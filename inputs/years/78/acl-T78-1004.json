        "Over the past few years, there have been a number of papers arguing the relative merits of primitives and prototypes as representations for the meaning of natural language.",
        "Much of the discussion has been both pugnacious and confused, with each author setting up one or another straw-man to knock down.",
        "Much of the confusion has resulted from a lack of agreement as to what it would mean for a system to use primitives or prototypes.",
        "There are several different dimensions along which semantic formalisms vary, and many of the arguments have blurred these into a single distinction.",
        "In this paper, I propose a framework within which to compare a variety of semantic formalisms which have been proposed in linguistics and artificial intelligence.",
        "The paper lays out three dimensions (called ontological, logical, and relational), describing the relevant options along each and the implications of making alternative choices in the design of a formalism.",
        "It does not attempt to demonstrate that one or another alternative is right, but instead tries to clearly state the advantages and disadvantages of each in a non-partisan way.",
        "It is more in the style of a textbook than of a research paper.",
        "Its contribution will, I hope, be in dissolving some non-issues which have occupied previous discussion, and in focussing attention on the real distinctions between alternative proposals.",
        "My own prejudices are set forth in Winograd (1976) and Bobrow and Winograd (1977).",
        "In addition to citing primary sources, I will make particular reference to the discussion by Wilks (1977) since it is recent and sets out a number of the same issues."

        "The formalisms we want to compare are all based on the use of symbol structures to represent meaning.",
        "There are deep philosophical questions as to how much of meaning can be captured in a formal system, but such questions are outside the scope of this paper.",
        "We will take it for granted that meaning is to be characterized in terms of structured relationships between discrete symbols.",
        "The first question, then, is just what these symbols are.",
        "There are three basic positions which have been taken: LINGUISTIC.",
        "In many older accounts of meaning, the only entities which take part in the formal structure are the entities of language: words, morphemes, phrases, and sentences.",
        "The dictionary is an account of meaning within this tradition.",
        "The meaning of a word is expressed in terms of structures made up of other words, without any direct appeal to concepts which lie outside the language.",
        "PSYCHOLOGICAL.",
        "Most current work in AI and psycholinguistics assumes that the entities which are manipulated in the formal theory represent some sort of concepts which underlie language use, but are not themselves part of the language.",
        "These concepts have psychological reality, in that they correspond to functional components in the memory and language activity of a person.",
        "Words and sentences are seen as corresponding to structures of underlying concepts.",
        "A psycholinguistic theory includes an account of the processes by which language is translated into conceptual structures, and generated from them.",
        "In the case of Al systems (such as the conceptual dependency formalism of Schank (1972)), the commitment to PSYCHOLOGICAL entities is a global assumption which plays little role in the methodology of the work.",
        "In the case of psychological experimentation (for example, much of the work described by Clark and Clark (1977)), it is a hypothesis to be tested explicitly.",
        "Some theoretical psychologists (such as Miller and Johnson-Laird (1976) and Fodor (1975)) have characterized it is a private \"language of thought\".",
        "THEORETICAL.",

        "They argue that the symbols of their formal semantic theories need not correspond to functional psychological entities.",
        "The symbols and structures play a role similar to that of postulated theoretical entities in physics, such as neutrinos and probability waves.",
        "A system based on them is justified in terms of its resulting overall simplicity and ability to account for the observable phenomena, not by finding psychological correlates for its individual terms.",
        "This view shares with the psychological view the notion of lexical decomposition.",
        "Words and sentences of the language correspond to structures built up of non-linguistic symbols.",
        "There has been a certain amount of confusion within both syntactic and semantic theory about whether there is any psychological reality to the formal constructs postulated by linguists.",
        "In the 60's, experiments w _re carried out (e.g., Miller, 1962) looking for psychological correlates of transformations, with generally negative results.",
        "Chomsky has repeatedly reiterated his official stance that the validity of transformational theory is not based on any assumption as to whether transformations play a functional role in language comprehension or production.",
        "Similarly, as Wilks (1977) points out, Katz's view of semantic markers shifted from PSYCHOLOGICAL (in Katz and Fodor, 1965) to THEORETICAL (in Katz, 1972).",
        "In doing AI research, the issue can be finessed.",
        "In building a program, one must develop a set of symbolic structures which are used functionally – they play a direct role in the memory and reasoning of the system.",
        "In this sense they are purely psychological (the psychology of the computer program, not of a person).",
        "When the program is viewed as a 'theory of human language use', two routes can be taken.",
        "If strong psychological equivalence is claimed, there is an assumption that the internal organization and objects of the program correspond to the organization and objects in the mind of a human language user.",
        "An alternative position of weak psychological equivalence is similar to that of the generative linguists.",
        "The program as a whole is justified by its ability to match human performance, but no claims are made about the ways in which its organization maps onto psychological phenomena.",
        "Since programs can be built without confronting this issue, there has been a tendency by Al researchers to handwave about it, taking whichever viewpoint seems most advantageous in a given discussion."

        "In taking words as the formal objects, we leave the semantic problem completely unaddressed.",

        "As many people have argued, (e.g. Lewis (1972) in discussing Katz and Fodor's theory of semantic markers), translating English into `Markerese' doesn't illuminate the fundamental nature of meaning any more than translating it into French.",

        "He characterizes them as criticisms of semantic primitives and argues that they are based on weak 'escape arguments'.",
        "He is correct in concluding that the concerns of these authors are orthogonal to the specific technical debate about primitives, but wrong in assuming that they are arguments in the same domain at all.",
        "In creating formal systems for representing and manipulating structures corresponding to meaning, we are not forced to answer the fundamental question of what meaning is.",

        "There are valid doubts about whether adequate semantic formalisms (in the AI/operational sense) can be developed without more careful thought about the basic questions, In particular, our unexamined assumptions about the nature of meaning can lead us down paths in the problems we choose to look at, which may in the long run conceal other more fruitful paths.",

        "There are three basically different views of the logical status of the individual concepts (or words): ABSTRACTION.",
        "The tradition drawn from logic and linguistics is to view the elements of a semantic formalism as logical abstractions – predicates and constants within a logical system.",
        "The meaning of a word is a structure of semantic elements which express the logical truth conditions determining its applicability.",
        "For example, if we analyze one sense of \"bachelor\" as having the semantic components HUMAN, MALE, and UNMARRIED, it is implied that any object to which that sense of the word could be properly applied will fit the truth conditions corresponding to those terms.",
        "If \"kill\" is analyzed as a structure of the form CAUSE(X, DIE(Y)), then we can safely deduce from the fact that \"A killed B\" that, among other things, B died.",
        "There are many old and unsettled debates about the status of such knowledge as analytic or synthetic.",
        "The issue here is not that distinction, but the status of the semantic analysis as leading to logical consequences which can be drawn from the the application of a given word.",
        "PROTOTYPE.",
        "One of the currently fashionable trends in AI is the development of languages and systems based on some kind of frame or prototype representation.",
        "The basic motivation comes from the observation that much of what we know about the world is not in the form of simple logical statements, but in knowledge about what is typical or expected.",
        "If we represent the meaning of \"buy\" and \"sell\" in terms of a COMMERCIAL-TRANSACTION scenario which includes the transfer of money, we also want to be able to apply it to cases which involve the ex change of valued objects other than money.",
        "However, we do not want to do this by creating an abstraction (e.g. the exchanged object is a VALUED-OBJECT) and thereby lose the information that it is usually money.",
        "Many papers have been written on the advantages and problems of including prototypical information as a fundamental part of a semantic representation.",
        "Formally, such systems are distinct from those based on logical abstraction only if issues of computational order and resources are taken into account (See Winograd (1976), for a discussion of these issues).",

        "Prototype-based systems have often gone along with a psychological view of the status of the symbols they use.",
        "Some of the motivation has come from psycholinguistic experiments which indicate that in many cases people are uncertain about the applicability of words to 'borderline cases', although they have a clear notion of the 'prototypical case'.",
        "This applies to areas of the vocabulary as varied as color terms (Berlin and Kay, 1969) and simple nouns such as \"cup\", \"glass\", and \"bowl\" (Labov, 1973).",
        "The implication is that the semantic representation of words is organized around a set of 'most typical' cases rather than around a checklist of logical criteria which must be met for the word to be applied.",
        "EXEMPLAR.",
        "Extending the prototype notion one step further, some psychologists have suggested that our understanding of words is based on having exemplars which are drawn from experience.",
        "Rather than having a semantic prototype for \"fruit\", we may have an exemplary fruit (e.g. a red apple) and understand the use of the word by comparison to what we know about this apple.",
        "The line between prototypes and exemplars is not sharp, but there is a difference in emphasis.",
        "Prototypes emphasize the presence of information which is typical to the class of objects described by a word, while exemplars emphasize the ability to reason by comparing one specific object to another specific object, which may have its own peculiarities which are not general to the class.",
        "Although there has been some discussion of reasoning by analogy (e.g. Moore and Newell, 1973), no system I know of has really made use of exemplars in a substantial way.",
        "There are many difficult issues surrounding the selection of the 'important' or 'invariant' aspects of the exemplar in a specific context.",
        "Critics of AI (e.g. Dreyfus, 1972) see this as being impossible to adequately represent in a formal system.",

        "The raison d'etre of a semantic theory is the desire to find regularities in the way language conveys meaning.",

        "The theory is interesting to the extent that the formal semantic system allows us to find regularities and state broader generalizations than we could at the surface level.",

        "_M systems in general are based on 'reasoning' programs which make use of semantic representations to do reasoning which is independent of the specific linguistic form in which the knowledge was stated.",
        "In some discussions of primitives, it is implied that it is necessary to have a system based on primitives in order to make significant generalizations.",
        "It should be clear from the discussion above that this is a confusion of categories.",

        "Criteria for deciding on a set of semantic entities.",
        "The main factor influencing the choice and justification of semantic entities within a formalism is the choice along the ontological dimension.",
        "Those who take a LINGUISTIC position need make no choice – the words of the language are themselves the entities of the semantic theory.",
        "There is work to be done in determining the relations between them, but the set of entities is given from the beginning.",
        "Those who take a THEORETICAL stance are free to create semantic entities at will, but must justify them by demonstrating that the set chosen leads to generalizations and simplifications which are not shared by alternative sets.",

        "In this context, there are only vague intuitions and heuristics to guide the choice of entities and their relationships.",
        "Wilks accepts this, in noting that \"no direct justification of the vocabulary [of primitives] makes any sense.\" The most interesting problems arise if the formalism is intended as a PSYCHOLOGICAL theory.",

        "Some of the distinctions above (such as that between ABSTRACTION, PROTOTYPE and EXEMPLAR) grew out of experiments of this type.",

        "Are they idiosyncratic, or shared by all competent speakers of a language?",

        "Much of the discussion of primitives and prototypes above can be applied both to classification (for example, Schank's (1972) classification (f acts vs. Lakoff's (1977) 'gestalts') and to the case relationships between participants and an act (Fillmore's (1968) notion of a primitive set of cases vs. the Bobrow and Winograd (1977) notions of hierarchies of prototypes with named 'slots).",

        "However, DISTINGUISHED subsystems can be used to create a canonical form for their particular aspect of meaning in a system which does not depend on primitives.",
        "By choosing to always expand into the terms of this subsystem in the same way, all of the properties of canc lical form apply.",
        "In evaluating the benefits of canonical form, it is important to take into account the procedural aspects.",
        "In its simplest usage, each piece of input text is converted immediately to canonical form and stored that way.",
        "Inferences are based on the elements of this expanded form, and memory search depends on finding the form corresponding to the query as a subset of what is stored.",
        "In a more sophisticated use, the canonical form is available for potential expansion, but memory can include unexpanded structures built up out of a vocabulary of non-primitive semantic entities.",

        "Absence of ambiguity and vagueness.",
        "This property applies to the canonical form after expansion.",
        "It is a global property of systems based on expansion at input – since meanings are expanded into canonical structures of primitives at the time they are analyzed, there is no remaining uncertainty about their meaning.",
        "This is viewed as an advantage by those who emphasize the use of the formalism in abstract reasoning, and as a disadvantage by those (like Martin, 1976) who emphasize the importance of context and interpretation in using knowledge.",

        "The advantage is a uniform way or triggenng standard inferences.",

        "In a system which does not expand to a common base, the same inference might have to be repeated in a number of places.",
        "The disadvantage arises in the case where an inference is associated with a higher-level meaning (such as \"flee\" having implications not shared by other instances of going).",
        "In a fully canonical system, it is necessary to recognize the particular combination of primitives which triggers the inference.",
        "In systems like that of Rieger (1975), there are discrimination nets, used to sort out the appropriate inferences from the expanded forms.",
        "This again leads to a combinatorial problem which becomes untenable in all but the smallest systems.",
        "Like the other issues, this one is complicated by the ability to build systems which partake of canonical expansion to some degree, either by expanding only along certain dimensions, or by operating with a mixture of expanded forms and non-primitive-based forms from which they were derived.",
        "Possibilities for dealing with extended meaning and metaphor.",

        "For example, if we define \"spend\" in terms of a commercial transaction, then it must be extended to deal with \"I spent a week in Boston.\" In general, formal semantic theories have not gone very far in dealing with these problems.",
        "Those who base systems on PROTOTYPE or EXEMPLAR reasoning argue that this is an important step towards dealing with the fuzzier aspects of language.",
        "However, the computational details needed to make the power of such systems clear have not been filled in.",
        "They either stick to trivial cases (as in Moore and Newell, 1973), or operate in ways which do not depend on going beyond standard logical meaning.",
