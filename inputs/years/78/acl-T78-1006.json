        "Many researchers in linguistics, psychology, philosophy and artificial intelligence have recently begun to abandon a purely linguistic approach to definite anaphora <*2> in favor of a notion of reference into some kind of model of the discourse, cf. Karttunen [1976], Levin & Goldman [1978], Lyons [1978].",
        "Stenning [1975].",
        "My own research on definite anaphora (cf. Webber [1978a&b]) follows this approach, in particular making the following five assumptions:",
        "1.",
        "One objective of discourse is to enable a speaker to communicate to a listener a model s/he has of some situation.",
        "Thus the ensuing discourse is, on one level, an attempt by the speaker to direct the listener in synthesizing a similar model.",
        "2.",
        "Such a discourse model can be viewed as a structured collection of entities, organized by the roles they fill with respect to one another, the relations they participate in, etc.",
        "3.",
        "The function of a definite anaphoric",
        "expression is to refer to an entity in the speaker's discourse model (DMs).",
        "<*3> In using a definite anaphor, the speaker assumes (a) that on the basis of the discourse thus far, a similar entity <*1>.",
        "The author's current address is: Department of Computer and Information Sciences, The Moore School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia PA 19174.",
        "<*2>.",
        "Although I will soon explain what I mean precisely by \"definite anaphora\", the term basically denotes a function that some types of syntactic expressions can serve.",
        "Expressions which can function as definite anaphors include definite pronouns and definite descriptions.",
        "Other roles that definite pronouns and descriptions can fill are discussed in Geach [1962], Partee [1972], Norman & Rumelhart [1975] and Webber [1978a].",
        "<*3>.",
        "A similar assumption is made by Karttunen [1976], Levin & Goldman [1978], Lyons [1978] and Stenning [1975].",
        "will be in the listener's model (DM T.) as well and (b) that the listener will be able to access that entity via the given definite description or definite pronoun.",
        "4.",
        "The referent of a definite anaphor is thus an entity in DMs, which the speaker presumes to have a counterpart in DML.",
        "Discourse entities may have the properties of individuals, sets, events, actions, states, facts, beliefs, hypotheses, properties, generic classes, typical set members, stuff, specific quantities of stuff, etc.",
        "5.",
        "In deciding which discourse entity a definite anaphor refers to, a listener's judgments stem in part from how the entities in DML are described.",
        "(When a discourse entity E is the referent of a definite anaphor A, one might distinguish that description of E conveyed to the listener by the immediately preceding text and consider it A's antecedent.)",
        "The point of making these assumptions explicit is to stress that insofar as reasoning about discourse entities is mediated by their descriptions, discourse entity descriptions are critical to anaphor resolution.",
        "Now one consequence of these assumptions about discourse models and reference is that the task of understanding definite anaphora can be decomposed into several complementary parts:",
        "1. deciding whether a definite pronoun or definite description is truly anaphoric (i.e., is intended to refer to some entity presumed to already be in DML) or whether the term fills some other role in the discourse; 2. synthesizing a discourse model which is similar to that of the speaker and inhabited by similar discourse entities;",
        "3. constraining the possible referents of a given anaphoric expression down to one possible choice - the \"anaphor resolution\" problem; 4. determining what other functions a",
        "definite description is intended to fill besides enabling the listener to construct or get to its referent.",
        "While I cannot hope in this short paper to cover even one of these four sub-tasks, what I shall try to do is illustrate how the explicit data - i.e., the actual sentences of the discourse, produced by a particular person (or a particular computer program) in a particular situation - provide material for the model synthesis process.",
        "In particular, I shall show (1) how indefinite noun phrases are associated with the evocation of new discourse entities, independently of any higher-level expectations, and (2) how those new discourse entities will initially be described.",
        "I will claim that such an initial description (ID) is critical to both model synthesis and anaphor resolution since it allows the listener to reason appropriately about the discourse entity in order to assign it to an appropriate role vis-a-vis his or her higher-level expectations.",
        "<*4> Moreover, since it is possible for a discourse entity's current role assignment to be found incorrect, it is the entity's ID that allows it to be reassigned to another role with respect to the listener's revised expectations.",
        "In Section 2 I will consider indefinite noun phrases vis-a-vis the discourse entities they evoke and how those entities are described.",
        "I will contrast them briefly with non-anaphoric definite noun phrases and then show that all determined noun phrases, including odd ones like \"few orc eggs\", \"many lemon gum balls\", etc.",
        "pattern after either definites or indefinites vis-a-vis the discourse entities they evoke and how those entities can be described.",
        "In Section 3 I will show how this approach to definite anaphora in terms of discourse entities and their descriptions can accommodate certain problematic cases of anaphoric reference that have been discussed in the linguistics and philosophic literatures - the famous \"donkey\" sentence (cf. Bartsch [1976], Edmundson [1976], Hintikka & Carlson [1977]) and the problem of reference in disjunctive contexts (cf. Karttunen [1977]).",
        "Finally, to show that it is not <*4>.",
        "From different points of view, discussions of the relationship between the explicit text and higher-level organizing structures can be found in Collins, Brown & Larkin [1977] and Webber [1978b].",
        "just definite and indefinite noun phrases that can evoke entities in the listener's discourse model, I will illustrate in Section 4 an example of deictically-evoked entities and comment on the problem of describing them appropriately."

Webber [1978a]), the entity it evokes will be appropriately described via a conjunction of (1) the description inherent in the noun phrase (e.g. \"yellow T-shirt that Bruce had admired\"); (2) a predicate that embodies the remainder of the sentence (e.g. \"which Wendy bought\"); and (3) a predicate that relates that entity to the utterance evoking it (e.g. \"which was mentioned in (or evoked by) sentence 6a.\").",

        "Fx represents an arbitrary open sentence in which x is free; i stands for Russell's definite operator, iota; and S is the label assigned to the proposition on the left-hand side of the arrow.",
        "Informally, this rule, which I shall call [RW-1], says that if a proposition S states that there is a member x of class C which makes Fy true, then there exists an individual describable as \"the C which F's which was evoked by proposition S\".",

        "<*10>.",
        "This latter point is a subtle one, and usage may vary from person to person.",
        "That is, some people intend an indefinite plural noun phrase contained in a sentence S - \"Some <x>s P\" - to refer to the maximal set - i.e., \"the set of <x>s which P\".",

        "Notice that if the terms were conjoined rather than disjoined, the truth of the conjunction would imply the simultaneous existence of two entities within the model.",
        "In that case, either the referent of \"it\" would be ambiguous or the sentence would just be bizarre.",
        "The other, I think nicer, way of approaching the problem holds that each sentence evokes only a single discourse entity into the model, with the indecision (i.e., the disjunction) embodied in its ID.",
        "That ID is of the form \"A if P, otherwise B\".",
        "For example, the entity evoked by sentence 22 would be describable as \"the car that Wendy has (if she has a car) or the bike that Bruce has otherwise\"; that evoked by sentence 23 would be describable as \"the bike that Bruce will have (if he chooses a bike) or the car that Bruce will have otherwise\"; that evoked by sentence 24, as \"the new car that Bruce has (if he has a new car) or Bruce's brother's car otherwise\"; and that evoked by sentence 25, as \"the car Bruce will have bought (if he buys a car) or the bike Bruce's brother will have bought otherwise\".",
        "One advantage to this approach is that additional properties which truthfully follow from either ID can be ascribed to the entity without committing oneself to one description or the other.",

        "of \"block my driveway\" must be a physical object, preferably large and somewhat mobile.",
