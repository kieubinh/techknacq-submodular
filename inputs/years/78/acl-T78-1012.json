        "Introduction to the Problem",
        "When speakers' utter or write sentences, they use certain words in the sentence to refer to people, places, object, times, events and ideas which exist in the real world.",
        "When sentences are formed into units of two or more sentences, certain words refer back to other referring expressions in' the previous sentences.",
        "Among the words which can be used to refer to the real world as well as to refer back (which is called the process of co-reference) are noun phrases containing a definite article, such as the (called defnps, hereafter).",
        "Several aspects of comprehension of defnps are open problems:",
        "1.)",
        "What is the definition of the reference of a defnp?",
        "That is, what to we mean by reference in computational linguisitics?",
        "2.)",
        "How are defnps which are used to co-refer into a discourse distinguished from those which refer to real world objects outside the discourse?",
        "3.)",
        "What methods of search will distinguish the referent of a defnp which refers to an entity outside the discourse context?",
        "4.)",
        "What different ways can defnps be used to co-refer to other entities in the discourse?",
        "5.)",
        "How can co-reference of defnps be detected?",
        "6.)",
        "What inferences and data structures will be needed for the detection process?",
        "The work of Winograd [1971], Charniak [1972] and Rieger [1973] suggest that inferencing is crucial to the interpretation of co-reference.",
        "This paper presents a viewpoint from which to answer these questions based on the concept of focus, as developed by Grosz [1977] and the author (Bullwinkle [1977]).",
        "This paper extends' Grosz' work by establishing a framework for communication and a set of rules for use of focus in discourse.",
        "The approach taken here represents an alternative to the inference driven schemes of Charniak and Rieger.",
        "1.",
        "I will use the term speaker to refer to the producer of a spoken or written discourse and hearer to refer to the receiver of the discourse.",
        "2.",
        "The Communication Process and Focus The description of the communication process given here contains four simple assumptions which are generally true and will be taken as true in this work.",
        "First, the speaker is assumed to be communicating about something.",
        "This assumption implies that the speaker is not speaking gibberish, that there are referring expressions and either requests, questions, assertions or acknowledgements being made.",
        "The something which the communication is about will be called the focus of the discourse.2 Second, the hearer is assumed to be able to identify what the focus of the discourse is.",
        "The speaker wants to communicate about something, and for the communication to occur, the hearer must be able to distinguish what the speaker is communicating about.",
        "Third, the speaker is not trying to confuse or deceive the hearer.",
        "The speaker uses referring expressions with the intention of referring to someone or something, or with the intention of describing something or some event.",
        "In Gricean3 terms, the byword is \"Be perspicuous.\" The final assumption claims that the speaker assumes the hearer knows certain knowledge about the real-world which can be referred to during the communication process.",
        "Recent research (Cohen [1978]), as well as the well known work of Searle [1969] and Austin [1962], describe models of the speaker's knowledge of what the hearer believes.",
        "In this chapter, the weakest form of such a model is assumed: the speaker assumes the hearer has enough real-world knowledge in common with the speaker to know the entities which the speaker refers to, and that knowledge is what the speaker draws on in constructing a message for a hearer.",
        "These four assumptions will play an important part in the discussion of co-reference interpretation which follows.",
        "2.",
        "I don't want to suggest that only one thing can be communicated in a discourse, for speakers do direct their attention from one thing to another.",
        "For the moment, I will speak of the focus as the first center of attention in a speaker's discourse.",
        "3.",
        "Grice, H.P.",
        "\"Logic and Conversation\" etc.",
        "This paper makes the claim that the focus acts as an index function for referring expressions.",
        "For those referring expressions which are anaphoric, the focus indicates where to look for an antecendent.",
        "For those referring expressions which are names or descriptions of things in the world, the focus acts as a generation center for a process that chooses a representation of a real world entity which fits the name or description.",
        "However, the focus of a discourse alone is not sufficient to produce the indexing behavior.",
        "The focus must be used in conjunction with a hierarchical semantic network of associations.",
        "The network will indicate what other concepts are related to the focus.",
        "It is a codification of some of the general knowledge speakers and hearers have about the real world.",
        "The network is a dynamic structure because the hearer adds to his/her general knowledge in the process of interpreting a piece of discourse.",
        "Focus must also act with a third piece of computational machinery, an inferencing mechanism.",
        "It is used to infer from general knowledge and some suppositions that a certain proposition is true.",
        "An example will be helpful here.",
        "In the discourse below, the focus of discussion is the meeting of DO-1.",
        "All four sentences give information about the focussed entity.",
        "Thus in DO both sentences 3 and 4 make no direct reference to the meeting of DO-1.",
        "As human hearers, we know that these sentences are related to the rest of DO because they give information about the focus meeting.",
        "In DO-3 there are three clues which connect this sentence and the rest of the discourse: the use of get together, the co-reference of we to the participants of the meeting, and his office establishing a place for a meeting.",
        "DO-4 introduces an additional participant which can be surmised from the use of invite, and the fact that the ellipsis of the event that John is invited to is the focus.",
        "A piece of the hierarchical net needed for DO is given below in figure 1.",
        "A prototype meetings has associated places, times, participants, and purposes.",
        "The relation between meeting and place is one of occurrence while the relation between meeting and purposes is one of causality.",
        "When DO-1 is encountered, the hierarchical net grows a new member: an instance of meeting from DO-1.",
        "It inherits the associated entities of meetings and some specific values for the participant entity.",
        "DO-2 indicates that something (called it) will occur at a particular time.",
        "The focus of DO-1 is meeting, so the focus, meeting, is proposed as the antecedent of it.",
        "To",
        "meeting I v. place time panicipant \".•' purpose meeting-with-Stanoczyk ■",
        "confirm the proposal, the Inference mechanism checks to see if meetings occur at times.",
        "Indeed they do, so the proposal of meeting as antecedent of it is accepted.",
        "The explanation about the use of focus is not really so simple because the focus of a discourse changes.",
        "The interpretation of focus requires a means of recognizing that the focus has changed to some other entity.",
        "In DO' the focus begins on meeting, but the it in DO'-3 has my office as its co-referent, not the meeting.",
        "Detecting this co-reference requires a means of noticing a shift of focus and using the inferencing mechanism to confirm the choice of co-referent.",
        "Focus shift detection will not be discussed here; the reader is referred to Bullwinkle [1977] for a discussion of focus shift where the term \"sub-topic shift\" is used.",
        "DO'-1 I want to schedule a meeting with George, Jim, Steve and Mike.",
        "2 We can meet in my office.",
        "3 It's kind of small, but the meeting won't last very long anyway.",
        "3.",
        "Reference in Computational Terms",
        "The theory presented here distinguishes two kinds of referring.",
        "The first is an internal reference between a noun phrase and some preexisting database object.",
        "That database object represents a real world entity.",
        "In Figure 2 below internal reference links the noun phrase NP1 \"Jimmy Carter\" to a representation of Jimmy Carter (who is described as president of the US, etc.).",
        "How the noun phrase and the database object refer to the real world is the classical semantic problem of reference (cf. Kripke [1972] among others) and is beyond the scope of this work.",
        "The other kind of referring is co-reference.",
        "Co-reference links a noun phrase to another noun phrase.",
        "The two noun phrases are said to co-refer, and both internally refer to the same database object, both refer to the real world object.",
        "In Figure 1, the dashed link from NP2 \"Jimmy\" to NP1 is a co-reference link.",
        "The dot-dash link from NP2 to the database object is a virtual internal reference link which results from the co-reference link from NP2 to NP1 and from the internal reference link from NP1 to the database object.",
        "Internal reference and co-reference links are distinguished because co-reference links can be established more easily using discourse context, which will be discussed in detail later in this paper.",
        "In the remainder of this paper when I speak of internal reference, I will drop the phrase \"internal\" and use only \"reference.\" A computational theory of co-reference comprehension must answer the following questions about the use of referential terms in natural language:",
        "(1) Does the expression refer to someone or something?",
        "(2) What conceptual entity in the memory or the database of the hearer's knowledge, if any, is denoted by the referring expression?",
        "(3) When does a given expression refer to the same entity as another referring expression?",
        "The expression Julius Caesar is used to refer, and can refer to the person represented in the hearer's knowledge as Julius",
        "NP1 \"Jimmy Carter\" NP2 \"Jimmy\" internal virtual reference internal reference Database Representation of Jimmy Carter Name: Jimmy Carter",
        "occupation: President of US birthplace: Georgia",
        "Caesar.",
        "To answer the first question above, the hearer must decide that names are referring expressions.",
        "To answer the second question, the hearer must decide 1) whether Julius Caesar refers uniquely and 2) what conceptual entity in the hearer's memory represents the hearer's real-world referent.",
        "These two decisions together with the initial assumptions appear to make necessary and sufficient conditions for comprehension since by deciding that Julius Caesar refers uniquely and choosing a conceptual entity, the hearer has decoded what entity the speaker was referring to.",
        "There are, however, situations where the hearer's choices to the above decisions and the speaker's intended referent do not coincide.",
        "Suppose the hearer decides that Julius Caesar refers uniquely and refers to Julius Caesar, who was a Roman emperor.",
        "The speaker may also have intended it to refer uniquely, but to the author's deceased cat, whose name was Julius Caesar.",
        "Now there are three possibilities: either the hearer knew about Julius Caesar the cat, but decided the expression referred to Julius the emperor, or the hearer only knew about the emperor, or the hearer didn't know of either.",
        "In the last case, the hearer \"found\" a referent by a chance from randomly linking up the name and some memory representation.",
        "The last possibility does not fit a description of reference comprehension of any kind.",
        "Randomly hooking up information from one's memory to what appears to be a referring expression may be a cognitive act, but intuitively no one would call it reference comprehension.",
        "In the case where the hearer only knew about the emperor, it seems safe to conclude that the reference may have been comprehended, but incompletely.",
        "As we shall see, there are many other clues in communication about the referent of terms than those given by referring expressions in isolation.",
        "Without these, reference comprehension is incomplete because the hearer has no means of knowing whether s/he may have the wrong referent.",
        "Even with the best set of clues, the hearer may still choose Julius the emperor.",
        "Here we will say that comprehension has taken place, completely but incorrectly, because the hearer has used all the relevant communication knowledge to decode the speaker's message.",
        "What can be concluded is that the speaker's rules for reference generation and/or the speaker's knowledge of the hearer is faulty (thereby contradicting the speaker's assumption above).",
        "In the case where the hearer knows of both possibilities and chooses the incorrect one, the hearer may have erred due to failure to follow other communication clues or again because the speaker's rules and knowledge were lacking.",
        "In conclusion, a referring expression is comprehended as intended, if and only if the same referent as that intended by the speaker is chosen from the entities in memory.",
        "The expression is otherwise just comprehended when the hearer chooses an entity from memory which is denoted by the referring expression using all the available communication clues but does not choose the same entity as intended by the speaker.",
        "An expression will be.",
        "considered incompletely comprehended if the hearer fails to use all the 'communication cues available at the time the communication occurs.",
        "So far I have not considered the possibility of error on the part of the hearer because of the hearer's beliefs.",
        "Suppose, for example, that the hearer believes the speaker hates to even speak of cats.",
        "Then the hearer may conclude that Julius Caesar is most likely a reference to the emperor of Rome.",
        "I am not going to consider this possibility in the forthcoming discussion; instead I will restrict the discussion to cues from the communication process.",
        "Hearer beliefs raise a separate set of philosophical as well as computational problems and entends the scope of this study too broadly.",
        "However, the issues are significant in the total picture of reference and co-reference comprehension.",
        "In the remainder of this paper I will consider co-reference comprehension just from the hearer's point of view.",
        "Thus in discussing referential and co-referential expressions, I will be concerned with a model of how the hearer disambiguates these expressions used in discourse.",
        "By symmetry, one might suppose that the generation of referential expressions by a speaker could make use of a similar model.",
        "Such a supposition will remain untested in this paper and is to be verified by later work.",
        "Furthermore, I will not be concerned with comprehension as intended since this process requires the additional information of what the hearer believes that the speaker knows about, Instead I will point out at various times how the theory under discussion would need modification if hearer's beliefs were included."

        "Definite noun phrases can be used to refer to entities in the real world.",
        "Russell (1905] says of the expression the author of Waverly that it denotes Sir Walter Scott, and that when it is strictly used, a defnp denotes uniquely.4 Thus by using a definite article, a speaker is saying in effect \"there is one object in the world denoted by the phrase that follows and I mean that one.\" Of course a defnp may be used to denote someone without actually denoting anyone, as is the case with the woman who wrote Waverly.",
        "This defnp is used to refer to someone, but there is no conceptual representation in the hearer's (or for that matter, the speaker's) memory which corresponds to a real world",
        "entity assuming the normal case.5 Nothing in the syntactic or semantic form of the expression itself suggests that the expression has no denotation.",
        "How can the hearer determine whether the defnp refers to someone or not?",
        "Of course, if there exists a memory entity the author of Waverly, which is attributed as male, the hearer can decide that the expression does not refer to anyone on the basis of a contradiction.",
        "But if no memory entity exists, the hearer cannot decide whether the woman who wrote Waverly refers to anyone.",
        "This way of looking at defnps, however, fails to account for all the phenomena of defnps because it involves an assumption which is not true.",
        "The Russellian analysis has difficulties because defnps are not always used to refer!",
        "The problem is not only whether a particular defnp actually denotes a real world object; it is also a question of whether the defnps is intended to refer at all.",
        "Even more surprising, a defnp may be used to refer, but the speaker may not intend for the hearer to know the referent of the defnp; the defnp form is used to indicate that the referent is knowable, but possibly not significant for the communication at hand.",
        "Donnel4an [1977] points out that some defnps are used attributively.",
        "If we happen upon Smith who lies dead with foul wounds, one can say \"Smith's murderer is insane.\" Used attributively, Smith's murderer does not refer to anyone, and the phrase does not describe a particular person.",
        "It is as if to say, Smith was murdered and the murderer, whoever that may be, is insane.",
        "Thus the speaker using an attributive defnp does not assume that someone fits the description, whereas with a referential defnp the speaker expects the hearer to realize who is being pointed to.",
        "The other distinction a speaker can make is to use a defnp to indicate that the referent is knowable.",
        "Thus if one says:",
        "(1) Larry read a lot of linguistics in the hospital.",
        "(2) Larry read a lot of linguistics in a hospital.",
        "the (2) usage is not the same as the (1).",
        "While the hearer does not know which hospital the hospital refers to, it is clear it refers to some particular one.",
        "Comprehension of the referential term does not involve finding a memory entity which represents the real world entity that the expression refers to.",
        "For reference comprehension, this concern is considerable since the Chinese government in (3) does not demand reference disambiguation, while (4) does; the disambiguation is difficult because the expression can refer to more than one thing.",
        "(3) John got help from the Chinese government in adopting an Oriental child.",
        "(4) Get a visa for your trip from the Chinese government.",
        "Another difficulty with defnps is that sometimes they are used not to refer to or to describe specific individuals or objects, but to characterize a class of entities with the 5.",

        "A defnp that characterizes a class of entities by means of an individual whose properties are delineated by the properties of the head noun phrase and its modifiers is a generic defnp.",
        "A defnp is attributive if it describes an entity without referring.",
        "A defnp can be ambiguous in use (u-ambiguous hereafter) if its use as a specific, attributive or generic is not identifiable, while a defnp is ambiguous in reference (r-ambiguous hereafter) if it is used specifically and there is more than one entity fitting the description of the defnp.",

        "Most stories have at least the context of there being a story teller, a• hearer and the story being told.",

        "There may be lots of hot dish holders denoted by conceptual entities in my friend's mind, but I am referring to a specific one.",
