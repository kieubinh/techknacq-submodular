        "Introduction When two people talk, they focus their attention on only a small portion of what each of them knows or believes.",
        "Not only do they concentrate on particular entities (objects or relationships), but they do so using particular perspectives on those entities.",
        "In choosing a particular set of words with which to describe an entity, a speaker indicates a perspective on that entity.",
        "The hearer is led, then, to see the entity more as one kind of thing than as another.",
        "For example, a single building may be viewed as an architectural wonder, a house, or a home, and a single event may be viewed at one time as a selling, another as a buying, and still another as a trading.",
        "Some entities are central to the dialog at a certain point and hence are focused on more sharply than others.",
        "More importantly, much of what each participant knows is not clearly in view at all; it is not considered by the speaker in choosing what to say or how to say it, or by the hearer in interpreting an utterance.",
        "Focusing is an active process.2 As a dialog progresses, the participants shift their focus to new entities or to new perspectives on entities previously highlighted by the dialog.",
        "Furthermore, an actor is involved in focusing (as the term is used in this paper): if an entity is in focus, it is the object of someone's focusing; it cannot be impersonally in focus.",
        "When I use the constructions \"highlighted\", \"focused on\", or \"in focus\", there is always an implicit actor doing the highlighting or focusing.",
        "Finally, the entities that the speaker and hearer focus on are entities in their (external) shared reality.",
        "Focusing, then, is the active process, engaged in by the participants in a dialog, of concentrating attention on, or highlighting, a subset of their shared reality.",
        "The relationship between language and focusing is two-way: what is said influences focusing; what is focused on influences what is said.",
        "The speaker provides clues for the hearer both to what s/he is currently focused on and to what s/he wants to focus on next.",
        "These clues may be linguistic or may derive from shared linguistic or nonlinguistic knowledge.",

        "I would like to thank Jerry Hobbs, David Levy, Ann Robinson, Jane Robinson, Candy Sidner, and Brian Smith for discussing the ideas in this paper and commenting on various drafts of it.",
        "2 This is the reason the verb \"focusing\" rather than the noun \"focus\" is used most often in this paper.",
        "shared beliefs about what entities are highlighted to interpret such things as the appropriate sense of a particular word and the object or event corresponding to a definite description.",
        "The link between the entities discussed in an utterance and the entities focused on when the utterance is spoken is thus an important aspect both of producing and of interpreting that utterance.",
        "The use and interpretation of definite descriptions in dialog demonstrate the importance of focusing to dialog participants.3 This paper examines the relationship between focusing and definite description and the implications of this relationship for computer systems for dialog understanding.",
        "Section B presents an example that illustrates this relationship.",
        "Section C discusses definite descriptions from both the speaker's and the hearer's perspectives and presents problems that arise for both participants whose solutions are influenced by how the participants are focused.",
        "Section D addresses some problems that arise in computationally capturing the notion of focusing and discusses other aspects of dialog with which focusing mechanisms must be coordinated in a natural language processing system, in order to handle the problems introduced in the preceding sections."

        "To begin, I want to examine a sample dialog between two people, an expert and an apprentice, cooperating to complete a task.",
        "It illustrates several important aspects of the role of focusing in communication.",
        "The sample comes from a corpus of task-oriented dialogs collected in situations simulating direct interaction between a person and a computer (Grosz, 1977; Deutsch, 1974).4 The particular task being performed is disassembly of an air compressor.",
        "(1) E: First you have to remove the flywheel.",
        "(2) A: How do I remove the flywheel?",
        "(3) E: First, loosen the two allen head setscrews holding it to the shaft, then pull it off.",
        "(4) A: OK. (5) I can only find one screw.",
        "Where's the other one?",
        "(6) E: On the hub of the flywheel.",
        "(7) A: That's the one I found.",
        "Where's the other one?",
        "(8) E: About ninety degrees around the hub from the first one.",
        "(9) A: I don't understand.",
        "I can only find one.",
        "Oh wait, yes I think I was on the wrong wheel.",
        "(10) E: Show me what you are doing.",
        "(11) A: I was on the wrong wheel and I can find them both now.",
        "(12) The tool I have is awkward.",
        "Is there another tool that I could use instead?",
        "(13) E: Show me the tool you are using.",
        "(14) A: OK. (15) E: Are you sure you are using the right size key?",
        "(16) A: I'll try some others.",
        "(17) I found an angle I can get at it.",
        "(18) The two screws are loose, but I'm having trouble getting the wheel off.",
        "(19) E: Use the wheelpuller.",
        "Do you know how to use it?",
        "(20) A: No.",
        "(21) E: Do you know what it looks like?",
        "(22) A: Yes.",
        "(23) E: Show it to me' please.",
        "(24) A: OK (25) E: Good.",
        "Loosen the screw in the center and place the jaws around the hub of the wheel, then tighten the screw onto the center of the shaft.",
        "The wheel should slide off.",
        "First, consider the use of the phrase \"the two screws\" in (18) to refer to the two setscrews holding the pulley on its shaft and the use of the phrases \"the screw in the center\" and \"the screw\" in (25) to refer to a part of the wheelpuller.5 Since most objects do not have proper names, definite descriptions are a primary means of identifying objects.",
        "However, as in this dialog, the same description may be used to identify different objects at different times.",
        "When (25) was uttered, the two screws mentioned in (3) through (18) were the most recently mentioned objects that could be referred to by a phrase such as \"the screw\", but they were no longer focused on by the dialog participants -- they were no longer relevant to either the dialog or the task -- and hence were not considered as possible referents for either \"the screw in the center\" or \"the screw\" in (25).",
        "One can see in this example that the most recently mentioned object that satisfies a description may not be the object identified by that description.",
        "What entities a speaker and hearer are focused on influences both the kinds of descriptions they use and how their descriptions are interpreted.",
        "In utterance (3), the expert indicates that he is focused on, and concurrently gets the apprentice to focus on, the two subtasks involved in removing the pulley.",
        "In particular, the two allen head setscrews involved in the first task are brought into focus; they continue to be in focus through the first part of (18).",
        "The initial clause of (18) indicates the completion of the task involving the screws and hence suggests that the apprentice will shift her attention to some new task (she might not -- she could still say something more about the screws).",
        "She does 5 The modifying phrase \"in the center\" does not distinguish the main wheelpuller screw from the setscrews, but from other screws that are part of the wheelpuller.",
        "make such a shift in the second clause of (18) (\"but I'm having trouble getting the wheel off\").",
        "In (19), the expert indicates that he has followed this shift (note that he might have asked a question about the screws -- e.g., \"How loose are they?\" -- and thereby continued to focus on them and the associated task) and narrows focusing from the task of removing the flywheel to a particular tool involved in that task.",
        "In this context, it is clear that the phrase \"the screw\" cannot refer to either of the setscrews, but must refer to something else.Â° This dialog also indicates some of the ways in which focusing is manipulated in a dialog.",
        "In particular, it illustrates how the structure of the entities being discussed (the 'domain') influences focusing and hence the structure of the discourse.",
        "The dialog concerns the performance of a task; its topic is that task.",
        "As a result, the way in which the apprentice and expert focus, and hence the structure of the dialog,7 are closely linked to the structure of the task.",
        "Information about the structure of entities in the domain provides one kind of clue to how focusing can change.",
        "What about general linguistic clues to focusing?",
        "What information in words themselves or in sentence structure can influence focusing?",
        "The use of \"but\" in (18) illustrates one kind of linguistic clue to focus.",
        "The indication of contrast suggests a shifting of focus to the entities described in the clause following the \"but\".",
        "In fact, this shift does occur and the remainder of the fragment concerns things involved with \"getting the wheel off\".Â° The final point I want to make with respect to this fragment concerns the relationship between how the speaker and hearer are focused and how differences in focusing affect understanding.",
        "It is clearly crucial for speaker and hearer to be able to distinguish their own beliefs from each other's.",
        "What about focus?",
        "I am concerned here not with the consistent difference in focusing 6 It is interesting that some people who are not familiar with the compressor or wheelpuller find this sequence confusing: (18) seems to end any concern with screws and hence (25) is unintelligible.",
        "One must know -- or infer -- that the wheelpuller has a screw for the statement to make sense.",
        "7 The concept of structure used here is similar to that in Levy (1977), but different from that in work on story and text grammars (cf. vanDijk 1972; Rumelhart 1975).",
        "In particular, I am not interested in such things as generating or recognizing a valid dialog (the analogy to sentence grammars), but rather in those dynamic aspects of intersentential relationships such as focusing that influence the interpretation and generation of utterances in a dialog.",
        "8 One of the key open problems for incorporating focusing mechanisms in natural language processing systems is identifying the different kinds of clues to focusing and how they interact.",
        "Some aspects of this problem are discussed in Section D.",
        "that results from the speaker being one step ahead of the hearer (closing this gap is one goal of an utterance), but rather with whether speaker and hearer purposely maintain differences in focusing over several interactions (as they do with beliefs).",
        "An analysis of the dialogs we collected indicates that, in most cases, whether or not a speaker and hearer are focused similarly, they speak as though they were.",
        "Speaker and hearer assume a common focus; they usually do not have distinct models of each other's focus.",
        "That is, the speaker assumes that the hearer in understanding an utterance has followed any shift in focus indicated by that utterance and is, to the extent it matters, focused on the entities the speaker intended (from the perspective the speaker intended).",
        "It is only when a difference in focusing results in some fairly major incompatibility that a problem is detected.",
        "The interchange in (5) through (11) illustrates what happens when the two participants in a dialog believe erroneously that they are focused on the same entity.",
        "Initially, the apprentice is focused on the motor pulley, which she thinks is the flywheel.",
        "Because the expert is not aware of this (he probably doesn't even consider the possibility), his responses are not very helpful."

        "Furthermore, the hearer may wonder whether he is mistaken if he thinks he has determined the referent but there is more description to process (cf. Grice, 1975).",
        "Using the phrase, \"the red-handled screwdriver with the small chip on the bottom and a loose handle\" to identify the only red-handled screwdriver will probably both increase the hearer's search time and confuse him.",

        "By separating those items currently highlighted from those that aren't, focusing provides a boundary around the entities from which the entity being either described or identified must be distinguished.",
        "For generation purposes, this boundary circumscribes those items from which the entity being described must be distinguished, and thus provides some means of determining when a description is complete enough.",
        "It is useful for interpretation in providing a small set of items from which to choose.",

        "First, the only clues to how focusing changes that have been incorporated in the system are clues based on shared knowledge about the structure of entities in the domain (in particular, the structure of the task); linguistic clues and the interaction between different kinds of clues remain to be examined.",
        "Second, the highlighting of explicit and implicit focus are used in interpreting definite descriptions, but an exact match is required; the question of what constitutes an inexact match has not yet been faced.",
        "Third, although the highlighting structures provide for focusing on different aspects of an entity, the deduction routines do not use this information in accessing information about an entity in focus.",

        "The term focus (as well as liumg0 is sometimes used (e.g., Halliday, 1967) to refer to prominence in a sentence, a more local phenomenon than focus as discussed here.",
        "It is clear that a speaker and hearer are focused not only globally on some set of entities but also more locally, and that this more local focusing affects the way in which a particular idea is expressed in an utterance.",
        "This raises the question of how sentential focusing interacts with the more global focusing discussed in this paper.",
        "When does the way in which an utterance is phrased not only highlight certain entities, but also change the global focusing of the dialog participants?",
        "An answer to this question requires looking more closely at what kinds of clues a speaker can use to shift focus.18 A speaker's clues on how to focus may be linguistic or may come from knowledge about the relationships among entities being discussed.",
        "Linguistic clues may be either explicit, given directly by certain words, or implicit, deriving from sentential structure or from rhetorical relationships between sentences.",
        "In the model described in Grosz (1977), both implicit focus and the procedures for shifting focus are based on clues that derive from knowledge a speaker and hearer share about the structure of the entities being discussed; they use a representation 9f the task to decide when and how to shift focus.Â° For the focus mechanisms to be useful for discourse in general, they must be extended to handle the linguistic clues that a speaker may use.",
        "In particular, two kinds of implicit linguistic clues must be understood and their use for shifting formalized.",
        "First, there are the global linguistic clues that come from patterns of relationships between sentences, such as paraphrase and elaboration (Grimes, 1975; Halliday and Hasan, 1976).",
        "For example, by elaborating on some element of a sentence, a speaker shifts focus to that element (really the entity expressed by that element).",
        "A major question here is how to recognize when such patterns occur (cf. Hobbs 1976).",
        "Perhaps more important, there is the question of whether recognizing the patterns requires knowing how the focus of attention in the 18 It is important to note that shifting and focusing are not separable tasks.",
        "Focusing is an ongoing process that both influences and is influenced by the interpretation of an utterance.",
        "This dynamic aspect of focusing is clear in the interpretation of the phrase \"one screw\" in utterance (5) of the initial dialog fragment.",
        "The focusing established by the expert in utterance (3) highlights a set of screws from which the one screw can be chosen.",
        "The reference to one screw shifts focus to the particular subtask of loosening those screws.",

        "For example, in describing a house, focus can move from the total house to one of the rooms of the house.",

        "It may be that such global patterns are more useful in setting expectations about where focus may be in the following utterances than in determining the focus in a particular utterance.",

        "Sidner (1978) presents rules for determining focus, based on syntactic structure.",
        "A particularly important aspect of her work involves the recognition that focusing is only predicted by a single utterance and that the \"expected focus\" must be confirmed by succeeding utterances.",
        "That is, the question of whether an utterance changes global focus cannot be answered on the basis of the individual utterance.",
        "Rather, an utterance can only suggest a global shift in focus.",

        "Before the focusing mechanisms can be extended to handle inexact matches two major problems must be addressed: determining how to decide whether an inexact match is close enough and determining how to decide between accepting an inexact match and considering a shift in focus.",
        "For the first problem, focusing makes it possible to determine the closest match, but not to decide whether that match is close enough.",

        "Instead, it orders the way in which aspects of the concept are to be examined.",
