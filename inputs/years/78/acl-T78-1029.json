        "Consequently, NL systems must be designed to respond appropriately when they can detect a misconception on the part of the user.",
        "Several conventions exist in cooperative conversation that allow a speaker to indirectly encode their intentions and beliefs about the domain into their utterances, (\"loading\" the utterances), and allow (in fact, often require) a cooperative respondent to address those intentions and beliefs beyond a literal, direct response.",
        "To be effective, NL computer systems must do the same.",
        "The problem, then, is to provide practical computational tools which will determine both when an indirect response is required, and wEWE that response should be, without requTg that large amounts of domain dependent world knowledge be encoded in special formalisms.",

        "But you might be interested in anything that Nasa Headquarters sponsors... After perusing this list, the chairperson concludes that although the projects don't look very promising, s/he will get in touch with Nasa Headquarters.",
        "S/he asks: Q: Who is the contact at Nasa Headquarters?",
        "It turns out that there is a contact at Nasa Headquarters for each project sponsored, and so the system prints out the The problem of producing apparently intelligent behavior from a NL system has traditionally been viewed in Artificial Intelligence as a problem of modelling human cognitive processes, or modelling knowledge about the real world.",
        "It has been demonstrated here that such approaches must include a pragmatic theory of the conventions and properties of the use of language, to function effectively.",
        "Domain driven inferences must be complemented by language driven inferences to appropriately process NL.",
        "Further, it has been argued that language driven inference mechanisms help to control the inference process, and can provide a more general and computationally attractive solutions to many problems previously thought to require domain driven inference.",
        "A descriptive theory of one type of cooperative indirect response to inappropriate questions has been presented, and extended to a prescriptive (computational) theory by restricting the domain of application to DB query systems.",
        "This theory has been implemented using language driven mechanisms in the design of CO-OP, a cooperative query system.",
        "The result is the generation of appropriate corrective indirect responses in a computationally efficient and domain transparent fashion."
