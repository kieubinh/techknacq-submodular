        "In order to fix some of these ideas, we begin by surveying a number of instances of default reasoning as they are commonly invoked in A.I.",
        "Specifically, we discuss default assignments to variables, the closed world assumption, the frame default for causal worlds, exceptions as defaults, and negation in A.I.",

        "We shall see that these may all be formalized by introducing a single default operator 14 where 17LW is taken to mean \"W is not deducible from the given knowledge base\".",
        "In addition, we shall discover that the closed world and frame defaults provide clear representational and computational advantages over their corresponding first order theories.",
        "The former eliminates the need for an explicit representation of negative knowledge about a world, while the latter eliminates the so-called frame axioms for dynamic worlds.",

        "We can view this declaration as an instruction to the KRL interpreter to carry out the following: If x is a person, then in the absence of any information to the contrary, assume hometown(x)=PaloAlto, or phrased in a way which makes explicit the fact that a default assignment is being made to a variable: If x is a person and no value can be determined for the variable y such that hometown(x)=y, then assume y=PaloAlto.",

        "As an example, consider the theory",
        "is now proved, we cannot infer A, so this theory has the single theorem B.",
        "If instead, we had started by observing that B is not provable, then the theory would have the single theorem A.",
        "Default theories exhibiting such behaviour are clearly unacceptable.",
        "At the very least, we must demand of a default theory that it satisfy a kind of Church-Rosser property: No matter what the order in which the theorems of the theory are derived, the resulting set of theorems will be unique.",
        "Another difficulty arises in modeling dynamically changing worlds e.g. in causal worlds or in text understanding where the model of the text being built up changes as more of the text is assimilated.",
        "Under these circumstances, inferences which have been made as a result of a default assumption may subsequently be falsified by new information which now violates that default assumption.",
        "As a simple example, consider a travel consultant which has made the default assumption that the traveller's starting point is Palo Alto and has, on the basis of this, planned all of the details of a trip.",
        "If the consultant subsequently learns that the starting point is Los Angeles, it must undo at least part of the planned trip, specifically the first (and possibly last) leg of the plan.",
        "But how is the consultant to know to focus just on these changes?",
        "Somehow, whenever a new fact is deduced and stored in the data base, all of the facts which rely upon a default assumption and which supported this deduction must be associated with this new fact.",
        "These supporting facts must themselves have their default supports associated with them, and so on.",
        "Now, should the data base be updated with new information which renders an instance of some default rule inapplicable, delete all facts which had been previously deduced whose.support sets relied upon this instance of the default rule.",
        "There are obviously some technical and implementation details that require articulation, but the basic idea should be clear.",
        "A related proposal for dealing with beliefs and real world observations is described in [Hayes 1973].",
        "One way of viewing the role of a default theory is as a way of implicitly further completing an underlying incomplete first order theory.",
        "Recall that a first order theory is said to be complete iff for all closed formulae W, wither W or ,W is provable.",
        "Most interesting mathematical theories turn out to be incomplete - a celebrated result due to Godel.",
        "Most of what we know about the world, when formalized, will yield an incomplete theory precisely because we cannot know everything - there are gaps in our knowledge.",
        "The effect of a default rule is to implicitly fill in some of those gaps by a form of plausible reasoning.",
        "In particular, the effect of the closed world default is to fully complete an underlying incomplete first order theory.",
        "However, it is well known that there are insurmountable problems associated with completing an incomplete theory like arithmetic.",
        "Although it is a trivial matter conceptually to augment the axioms of arithmetic with a default rule11 where W is any closed formula, we will be no further ahead because the non theorems of arithmetic are not recursively enumerable.",
        "What this means is that there is no way in general that, given a W, we can establish that W is not a theorem even if W happens not to be a theorem.",
        "This in turn means that we are not even guaranteed that an arbitrary default rule of inference is effective i.e. there may be no algorithm which will inform us whether or not a given default rule of inference is applicable: From this we can conclude that the theories of a default theory may not be recursively enumerable.",
        "This situation is in marked contrast to what normally passes for a logic where, at the very least, the rules of inference must be effective and the theorems recursively enumerable.",
        "Finally, it is not hard to see that default theories fail to satisfy the extension property [Hayes 1973] which all \"respectable\" logics do satisfy.",
        "(A logical calculus has the extension property iff whenever a formula is provable from a set P of premises, it is also provable from any set P' such that P c P'.)",
        "[Kramosil 1975] attempts to establish some general results on default theories.",
        "Kramosil \"proves\" that for any such theory, the default rules are irrelevant in the sense that either the theory will be meaningless or the theorems of the theory will be precisely the same as those obtainable by ignoring the default rules of inference.",
        "Kramosil's result, if correct, would invalidate the",
        "main point of this paper, namely that default theories play a prominent role in reasoning about the world.",
        "Fortunately, his \"proof\" relies on an incorrect definition of theoremhood so that the problem of characterizing the theorems of a default theory remain open."

        "Default reasoning may well be the rule, rather than the exception, in reasoning about the world since normally we must act in the presence of incomplete knowledge.",
        "Moreover, aside from mathematics and the physical sciences, most of what we know about the world has associated exceptions and caveats.",
        "Conventional logics, such as first order logic, lack the expressive power to adequately represent the knowledge required for reasoning by default.",
        "We gain this expressive power by introducing the default operator.",
        "In order to provide an adequate formal (as opposed to heuristic) foundation for default reasoning we need a well articulated theory of default logic.",
        "This requires, in part, a theory of the semantics of default logic, a suitable notion of theoremhood and deduction, and conditions under which the default inference rules are effective and the set of theorems unique.",
        "Since in any realistic domain, all of the default schemata of Section 2 will be in force (together, no doubt, with others we have not considered) we require a deeper understanding of how these different schemata interact.",
        "Finally, there is an intriguing relationship between certain defaults and the complexity of the underlying representation.",
        "Both the closed world and frame defaults implicitly represent whole classes of first order axioms.",
        "Is this an accidental phenomemon or is some general principal involved?",
