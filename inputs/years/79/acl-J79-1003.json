        "This paper discusses human semantic knowledge and processing in terms of the SCHOLAR system.",
        "In one major section we discuss the imprecision, the incompleteness, the open-endedness, and the uncertainty of people's knowledge.",
        "In the other major section we discuss strategies people use to make different types of deductive, negative, and functional inferences, and the way uncertainties combine in these inferences.",
        "Impreeision can occur either in memory or in communication.",
        "SCHOLAR can have precise values or fuzzy values stored, and its procedures can, to some extent, deal with fuzzy questions when precise values are stored, and with precise queltions when fuzzy values are stored.",
        "Embedding allows information to be specified in the data base to any level of detail or precision.",
        "But SCHOLAR only communicates the most important information on any topic (as measured by importance tags), unless more information is requested.",
        "It should also be possible by using importance tags to adjust what information SCHOLAR communicates, in accord with the sophistication and interests of the listener.",
        "Inference strategies that are appropriate when the complete set of object attributes, or values, is known (i.e., in a closed world) do not apply when knowledge is incomplete (i.e., in an open world).",
        "There are a variety of uncertain inferences that people use to circumvent the holes in their knowledge, which are being programmed in SCHOLAR.",
        "There is a set of transitive relations -- superordinate, superpart, simil&rity, proximity, subordinate, and subpart relations -- that people frequently u c to make deductive inferences.",
        "Currently SCHOLAR only handles superordinate inferences (e.g., the Llanos has a rainy seccon because it is a savanna) and superpart inferences (e.g., the language in Rio is PortUguese because Rio is pat of Brazil).",
        "Deductive inferences can be more or less certain (similarity inforances are like suparordinate inferences, but less certain) and can have restrictions on their u e (only certain attributes transfer on superpart).",
        "When knowledge is incomplete, it is not safe to assume that something is not true just because it is not stored.",
        "Thus an inference is necessary to decide when to say \"No\" and when to say \"I don't know.\" There is a complicated set of strategies in SCHOLAR to find various kinds of contradictions that people use to say \"No.\" If a contradiction cannot be found, another negative inference, called the \"lack-of-knowledge\" inference, is tried.",
        "When enough is known about an object, it is possible to conclude that something is not true ..ut that object on the grounds that if it were true, it would be stored.",
        "Another class of uncertain inference E depends on ill-defined knowledge of functional dete inants, e.g., that climate depends on latitude and altitude.",
        "Different ways that people use functional knowledge involve functional calculations (e.g., if a place has a particular latitude, it probably has a particular climate), functional analogies (e.g., if a place is like another place in latitude and altitude, it probably has the s e cli .te), and to nn-wer Why questions (e.g., a place has a particular climte because of its latitude and altitude).",
        "Different inferences can combine in different way3.",
        "So tin one strategy may call another strategy to find an answer.",
        "When different inferences independently reach the s e or different conclusions, they combine to increase or decre3se certainty.",
        "The pin-gramming of uncertain infurcaces is necesrary to make computers a clever and as fuzzy-thinking Llr; p ple."

        "But there are three facts that ether II ke a contradiction possible: (1) Buenos Aires is located in Argentina, (2) cities only have one location, and (3) Argentina and Brazil are mutually exclusive.",
        "We can illustrate the necessity for conditions (2) and (3): (2) even though Portuguese is the language of Portugal, it is also the language of Brazil (i.e., language can have re than one location); (3) even though Sao Paulo is in South America, it is also in Brazil (i.e., South",

        "Making an incorrect negative inference about cities with More than one location (e.g., Kansas City) or different cities with the same name (Rome, New York, and Rome, Italy) is precluded by storing both locations specifically, just as with deductive inferences.",
        "The strategy we have rked out and implemented to find different contradictions of this kind is fairly complex.",
        "Failure to find a contradiction leads to another kind of negative inference people use which call the lack-of-knowledge inference (Collins, Carbonell and Warnock5).",

        "(Hid conclusion was at lea ;t somewhat wrong, because there are in fact several other countries in South America that produce oil, though for those countries oil is not nearly so important as it is for Venezuela.)",
        "Sach a strategy is currently being implemented in SCHOLAR in the following way: If asked a question like \"Is oil a product of Uruguay?\" where no oil is stored, SCHOL can look for oil under similar objects (e.g., Venezuela or Brazil) or objects with the",
        "Venezuela (say with an I-tag of 3) and if it has enough information stored about Uruguay (up to an I-tag of 8, say) to know about oil if it were at all important, then it can infer that Uruguay probably has no oil.",
        "The degree of certainty exprevsed in the an er should depend on the difference in I-tags between the depth of what it knows about Uruguay and the level at which oil is stored with similar objects.",
        "If SCHOLAR can find no i2ilar objects that have the property in question, as with \"Is sand a product of Uruguay?\" the appropriate anscler is something like \"I don't know whether sand is a product of any country in South America.\" The lack-of-knowledge inference is based on the assumption that one's knowledge is fairly consistent for similar objects."
