        "ABSTRACT The REQUEST System is an experimental natural language query system based on large transformational grammar of English.",
        "In the original implementation of the system the process of computing the underlying structures of input queries involved a sequence of three steps: (1) preprocessing (including dictionary lookup), (2) surface phrase structure parsing, and (3) transformational parsing.",
        "This scheme has since been modified to permit transformational operations not only on the full trees available after completion of surface parsing, but also on the strings of lexical trees which are the output of the preprocessing phase.",
        "Transformational rules of this latter type which are invoded prior to surface parsing, are known as string transformations.",
        "Since they must be defined in the absence of such structural markers as the location of clause boundaries, string transformations are necessarily relatively local in scope.",
        "Despite this inherent limitation, they have so far proved to be an extremely useful and surprisingly versatile addition to the REQUEST System.",
        "Applications to date have included homograph resolution, analysis of classifier constructions, idiom handling, and the suppression of large numbers of unwanted surface parses.",
        "While by no means a panacea for transformational parsing, the use of string transformations in REQUEST has permitted relatively rapid and painless extension of the English subset in a number of important areas without corresponding adverse impact on the size of the lexicon, the complexity of the surface grammar, and the number of surface parses produced.",

        "The system includes a large transformational grammar, a transformational parser, and a Knuth-style semantic interpreter.",
        "The grammar and its associated lexicon are broadly oriented towards question-answering on periodic numerical data, they also include material specific to natural English interaction with collections of business statistics, as exemplified by the Fortune 500 The long-range objective of the work on REQUEST is to determine the extent to which machine-understandable subsets of English can be developed to provide non-programmers with a convenient and powerful tool for accessing information in formatted data bases without having to learn a formal query language.",
        "In the interest of facilitating effective \"understanding\" on the part of the system, the semantic scope of the English subset we are currently dealing with is largely restricted to the world of business statistics.",
        "Within that narrow domain of discourse, however, we are attempting to cover a relatively broad range of syntactic and lexical alternatives, in the hope of permitting future users to employ their normal patterns of written expression without major adjustment.",

        "grammar covers a variety of basic English constructions in some depth, including wh- and yes-no questions, relative clauses and clausal negation It is now being extended into such areas as comparison, conjunction and quantification which, while complex, appear to be of central importance in providing a semantically powerful subset of English.",

        "As can be observed from Figure 1, the system contains two major components, one transformational, the other interpretive.",
        "The transformational component, which serves to analyze input wuiu strings and compute their underlying structures, consists of two main parts: a preprocessor and a parser.",
        "The interpretive component also J. has two major subcomponents: (i) a semantic interpreter, which translates each underlying structure into a logical form, i.e., a formal expression specifying the configuration of executable functions required to access the data base and compute the answer to the corresponding question 4= 4= and (ii) a retrieval component which contains the various data-accessing testing, and output formatting functions needed to evaluate the logical form and complete the question-answering process.",
        "Looking at the transformational component in somewhat greater detail, the role of the preprocessor is to partition the input string into words * Implementation of the semantic interpreter, which operates according to a scheme originally proposed by D. E. Knuth [3], is clue to S. R. Petrick [1, 4, 5], who has also devised the specific semantic interpretation rules employed in REQUEST.",

        "Multi-word strings that function as lexical units are identified by a \"longest match\" lookup in a special phrase lexicon; while the lexical trees corresponding to arabic numerals (which may variously represent cardinals, ordinals, or year names) are supplied algorithmically rather than by matching against the lexicon.",
        "In cases where there are gaps in the preprocessed' string, due to the presence in the input of misspellings, unknown words, ambiguous pronoun references, and the like, the preprocessor prompts the user to supply the required information.",
        "* Operation of the transformational parser proceeds in three stages: (1) The preprocessed string is successively analyzed with respect to the structural description of each rule in a linearly ordered list of string transformations.",
        "Each successful match against a string transformation leads to modification of one or more of the trees in the preprocessed string through application of the operations specified in the structural change of the rule in question -- operations which are drawn from precisely the * The original design and implementation of the parser are due to Petrick [61.",
        "The version currently being used in REQUEST is the result of significant revisions and extensions by M. Pivovonsky, who (with the aid of E. 0.",

        "cases still occur with some frequency where more than one surface parse is produced. )",
        "(3) Finally, the transformational parser processes each surface structure in turn, attempting to map it step by step into a corresponding underlying structure",
        "according to the rules of a transformational grammar.",
        "In this process transformational inverses are applied in an order precIsely, opposite to that in which their \"forward\" counterparts would oc., invoked ifi sentence generation: inverses of the postcyclie transformations are applied first, starting with the \"latest\" and ending with the 'earliest\"; then the inverses of the cyclic transformations are applied (also in last-to-first order) working down the tree from the main clause to those that are most deeply embedded.",
        "To help ensure validity of its final output, the parser checks each intermediate output produced by successful application of an inverse tztans-formation to determine whether or not its constituent structure conforms fully with the set of branching patterns that can be generated by the current grammar in underlying or intermediate structures.",
        "At the end of each inverse cycle, a similar check is performed to determine whether all structure above the next (lower) level of embedded S s is consistent with the inventory of allowable underlying structure patterns alone.",
        "Failure of either test results in immediate abandonment of the current analysis path.",

        "Unlike the balance of the transformational parsing process, these three preliminary steps do not seem to bear a, direct correspondence to familiar generative operations.",
        "Nevertheless, their combined effect is to produce the tree or trees which exist at that stage of the \"forward\" generation where the last postcyclic transformation has applied.",

        "Eschewing irrelevant details, the essentials of the representation adopted (which bears certain strong resem - blan.ces to the predicate calculus) are as follows: Each underlying structure tree represents a proposition (category SI) consisting of an underlying predicate (V) and its associated arguments (NP's) in,that order.",

        "The INDEXes and the terminal nodes they dominate play an important role in the grammar, including the representation of coreference .",
        "One major impact which this view of underlying structure had on what the \"bootstrap\" had to accomplish involved the connection of prepositional phrases to the balance of the surface structure tree.",

        "Thus, in the question \"What companies are computers made by?\"",

        "The first analysis initiated a lengthy inverse derivation that was terminated as ill-formed only after the entire posto.ycle and the first inverse cycle had been traversed, meaning that nearly as much time was spent in pursuing this incorrect path as was required to follow the correct one.",
        "In this and a number of similar cases, however, it was observed that ill-formedness of the surface structure could have readily been detected at or near the outset of the transformational parsing process by performing tests employing the pattern-matchin power of transformational rules.",

        "In the spring of 19721 the surface grammar was greatly expanded in an attempt to cover the full range of structures that could be produced by th'e set of transformational rules then in use.",
        "At that point, the combined effect of the various design decisions affecting surface structures and surface parsing became immediately and painfully evident in the form of a",

        "produced no less than 1.9 surface parses, a figure which soared to 147 when a third prepositional phrase was introduced by replacing \"Buffalo\" with the classifier construction \"the city of Buffalo\" Although a blocking rule for detecting spurious stranded prepositions rather quickly killed off 16 of the 19 analyses in the former case, thereby reducing the analysis problem to tractable size, the system was unable to cope with the latter situation at all, due to problems of storage overflow.",
        "Thoughts of what would inevitably happen if we added yet another prepositional phrase (as in \"Was the headquarters of XYZ in the city of Buffalo in 1971? \")",
        "made it clear that killing off unwanted surface parses after the fact by means of blocking rules was not enough, measures would have to be adopted which would prevent formation of most such analyses in the first place.",

        "(In the case of (8) above, 13 of the original 19 parses were ruled out on the ground that proper nouns cannot take modifiers, while 3 more analyses (plus 4 of the 13 already eliminated) were excluded on the basis of distributional distinctions between prepositional phrases and other noun phrases. )",
        "Implementation of the refinements in the surface grammar required mxrnerovis part-of-speech code changes in the lexicon and a substantial increase in the number of rules in the surface grammar.",

        "The principal costs of ambiguity suppression were felt not in the analysis programs, which required only negligible modification for that purpose, but rather in the surface grammar, which grew much larger and more complex to the point where it became rather difficult to work with.",

        "Summary and Conclusions",
        "In the REQUEST System, string transformations are transformational rules of relatively local scope which are applied to strings of lexical trees at a point midway between lexical lookup and surface phrase structure parsing.",
        "From the 'standpoint of linguistic theory, the status of the string transformation facility is unclear, since it is a component that seems to have no direct generative counterpart.",
        "Thp fact that a number of existing string transformations are in effect inverses pf late postcyclic transformations suggests that there may be some value in viewing the facility in terms of such relationships.",
        "However, the rule writer is entirely free to ignore linguistic considerations of this sort and define any of a wide range of tree manipulations as string transformations.",
        "Accordingly, the string transformation facility can,with some justification, simply be viewed as a convenient mechanism whereby the tree processing power inherent in grammatical transformations is made available for purposes of implementing a wide variety of parsing heuristics.",
        "In contrast to the obscurity of its theoretical role, the string transformation facility of REQUEST has had a clear and decidedly favorable Impact on the practical development of the system.",
        "The facility was originally added in order to provide a more satisfactory input interface to the transformational parser -- an interface which would be considerably",
        "less vulnerable to the undesirable side-effects of expanding grammatical coverage than one consisting solely of a preprocessor and a surface parser.",
        "More specifically, this innovation was aimed at preventing the proliferation of unwanted surface parses in a way which would be at once less costly and more perspicuous than alternatives requiring extension of the preprocessor or of the surface grammar.",
        "Based on approximately one year's experience in the use of the string transformation facility, it appears to have fulfilled these ori!",
        ";irial objectives, During this period, the grammatical coverage of REQUEST has been significantly expanded, but the lexicon and the surface, grammar have undergone only very modest growth as a result, and there has been no accompanying upsurge in the number of spurious surface parses.",
        "The strategy of reordering the inverses of certain late postcyclic rules within, the parsing system by placing them before, rather than after, the surface structure rules has proven to be effective both in reducing the number of unwanted surface analyses and in simplifying the surface grammar (and hence the structures that it produces).",
        "Moreover, string transformations have also shown an unexpected versatility in suck areas as idiom processing and homograph resolution.",
        "In contrast to these favorable results, our attempt to employ string transformations in dealing with conjunction constructions -- while of great",
        "indirect benefit -- can hardly be viewed as an unqualified success.",
        "What the latter experience has clearly demonstrated is the fact that string transformations are a tool., not a panacea, and cannot be expetted to yield satisfactory results in areas where the necessary linguistic groundwork is lacking.",

        "The fully-parenthesized list notation employed in the computer file has been \"pretty printed\" i.e., printed with indentations) in order to make the internal structure of the rules more legible.",
        "Each list is surrounded by a pair of parentheses, with its main components (if any) in general printed starting two spaces to the right of the beginning of their \"parent\" list.",
        "Thus, for example, the left parenthesis of the pair surrounding each rule is indented two spaces to the right of the left parenthesis that initiates the entire list of rules.",
        "Similarly, with the exception of the header list (which is indented only one space to make it stand out), the main components of each rule -- the header, structural pattern, condition, structural change and feature change -- are indented two spaces with respect to the rule, and so forth.",
        "In contrast to the two-dimensional graphical representation employed for trees in the figures in Section 4 of the text, trees in the listing are rep resented in a linear, parenthesized notation with the following essential characteristic s:",

        "stands for a tree of the form where B, C .",

        "D themselves may be replaced by parenthesized expressions",
        "that stand for subtrees, etc.",
        "As in the figures of Section 4, association• of a feature list with a nos:* is denoted by enclosing the list in one pair of parentheses and then surrounding the node and the list with a second pair of parentheses, e. g. (A ( + FEAT1 - TEAT2 )).",
        "In place of the curly bracket notation used in the figures to denote mutually exclusive sequences of trees, the listing employs expressions of the form (OR (list of trees1) (list of trees 2) ... (list of treesn )), where the arguments of thee OR stand in one-to-one correspondence with the sequences of trees.",
        "Thus, for example, the expression",

        "Within a condition, structural change, or feature change, trees are represented in a fully parenthesized 'dressed\" notation which contrasts as follows with the \"peeled\" notation just described for trees in structural patterns: Each node in a tree always has two pairs of associated parentheses -- an inner pair surrounding the node and its feature list (if any) and an outer pair enclosing the node, the feature list, and any subtrees dominated by the node.",
        "Each feature list contains at least two pairs of parentheses one surrounding the entire list, and one for each (feature value, feature name) pair.",
