        "4vhatever may turn out to be the case here, it seems clear that some sorts of processes must be applied in order to transform the original form of storage into a verbal output: that the stored materi I must be verbalized.",

        "One I'S the originil verbnlization performed by the Grill-tor of the source language text.",

        "Not only must the translator adhere to the rules of his own language, he must also produce a verbalization that communicates, so flr as possible, the same underlying content or knowledge that was communicated by the source language verbalization.",
        ".he verbalization in the target language is thus subject to this special kind of constraint., Its producer is not free to \"say what he wants,\" but must insofar as poqsible say the same thing as the producer of the source language text.",
        "we suggested in an earlier report that there are two dimensions of high quality translation, which we termed naturalness and fidelity.",
        "Naturalness is achieved when the target language verbalization adheres to all the constraints of that language; the output will then sound \"natural% Fidelity is achieved to the extent that the target language verbalization communicates the same content as the source language one.",
        "Verbalization in general, as we see it, consists of a mixture of two kinds of orocesses: those which necessitate creative decisions on the Dart of the verbalizer and those wlaich do not, Deli:1g governed by the constraints imr)osed by the 11nruage.",

        "tive processes are ultimately governed by the content which underlies the verbalization; the verbalizer has to decide how best to verbalize that content.",
        "Normally a range of choices will be open to him, and he must decide what will most effectively convey what he has in mind.",
        "After he has made sch choices, there are often automatic consequences which follow from them because of the",
        "particular rules of the language (but which are themselves likely to lead to the necessity of further creative choices).",
        "We can say, then, with respect to the two verbalizations involved in a translation, that the producer of the source language, verbalization, has applied both creative and algorithmic processes, whereas in the target language verbalization only algorithmic processes are autonomously applied, the necessary creative choices being determined by the choices that were made in the source language verbalization.",
        "Thus the naturalness of the fanal translation depends largely on adherence to the algorithmic processes of the target language, while its fidelity depends on the extent to which the translation has been able to incorporate creative cuoices that correspond to those originally applied in the source language.",
        "In ail probability there are cases where exact correspondence in these choices is not possible, and where a certain amount of autonomous creativity has to be introduced into the target verb lization -1,s well.",
        "These are the cases where automatic translation becomes most problematic.",

        "It knows when cretive choices are necessary, but must ask the user what choices to make.",
