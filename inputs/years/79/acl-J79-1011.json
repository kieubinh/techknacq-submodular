        "Recognition cf such a gestalt allows the hearer or reader to assign the language data to a specific subpopulaticn about Which he already has prototype information.",
        "Assuming this provides a workable view of style, then the basic task cf an investigation of the phenomenon is ohe of generating hypotheses about possible language-element p&rticiparits in style-marking constellations which can be investigated in themselves and in patterns cf co-occurrence.",
        "The results of such investigations, if successful in differentiating externally defined sutpopulations of language, will provide additional data about language to which any grammatical description must be responsible.",

        "NP modification: adjectives 29. locatives 30. appositives 31. full relative clauses 324 partially reduced relative clauses 33. noun-adjuncts 34. noun-heads, including pronouns 35.",
        "Adverbials: prepositional phrases 36. other advertials 9",
        "Extraposition, e. g. implies an embedded clause; a passive constttcticn implies a transitive verb; conditional clauses may imply the past tense marker; contracted verbal forms imply auxiliaries; and emphatic do and other auxiliaries are mutually exclusive.",
        "Hcwever, none of these relationships (referred to here as grammatical co-occurrence restriCticns), with the exception of the last, is reciprocal.",
        "Extrarositicn implies an embedded clause, but an embedded clause does nct necessarily imply extraposition; a passive construction implies a transitive verb, but a transitive verb does nct imply a passive construction, etc.",
        "Since these various elements are not completely redundant, they are able to operate at least semi-independently as possible syntactic indicators of style.",
        "Five genres were chosen for investigation cn the basis of context cf utterance which permits identification by place of publication.",
        "The genres selk.cted were: Learned Journals, Newspaper Eepertage, Popular Jcuinals, Government Dccuments, and Fiction.",
        "The actual data were drawn from Frown University millicn-word English corpus, A Standard Sample of Present_ day Edited American English for Use with Dioital Computers.",
        "lids corpus consists of 500 samples cf English-language texts published in the United States in 1961, each sample 10 approximately 2,CnO words long.",
        "This large number of relatively short samples minimizes the effect of any single author or topic, and the restrictions on date and place of publication contrcl variables associated with provenance.",
        "A complete description of this corpus and its content may be found in Francis (1964) or in Kucera & Francis (1967).",
        "A total sample of 5C0 sentences was drawn, 1C0 from each of the five genres.",
        "Each genre subset cf 100 consisted cf ten sentences from each of ten sentence-length blocks.",
        "Sentence length was measured in words, and the blocks are shown in Table 2.",
        "These block lengths were chosen to miricr roughly the distribution of sentence lengths in the entire corpus.",
        "A structured sample of this kind was drawn tc prevent sentence length as such from acting as a variable since sentence-length distribution was already known to differentiate among genres (Marckworth & Pell, 1967), and also to guarantee that those syntactic devices which tend to be associated with greater sentence length wculd have equal opportunities to appear within each genre sample.",
        "Again, the emphasis in this study was cn the senttrce as the basic unit cf analysis, and cn the cc-occurrence of syntactic structures within sentences.",
        "The reader should keep in mind, however, that a random sample cf sentences would permit certain sentence",
        "lengths tc dominate in specific genres, pcssibly obscuring the co-occurrence patterns of interest here but, nevertheless, reflecting another property which can clearly be said to character zeigenre style.",
        "Each of the sample sentences was anAlyzed for the occurrence of the syntactic variables indicated in Table 1, and the number cf occurrences of each structure was recoreled.",
        "A discussion cf the basis on whiot the syntactic elements were identified may be found in Marckworth (1973, .111411.",
        "411-48).",
        "The basic data for analysis thus consisted of",
        "500 observations, (sentences) with each observation scored on 36 variables and classified by genre and length.",
        "The subsequent analysis cf these data was based primarily on discriminant functions 'which were used to determine how the variables served to distinguish one genre from another.",
        "Easically, discriminant Junction analysis is the multivariate extension cf the univariate F ratio which is used to distinguish among previously established groups.",
        "It represents, however, a conSiderable increase in both, complexity and analytical power since it focuses not only on the simple, differences between groups on each variable, but also cn the interrelationships among differences on the several variables considered simultaneously.",
        "It serves to maximize group differences by developing maximally efficient weights which, when applied to the original, data, will yield the clearest distinctions among the groups being analyzed.",

        "These results demcnstrate that sentences from all cf the non",
        "* Those variables having a positive value are characteristic of fiction sentences, but not of non-fiction; those values with a negative value, vice versa.",
        "fiction genres are more alike in syntactic structure than any cf them are like sentences from ficticn.",
        "This may, at first view, be surprising in light of the range of non-ficticn genres included in the study, but it bears out the findings of at least cne ether investigaticr cf quantitative characteristics of the language of different genres (Marckworth and Bell, 1967, on sentence-length distributicns): that the major measurable stylistic distincticr is between fiction and no-n-ficticn genres.",
        "several interesting cbservations may be made about the syntactic variables that participate in the discrimination (see Table 4).",
        "The uicst obvious pcint is the heavy invclvement of syntactic features of the verbal unit in differentiating fiction frcm non-fiction styles.",
        "With the Exception cf inclusicn of direct discourse, which seems transparently attributable to the dialogue characteristic of fiction, and tne lack cf sassive ccnstructicns, since voice has been shown tc be a whole-sentence focus phenomenon (Andrew, 1974), all of the variables in Table 4 ar/e associated with verbal rather than nominal elements cf sentence.",
        "Marking for last tense and EErfective asEe, intrarsitdve verbs, and contracted verbal fc4ins are all specific tc the verb phrase, and adverbial clauses and other advertials are either specifically verb-modifying or are whcle-sentence-modifyjng.",
        "Apparently elements of the noun 19 phrase, cr at least those considered in this study, do not participate in the distinctively style-associated constellations of syntactic structoes that distinguish fiction from non-faction.",
        "A second notable feature distinguishing the fiction sentence set is the amount of indication of past time action.",
        "This is conveyed nct only by the formal last tense variatle, which in the great majority of cases does indicate a past time action, but also by the perfective aslfct, which always_ indicates a past time event whether marked for past ci present tense.",
        "This feature is perhaps understandable in view cf the usual function of fiction as a rarrative of past events, and it should also be noted that this same function may utilize another role of perfective aspect--that of interrelating sequential events through time, A question may be raised about the relationship of two of the fiction-distinguishing variables: the presence of intransitive verbs and the absence of passive constructions.",
        "Since these two exhibit a non-reciprocal grammatical co-cccuxrenoe restriction between voice and verb type--passive voice implies a transitive verb but not vice versa--it is possible that the paucity of passive constructiobs in fiction is simply an artefact of the frequency of intransitive verbs.",
        "In other words, we muot ask whether 20 passive sentences occur less in fiction than in non-fiction simply because they have less opportunity to do so, or whether non-passiveness is an independent syntactic feature of fiction style.",
        "A comparison of the ratios of occurrence of passive construction to transitive veLb in tie fiction and non-fiction genres shows the latter case to be the true one.",
        "(Such a ratio expresses the actual occurrence of passive sEptencPs in relation to the possible occurrences.)",
        "The ratios for the five genre are",
        "It is tempting to speculate about just why the fiction genre should be characterized by significantly more intransitive verbs tc cause this variable to be discriminatory.",
        "Cne possible explanation, which suggests a simple characterization of fiction style, could be based on analy2ing a large subset (if not the whole class) of verbs usually called intransitive as items which can occur both with nc object (traditionally called intransitive verbs) and with one or two objects (traditionally called transitives).",
        "In such an analysis it is presumcd that when the gramm4tical object of a verb of this class is either reduncant or not completely specified it is suppressed and",
        "the result is a one-place predicate sentence, e.g., John sang.",
        "When the grammatical object carries new or required information it is present and the result is a multiple-place predicate, e.g., Jchn sans a Greek fclksong.",
        "This sort of analysis cf the \"intransitive\" verb opens the door to a very general characterization of genre differences.",
        "Thus viewed, the intransitive verb variable characterizes sentences which are nct heavily infcrmaticn criented--sentences in which a major component, the grammatical cbject, is either so predictable cr sc unimportant that it is nct even specified.",
        "Such sentences are significantly more characteristic of fiction than cf ncn-ficticn writing, and this analysis of them suggests a measurable basis for the cld rule of thumb that successful (although nct necessarily good) fiction wriiirg is strcngly action oriented.",
        "It also suggests the validity of the ccmmon-sense intuit:ion that a primary source of the differences between Liction and non-fiction is that the latter is designed fcremost as an information-conveying instrument; that in the dichctdmy cf literary purpose• it is mere likely tc teach than to delights Since one of tke major ways in which infcrmation can be packed into a sentence is through healiy use of nominal elements, we locked a simple mEasure of thi.",
        "characterization cf fiction style as action-ariented as",
        "tearing cut the supposition that sentences in the nonfiction genres have acre nouns in proportion to verbs than do those from fiction.",
        "It may also be noted that, in addition tc being high in nouns in proportion to verbs, nonfiction sentences also exhibit somewhat more noun modification than fiction, as shown by the following ratios",
        "Thus, from the discriminatory variables identified by the five-group discriminant function analysis and the further obser,vations suggested by them, a picture emenges of distinctive syntactic structure constellations in at least two major genre categories: fiction, with the syntactic structures determined by the function of past-time, action-oriented, narrative communication; and non-fiction, with structures determined by an information-carrying function.",
        "23 The five--group discriminant function analysis showed such a majcr distinction betwee'n fiction and the non-fiction genres that it seemed possible that differences in the non-ficticn genres might have been obscured.",
        "In consequence, a four-'group discriminant function analysis was done on data from these genres only.",
        "The result indicated a distinctio• in syntactic structure between the formal genres (Learned Journals and Government Documents) and the informal (Newspaper 'Reportage and Popular Journals) alcng the first axis, and along the second axis a distinction between Popular Jcurnals and Newspaper Reportage.",
        "The third dimension distinguished Learned Journals from Government rocuments (see Figure 2).",
        ":able 5 shows the syntactic variables that participate in These three discriminations.",
        "These discriminating structures present a less distinct picture cf different types cf writing than dc those differentiating fiction and non-ficticn, but nevertheless illustrate some interesting points abcut genre and style.",
        "Cf the four items that characterize informal non-ficticn sentences, only transitive verb is not susceptible to immediate explanation, although we can note that its presence as an informal marker must be due almost entirely to sentences from Popular Journals since, in the",
        "discrdgihation between Newspaper Reportage and Popular Journals, it has a negative weighting for the former; that is, in the comparison of this pair of genres, Newspaper Reportage is distinguished by the absence of transitive verbs (see Variable 16, Discriminant Function II, in Table 5).",
        "The'cther three distinguishing features of the informal genres are inclusicn cf direct discourse, contracted verbal forms, and last tense.",
        "Inclusion of direct discourse is probably present as a result of the tact t}'at the parsiag procedure aid not differentiate between true direct discourse cf the sort found in fiction dialogue and the inclusion of quoted material of the sort fcund in Newspaper Reportage in which one or two words may be quoted.",
        "The supposition that Newspaper Reportage ccntributed this discriminant variable tc the informal category is borne out by its appearance as a characterlstic distinguishing that genre from Popular Jcurnals, as shown by the second function in Table 5. contracted verbal forms are a typical and, frequently, a deliberate indicator of informal style, which probably explains the presence of this variable as a discriminator.",
        "In addition, editorial policy (or a writer's perception of it) usually discourages the use of these fcrms in any sort 27 of formal written language, which explains their absence in Iearhed Journals and Government DocuMents.",
        "Why 1st tense should .differentiate informal from formal no fiction is not really clear; one pos.sible contributory cause may b hat Learned Journals frequently discuss things as they are (or appear to be) Government Documents (which in this sample are largely proclamations of future legal interpretations or holidays) discuss things as they will be, hut Newspaper Reportage discusses things as they have beer.",
        "'Several other transparent discriminatory variables are to be seen in Table 5.",
        "Variable 8, passilve constructions, which distinguishes Learned Journals ftom Government Documents, is almost certainly a result of conscious editorial policy.",
        "The presence of declarative sentences and the 'absence of imperative sentencss which distinguish Newspaper Eeporta.g• from Popular Journals are a joint result of the presence in Popular Journals of a rumber of how-to-do-it articles: \"Hold the brick in your left hand •••,\" A less transparent, but perhaps more analytically interesting set of variables is shown in gable 5 (32, 33, 26, and 24, 22, 33).",
        "The first three, Iartiilly reduced relative classes, ,noun adjuncts, and,advertial clauses, are atypical of informal non-fictioh in the informal/formal discrimination; the other three are involved in 28 distinguishing Learned Journals from GoVernffent Documents--rominalizations in the noun n,11Lase and corjoined words and .phrases by their presence in Learned OcUrnals and noun adjuncts by its absence.",
