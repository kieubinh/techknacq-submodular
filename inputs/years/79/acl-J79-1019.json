        "Traditional phonological rules describe transitions from the underlying form to the surface form of a word.",
        "However, in casual (fast) speech, words are not distinct, independent units, but run together and interact.",
        "Fast speech rules attempt to describe these changes that occur as speech becomes faster and more casual (4, 8, 9), This is a case 'history of the examination of two particular sets of rules on the Phonological Grammar Tester (PGT) of Friedman and Morin (3).",
        "An overview is given in Appendix A and a sample of the output in Appendix B.",
        "In addition to testing these two sets of fast speech rules, we were also interested in the problems of testing such a grammar with this program.",
        "Testing the Fast Speech Rules For our first test, ye chose the fast speech rules of Neu (6) as the best available set of rules given in a reasonably.",
        "consistent notation.",
        "The rules were given in two formats: one using phonemes and the other using distinctive features.",
        "The first task was to adjust the notation into a machine usable form.",
        "For the purposes of this test, we used the feature systet of Chomsky and Halle (1), with three types of boundaries: syllable (+), morpheme CO and word (#10.",
        "For example, the features anterior and coronal had to be substituted for 211cv of articulation.",
        "Also, the rules had to be modified so that each feature had the same type of value (integer, binary, 9E marked unmarked) throughout the grammar.",
        "For example, in the PGT, 1stress, is not equal to +stress and is less than =stress, which could cause man unexpected problems in the grammar.",
        "Another minor problem was determining whether a C in the rules meant not_a vowel, l+consl, or 1cons -vocali.",
        "Sample drivations were given with the rules, and these were used as a first test.",
        "We quickly found a number of small problems, most being that the rule had been incorrectly or incompletely stated.",
        "For example, Geminate Reduction and Alveolar Flapping would not apply across the word boundary in \"want to\", while the 2 in \"captain\" blocked the application of Glottalizat ion.",
        "More sample words were taken from Neu and several more small",
        "errors were found, such a Nasal Consonant Deletion bleeding Transitional Stop Insertion and thereby indicating that it should be ordered after Transtop.",
        "We still had some unresolved problems, such as \"Ts /f e d a 1/ a proper fast speech form of ,federal'?\", when the revisions and additions (7) arrived.",
        "Many of these revisions corresponded to our solutions of problems encountteied during testing of these rules.",
        "The final form of this first set is given in kppendix C. Since there was little obvious order in the rules, graphing the partial ordering given was very helpful in exploring the rule ordering.",
        "The partial ordering given with the rulas, Figure 1, was quickly refined to that in Figure 2 by testing the sample derivations.",
        "In these new rules, particular attention was paid to the presence and position of syllable, morpheme and word boundaries in the environments for which the rules should apply.",

        "testing these rules a major problem was in determining what did and did not constitute proper fast speech forms.",
        "In slow speech, it is fairly easy to break up the utterance into a seguecte of, phonemes, but in fast speech, the utterance is more continuous and it is harder to decide what is a segment and whore the segments begin and end.",
        "For example, the palatalization rules produce the following derivation: (a).",
        "/diditityul (b).",
        "/dititIyul (c).",
        "/di**Tu/ We are not inclined to believe that an intermediate form /did##Tyu/ exists between steps (a) and (b) in this derivation.",
        "I think that (b) is a true intermediate form, existing in slower, casual speech, but not in fast speech.",
        "Our best evidence indicated that the RUH is the same as the syllabic\"r\",thusraising the problem of ordering the Syllabicizing and Ruh-reduction rules.",
        "Are the proper forms /g u v + n r/ and /f e d + r 1/ or, more likely, /g u v + n r/ and /f e d + r 1I?",
        "Gr, could it possibly be /g u v + n r/ and /f e d + r 1/, with the Syllabicizing rule not deleting the schwa,, but making it very short and possibly devoicing it?",
        "Another disturbing result of the testing was the application of rules across deleted segments.",
        "For example, after 22vernor has been reduced to /g u v + n r/, Progressive Assimilation applies, producing /g u v + m r/.",
        "Similarly, sanity_clause becomes/s ae n + t a .../ which becomes Is ae n + r a .../,",
        "closing in on a fast speech form of aanta Claus.",
        "The final form of the second set of rules and the output are given in Appendix D. Suuested_fodifiutions to the PGT The PGT was writfen or the testing of traditional phDnological grammars which take an underlying form to a surface form, and thus fast speech rules present several unforeseen problems.",
        "Fast speech rules do not constitute a complete grammar, but are instead interspersed, among the traditional riles.",
        "In producing an intermediate or surface form for input to the grammar, the use of diacritics would produce a simpler and more economical representation af the input For example, in the present system, it is necessary to give a separate definition for each stress assignment for each vowel, instead of defining each Vowel once and assigning the stress through the use of diacritics.",
        "Syllabification aPpears to occur before some of the rules, and after others.",
        "TO avoid having to insert, rules for syllabification or having the rules preceding syllabification ignore syllable boundaries in the input, the POT should have a \"human intervention,' rule which would allow the user to change the tree as part of the derivation, simulating the effect of thP",
        "\"missing\" rules.",
        "\"Human intervention\" rules could be used to postpone Voriting rules, either to a later session or indefinitely if the rules are too hard to write or if they are Outside the scope of the problem.",
        "Another problem arises from most, if not all, fast speech rules being optional.",
        "The present system generates a single derivation using a random number generator to decide whether or not to apply optional rules.",
        "As a result, to obtain a good test of the effect of an optional rule in the grammar, we have to do two tests, one with the rule obligatory and one without the rule.",
        "With, a large number of optional rules operating on a non-trivial set of test data, having to test each possible rule combination individually would be a, staggering task.",
        "A more satisfactory method wguld be for the PGT to produce a set of derivations such that any time an optional rule can apply, the POT produces a derivation for the case where the rule was applied and one for the case where it wasn't.",
        "Cohen and Mercer (2) have implemented such a feature in their rule tester by storing the result of the application of a rule as a directed graph.",
        "Subsequent rules are applied to all paths through the grph, producing a new graph.",
        "In considering the problem of when an optional rule should be applied, we are considering perfouance (10).",
        "To this end, we might be better served by having the variable rules of Labov (5) in addition to traditional phono:ogical rules.",
        "Instead of the all-or-nothing matching of normal rules, variable rules employ incremental matching, with the likelihood of the rule being",
        "applied being a function of the degree of match, the rate of speech, and the nature of the conversation (e.g. Is it formal or casual?).",
        "For example, for the Progressive Assimilation rule for point of articulation (PROARTIC), /s 0 f n/ f(soften) becomes /sOfm/ only in very fast speech, but /pr+fyu+z n/ (profusion) becomes /p r + f y u + Z Ci/ in most fast speech.",
        "In addition, for each variable rule applied, the PGT should use the associated probability tc produce a final probability for each derivation.",
        "Unfortunately, the implementation of variable rules would necessitate major changes to the PGT.",
        "Convenient, but not necessary, would be the ability to make a rule \"blind\" to certain types of nodes.",
        "For example, Chomsky and Halle (1) allow some boundary symbols to be invisible to their phonological rules.",
        "In some cases, this ability might be able to fulfill the fuection of a \"human intervention\" rule.",
        "Observations about Fast SDeech Rules Testing the fast speech rules led to certain insights into the interactions of thP rules.",
        "The most vexing problems were with the representation of boundaries.",
        "rne use of +, #, and *I seems artificial and cumbersome.",
        "A more natural approach seems to be to assign the boundaries varying degrees of atrength, and then allow the phonolcgical rules to operate on the strength assignments, Consider the problem of \"John's going to work\" becoming the East speech form \"John's gonna work\" in the case",
        "where going is an auxiliary but uot in the case where it is the verb.Rather than having the phonological rule sensitive to the syntax, seems much cleaner to have it sensitive to the boundary strength between going and to.",
        "To this end, we must allow the syntax to influence the initial assignments of boundapy strength.",
        "The use of boundary strengths also seems to solve the problem, of how boundaries are reduced.",
        "For example, in reducing want to to wanna should the word boundary be reduced to a morpheme or a syllable boundary?",
        "Another use of boundary strengths might be to mark the position of segments deleted from a word by strengthening the neighboring boundary.",
        "For example, when governor is reduced to ggv'ner, the v is lengthened, indicating the possible presence of a stronger then normal syllable boundary.",
        "This stronger boundary would then prevent the v from changihg the n to an m under Progressive Assimilation.",
        "An alternative is to have a \"strong syllable\" boundary symbol which would be \"stronger\" than a \"weak word\" boundary symbol, but this would be mdssy and unnatural.",
        "It would probably be more productive to represent fast speech forms with phonemes utilizing multivalued (1 through 7 instead of + and -) features.",
        "Giving the segments length attributes would allow segments to be deleted by a combination of rules which reduce segment lengths.",
        "Also, in comparing forms, a very short segment could be considered to be deleted.",
        "Fast speech rules seem to be selective as to the words to",
        "which they can apply.",
        "Zwicky (14) gives examples and counterexamples for various fast speech rules; However, it seem that the counterexamples are words which do not frequently occur in 6asual spe.ech, while the examples were common.",
        "This point was illustrated when , in an early run, that Schwa Deletion produced /k ae n g r u/ from \"kangaroo\".",
        "At first, this fast speech form was unacceptable, but with use, it became more and more acceptable.",
        "Interestingly enough, a small random polling seemed to indicate that this form is acceptable \"ifyou'rean Australian\".That fast speech rules apply to what is common in the speaker's vocabulary is also evidenced bytheheavy application of fast speech rules to local names.",
        "The similarity of the Palatization rules in this fast speech grammar and in noimAl Fnglish (1) raises tha question of \"What are last speech rules?\".",
        "If normal rules are restricted versions of the more general processes which also account for the fast speech forms (14), then we must be careful in using slow speech surface forms to test the fast speech rules.",
        "For example, part of the data covered by the Schwa Deletion rule might actually result from schwas being inserted between consonants in slow speech formA."
