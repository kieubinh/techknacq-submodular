        "As more and more items are described, additional topics may be tied into the same conference node.",
        "The ultimate result will be a highly interconnected set of concept nodes, each with its own set of associated textual materials.",
        "To achieve this kind of structural organization for the network, we make use of the dependency relationships in the user's descriptions: each node level corresponds to a syntactic dependency level.",

        "Second, single word descriptions play an important role in achieving our goal of communicative efficiency.",
        "Since we anticipate that users will make frequent use of single word references when working in the context of a particular topic, we want to provide a natural and convenient treatment of such descriptions.",
        "Finally, a phrasal description can convey a higher order categorization of an existing topic without containing a simple phrase for that topic.",
        "For example, THE REVIEWER'S COMMENTS ON THE PAPER may reference a paper mentioned earlier; yet it contains no simple phrases describing that paper.",
        "These considerations lead us to the third logical component of the network data structures, the single word.",
        "Essentially, each component word provides access to a series of pointers to simple phrases in which the word occurs.",
        "Word-to-phrase pointers are of two types: those indicating usage 37 as subject noun; and those indicating modifier usage in a particular simple phrase.",
        "As we shall see later, this distinction is required in order to relate new simple phrases to existing topics at an appropriate node level.",
        "Having specified the three logical components and the linkages in the representational network, we now turn our attention to the storage implementation of these structures.",

        "The directories could be accessed and updated on disk, or they could be brought into core storage for the duration of the session.",
        "We adopted the former strategy for a number of reasons.",
        "First, AUTONOTE is highly oriented toward the use of disk file storage.",
        "Several file interface routines were available at the outset for conveniently storing and accessing information through the MTS file system.",
        "Second, as the network grows in complexity, it becomes increasingly unlikely that the user will reference the major portion of the network during any given session.",
        "By maintaining the network in disk files, the amount of core storage required is substantially reduced.",
        "Finally, the file approach greatly simplified the programming effort, especially in those system components that operate recursively on the list structured network.",
        "We will elaborate on this point further in section VI, which illustrates the simplification of recursive processes in AUTONOTE2.",
        "38 Rather than store all the directories in a single disk file, we chose to maintain each directory separately.",
        "This strategy preserves the logical distinction among the three types of directory information, and has also simplified the programming of the system.",
        "We now describe the organization of each of the directory files.",
        "The node directory.",
        "Each node in the representational network has a corresponding integral node number which is also the line number in the node directory file.",
        "As new node numbers are needed to represent new topics, the next sequentially numbered line in the node directory is assigned as the node number.",
        "Each node directory line contains four fields--one for bookkeeping information and three fields for the upward, downward, and item reference pointers for the node.",
        "The item reference region contains a list of integer item numbers.",
        "The upward pointer region also contains a list of integers that represent immediate linkages to superior nodes.",
        "The two types of downward pointers (to nodes and to phrases) are stored in a common region.",
        "Each node, simple phrase, and single word has a corresponding file line number in its respective directory file.",
        "In thee case of nodes, the line number is simply the node number.",
        "In the case of words and simple phrases, the line number is the result of a, hash coding process on a compact character representation of the word or phrase.",
        "Thus a \"pointer\" is actually a file line number.",
        "Downward pointers to nodes and phrases are distinguishable in the node directory on the basis of the magnitude of the line number.",
        "Since each of the three pointer fields is of fixed length, there is a maximum number of each type of pointer for a given node directory line.",
        "Each field consequently has an associated continuation pointer to a line where additional pointers are stored if necessary.",
        "The phrase directory.",
        "To locate the phrase directory line for a particular simple phrase, a hash coding function is applied to the character string formed by concatenating the modifier word, a slash, and the subject word.",
        "For example, the directory line for the simple phrase PAPER ABOUT AUTONOTE is the hashcode for the string \"AUTONOTE/PAPER.\" Since the hashing function operates only on the modifier and subject word, simple phrases formed from the same two words, but with differing (or no) prepositions, are mapped into the same directory line number.",
        "To distinguish among the various instances of the same two-word combination, the directory line for simple phrases consists of a series of pointer blocks.",
        "Each pointer block contains a code for the particular preposition used, some additional bookkeeping information, and a pointer to the node directly described by that occurrence of the simple phrase.",

        "A different choice of modifier referents determines a correspondingly different set of paraphrases.",
        "If PERSONAL was intended to modify INFORMATION, we would have the paraphrase SYSTEMS FOR THE RETRIEVAL OF PERSONAL INFORMATION, with a corresponding list of incomplete references to the topic.",
        "As in the prepositional case, the choice of modifier referents is guided by the current state of the representational network.",
        "After processing the last modifier in the string, the parser positions itself at the preceding modifier and moves left in the input string until the first word in the modifier string is processed.",
        "In the above example, after associating RETRIEVAL with SYSTEMS, the parser next examines the modifier INFORMATION.",
        "A list of simple phrase candidates is formed.",
        "In this case, the list contains INFORMATION RETRIEVAL and INFORMATION SYSTEMS.",
        "If neither of the candidate phrases has been previously used, the system queries,: WHAT DOES INFORMATION MODIFY?",
        "The user's reply is matched against the candidate referents and the appropriate simple phrase is formed.",
        "47 Possessive adjectives.",
        "Possessives are processed in much the same way as normal modifiers.",
        "The system recognizes the 's word stem and marks the root word as a possessive.",
        "The root word is later stored in the network directories along with a possessive flag.",
        "Thus the phrase SMITH'S PAPER is stored internally as SMITH/PAPER (possessive).",
        "The removal of the stem insures that a subsequent simple phrase incorporating a preposition (PAPER BY SMITH) will hash to the same directory line thus allowing the use of either prepositional or possessive forms in referencing topics.",
        "A particularly interesting case arises when a possessive occurs in a string of consecutive modifiers as in SMITH'S LATEST MEMORY EXPERIMENT.",
        "The string is first processed as described above; that is, a check is made to see if SMITH has been used in a simple phrase with LATEST, MEMORY, or EXPERIMENT.",
        "In the event that this yields no clues, the system then checks to see if SMITH was rendered as a possessive.",
        "Upon noting that it was, the parser carries out a heuristic that assumes that the possessive modifies the head noun, EXPERIMENT.",
        "The possessive heuristic can be fully stated as follows.",
        "A possessive occurring in a string of modifiers will be assumed to modify the head noun unless another possessive occurs between it and the head noun.",
        "In the latter case, the first possessive will be assumed to modify the second.",
        "This is similar to the possessive feature employed by the REL parser (Dosert & Thompson, 1971).",
        "Thus in SMITH'S RESEARCH GROUP'S MEMORY EXPERIMENT, SMITH'S is assumed to modify GROUP, and GROUP'S is assumed to modify the head noun EXPERIMENT.",
        "The question now arises, why check the phrase directory first instead of applying the possessive heuristic immediately?",
        "To answer this, suppose a topic was originally described as THE RESULTS OF THE MEMORY EXPERIMENT BY SMITH and 48 the user now attempts to refer to it as SMITH'S MEMORY EXPERIMENT RESULTS.",
        "If the possessive heuristic were applied immediately, the system would incorrectly form the simple phrase SMITH'S RESULTS, not SMITH'S EXPERIMENT.",
        "By checking the network first, the simple phrase EXPERIMENT BY SMITH will be detected and the system will parse the description appropriately.",
        "Implementation of the Parser The ultimate goal of the parser is to determine the simple phrases of a topic description.",
        "The parsing algorithm is implemented as a two stage process.",
        "The first stage is a preliminary scan to ascertain that the string is in a form acceptable for analysis.",
        "The description is segmented into an ordered list of words, each of which is marked as either WORD, POSSESSIVE, ARTICLE, or PREPOSITION.",
        "The parser makes no distinction between nouns and modifiers until completing the scan.",
        "At this point, the last in a series of consecutive WORDs is marked as a NOUN; the preceding words are marked as MOD-IFIERs.",
        "Possessive modifiers are an exception as they can be recognized explicitly during the scan.",
        "A record of article usage is also kept, but the articles themselves are not placed on the word list.",
        "The preliminary scan of the description can be viewed as a simple finite state process.",
        "Of course, to be completely formal, the recognizer would have to examine each input character.",
        "For convenience we will assume a five state automaton with inputs: WORD, POSSESSIVE, PREPOSITION, and ARTICLE.",
        "The state transition graph for the machine is given in Fig. 11.",
        "The machine starts in state S0, examines the next input and moves to a new state.",
        "If at the end of the input string, the machine is in state Sl, called the final state, the input is accepted; otherwise, the user is asked to rephrase.",
        "Note that in state",
        "S2' the machine has just encountered an article and is anticipating a \"word.\" If the machine is in state S0 upon completion, it has just recognized a preposition and is expecting an object; thus, the string is rejected.",
        "The state S4 is reached whenever a possessive is encountered.",
        "Since a possessive must have an object noun, a \"word\" input is required to reach state Sl.",
        "State S3 is a trapping state; once entered, the machine remains in that state regardless of the remaining input and the description is consequently rejected.",
        "State S3 corresponds to various error conditions--two consecutive prepositions or articles, an article between two words, a phrase beginning with a preposition, etc.",
        "Descriptions found acceptable by the scanner next undergo analysis by the second stage procedure.",
        "This algorithm steps through the word list and builds a table of simple phrases called the phrase table.",
        "Each entry in the phrase table includes (1) the internal character representation of the phrase for use in hash coding, (2) a numerical code for the preposition used, (3) the hash code (directory line number) for the phrase, (4) a list of nodes directly described by the phrase, and (5) a coordinate or subordinate link to another phrase table entry.",
        "We now illustrate the construction of the phrase table by following through several examples.",

        "The modifier PLANNED is first noted.",

        "Next the prepositional phrase ABOUT AUTONOTE is encountered.",
        "Again there is only one possible noun referent.",
        "The phrase PAPER ABOUT AUTONOTE is entered into the table and marked as coordinate with the first entry.",

        "A yes response results in the addition of PAPER FOR CONFERENCE to the phrase table.",

        "The word search procedure involves the use of selected words from the description and the word directory to obtain a set of active phrases containing 63 Whose words.",

        "The description of the paper was also left pending in the Stage 4 example.",
        "In fact, Case 2 and 4 can only occur in this situation since the presence of a simple phrase with paper as the subject noun would have been picked up earlier in either Stage 1 or 3.",
        "The stage in which topic identification is made also is important when processing retrieval descriptions.",
        "Recall that a principal advantage of the referential system is that it enriches its representation of the user's topics during retrieval.",

        "However, if topic identification occurs in Stage 2, note that a simple phrase will be added at one level higher than the decided topic.",
        "If processing a retrieval description, the addition would be meaningless as it will not enrich the description of the identified node.",

        "Furthermore, subject to the user's own limitations in describing his materials, the topic framework of AUTONOTE2 implies \"perfect\" precision and recall once a particular topic is identified during retrieval.",
        "A principal motivation for the AUTONOTE2 system was the desire to overcome the disadvantages of keyword indexing techniques, which force the user to translate ideas and concepts pertinent to a given document into discrete content indicators.",
        "In developing AUTONOTE2 we have sought to provide mechanisms for 88 defining and efficiently referencing these concepts directly.",
        "An evaluation of AUTONOTE2 should therefore provide some comparisons of keyword indexing vs. indexing by topic.",

        "Copies of the item texts, the originally assigned keywords, and protocols of Sauvain's activities during data base indexing, organization, and retrieval were acquired.",
        "We then proceeded to re-index the collection with AUTONOTE2 topic descriptions.",
        "Each of the roughly 400 items in the data base was viewed and described in a sequential fashion; that is, there was no lookahead or pre-planning of topic phrasings to facilitate network structuring.",

        "For brevity, AUTONOTE2 reports of parsing assumptions are excluded.",
        "However, system responses that elicit a user reply are shown to provide a feeling for user interaction under AUTONOTE2.",
        "Indexing activity.",
        "The AUTONOTE2 protocols show a high degree of terse, efficient referencing of previously defined topics.",
        "The communicative efficiency was especially great in instances where several consecutive items were entered on a common topic.",
        "This situation frequently occurred when entering a set of reading notes on a particular paper or collection of papers.",
        "Typically, the first item in such a set of entries was assigned to one or more new topics.",
        "In describing the subsequent items, references to these topics often were conveyed by a single word or phrase, or by a null description (a description line consisting of only a slash is treated as a reference to the topic just mentioned).",
        "To illustrate, consider the materials dealing with various aspects of artificial intelligence.",
        "A total of 17 of these items contained notes taken at a 1968 conference at Case Western Reserve University.",
        "Of the AUTONOTE2 descriptions supplied for these items, three mention only the word CONFERENCE; five include the subphrase 1968 CONFERENCE; two include CWRU CONFERENCE; and seven make no explicit reference to the conference at all.",
        "Each of the items, however, was associated with a topic node linked in dome way to the \"conference\" node.",
        "Furthermore, though none of the descriptions contain the words ARTIFICIAL or INTELLIGENCE, each of the associated items can beaccessed in the network through the \"artificial intelligence\" node.",
        "In the AUTONOTE protocol for these materials, there was frequent use of descriptor abbreviations and other idiosyncratic tags (CWRUAICONF, AI, COGPSY, 90 etc.).",
        "These suggest a strong desire to eliminate repeated entry of lengthy descriptors and phrases.",
        "The major drawback of this strategy, however, is that abbreviations (especially the more uncommon ones) are not as easily remembered as the words they represent.",
        "In addition, once an abbreviation has been used, the user must remember that he has done so in order to maintain consistent indexing.",
        "In contrast, there was little motivation for descriptor abbreviations under the AUTONOTE2 system.",
        "Once a lengthy phrase had been defined in the network there was generally no need to reference it again with a full description.",
        "The Sauvain study identified a clear need for mechanisms to assist the user in maintaining consistent indexing.",
        "The second type of need (how a descriptor has been used) frequently occurs when a text item is being entered.",
        "The user has some ideas for candidate descriptors, suspects that there has been prior usage of these words, and needs a way to check the prior usage to keep his indexing consistent.",
        "He also may want to look at prior usage contexts to get ideas about other descriptors to use, or to weed out candidates that look too general.",
        "The topital view of the data base under AUTONOTE2 eliminates part of this problem.",
        "When describing a new topic the AUTONOTE2 user need not be as concerned about prior word usage in other contexts.",
        "The representational network provides a means for discriminating among the various topics in which a particular word occurs.",
        "If, on the other hand, the user suspects that the item at hand is somehow related to a previously existing topic, there is an analogous need to interrogate the representational network for candidate topics.",
        "This capability is provided by the DESCRIBE command.",
        "There were, in fact, numerous instances in 91 the AUTONOTE2 protocols of network interrogation prior to entering descriptions.",
        "An example is given in Fig. 22.",
        "In response to the user's description",
        "the system indicates that no association will be made with a prior topic.",
        "The user recalls talking about the evaluation of automatic indexing techniques earlier so he requests the system to search further by entering a RELOCATE command.",
        "Two candidates are generated, one of which is the desired referent.",
        "Under the, keyword system, searching for candidate descriptors and usage contexts was much more tedious.",
        "Typically, a RETRIEVE command was issued calling for the display of all keyword lines of items indexed by a particular term or logical combination of terms.",
        "In some cases a large number of items were accessed necessitating time consuming perusal of the data base.",
        "The discussion thus far should convey some feeling for the degree of communicative efficiency achievable with AUTONOTE2.",
        "To provide a more precise 92 indication of this aspect of system performance we calculated the ratio of content words conveyed to content words entered for three samples of data base items (articles and prepositions were excluded).",
        "The average number of AUTONOTE2 words entered and conveyed were compared with the average number of AUTONOTE keywords assigned within each sample (under the keyword system this ratio will always equal one).",
        "The three samples taken were (1) a random sample of 50 items, (2) 41 sequential items, and (3) all items dealing with some aspect of artificial intelligence.",
        "The results of this tabulation are summarized in Fig. 23.",
        "In all three samples more than three content words were conveyed for every two entered, on the average.",
        "The conveyed-entered ratio was lowest for the random sample and highest for the artificial intelligence items.",
        "This is because most of the items dealing with artificial intelligence were entered with a rich global context of topic nodes defined.",
        "The sequential items, on the other hand, were related to several smaller, more localized topic structures.",
        "Consequently, many more of these items were described in full.",
        "The random sample lacked a consistent contextual framework, and consequently had the least communicative efficiency on the average.",
        "Retrieval activity.",
        "We have seen that retrieval activity is an essential part of the indexing and organizational processes.",
        "The protocols show a frequent need to starch for related material and item numbers in the keyword system and a corresponding need for network interrogation prior to description entry under AUTONOTE2.",
        "However, the AUTONOTE2 topic framework eliminates much of the text file perusal so common in the AUTONOTE protocols.",

        "Fig.",
        "23 - A comparison of entered and conveyed content words for three samples of data base items items.",
        "Consequently, there was very little need to examine the text file prior to describing new items or relating them to others in the data base.",
        "A perusal of candidate topics generated by the DESCRIBE command was sufficient in most cases.",
        "The most outstanding improvement during retrieval activity occurred in instances of very general queries.",
        "Under the keyword system a request for all items pertinent to, say, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE or PROBLEM SOLVING will access a large set of items.",
        "Queries of this kind were employed to peruse large segments of the data base relevant to a general topic area--for example, in search of item candidates for a particular grouping.",
        "The important difference between the two systems in this situation is that AUTONOTE gives the user no indication of the subtopics within the general topic area.",
        "The AUTONOTE user essentially has two alternatives: he may display each of the accessed items(optionally suppressing text); or he may further restrict the set of items, with an addi94 additional set of descriptors.",
        "Both options have notable drawbacks.",
        "The first entails time-consuming perusal of the data base.",
        "The second raises a more significant problem.",
        "Which descriptors should be used to restrict the size of the accessed set of items?",
        "Some descriptors may restrict the set too greatly, eliminating relevant material; others may discriminate very little or not at all.",
        "In the absence of system feedback, this discrimination process places a major burden on the user's memory.",
        "The AUTONOTE2 system, on the other hand, provides the user with very meaningful feedback in response to general queries.",
        "Consider, for example, the retrieval protocol presented in Fig. 24.",
        "At each level in the representational network, the user is given an opportunity to choose among several subtopics.",
        "This example very effectively demonstrates a marked improvement over keyword indexing--the ability to discriminate among subsets of material indexed under a common set of general descriptors."
