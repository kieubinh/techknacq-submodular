        "If a predicate calculus representation is used, then efficient deduction requires some algorithm for selecting those clauses which might match the clauses in the deduction rule.",
        "Thus, the pattern matching problem is not avoided, and an efficient deduction algorithm probably will have to have an underlying network pattern similar to ours, although not so visible.",

        "Many of the programs will probably in reality not contain anything else than our chaining rules, variables and patterns, and such system will also require some more or less hidden underlying network to select rules and facts of interest during a certain deduction process.",
