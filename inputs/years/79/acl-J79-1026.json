        "Assuming that semantics must be taken into account in a translation system, there are at least two major classes of intermediate representations to choose from for use in a translation system.",
        "One class of representations is non-linguistic.",
        "In this class syntax is ignored and use is made of various conceptual units and relations (e.g. Schank's conceptual dependency).",
        "Another class of representations is linguistic.",
        "In this class syntax and semantics are combined into a syntacto-semantic representation which is connected to surface structure in a fairly direct fashion (e.g. Montague grammars [1] and Junction Grammar [2]).",
        "We have chosen to test Junction Grammar as the interlingua for a machine-assisted translation project.",
        "The basic concepts of this model of language were developed by Eldon Lytle in the late 1960's, but, as with many theories, it has been under continual development ever since.",
        "For subject-verb-object sentences, junction trees look much like the familiar phrase markers.",
        "Let us then preview the steps of the Junction Grammar translation process using an extremely simple sentence.",
        "Given the English surface string, \"He needs it\", English analysis would produce the junction tree:",
        "Note that the tree has an order independent of the surface word order of the input text.",
        "The function m(x) produces the word sense or sememe of its argument.",
        "The values of this function have been implemented as positive integers called semantic indices.",
        "The plus signs under the categories PV (verbal predicate) and SV (verbal sentence) stand for adjunction, one of the basic types of junction recognized by Junction Grammar.",
        "Suppose we want to synthesize this junction tree into French.",
        "Transfer would adjust this tree because French expresses the meaning of 'need' as 'have need of'.",
        "Then French synthesis would perform lexical selection and ordering to produce the string \"Ila besoin de ca\", or \"Il en a besoin\".",
        "The following chapters will discuss junction trees in more detail and then explain how the analysis, transfer, and synthesis Steps are currently implemented.",
        "The problem with the above junction marker is that it is not clear which that is the relative pronoun.",
        "Following Montague (see also Partie [3] and Gabbay [4]) we could subscript the subjunction operation and the appropriate that with respect to which the modification occurs:",
        "swallows that The above tree would then be lexicalized as sentenc (1).",
        "If we had subscripted just the other that then the marker would be lexicalized not as sentence (1) but rather as: (1A) Every monkey that that swallows gets indigestion.",
        "A readable way of handling such clauses is the method used in Junction Grammar: The proform with respect to which the modification occurs is directly joined to the noun being modified.",
        "Thus the structure takes the place of subscripts.",
        "swallows that The reader will notice that the above diagrams are not normal binary trees, but we call them trees or intersecting trees because they can be drawn as sets of cross-referenced trees.",
        "gestion N * N + V monkey that swallows 9 The following tree illustrates the notational variations of (a) drawing intersecting trees as cross-referenced sets of normal, trees, (b) drawing the junction symbol between the brothers (subordinate nodes) instead of next to the father (superordinate) node, and (c) optionally leaving out the junction symbol when it is adjunction (+).",
        "monkey 1 It is interesting to note that one simple method of generating in a context-free way such intersecting trees as those used in Junction Grammar is to employ context-sensitive rules as node admissability conditions.",
        "This method is essentially in harmony with McCawley's [5] proposal.",
        "For example, the rule A--)0BC allows the well-formed structure A Further, the rule ...------•-■ B C A-,,BC/F G is construed as saying that a subtree with A immediately dominating the sequence BC is a well-formed subtree provided that elsewhere in the tree a node F immediately precedes A and A immediately precedes a node G. Thus, as an example, the following tree is well-formed from the rules indicated.",
        "Though the tree is well-formed if the rules are node admissability conditions, FBCGH cannot be derived from this grammar in a standard rewrite derivation way.",
        "Intersecting trees are of the form: W Z If such production rules were to be used, their form would be: W--XY Such production rules are type 0 and not type 1.",
        "B. Noun Complements.",
        "It is instructive to contrast the above Junction Grammar treatment of relative clauses with its treatment of noun complements.",
        "It would seem that there are serious theoretical problems associated with the phrase structure rules NP-->NP S and S of Transformation Grammar [6].",
        "These rules propose to account for restrictive relative clauses and noun complements, respectively, both embedding an entire sentence to a nominal antecedent, encompassing both constituents with brackets labelled NP.",
        "It seems clear that the two structures in question are in fact related, i.e. in some sense similar, but not in the way suggested by the P-rules proposed to generate them.",
        "Specifically, in each case there seems to be an overlapping of constituents in the main clause with those in the subordinate clause: In the relative clause, an NP of the main clause coincides referentially with an NP of the dependent clause; in the complement, a noun, or potentially, a noun phrase, of the main clause is equated referentially with the entire dependent clause.",
        "Thus sentence (2) is ambiguous over the relative clause and the complement readings.",
        "(Notice that one can replace that with which for the relative clause reading but not for the complement reading.)",
        "There is nothing in the P-rule formulation to make this overlapping of constituents explicit, however.",
        "Hence, a mechanism for checking the coreference of NP's is required so that the relative clause transformation could apply to sentences embedded by NP--,NP S and produce the appropriate relative pronoun.",
        "It is not clear, however, whether this mechanism is supposed to establish a coreference relation between the head N and the complement S in NP--0N S, since no T-rule seems to depend upon such a check.",
        "Moreover, there is no clear justification for using N rather than NP to the right of the arrow in the complement rule, since the head of a complement can have articles and modifiers too.",
        "Still more serious is what appears to be implied by the relative clause rule.",
        "Namely, the entire clause is bracketed with a nominal category (NP), suggesting that it, like the complement, is functioning in its entirety as a nominal constituent.",
        "The structural symmetry of these two rules results in a false generalization (the illusion that both clauses were nominalized) while failing to make explicit the generality which actually exists and is semantically crucial (the referential overlap between constituents in the main and dependent clauses).",
        "What is needed are structural representations which reflect the overlapping of constituents without violating what seem to be the correct categorizations."

        "LET.",
        "One form of LET is used to move around the junction tree.",

        "In the example LET =5 BE Y(A(=3)), the movement is relative to an initial node pointed to by =3.",
        "In this initial address slot we can also use the symbol 'H', which stands for the topmost node of the highest ranking subtree of the junction tree, or '=', which stands for the address of the most recently created node in the tree.",
        "Another form of LET assigns values to condition variables.",
        "When an address variable is assigned to a condition variable (e.g. LET C7 BE =5) , the condition variable receives the semantic index of the node pointed to by the address variable.",
        "Also available in TL is an easily expandable set of built-in functions to perform such tasks as indicating the category of a node, checking for the presence or absence of certain semantic features on a node, or reporting on the structural context of a node.",
        "For example, LET C7 BE INODCAT(=8) sets C7 to a number indicating the category of the node pointed to by =8.",

        "It is proposed that junction schemata of the type illustrated constitute a universal pool of structural patterns available to all languages.",
        "Presumably, most languages use the majority of them but no one language need use them all.",
        "Perhaps no two languages use exactly the same subset, nor any two persons speaking the same language, for that matter.",
        "Languages can be expected to vary in their manner of realizing junction patterns as surface strings.",
        "Specifically, the lexical stock, word order, concord, inflection and conjugation paradigms, etc., are known, for the most part, to be language specific.",
        "Our experience to date supports such expectations.",
        "For example, the basic word order for Japanese can be obtained by shifting the left-right options on subjunction used by English to right-left.",
        "While English uses heterogeneous interjunction freely (\"John passed, which surprised us\", etc.",
        "), Japanese does not; it either uses the corresponding full-subjunction (\"That John passed surprised us\"), or two conjoined sentences (\"John passed, and this surprised us\").",
        "Of course, the lexical stock and morphophonemic patterns of Japanese are radically different from those of English.",
        "But the conclusion we have been forced to repeatedly is that while surface phenomena are vastly disparate from language to language, junction phenomena are more alike than different.",
        "70 While we use the familiar ANALYSIS/TRANSFER/SYNTHESIS scheme as a general framework for our translation system, the design of these components is rigidly governed by the junction grammar model, with junction trees serving as the interlingua.",
        "Analysis, operating in an interactive mode, produces junction trees from the source text.",
        "The data thus obtained is then passed to the transfer segment of the system.",
        "Transfer from a source language A to a target language B begins with inspection of every junction rule and semantic index appearing in the junction trees produced by analysis.",
        "If some rule or semantic index of A does not belong to the subset used by language B, then a transfer subroutine adjusts the junction tree.",
        "The library of A-B transfer subroutines is a partial contrastive grammar of languages A and B.",
        "However, since word order and other lexical phenomena are abstracted away from the semantic component in our model, these do not enter into transfer at all, but are handled independently by lexical synthesis for language B.",
        "The adjusted trees output by transfer are passed to a synthesis program.",
        "The four steps of the synthesis process correspond to four lexical rule types--ordering, matching, ellipsis (or hiatus), and agreement.",
        "Our development group is currently engaged in developing English analysis and transfer-synthesis for translation into Spanish, French, and German, using the University's IBM 360/65.",
        "Our system's dictionaries are largely based on a vocabulary drawn from a data base of materials published for the membership of the",
        "We expert that this prototype will provide a gauge for the utility of various on-line interaction techniques for computer-assisted translation systems and for the feasibility of achieving commercial grade computer-assisted translation via the junction grammar model of language described herein.",
        "Work is also in progress to develop a phonological component of Junction Grammar that accounts for the connection between prosodic features (pitch, amplitude, duration, pause, etc.)",
        "and semantic considerations of sentences."
