        "sentence reiognizer would have to look in order to be compatible with present psycholinguistic knowledge about speech comprehmdma.",
        "The basic premise is that psycholinguistic considerations are of potential interest to computational theories (see, e.g., Scharik(1972)).",
        "Let me begin by summarizing some characteristics of speeci\" processing which we know either from experiments, or which are intuitively clear.",
        "First, there is some evidence that the clause is a unit of processing.",
        "For instance, Caplan(1972) showed that after a clause boundary is passed, the constituent words bf the completed clause are relatively inaccessible, as measured by word recognition latency.",
        "The effect was independent of the serial position of the word for which recognition time was tested.",
        "This suggests that sentences are processed clause by clause, with only the semantic content regularly retained after the clause boundary is passed.",
        "The surface words (and a fortiori the syntactic structure) of the clause would tend to be erased after each clause boundary.",
        "1",
        "Another study supporting the clause as unit of processinf is Abrams & Bever(1969).",
        "These authors found that reaction time to short bursts of noise \"clicks\") superimposed on sentences was longer for clause-final clicks than for clause-initial ones.",
        "This would point to the clause as unit of perception, under the assumption that processing is more intensive towards the end of a perceptual unit, and that reaction time to external stimuli is a valid indicator of the intensity of internal processing.",
        "(For a review of other studies in Support of the clausal processing theory, the reader is referred to Fodor, Bever & Garrett(1974), where arguments are also given for the clause as a decision point across which ambiguities are,normally at least, not carried.)",
        "Secondly, it seems that as we listen to speech, we simultaneously have access to both the syntactic and semantic properties of what we hear.",
        "That is, there appears to be parallel, orocessing, of the syntax and the semantics of a clause.",
        "One finding explained by this assumption is that so-called \"irreversible\" passive sentences like (1) are perceptually no more complex than their active counterparts (the girl piCked the rlower,in this case).",
        "By contrast, 'reversible\" passives like (2) take longer to verify vis-a-vis pictures than the corresponding active sentences (Slobin(1966)).",
        "presumably contains surface words as terminal nodes.",
        "Hence if the syntax were regularly preserved the surface words should remain easily accessible, too.",
        "(1) The flower was picked by the girl.",
        "(irreversible) (2) The boy was kicked by the girl.",
        "(reversible) It appears that the syntactic complexity introduced by the passive construction is somehow circumvented by a predominantly semantic method of analysis in the case of ±reversible passives.2 We thus get a picture of speech processing as in Fig.1.3",
        "Schank(1972), who believes that the function of syntax is \"as a pointer to semantic information rather than as a first step to semantic analysisP(p.555) Similarly, Winograd(1971) allows parallel operation of syntactic and semantic analysis.",
        "However, zne syntactic and semantic processor in Winograd's system have full power, in principle, to question each other about their respective success before proceeding with their part of the analysis.",
        "This powerful device has been severely restricted in the theory described here (for details, see Reimold(forthcoming)).",
        "The main reasons for this are the greater reliance, in my theory, on \"syntax-free\" semantic interpretation, and the generally shorter lifespan of syntactic structure (see the discussion of \"peripheral clauses\" below).",
        "Woods (1973) also discusses a system with certain facilities for parallel processing, for instance, the \"Selective Modifier Placement\" facility (SMP).",
        "The humtion of SNIP is to select from the list of syntactically admissible alternatives the one which is semantically most appropriate,, and return only that alternative to the parser before going on to analyze the rest of the sentence.",
        "The most important difference between Woods' proposal and the one presented here is that his semantic processor only chootes among gyntqmttcalrly structured, alternatives (and, in that sense, is a fully syntax-sensitve method), whereas my theory pcertulates no svntactic link, betmeen aich modifiers and their heads.",
        "7 Let me return now to the principle of clause-by-clause processing.",
        "If WA assume that \"immediate processing\" takes place in short term memory, then we must automatically require that the unit of processing must not exceed the known Limits of short term memory.",
        "Now since that limit is generally taken to be about 5 words, the clause-by-clause principle cannot be literally true.",
        "For instance, (3) lists some \"clauses\" longer than 5 words.",
        "It seems to me, therefore, that we have to revise the traditional concept of clause.",
        "(3)a) John and Bill and Otto stroked and hugged the goat ana the goose.",
        "b) The man with the dog with the collar, with the bell .",
        "• • laughed.",
        "c) John met his friends yeaterdav mornina around ten o'clock i .a little cafe near D.uvuuwax.",
        "I propose to take the underlined phrases in (3) out of the sentence proper and process them as if they were separate clauses.",
        "That is, I draw a distinction between the \"nuclear\" clause and \"peripheral\" clauses.",
        "The non-underlined 'portions in (3) are nuclear clauses.",
        "Peripheral clauses includes Prep-clauses (\"with the collar\"), Comparison-clauses (\"than the old colonel\"), Post-clauses (\"yesterday,\" \"around ten o'clock, 'in a little cafe\"), and Coordinate-clauses (\"and Bill,\" \"and hugged\").",
        "8 This treatment of certain phrases as peripheral clauses seems plausible too, if we consider that \"adnominal\" Prep-phrases, for instance, are semantically like relative clauses, as shown in (4), and that adverbs are parallel to certain \"adverbial\" clauses, as indicated in (5).",
        "(4) A girl f with a green hat greeted John.",
        "who wore a green hat .",
        "I 5) John ate the cake afterwards .",
        "after the guests left.",
        "Evidently, with .a green hat in (4) is related to who wore a green hat, and the adverb afterwards in (5) can be replaced by full adverbial clauses like AftIrtIg_zlesaltft.",
        "We are presently testing the validity of this notion of peripheral clause.",
        "We use sentence pairs like (6a-b): (6a) The officer threatened to give the woman * a +icket.",
        "(cicsmeinternal position of click ii*Is ) (6b) The officer threatened to fine the woman * without • a license.",
        "(clause-final position of click \"*\") Our goal is to determine, using a 14click detectiontparadigm, whether or not there is a \"clause boundary effect\" before the final peripheral clause without a license, in (6b).",
        "Notice that according to my hypothesis, there, is a clause boundary after woman in (6b), but not in (6a).",
        "It has been shown in a number of studies that clause boundaries (but not phrase boundaries, in general) have certain measurable behavioral effects (of.",
        "the",
        "review in Fodor, Bever & Garrett(1974)); so this should apply here too, if peripheral clauses are indeed psychologically real clauses.",
        "'Now, the last principle•I want to discuss is that in understanding an utterance, people make creative use of their knowledge about the world .41' For instance, if I only hear you say",
        "(7) The cat just caught a I can immediately guess that the last word was something like tirsi or molls.",
        "Similarly, if you says (8) Put the freezer in the turkey.",
        "I know that you really meant \"put the turkey in the freezer,\" Li'This general point has been made, in one fort pr another, by many authors.",
        "For instance, Winograd(1971) notes that correct understanding of they in \"The city councilmen refused to give the women a permit for a demonstration because they, feared violence° and \"The city coundlmen refused to give the women a permit for a demonstration because they advocated revolution\" needs the \"information and reasoning power to realize that city councilmen are usually staunch advocates of law and order, boat are hardly likely to be revolutionaries.\"(p.11) Similarly, Schank(19:72) envisages a theory of natural language understanding which,\"has a conceptual base that consists of a formal structure\" and \"can make predictions on the basis of this conceptual structure\"(p.556) The principal differences between these approaches and mine have to do with (1) the arm of the stored semantic information (PLANNER and \"conceptual case network\" representations vs, predicate calculus representations) and (2) the proposed =mu mechanigml to this information.",
        "Schank's theory relies on lexical decomposition, while I use the \"meaning postulates\" method.",
        "Winograd opts for a broad procedural approach, representing \"knowledge in the form of proceuures rather than tables of rules or lists of patterns.\"(p.21) By contrast, my proposal remains closer to the traditional \"declarative\" approach, as will become clear"
