        "This paper describes a linguistically-based recognition grammar model, which was developed as part of a Computer-Aided Instruction Project, to the tasks of recognizing and analyzing a variety of basic sentence types in English.",
        "Ways of extending the model to the analysis of complex sentences are also suggested.",
        "The procedures and the model described herein _are original; however, they owe much to insights found in the work of two linguists, Gruber and Fillmore.",
        "The general problem of grammar recognition is that of going from a surface string of words to a deep representatLon that permits semantic interpretation.",
        "More specifically, our grammar recognition procedure depends on the identification of the precise function or semantic role that each noun phrase actant occurring in a given sentence exhibits with respect to the verb of that sentence.",
        "By assigning verbs -- or, to be more precise, verb senses-to one or more paradigms (i.e., perceptually and functionally defined surface configurations), it becomes possible to determine algorithmically for every sentence the functional relation (e.g., theme, causal actant, goal, source, locus) that each noun phrase in the sentence bears to the verb, thereby assisting greatly In",
        "arriving at a representation of the meaning of each sentence.",
        "A nubber of verb paradigms such as intransitive, transitive and ergative are defined.",
        "Verbs belonging to the intransitive paradigm such as die, fall, go, etc.",
        "always have subjects that function as themes.",
        "Verbs belonging to the transitive paradigm such as kill, read, eat, etc.",
        "have subjects that function as causal actants and objects that function as themes.",
        "The ergative paradigm, which is more complex, consists of change-of-state verbs such as open, melt, increase, etc.",
        "If an ergative paradigm verb has both a subject and.",
        "an object, the subject is a causal actant and the object is a theme; however; if such a verb takes only a subject, then the subject functions as a theme.",
        "The paradigm membership of each verb sense in the data base is determined and is recorded as a lexical feature of that verb.",
        "The number of verb paradigms would proliferate almost indefinitely were it not for several devices, built into the grammar.",
        "One of these devices is the reversal of transformations such as passive and interrogative so that subject and object functional relations remain the same as in active, declarative sentences Another such device is the ElsamEulLmna2115Altasimnsim such as the one occurring in a sentence like \"John ate.\"",
        "In this case, an indefinite object is reconstructed and the transitive paradigm feature of the verb eat remains intact.",
        "A third device of this nature is use of a notion called incorpor.ation.",
        "For example, a sentence sdch as \"It is raining.\"",
        "will be analyzed as having incorporated the theme subject rain' into 4 the verb with the result that a more abstract structure resembring \"Rain is falling\" gets reconstructed and processed as an intransitive verb paradigm item.",
        "To overview the entire procedure, we start by paratng the surface structure of any given sentence.",
        "The major constituents and parts of speech are identified.",
        "Next, we determine the type of sentence involved (i.e., declarative, interrogative, imperative) and transform the word order where necessary.",
        "Following that the form of the verb (i.e., voice and tense) is identified and again the word order is transformed if need be.",
        "A surface role (t.e., subject, object) is then assigned to each noun phrase not preceded by a preposition.",
        "At this time the lexical entry of the verb is consulted for features of movement, deletion, incorporation, etc.",
        "so that any necessary final adjustments can be made.",
        "The paradigm membership of the verb is then identified thereby permitting a predetermined heuristic to assign a relation (i.e., theme, causal actant, locative, etc.)",
        "Eo every noun phrase in the sentence.",
        "Finally, by applying the above information as well as other lexical and grammatical information the surface structure is transformed into an appropriate abstract structure that permits semantic interpretation"

        "For a number of years in the early 1970.'8 the U.S. Air Force sponsored research at System Development Corporation in the application of natural language processing techniques to computer-aided instruction (CAI).",
        "The purpose of this research was to increase the overall effectiveness of CAI as an instructional method, with particular emphasis on extending the student computer interface to permit student-generated free form responses and queries.",
        "The research included experiments with a deductive question-answering system designed for use In CAI, the modeling of the behavior of a hypothetical tutor, and lastly the computer evaluation of constructed student responses, and a question-answering system driven by a dynamic model of the CAI lesson content.",
        "The subject matter used in the project was introductory meteorology -- specifically concepts relating to the nature of precipitation.",
        "One of the goals of this Computer-Aided Instruction Project was' the development of an efficient recognition grammar that is as simple and realistic as possible without sacrificing, information critical to semantic interpretation The primary purpose of this grammar was the analysis of student responses phrased in natural English a necessary step in the answer-evaluation process.",
        "This paper describes in a general way the grammar recognition model developed As part of the CAI Project.",
        "The model developed was based on the assumption that recognition grammars should be constructed quite differently from production grammars (i.e., they are something other than mere inverse algorithms of production grammars and involve certain questions of heuristics that are not of concern in the consttuct-ion of production grammars); therefore an attempt was made to develop a unique model specifically oriented to recognition tasks.1 1 The author is not a computer programmer but an applied linguist, who collaborated on a grammar recognition model for the computer-aided instructiom project wieh a team of oomputer programmers and specialists in artificial intelligence that included William J. Schoene, John S. Brown and Robert F. Simmons,, and the author is greatly indebted to these colleagues for their assistance.",
        "Questions concerning the details of actual programs and routines implemented should therefore be addressed to one of these specialists rather than the author, who served the project in a not-technical capacity as a linguist.",
        "At the time this CAI project was undertaken two of the most successful recognition grammars that had been constructed wer' the IBM \"Automated Recognition Grammar for English,\" of Guli-cover, et al.",
        "(1969), and the work done Bt MIT on Project MAC, which is described in Winograd (1971).",
        "The Culicover recognitio grammar is based largely on the generative-transformational work of Chonisky (1965) and others, and 'is a highly complex mechanism that attempts ta capture the insights of Chomsky's generative-transformational model from the recognition grammar point of view.",
        "Winograd's highly pragmatic recognition procedures, on the other hand, make use of a systemic-type of grammar a la Halliday (1961, 1966, 1967); however, the power of Winograd's system is much more in his limited wor11-model and semantic networks than in his grammar.",
        "Rather than produce an imitation o either the IBM Recognition Grammar or the MIT Project -- it is, in fact, possible that neither of these approaches will ultithately be the most useful one for recognition purposes – we tried to reexamine recent insights, especially Fillmore's Deep Case Hypothesis (1968b), Chafe's semantically-based grammar (1970), and Gruber's work on the Lexicon (1965, 1967) in order to see how the functions and co-occurrence relations.",
        "they describe .might best be incorporated into a recognition grammar without sacrificing the positional insights that much of Chomsky's work has made explicit.",
        "In retrospect, eur greatest debt was to Gruber (1965) This re search was, of necessity, carrzed out somewhat independent of the 9 lingtistLc descriptions presented by these authors since they typically endeavor to remain neutral with respect to questions of production and recognition in their work."

        "The problem we faced is, in general terms, the following: Given (more or less) accurate parsings of students' responses, how do we, as simply as possible, automate the reconstruction of deeper, more abstract message representations that permit us to make reasonable semantic interpretations?",
        "This paper outlines the essentials of our solution to this problem.",
        "The solution is described in terms of the surface structures and deep representations of simple sentences because it is easiest to understand and evaluate the solution at this level.",

        "as simple sentences are concerned, and complex sentences can also be handled, given certain modifications that will be discusSed briefly in the following sections.",
        "57 Extension of the S stem to C lex Sentences It would be impossible to review all our procedures concerning complex sentence types in English; thus we shall merely exemplify our techniques focusing mainly on infinitival -- and marginally on gerundive -- sentential a1ements in the process.",
        "Embedded sentences typically contain a number of optional and obligatory surface deletions 'ihich must be recovered.",
        "Reconstructions involve those subjectless predicates that are a result of deletion transformations taking place as part of the embedding process.",
        "For the sake of comparison, we have provided in (106) stences which have undergone subject deletions or movements of this type, and sentences in (107) which have not.",
        "Note that in all of the above cases, when the lower sentence loses its subject through either movement ar deletion, the lower predicate becomes infinitivalized.16 From the tecognition point of view these movements and deletions must be reversed if we wish to reconstruct the subject is,nd predicate of lower sentences accurately.",
        "The first step in our procedure is the application of the rule stated in (108b) since this will identify subjectless predicates, this permitting the rules to build tentative deep structures.",
        "16It should also be pointed out that gerundivization as wel as infinitivalization can result from either of these operations (e.g., John began running; I like playing volleyball, etc.)",
        "17T4e are tentatively inserting a deleted 'for /\\ ' in all such cases; however, this is a simplication which may eventually turn out to be infelicitous (i.e., in some cases it may not be necessary to insert a 'for').",
        "The next thing we must do is.",
        "classify verbs in such a way that we can correctly fall the deltas in all of the above struc.tures.",
        "Thus instead of describing a verb as a 'subject-subject deletion' verb (109), we will describe it as a 'copy subject' verb-(113), so we know that the higher subject must be copied onto the delta in the embedded sentence in order for the syntactic deep structure to be complete and accurate.",
        "The following table shows how the features in our recognition grammar correspond to the features that might be used in a generative grammar.",
        "There is, however, one transformation which must take place before the analysis of embeddings begins, and this is the 'passive-to-active' transformation.",
        "Thus a sentence such as (117) is first changed to (118) before the embedding procedures are effec ted.",
        "(117) John was told to leave.",
        "(118) told John to leave.",
        "If this transformation were not carried out, all features of object-embedding.",
        "verbs would have to be re-analyzed in the passive as follows:",
        "specifications, it seems quite unnecessary in light of the fact that de-passivization must, in any case, be done before the appropriate paradigm heuristic applies; thus it can easily be carried out before embedding procedures apply as well.",
        "Paradigm analysis then begins with the lowest (i.e. most embedded) sentence in the tree and moves up with the result that an entire embedded sentence (via an intermeaiate NP node) is functioning as theme or causal actant in a higher sentence.",
        "The procedures outlined above for dealing with certain types of complex sentences – however partial and sketchy do indicate that it is possible to extend the verb paradigm recognition technique to complex sentences, i.e., its use is not limited to simple sentences.",
        "64 Concluding Statement Although many details have been omitted from this paper, we believe that such an approach is as linguistically and psychologically valid as other theoretical or pragmatic recognition procedures developed to date.18 Innovations in linguistics and psycholinguistics such as Bever and Langendoen's use of \"perceptual strategies,\" which explain as well as account for certain 18 In addition to the automated IBM Recognition Grammar of Culicover, et al.",
        "(1969) and Winograd's work at MIT on Project MAC (1971), both of which we mentioned in the introduction, there is, of course, also the Halle-Stevens \"Analysis-by-synthesip\" model (1964), which must be considered as a candidate for a recognition-grammar model theoretically -- even though Halle and Stevens were concerned with speech recognition per se.",
        "Although we can see that the \"Analysis-by-synthesis\" model is useful in explaining hallucinatory reconstruction of speech and related phenomena, we feel that neither their fully active model (nor a fully passive model for that matter) will prove to recon-s,..ruct accurately the complexities of normal human speech perception or to explain human language recognition and comprehension.",
        "facts of historical syntax (1972), tend to confirm our working assumption, which is that there are perceptual cues in the surface structure of English that are critical in grammatical recognition.",
        "We hypothesize that these perceptual cues, when combined with lexical information and information regarding the patterned movements and deletions that take place in syntactic configUrations (i.e., paradigms, transformations and incorporations) make up much of the \"knowledge\" that the speaker of a language gradually acquires and then uses in recognizing and understanding the sentences of his native language (or any language tie learns and knows, for that matter).",
        "We are convinced that this knowledge overlaps with, yet is somehow,different from, the knowledge and skills that are required if one wishes to produce grammatical sentences in a language.",
        "Kelley (1968), fiar example, has postulated that comprehension is basic in language acquisition and that rules of production are not essential for comprehension but may develop alongside of the necessary comprehension rules to satisfy other goals and purposes.",
        "If Kelley's model is correct, it indicates that human recognition grammars -- an essential component of comprehension -- are,not mere inverses of human production grammars.",
        "This, in turn, suggests that the most efficient computer-based recognition procedures will be based, not exclusively on generative production-type grammars, but also on principles and 66 rules similar to those that human beings would seem to employ expressly in language recognition ana limmprehension.",
        "On the othex hand, the model also suggests that the most realistic recognition procedure will overlap to a considerable extent with a production-type grammar -- utilizing, in different ways, a great deal of the same information.",
        "In the development of our recognition model, such psycholinguistic considerations proved to be Most useful."
