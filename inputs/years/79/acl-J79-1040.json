        "I shall return later to this metaphor of generations, but what is one to say in general terms of a field where yesterday's brightest spots are today's first generation systems, even though they have not been criticised in print, nor shown in any generally acceptable way to be fundamentally wrong?",
        "Part of the answer lies in the profound role of fashion in Artificial Intelligence in its present pre-scientific phase.",
        "A cynical American professor 'remarked recently that Artificial Intelligence/ (AI) had an affair with someone's work every year or two, and that, just as there were no reasons for falling in love, so, later, there were no reasons for falling out again.",
        "In the case of Winograd's work it is important now to resist this fashion, and re-emphasize what a good piece of research it was, as I shall inâ€¢ a moment.",
        "Another part of the answer lies,in the still fundamental role of metaphysical criticism in AI.",
        "In the field of computer vision things are bad enough, in that anybody who can see feels entitled to criticise a system, on the ground that he is sure he does not see using such and suct principles.",
        "In the field of natural language understanding things are worse: not only does anyone who can speak and write feel free to criticise on the correspandina grounds, but in addition there are those trained in disciplines parasitic upon natural language, linguists and logicians, who often know in addition how things MUST BE DONE on a priori grounds.",
        "It is this metaphysical aspect of the subject that gives its disputes their characteristically acrimonious",
        "claims being made.",
        "If what follows seems unduly philosophical, it should be remembered that Little is agreed, and almost no achievements are beyond question.",
        "To pretend otherwise, by concentrating only un the details,of established programs, would be meretricious and misleading.",
        "To survey an energetic field like this one is inevitably to leave a great deal of excellent work unexamined, at least if one is going to do more than give a paragraph to each research project.",

        "During this year both have produced sketches for a representation of knowledge on a larger scale than any discussed in this survey: roughly speaking, they have each produced A scheme foi a whole story.",
        "The value and function of such a larger-scale representation is much under discussion at the moment, b!t none of it invalidates what is contained here, except for some qualification to the position of Schank which is noted under the heading \"Centrality\" in section 6.",
        "The exclusions under (2) above are particularly unfair to the work in the unpublished theses of Rieger 11974) and McDermott (1974), and can only be justified, like those of sections (5) and (6) above, by space, bias and the considerations advanced in a later section of this survey concerning what it is for AI research to he about natural language, rather than about something else, like human psychology, or logic, .or the bargaining behaviour of children under stress.",
        "One final remark about the style of this survey.",
        "I have not indulged the normal critical luxury of careful and extensive quotation from authors followed by detailed and meticulous criticism.",
        "That would be wholly inappropriate in the present state of things.",

        "Cheap self-contradictions and changes of mind are all too easy to find, so criticism and omparisons are best drawn with a very broad brush and a light stroke."

        "Indeed, it might be argued that, in a sense, and as regards its semantics, Winograd's system is not about natural language at all, but about the technical question of how goals and sub-goals are to be organised in a problem-solving system capable of manipulating simple physical objects.",

        "Winograd has certainly not 15 committed himself to any such extreme, position'.",
        "It is interesting to notice that Woods' is, in virtue of his strong position on truth conditions, probably the only piece of work in the firld of Al and natural language to satisfy Hayes' (1974) recent demand* that to be 'intellectually respectable' a knowledge system must have natural model theoretic semantics, in Tarski's sense.",
        "Since no-one has ever given precise truth conditions for any interesting piece of discourse, such as, say, Woods' own papers, one might claim that his theoretical presuppositions necessarily limit his work to the analysis of micro-worlds (as distinct from everyday language).",

        "Of course, Winograd is free to concentrate on any micro-world he wishes, and all I am drawing attention to here is the danger of assuming that natural language is normally about real world procedures and, worse still, the implicit making of the assumption that we cannot understand discourse about a procedure unless we can do it ourselves.",
        "I am not saying that Winograd is making this evidently that the rhetoric surrounding the application of the slogan to his system may cause the unwary to do so.",
        "There is quite a different and low-level problem about the equivalence of Woods' and Winograd's systems, if we consider what we might call the received common-sense view of their work.",

        "4.",
        "Some More General Background Issues",
        "Winograd's work is a central example of the 'Artificial Intelligence paradigm of language', using 'paradigm' in Kuhn's (1970) sense of a large scale revision in systematic thinking, where the paradigm revised is the 'generative paradigm' of the Chomskyan linguists (Chomsky 1957).",
        "From the AI pointof view, the generative linguistic work of the last fifteen years has three principal defects.",
        "Firstly, the generation of sentences, with whatever attached structures, is not in any interesting sense a demonstration of human understanding, nor is the separation of the well-formed from the ill-formed, by such methods for understanding requires, at the very least, both the generation of sentences as parts of coherent discourse and some attempt to interpret, rather than merely reject, what seem to be ill-formed utterances.",
        "Neither the transformational grammarians following Chomsky, nor their successors the generative semanticists (Lakoff 1971), have ever.eXplicitly renounced the generative paradigm.",
        "Secondly, Chomsky's distinction between performance and competence models, and his advocacy of the latter, have isolated modern generative linguistics from any effective test of the systems of rules it proposes.",
        "Whether or not the distinction was intended to have this effect, it has meant that any test situation necessarily involves performance, which is considered outside the province of serious linguistic study.",
        "And any embodiment of a system of rules in a computer, and assessment of its out puts would be performance.",
        "AI, too, is much concerned with the structure of linguistic processes, independent of any particular implementation,\"",
        "** Vide: \"Artificial Intelligence is the study of intellectual mechanisms apart from applications and apart from how such mechanisms are realised in the human or in animals.\"",
        "(McCarthy 1974)",
        "17 but implementation is never excluded, as it is from competence models, but rather encouraged.",
        "Thirdly, as I mentioned before, there was until recently rio place in the generative paradigm for inferences from facts and inductive generalisations, even though very simple examples demonstrate the need for it.",
        "This last point, about the shortcomings of conventional linguistics is not at all new, and in AI is at least as old as Minsky's (1968,p.22) observation that in 'He put the box on the table.",
        "Because it wasn't level, it slid off', the last 'it' can only be referred correctly to the box, rather than the table, on the basis of some knowledge quite other than that in a conventional, and implausible, linguistic solution such as the creation of a class of 'level nouns' so that a box would not be considered as being or not being level.",
        "These points would be generally conceded by those who believe there is 'an AI paradigm of language understanding, but there wdUld be far less agreement over the poslitive content of the paradigm.",

        "On the other hand, there are many, almost certainly a majority, who argue that more is required, in that the methods and representations of knowledge by which the performance is achieved must be of the right formal sort, and that mere performance based on ad hoc methods does not demonstrate understanding.",

        "To understand what was meant when Winograd contrasted his own with what he called second generation systems, we have to remember, as always in this subject, that the generations are of fashion, not chronology or inheritance ad ideas.",
        "He des/bribed the work of Simmons, Schenk and myself among others in his sur'ey of new approaches, even though the foundations and terminology of those approaches were set out in print in 1966, 198 and 1967 respectively.",
        "What those approaches, and others have in common is the belie.",
        "that understanding systems must be able to manipulate very complex linguistic objects, or semantic structures, and that no simplistic approaches to understanding language with computers will work.",
        "19 In a very influential recent paper, Minsky (1974) has drawn together strands in the work of Charniak (1972) and the authors above using a terminology of 'frames': \"A frame is a data-structure for representing a stereotype situation, like a certain kind of living room, or going to a children's birthday party.",
        "Attached to each frame are several kinds of information.",
        "Some of this is information about how to use the frame.",
        "Some is about what ene can expect to happen next.",
        "Some is about what to do if these expectations are not confirmed.",
        "We can think of a frame as a network of nodes and relations.",
        "The top levels of a frame are fixed and represent things that are always true about the supposed situation.",
        "The lower levels have many terminals 'slots' that must be filled by specific instances or data.",
        "Each terminal can specify conditions its assignments must meet ....",
        "Simple conditions are specified by markers that might require a terminal assignment to be a person, an object of sufficient value, etc....\" The key point about, such struotures is that they attempt to specify in advance what is going to be said, and how the world encountered is going to be structured.",
        "The structures, and the inference rules that apply to them, are also expressions of 'partial information' (in McCarthy's phrase) that are not present in first generation systems.",
        "As I showed earlier, with the 'women and soldiers' example, such loose inductive information, seeking confirmation from the surrounding context, is required for very simple sentences.",
        "In psychological and visual terms, frame approaches envisage an understander as at least as much a looker aI a seer.",
        "Thus, we might, very tentatively, begin by identifyb:g what Winograd called 'second generation' approaches with those making use of very general notions akin to what Minsky called 'frames'.",
        "But this is no more than a temporary device, for convenient initial classification of the field, because later we shall have reason to question the first-second generation distinction, and, as noted earlier, Minsky's notion of 'frame' is itself a highly fluid one in the process of definition and refinement.",
        "Let us now turn briefly to five approaches that might be called second generation.",
        "20 Charniak The new work which owes most to Minsky's advocacy is Charniak's.",
        "He' studied what sorts of inferential information Charniak '72, '73, '74) would be needed to resolve pronoun ambiguities in children's stories, and in that sense to understand them.",
        "One, of his example 'stories' is: 'Jane was invited to Jack's birt4day party.",
        "She wondered if he would like a kite.",
        "A friend told Jane that Jack already had a kite, and that he would make her take it back The protlem concerns, the penultimate word 'it', and deciding whether it refers to the first kite mentioned or the second.",
        "Charniak's analysis begins by pointing out that a great deal of what is required to understand that story is implicit: knowledge about the giving of presents, knowledge that if one possesses one of a certain sort of thing then one may well not want another, amdâ€¢so on.",
        "Charniak's system does not actually run as a program, but is a theoretical structure of rules called 'demons' that correspond roughly to what Minsky later called frames.",
        "A demon for this example would be, 'If we see that a person might not like a present X, then look for X being returned to the store where it was bought.",
        "If we see that happening, or even being suggested, assert that the reason why is that P does not like X'.",
        "The important words there are 'look for', which suggest that there may well be confirming hints to be found in the story and, if there are, then this tentative, partial, inference is correct, and we have a definite and correct answer.",
        "This approach, of using partial (not necessarily true) inferences, in order to assert a definite answer, is highly characteristic of 'second generation' systems.",
        "The demons are, as with Winogram's work, expressed in a procedural language which, on running, will seek for a succession of interrelated 'goals'.",
        "Here, for example, is a demon concerned with another story, about a child's piggy bank (PB) and a child shaking it, looking for money but hearing no sound.",
        "The demon, PB-OUT-OF, is formalised as:",
        "Again, it is not necessary to explain the notation in detail to see that conditions are being stated for the contents of a piggy bank having been emptied.",
        "The pattern being sought by the demon in operation is the third line.",
        "If a chain of demons can 'reach' one of the possible referents in a story then there is a success registered and the ambiguity of the corresponding pronoun is resolved.",
        "It can be seen that the information encoded in the system is of a highly specific sort - in the present case it is not about containers as such, and how to get their contents out, but about Piggy Banks in particular, and everything relies on that particular knowledge having been put in.",
        "Not all the knowledge is of this general sort: in a recent paper (Charniak '74) where the 'kite' story is reconsidered there are rules of considerable generality and interest.",
        "One such is that Charniak calls a R+SSA rule: \"If the story gives information which would make it plausible to infer that PERSON is favourably inclined towards action A, and PERSON does Spa significant subaction (SSA) of A, then infer that PERSON is doing A"

'73) may reasonably be considered a further implementation of Simmons' methods.",

        "Each exposition of the system recounts its preceding phrases, from the original primitive-free one, through to the present causal inference form; rather as each human foetus is said to relive in the womb all the evolutionary stages of the human race.",
        "The only trouble with this, from an outsider's point of view, is that at each stage the representation has been claimed, to be the correct one, while at the same time Schank admits, in moments of candor (Schank '73), that there is no slid to the conceptual diagraMming of a sentence.",
        "This difficulty may well reflect genuine problems in language itself, and, in its &cutest form concerns a three-way confusion between an attractive notation for displaying the 'meanings of words', the course of events in the real world, and, finally, dttual procedures for analysis to be based on the diagrams.",
        "This raises the, to me, important question of the application of a semantic system, that I shall touch on again later.",
        "Schank, for example, does mention in passing the questions of word-sense ambiguity, and the awful ambiguity of English prepositions, but there are in no way central for him, and he assumes that with the availability of 'the correct representation', his system when implemented must inevitably solve th%se traditional ant vexing questions.",
        "No procedures are hinted at along with the graphs as to how thus is to be done.",
        "A distinction ,of importance may be becoming ap32 parent here-between Schank s work and Rieger's: in Rieger's thesis (Rieger 474) the rules of inference appear to create separate and new subgraphs wnicn may stand in an inferential relation to each other so as to produce conclusions about problems of, Say, pronoun reference, etc.",
        "BUt in Schank's corresponding papers the same inferences are not applied _to actual problems (Schank '74a) but only serve to complexify the conceptual graphs yet further.",
        "Closely connected with this matter is the question of the survival of the surface structure in the diagrams.",
        "Until very recently primitivis-ation applied only to verbs, that of nouns being left to Weber (Weber 1.770 Most recently, though, noun words have been disappearing from diagraps and been replaced by â€¢categories such as *PHYSOBS* But it is clear that the surface is only slowly disappearing, rather than having been abhorred all along.",
        "In a more recent publication (Schenk '74b) there are signs that this trend of infinitely proliferating diagrams (for individual sentences) is reversing.",
        "In it Schank considers the application of his approach to the representation of text, and concl..des, correctly in my 1,4ew, that the representations of parts of the text must be interconnected, by causal arrows, and that, in, order to preserve 11â€¢.cidity, the conceptual diagrams for individual sentences and their part.",
        "; must be abbreviated., as by triples such as POEPLE PTRANS PEOPLE.",
        "Herr indeed, the surface simply has to survive in the representation unless one is prepared to commit oneself to the extreme view that the ordering of sentences in a text is a purely superficial and arbitrary matter.",
        "The rensâ€¢ in which this is a welcome reversal of a trend should be clear, because in the 'causation inference' development, mentioned earlier, all the consequences and effects of a conceptualization had to be drawn within itself.",
        "Thus, in the extreme case, each sentence of a text should have been represented by a diagram containing most or all of the text of which it was a part.",
        "Thus the representation of a text would have been impossible on such principles.",
        "Wilks My own system constructs a semantic representation for small natural language texts: the basic representation is applied directly to the text and can then be 'massaged' by various forms of inference to become as deep 33 as is necessary for well defined tasks demonstrating understanding.",
        "It is a uniform representation, in that information that might tonvenionalll be considerea as syntactic, semantic, factual or inferential Ls well expressed within a single type of struogaire.",
        "The fundamental unit in the construction of this Meaning representation is the template, which is intended to correspond to an intuitive notion of a basic message of agent-action-object form.",
        "Templates are rigid format networks of more basic building blocks called formulas, which correspond to senses of individual words.",
        "In order to construct a complete text representation templates are bound together by two kinds of higher level structures called paraplates and inference rules.",
        "The templates themselves are built up as the construction of the representation proceeds, but the, formulas, paraplates and inference rules are all present in the system.",
        "at the outset and each of these three types of pre-stored structure is ultimately constructed from an inventory of eighty semantic primitive elements, and from functions and predicates ranging over those elements.",
        "The system runs on-line as a package of LISP, MLISP and MLISP2 programs, taking as input small paragraphs of English, that can be made up by the user from a vocabulary of about 600 word senses, and producing a good French translation as output.",
        "This environment provides a pretty clear test of llnguage understanding, because French translations for everyday.",
        "prose are either right or wrong, and can be seen to be so, while at the same time, the major difficulties of understanding programs - word sense ambiguity, case ambiguity, difficult pronoun reference, etc.",
        "- can all be represented within a machine translation environment by, for example, choosing the words of the input sentence containing a pronoun reference difficulty so that the possible alternative references have different genders in French.",
        "In that way the French output makes quite clear whether or not the program has made the correct inferences in order to understand what it is translating.",
        "The program is reasonably robust in actual performance, and will even tolerate a certain amount of bad grammar in the input, since it does not perform a syntax analysis in-the conventional sense, but.seeks message forms representable to the semantic structures employed.",
        "34 Typical input would be a sentence such as 'John lives out of town and drinks his wine out of a bottle.",
        "He then throws the bottles out of the Jolatow.",
        "Als-pitogalam 411 predwier Pieneh eentenoos with dift*ramlcutput for each of the three occurrences of 'out of', since it realises that they function quite differently on the three occasions of use, and that the difference must be reflected in the French.",
        "A sentence such as 'Give the monkeys bananas although they are not ripe because they are very hunÂ§r1â€¢ produces a translation with different equivalents for the two occurrences of 'they', because the system correctly realises, from, what I shall describe below aS preference considerations, that the, most sensible interpretation is one in which the first 'they' refers to the bananas and the second to the monkeys, .and bananas and monkeysihave different genders in French.",
        "These two examploe are dealt with in the 'basic mode' of the system.",
        "(Wilks 73a) In many cases it cannot resolve pronoun ambiguities by the sort of straightforward 'preference considerations' used in the last example, where, roughly speaking, 'ripeness' prefers to be-predicated of plantlike things, and hunger of animate things.",
        "Even in a sentence as simple as 'John drank the wine on the table and it was good', such considerations arse inadequate to resolve the ambiguity of 'it' between wine and table, since both may be good things.",
        "In such cases, of inability to resolve within its basic mode, the program deepens the representation of the text so as to try and set up chains of inference that will reach, and so prefer, only one of the possible referents.",
        "I will return to these processes in a moment, but first I shall give some brief description of the basic representation set up for English.",
        "For each sense of a word in its dictionary the program sees a fo2mula.",
        "This is a tree structure of semantic primitives, and is to be interpreted formally using dependency relations.",
        "The main element in any formula is the rightmost, called its head, and that is the fundamental category to which the formula belongs.",
        "In the formulas for actions, for example, the head will always be one of the primitives PICK, CAUSE, CHANGE, FEEL, HAVE, PLEASE, PAIR, SENSE, USE, WANT, TELL, BE, DO, FORCE, MOVE, WRAP, THINK/ FLOW, MAKE/ DROP, STRIK, FUNC or HAPN.",
        "35 Here is the tree structure for theâ€¢ action of drinking: OBJE) (SELF IN) (MOVE CAUSE) Once again, it is npt necessary to explain the formalism in any detail, to see that this sense of 'drink' is being expressed as a causing to move a liquid object (FLOW STUFF) by an animate agent, into that same agent (containment case indicated by IN, and formula syntax identifies SELF with the agent) and via (direction case) an aperture (THRU PART) of the agent.",
        "Template structures, which actually represent sentences and their parts are built up as networks of formulas like the one above.",
        "Templates always consist of an agent node, and action node and an object node, and other nodes t%at may depend on these.",
        "So, in building a template for 'John drinks,wine', the whole of the above tree-formula for 'drinks' would be placed at the central action node, another tree structure for 'John' at the agent node and so on.",
        "The complexity of the system comes from the way in which the formulas, considered as active entities, dictate how other places in the same template should be filled.",
        "Thus, the 'drink' formula above can be thought of as an entity that fits at a template action node, and seeks a liquid object, that is 'to say a formula with (FLAW STUFF) as its rightmost branch, to put at the object node of the same template.",
        "This seeking is preferential, in that formulas not satisfying that requirement will be accepted, but only if nothing satisfacimay can be-fOund.",
        "The tetplately established -ft; 3 fragment of text is the one in which the most formulas hive their preferences satisfied.",
        "There is a general principle at work here, that the right 36 interpretation 'says the least' in information-carrying terms.",
        "This very simple device is able to do much of the work of a syntax and word-sense ambiguity resolving program For example, if the sentence had been 'John drank a whole pitcher', the formula for the 'pitcher of liquid' would have been preferred to that for the human, since the subformulâ–º (FLOW STUFF) could be appropriately located within it.",
        "A considerable amount of squeezing of this simple canonical form of template is necessary to make it fit the complexity of language: texts have to be fragmented initially; then, in fragments which are, say, prepositional phrases there is a dummy agent imposed, and the prepositional phrases there is a dummy agent imposed, and the preoositional formula functions as a pseudo-action.",
        "There are special 'less preferred' orders to deal with fragments not in agent-action-object order, and so on.",
        "When the local inferences have been done that set up the ageat-action object templates for fragments of input text, thd system attempts to tie these templates together so as to provide an overall initial structure for the input.",
        "One form of this is the anaphora tie, of the sort discussed for the monkeys and bananas example above, but the more general form is the case tie.",
        "Assignment of these would result in the template for the last clause of 'He ran the mile in a paper bag' being tied to the action node of the template for the first clause ('He ran the mile'), and the tie 17eing labelled CONTainment.",
        "These case ties are made with the aid of .mother class of ordered structures, essentially equivalent to Fialmore's case frames, called paraplates and which are attagheo to the formulas for English prepositions.",
        "So, for 'outof', for ex pie, there would be at Least six ordered paraplates, each of which Is a string of functions that seek inside templates for information.",
        "In general, paraplates range across two, not necessarily contiguous, templates.",
        "So, in analysing 'He put the number he thought of in the table', the successfully matching paraplata would pin down the dependence of the template for the last of the three clauses as DIREction, by taking as argument only that particular template for the last clause that contained the formula for 'a numerical table', (and not a template representing a kitchen table) and it would do that because of a function in that paraplate seeking a similarity, of head (SIGN in this ease) between the two appropriate object 37 formulas, for 'number' and 'table'.",
        "The other template containing the 'furniture' formula for 'table' would naturally not satisfy the function because SIGN would not be the head of this sense formula for 'table'.",
        "The structure of mutually connected templates that has been put together thus far constitutes a 'semantic block', and, if it can be constructed, then as far as the system is concerned all semantic and referential ambiguity has been resolved and it will begin to generate French by unwrapping the block again.",
        "The generation aspects of this work have been describes in (Herekovits '73).",
        "One aspect of the general notion of preference is that the system should never construct a deeper or more elaborate semantic representation than is necessary for the task in hand and, if the initial block can be constructed and a generation of F J111:11 done, no 'deepening' of the representation will be attempted.",
        "However, many examples cannot be resolved by the methods of this 'basic mode' and, in particular, if a word sense ambiguity, or pronoun reference, is still unresolved, then a unique semantic block of templates cannot be constructed and the 'extended mode' will be entered.",
        "* In this mode, new template-like forms are extracted from existing ones, and then added to the template pool from which further inferences can be made.",
        "So, in the template derived earlier for 'John drinks wine', the system enters the formula for 'drinks', and draws inferences corresponding to each case sub-formula.",
        "In this example it will derive template-like forms equivalent boâ€ž in ordinary English, 'The wine is in John', 'The wine entered John via an aperture' and so on.",
        "The extracted templates express information already implicitly present in the text, even though many of them are partial inferences: ones that may not necessarily, be true.",
        "Common-sense inference rules are then brought down, which attempt, by a simple strategy, to construct the shortest possible chain of rule-linked template forms from one containing an ambiguous pronoun, say, to one cm-tamping one of its possible referents.",
        "Such a chain then constitutes a solution to the ambiguity problem, and the preference approach assumes that the shortest chain is always the right one.",
        "So, in the case of 'John drank the wine /on the table/ and it was good', (in three template-matching fragments as shown) the correct chain to 'wine' uses the two rules * Wilks '73b, and (in press)",
        "(1 is goodl (animate-2 wants 1) These rules are only partial, that is to say, they correspond only to what we may reasonably lock out for in a given situation, not to what KUST happen.",
        "The hypothesis here 13 that understanding can only take place oh the basis of simple rules that are confirmed by the context of application.",
        "In this example the chain constructed may be expressed as (using the above square bracket rvotatiorf to contain not a representation, but simply an indication, in English, of the template contents):",
        "The assumption here is that no chain using other inference rules could have reached the 'table' solution by using less than two rules.",
        "Thu chief drawback of this system is that codings consisting entirely of primitives have a considerable amount of both vagueness and redundancy For example, no reasonable coding in terms of structured primitives could be expected to distinguish, say, 'hammer' and 'mallet'.",
        "That may not matter provided the codings can distinguish importantly different senses of words.",
        "Again, a template for the sentente 'The sheperd tended his flock' would contain considerable repetition, each node of the template trying, as it were, to tell the whole story by itself.",
        "Again, the preference criteria are not in any way weighted, which might seem a draucack, and the preferential chain Length criterion( foL Inference chains might well seem too crude.",
        "Whether or not such a, system can remain stable with a",
        "Considerable vocabulary, of say several thousand words, has yet to be tested.",
        "It will be evident to any reader that the last two systems described, Schank's and my own, share a great deal in common.",
        "Even the apparent difference in notation is reduced if one sees the topological similarity that results from considering the head of a formula as functioning rather like a Schenk basic action.",
        "If one thinks of the dependencies of the case subtarts of a formula, not arranged linearXy along the bottom of a tsee, but radiating out from the head in the centre, then the two diagrams actually have identical topologies under interpretation.",
        "A difference arises in that the 'filled-in entity' for Schenk is the conceptualization centred on the basic action, though for me it is the network of formulas placed in relation in a template, where there is indeed a basic action, the head of the action formula, but there is also a basic entity in the agent formula and so on.",
        "Or, to put it another way, both what-is and what-is-expected are represented in the templates: the agent formula represents the agent, for example, but the left-hand part of the action formula alsp represents what agent was expected or sought, as in the (*ANI SUBS) stub-formula of the 'drink' formula.",
        "Although developed in isolation initially, these two systems have also influenced each other in more recent years, probably unconsciously.",
        "For example, conceptual dependency now emphasises the agent-action-object format more than before, and is less rverb-centred' and timeless, while, conversely, my own system now makes much more overt 1.1w of rules of partial information than in its earlier versions.",
        "Again, both systems have intellectual connections that go back before either generation of AI systems.",
        "In my view, both these systems have roots in the better parts of the Computational Linguistics movement of the Fifties: in the case of Schank's system, one may think of the earlier systems of (Hays '64) and (Lamb '66), and the arrow-structured primitive system of (Farradene '66) In the case of my own systom thPro are clew,- prerpeonts in the Parker-Rhodes '61) system of classification and the early semantic structures of (Richens '61) and (Masterman '61).",
        "In 1961 the last author was arguing 40 that 'what is needed is a discipline that will study semantic message connection in a way analogous to that in which metmathematics now studies mathematical connection, and bo that in which mathematical linguistics now studies syntactic connection'.",
        "(ibid., p.3) This historieml point raises a final One that is, I feel, of passing interest.",
        "There seem to be two research styles in this field; one is what might be called the 'fully finished style', ir which the work exists only in one complete form, and is not issued in early or developed versions The best example of this is Winograd's work.",
        "The other type, exemplified by all the other authors discussed here, to some extent, is the developing style: work which appears in a number of versions over the years, one hopes with gradual improvements, perhaps in attempts to tackle a wider range of linguistic or other inferential phenomena.",
        "There are advantages to both styles, but even in the latter one knows that any proposed structure or system will, in the end, be found wanting in the balances of language, so it can only be a question of when one will have to abandon it.",
        "The interesting question, and one to which no answer could possibly be given here, is just how far is it worth pushing any given structural approach before starting again from scratch?"

        "An interesting and difficult question that then arises is whether those who concentrate on central and less central areas of discourse could, in principle, weld their bodies of inferences together in such a way as to create a wider system: whether, to put the matter another way, natural language is a whole that can be built up from parts?",

        "There is no denying that this sort of information might be useful to have around somewhere; that, in Minsky's terms, the 'default' value of the instrument for eating is the hand brought to the mouth, so that, if we have no contrary information, then that is the way to assume that any given act of eating was performed.",
        "Nonetheless, there clearly is a danger, and that is all 1 am drawing attention to here, of taking inferences to a phenomenon logical level beyond that of =man sense.",
