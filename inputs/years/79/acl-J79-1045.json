        "We have tried as much as possible to keep the formalism which was developed by Woods intact, but some changes have been necessary or desirable to make the grammar more amenable to the speech parser.",

        "In the MATN formalism, the test component of each arc is, on all but the PUSH arc, a list of two tests.",
        "The first is a test on the Page 10 current word and its features, i.e. a local, context-free test.",
        "The second is a test on the register contents, i.e. a context-sensitive test.",
        "Both tests must succeed for the arc to be taken.",
        "The reason for splitting up the tests in this way is that register checking tests cannot be made unless the registers are set, and in many situations in the speech environment there may not be enough left context to guarantee that the proper registers would be set.",
        "Thus it is useful to be able to evaluate the context-free test on an arc at a different time in the parsing process from the context-sensitive one.",
        "On PUSH arcs, there are three types of tests which are used.",
        "It is useful and efficient to test the next word of input before actually doing the PUSH, to see, for example, if the next word can begin a constituent of the type being PUSHed for.",
        "This test is called a lookahead test, and takes the place of the normal context-free test in the test component of the arc.",
        "There is also the usual context-sensitive test on registers which were set before the PUSH arc was encountered.",
        "And finally, when the PUSH arc returns with a constituent, another context-free test may be done on the structure of the entire constituent.",
        "Therefore, the test component of a PUSH arc is a list of the three tests lust described.",
        "SENDR s were an efficient mechanism for text parsing because they allowed tests to be made on a lower level which involved information obtaine0 somewhere (possibly fAr) to the left in the input string -- information vihich would normally be inaccessible Page 11 beoause it would be hidden on the stack during the parsing of sub-constituents.",
        "There are svveral reasons for not allowing this mechanism in the speech parser Suppose, in the input that looks like \"... the person who.",
        "travels ...\", the word \"person\" is not the word which was really uttered.",
        "If it were allowed to be passed down it would become an integral part of the analysis at the lower level, and if another word were to be hypothesized in its place, the kower level the analysis would have to be redone even if none of the words in the relative clause had been cnanged.",
        "Thls is a process which would be extremely wasteful, especially in the speech environment where one wants to be able to take as much advantage as possible of information which was gained at one point and slightly altered at another.",
        "In particular, it is advantageous to consider as constituents such constructions as relative clauses so that they can be placed in a well-formed-substring table for use by other professes.",
        "Another reason is that some types of verifications (semantic, prosodic, and pragmatic, at least) can be done most conveniently on portions of an utterance which have been assigned a syntactic structure, i.e. on constituents.",
        "If a portion of an utterance is parsed (e.g1 \"that I gave you\" from the complete utterance \"The book that I gave you\") but doas not form a comDlete constituent because it is missing a piece of information from a higher constituent to the left which would have been sent down had it been available, then these verifications may not be made until the missing word or words are identified.",
        "Yet it may",
        "be important to build and verify the constituent in order to predict the missing word to the left.",
        "Therefore, it is better to allow constituents to be built without information which would normally have been passed down When parsing possibly incorrect fragments with little or no left context, it is heat to keep constituents as small and as independent as possible.",
        "The conversion process from an AIIN grammar to a MATN r!rammar with regard to SENDR s is straightforwardand infolves the use of a dummy symbol which is used in the construction of the lower level constituent.",
        "When the structure is popped, the PUSH arc examines it for agreement and may replace the dummy node by the appropriate item which would have been sent down.",
        "The structure returned by the PUSH for a relative clause on the fragment \"that I gave you\" might look like Figure 3.1 (where the structure is shown in both the usual tree diagram form and a corresponding form more amenable to computer output)."

        "Of course, if the lookahead funcCion fails altogether, the configuration is not set up, although the monitor in the WFST remains.",
        "When a constituent is completed (or found in the WFST) and a PUSH transition is about to be made, the score of the configuration on 4hich the transition terminates is a function of the score of the confiruration being extended the weirht on the arc, and the score of tbe constituent itself.",

        "It is not clear whether different scoring mechanisms would be better, however it is clear that the current scoring strategy is better than no scoring at all, as preliminary measurements indcate that the number of transitions created (as well as the number of configurations and predicions) Page 46 is reduced about 25% by the current strategy.",
        "(It is reasonable to ask why semantic scores are used to influence parse paths, since it was iust argued that lexical scores should not be used in this way Semantic scores may he more reliable than lexical ones hecause we are assuming that the utterande is semantically meanihgful.",
        "Under this assumption, a constituent like \"range remainder\" as a noun-noun modifier analogous to \"surplus money\" should be ruled out as early as possible.",
        "Since such constituents cannot be ruled out on syntactic grounds alone, since prosodic information (which might help to rule them out) is not available (see discussion in Section 7.2), an4 since they would seriously overrun the parser with a plethora of false paths if they were not rejected, it seems reasonable to permit semantics to influence the parser.)"

        "One of the weak points of the current system is the fact that some context information is not used until a path is complete, resulting in the creation of false paths and predictions which should not have been made.",
        "This is partly mitigated by the fact that this avoids a too great dependence on left context and allows the creation of partial paths which may be followed if an earlier word is changed.",
        "It is important, however, to minimize the number of predibtions which are made and to make the predictions as accurate as possible.",
        "In this regard, it is unforitunatc, that the currept system makes predictions on the left of an island solely on the basis of the first word in the island and .maskes predictions On the right end from configurations which, if context sensitive tests had been done along the path, would never nave been created.",
        "One way to help tighten the predictions would be to take each context free path through an island and walk it in a special mode after the island has been processed but before predictions are communicated to the control component.",
        "This mode would set and check registers, assuming that any tests which require unknown left context are true.",
        "Only if the path did not fail Page 79 under this mode of operation would the predictions at either end of it be made.",
        "If a really efficient way of handlinp unknown left context and of storinp this informaCion were developed, it could be used in place of the context free pass in the first place, thus eliminatinp all inconsistent paths.",
        "The problem with storing all possible contexts is that they must be recomputed each time a new step is added to the path.",
        "lhis is relatively easy if the next step is taken to the ripht of an existing path, since ATN s are more suited to left to ripht processing, but it becomes extremely complex when a transition is added to the left end of a path (or set of paths) or when a transition joins two sets of paths together.",
        "To be absolutely sure that no contexts have been missed, all the paths would have to be walked and their contexts reprocessed and copied in whole or in part (since the new step may be wrong, the old context must be preserved.)",
        "Of eourse this is not the only approach which could be .used a merffing technique like that of Earley's algorithm might be feasible, if the structure of the grammar were also changed to make it less left to right oriented.",
        "One great strength of the system is its ability to store and merge information in such a way that it does not have to be redone when the context is changed.",
        "For example, once an arc has been tried with a particular word match, a transition will be created if the arc may be taken and the arc will be removed from further consideration if it may not be taken.",
        "Then, if the conriguration should ever be reached with the same word match agarn (perhaps in a later theory) not only will any relevant Pape 80 transitions be recognized without having to go throur!h the work of recreating them, but also no arcs which had prev,iously Hal txgr hg rvIrigA.",
