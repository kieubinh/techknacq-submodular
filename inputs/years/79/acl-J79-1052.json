        "A sentence with a conjunction presents a problem for the application of detailed constraints to the parse tree (restrictions), an essential part of the parsing process.",
        "The tree structure will be different from that assumed by the restriction; conjunctional strings will have been inserted and the conjunctional strings themselves may be truncated versions of defined strings.",
        "To appreciate what this problem means, one must keep in mind that a grammar like that of the LSP for processing English text sentences is very large by comparison with grammars used in most other natural language processing systems, which are directed to particular subsets of English.",
        "The LSP grammar consists of approximately 3500 lines.",
        "The restrictions comprise by far the largest part of the grammar, and without them, text parsing,is out of the question.",
        "In addition, we have found that roughly one third of all text sentences contain coordinate or comparative conjunctions, many times in complicated",
        "interrelation.",
        "It is therefore essential that there be a means for executing restrictions on sentences containing conjunctions.",
        "One solution to this problem is to rewrite all the restrictions so that they test for conjunctions and accommodate truncated segments.",
        "This was done in earlier versions of the LSP parser but that involved a tremendous amount of detail and both increased and complicated the grammar enormously.",
        "As an alternative, in some cases the sentence can be expanded so that the restrictions operate on complete strings.",
        "But in other cases this is not possible because the expansion necessitates the introduction of certain transformations which should be done later.",
        "In the present system we therefore use a general solution whereby restrictions are re-executed automatically for conjunctional occurrences.",
        "Thus, in the analysis shown in Fig. 1 of Hearsay and rumors hastily printed the selectional restriction will be executed automatically for the sequences hearsay printed and rumors printed.",
        "This is equivalent to expanding the sentence into two assertions, namely, (Someone) printed hearsay and (Someone) printed rumors.",
        "The actual expansion is performed in the transformational phase (if the application requires expansion), which takes place after the surface analysis is obtained.",
        "However, for the correct surface analysis it is crucial that the restrictions operate on expanded or complete strings.",
        "Thus, the conjunction computation performs some of the function of expansion prior to the transformational phase.",
        "To apply restrictions to sentences containing conjunctions, a nondeterministic programming mechanism, which we call the stacking mechanism, was incorporated into the parser.",
        "This mechanism saves the conjoined structure so that the restriction can be re-executed for the conjoined structure.",
        "In principle, the same method can be applied to any grammar containing restrictions as long as the structure assigned to the conjunctional occurrence is of the same type as the one assigned to the segment that precedes the conjunction.",
        "An efficient restriction component of a grammar makes use of routines for pieces of code which are used again and again.",
        "Then the stacking mechanism can be implemented efficiently by changing the routines rather than the more numerous restrictions.",
        "In the LSP case, the routines which were modified are those which locate a basic type of structure in the parse tree, such as the routinesCORE, HOST, ELEMENT, LEFT-ADJUNCT, etc.",
        "* In addition to locating structures the modified routines must also test whether or not the structures are conjoined.",
        "When a restriction calls a routine which locates a conjoined structure, that routine in turn calls an operator which saves the conjoined structure(s) along with the place of the routine within the sequence of operations being executed in the restriction.",
        "The operator puts this information on a re-execution stack.",
        "The routine returns to the original structure located and the restriction interpreter executes the rest of the restriction.",
        "At this point the restriction interpreter is \"looking at\" the original structure located by the routine.",
        "When a restriction is successful the restriction interpreter uses the information on the re-execution stack to resume execution of that restriction.",
        "The restriction is resumed at the point immediately after the call to the routine so that the routine itself is not called again.",
        "Instead however, the restriction interpreter will \"look at\" the conjoined structure previously located and saved by the routine.",
        "For example, when the verb-object selection restriction WSEL1 is executed on the sentence They printed hearsay and rumors, it calls the CORE routine to obtain the core of the object.",
        "The CORE routine will go to hearsay, locate and stack rumors, and return to hearsay.",
        "WSEL1 will be successful for printed hearsay.",
        "WSEL1 will be resumed therefore at the point after the call to the CORE routine and rumors, which was saved *See Appendix for a detailed description of the routines.",

        "WSEL1 will be successful for printed rumors.",
        "A trace of the execution of WSEL1 which shows the re-execution of the restriction on the conjunct appears in Fig. 3.",
        "Various cases of WSEL1 with examples are explained in detail below.",
        "An effect of dynamic generation of conjunctional parse trees is that in addition to locating conjoined values, provision must be made for restrictions to function properly on the non-conjunctional grammar, in nOw situations due to conjunctions; a routine may be operating in a structure into which conjunctional strings have been inserted, or in a truncated version of a defined string or host-adjunct sequence.",
        "For example, the LSP RIGHT-ADJUNCT routine is assumed to start at a node X in an LXR type node.",
        "Without conjunctions the RIGHT-ADJUNCT routine goes one node to the right from X to arrive at the right adjunct of X.",
        "In Fig. 2 for the noun phrase rumors hastily printed, RIGHT-ADJUNCT, starting at the core position NVAA subsuming rumors, goes one node to the right to arrive at its right adjunct RN (hastily printed).",
        "However, with conjunctions the routine must go right until it lands at a non-conjunctional node.",
        "Thus, in Fig. 1, for the noun phrase hearsay and rumors hastily printed, RIGHT-ADJUNCT goes from NVAR (hearsay) past the conjunction string (and rumors) to RN.",
        "When RIGHT-ADJUNCT starts in the conjunctional string at NVAR (rumors), RN is not to its right.",
        "To go to RN, the routine locates the corresponding preconjunction element NVAR (hearsay) and goes to RN from there.",
        "To illustrate how the stacking mechanism works we will explain in detail how restriction WSEL1 is executed for several sentences with conjunctions.",
        "WSEL1 is housed in the center string ASSERTION:*",
        "The above restriction statements have the following functions: $OBJECT-NOUN checks that the core of the object position is a noun or pronoun; $GOVERNING-VERB tests that a verb coelement exists; and $FORBIDDEN-NOUN-LIST checks that the given verb has an attribute NOTNOBJ.",

        "It does this by first locating OBJECT (which was saved in register X10 by $OBJECT-NOUN) and by calling the COELEMENT routine.",
