        "This paper describes a computer program, called ISAAC, which can read, understand, solve, and draw pictures of physics problems stated in English.",

        "rigid bodies in static equilibrium, and include such objects as levers, pivots, weights, ropes, and springs in various configurations.",
        "An example of the class of problems solved is the following (from Sehaum's Outline of College Physics): The foot of a ladder rests against a 'c'ertical wall and on a horizontal floor.",
        "The top of the ladder is supporvi4 from the wall by a horizontal rope 30 ft long.",
        "The laddei is 50 ft long, weighs 100 lb With its center of gravity 20 ft from the foot, and a 150 lb man is 10 ft from the top.",

        "In order to understand and solve such a problem, it is necessary to build an internal model of the problem in which the various objects and then interrelationships are adequately represented.",
        "Many of the relationships and features of the objects are not specified explicitly in the problem statement but must be inferred by using common sense knowledge of what is usual.",
        "In the abow example, we 14,:stime that the ma to is standing on the ladder, although this is not explicitly stated.",
        "Thus, the understanding of a physics problem is an active process in Which the :=:entences of the problem statement are used to guide the construction of a model which represents the relationships and features of objects with much greater detail and specificity rhan, they are specified in the original problem statement.",

        "Was of representing objects and their relationships are developed.",
        "These representations, which are originally created in response to the sentences in the problem statement, are further elaborated by processes which construct.a geometric model of the problem, associate canonical objects (such as.a point mass) with physical objects t.su(h as a person), write and solve equations which describe the interactions of the objects and construct a diagram of the problem.",

        "While the diagram and answer to a problem are the most easily observable outputs of the program, another significant output is its robust internal model of the objects in the problem and their relationships.",

        "The process of understanding and solving a physics problem occurs in several distinct steps.",
        "First, the problem statement is translated from English into a structured parsing of the sentences, which is interpreted semantically to construct an initial internal model.",

        "A geometric model which repreents the spatial position and orientation of each object is constructed.",

        "interactions of the objects according to physical laws are written and solved, and answers are generated from the solutions.",
        "Finally, a picture model is constructed and used to guide the drawing of a diagram of the problem.",
        "These processes are described below in somewhat greater detail.",
        "The parsing programs transform each sentence from a linear string of words into a more structured form in which the relationships of words and phrases to each other are clearly defined.",
        "Each type of phrase is parsed by a specialist program which implements the grammar of the phrase as an augmented transition network.",
        "The grammar programs call the semantic programs both to interpret the semantic network structure produced as a result of the parsing and to guide the parsing process itself, Whether a particular modifier can be used to modify a noun phrase, for example, may depend on the actual relationships between objects in the model of the problem.",
        "After each clause has been parsed, the semantic routine associated with the main verb is called to complete the semantic processing of the clause.",
        "This semantic processing transfers the information provided by the sentence to* a growing model of the objects in the problem and their relationshiPs.",
        "Once the semantic processing is completed, the semantic network structures produced by the parser are no longer used.",
        "All of the sentences in the problem statement are parsed and processed semantically before the remaining parts of the program are executed.",
        "The routines grouped under the heading of \"Semantic Programs\" perform a variety of tasks.",
        "Semantic routines are associated with verbs and prepositions, and in some cases with other words.",
        "Preposition semantic routines must determine the appropriate sense-meaning of the preposition (using a decision network based on rough semantic classifications of the modified phrase and the object of the preposition) and then make the, appropriate changes in the semantic network token of the modified phrase.",
        "Verb semantic routines typically act to transfer information from the semantic network to the internal model, or define relationships among objects in the model; determination of the proper sense-meaning of the verb is often noeded as well.",
        "Another major semantic task is the identification of the referent of a noun phrase.",
        "Given a noun phrase which denotes an object or a location, it is necessary to ie,cide whether the phrase refers to an object or location whtich already exists in the model (and if' therr are several possibilities, which one it refers to), or whether a new object or location must be created as the referent of 'the phrase and added to the model.",
        "After all the sentences of the problem statement have been read, the frame creation programs a:re called to assign to each object a canonical object type (spell as a point mass or an \"ideal\" spring) which represents the behavior of the object as it eppears in the problem.",
        "The same type of actual object may be represented 1):\\I different canonical objects, depending on its context in the problem.",

        "The phrases around the key words become the \"variables\" in the equations which are constructed from the sentences.",
        "Thus, in one of Bobrow's examples, If the number of customers Tom gets is twice the square of 20 percent of the number of advertisements he runs, and the number of advertisements he runs is 45, what is the number of customers Tom gets?",

        "The area of physics problems involving rigid body statics is certainly a \"micro-world\", and a fairly small one at that; however, in the opinion of this author, it is a fruitful one for research in computational linguistics.",
        "The area is sufficiently circumscribed to be tractable for programming, but still involves a number of interesting problems – many more than a casual glance at the sample problems would suggest.",
        "In some cases, the correct parsing of a sentence depends on the particular relations of objects in the model of the problem, thus forcing the integration of syntax, semantics, and world knowledge in the parsing program.",
        "The difficult problem of referent identification must be solved (though of course in a limited way) for both physical objects and locations.",
        "Different sense-meanings of words (particularly verbs and prepositions) must be disambiguated.",
        "Canonical object frames must be selected to represent objects in the model, and inferences must be made to construct a complete and consistent model.",
        "Geometrical models of the problem must be constructed both for solving the problem and for drawing the picture.",
        "Thus, although the problem solving is specific to the area of physics problems, the process of understanding the English statement of the problem involves a number of interesting sub-processes which are likely to be important in any language-understanding program.",
        "The area of physics problems is a good one for investigating these sub-processes because there is a relatively clear understanding of what the result of understanding a physics problem must consist of: a model of the problem in which the attributes and relationships of objects are represented with sufficient specificity to allow equations to be written describing the interactions of the objects and to allow a diagram of the problem to be constructed.",
        "The twenty sample problems used to test the program were selected before the major version of the program was written.",
        "(When the program was almost complete, one problem which involved a great deal of world-knowledge required only for that problem was deleted and replaced by another problem.)",
        "Thus, iii a sense, the program was written to solve twenty specific problems – not a very large number.",
        "However, we tried to solve the problems in a legitimate, general way, using a minimum of \"tricksWe hope (but have not yet shown) that the program could be expanded considerably without rewriting very much of the existing code, and that it could be made to solve",
        "twenty more problems of the same type with relatively little difficulty.",
        "(Adding the problem which replaced the deleted one required only a semantic routine for one word.)",
        "The use of twenty preselected problems by several different authors actually made the program much more difficult than it might have been.",
        "Almost every problem had some idiosyncracy which required additional capabilities of the program or prevented au easy trick from being used in a superficially similar situation in another problem.",
        "On the other hand, the diversity of the problems led to the discovery of many interesting regularities which would have been missed if we had (say) selected problems that an existing program could solve or edited the problems to make it easier on the program.",
        "Thus, in a sense we are treating computational linguistics as an experimental science, in which the experimental data are existing examples of linguistic performance by competent native speakers, and in which the goal of the research is the production of programs which can adequately understand the examples of language performance.",
