        "This paper is intended to describe the case handling procedures of the preference semantics (Wiiks 1972, 1975a)system of natural language understanding by giving a more complete account than in previous papers, and in particular I shall distinguish the application of case to the parsing of preposition structures in English frown subsequent inferences using case(, Case information in this system is stored in two different places: in what are called formulas and paraplates respectively, I shall argue a reasonable processing account of case requires this.",
        "I shall contrast this position briefa'y with those of Schank and Riesbeck, who seem to me to advocate a singl* type of case information, and a no case view respectively.",
        "More importantly, I&shall argue against a recent position of Charniak that Artificial Intelligence (AI) natural language systems do not in fact make any use (If case.",
        "I shall discuss his arguments and urge that, although there are systems to which his arguments do apply, they do not apply to the one described here, at least hot if case is to have anything like its normal meaning.",
        "The use of case information in AI comes from the work of Fillmore (1968), in which the underlying structure of a sentence is displayed, in essence, as an array of argument values for a predicate, where the ^redir:ate is the verb of the sentence.",
        "The corresponding values are the case parts of the sentence, each of a different case type, and, for any given verb, the general pattern of cases it takes is called the case frame of that verb."

        "Thus, if the horizontal lines denote the verb predicate, the case frame for \"break\" could be written as: OBJECT (AGENT) (INSTRUMENT)) which means that this verb must take an object, and can but need not take an agent and instrument case.",
        "These latter two cases are optional here and that optionality is indicated by the parentheses round the case names.",
        "So, on this view:",
        "(1) John broke",
        "would be ill-formed because it gives us only the (optional) agent of breaking, which is John, but omits the obligatory object that is broken.",
        "This analysis can be contrasted with \"hit\", whose frame would be OBJECT (AGENT X INSTRUMENT)) where the overlapping brackets mean that the two cases,agent and instrumental are semi-optional, in that at least one of the two must appear.",
        "Thus (2) The window hit would be ill-formed on that view because, although it contains the obligatory object, it contains neither the agent nor the instrument of the hitting.",
        "However, (3) The window broke would be perfectly well – formed with respect to the frame for 'break'.",
        "This sort of case analysis is normally called deep case'to distinguish it from the surface case manifestation of word inflections in Greek, Latin and German etc.",
        "It should be noted, too, that here, as throughout the paper, no attempt is made to stick to the actual list of case names used by any author, since these vary so much from one to the next, and no point of principle hangs on any particular list of cases.",
        "Fillmore's linguistic theory is, naturally enough, a generative one in that the procedures it suggests would be those for generating sentences from an underlying structure of a verb plus its case argument values.",
        "What the surface form would be, given any particular underlying structure, is determined by what Fillmore calls the \"subject selection rule\", which says that, if there is an agent, that will be the subject of any active sentence produced; if there is no agent but there is an instrument, then that will be the subject and so on.",
        "In this paper, I hhall concentrate, as is normal if not desirable in AI and computational linguistics, on questions of analysis rather than generation.",
        "The general problem in analysis (that is not emphasised in generation) is that of the selection restrictions on the cases, which can be illustrated by looking at the simplest of the systems using case analysis (Simmons 1973).",
        "Simmons wishes to map",
        "all of the sentences (4) r (7) onto the same semantic network because all four, in some sense, refer to the same event: 7 (4) John broke the window with a hammer (5) John broke the window (6) The hammer broke the window (7) The window broke",
        "All are perfectly well-formed with respect to the frame for \"break\" given earlier.",
        "Simmons parses such sentences using an augmented transition network (Woods,1970) and a notion of case paradigm due to CelceMurcia (l972).",

        "The lines of (8) are patterns that must match input word strings in left right order so as to assign the cases they contain.",
        "The lines of (8) match each of (4) - (7) in turn, where marks the position of the verb (break) in each line of the paradigm.",
        "The lines of (8) are no more than the possible case combinations allowed by the case frame for \"break\" together with an analytic version of the \"subject selection rule\", which always makes the Agent the first (subject) item in any line of the paradigm (8) in which it occurs.",
        "There is no need for the lines of (8) to be ordered in their application to input sentences, S although there is one additional item of information required before they can be applied at all: the selection restrictions.",
        "These tell us what it is to be an agent of \"break\": in Simmons's scheme a noun marked ANIMATE.",
        "The selection restrictions attached to the cases in (8) are essential to the application of the paradigm, for only thus could we know that \"John\" in (4) was matched by AGENT in the first line of (8).",
        "It should be noted that the restriction of AGENT in (8) to nouns marked ANIMATE is not necessarily a restriction peculiar to 'break', but rather to the class of verbs for which (8) is the (active) paradigm.",
        "Conversely, the ANIMATE restriction on AGENTs in (8) is not necessarily on AGENTS as such although it might turn out to be so.",
        "These points will be important when we come to Charniak's arguments later.",
        "Notice too, that there are not two different ways in which a sentence can be ill-formed with respect to the paradigm: one with respect to selection restrictions and one with respect to the case frame (as has beep_ argued by Bruce l975).",
        "The case frame expressed by the paradigm, and the corresponding selection restrictions are indivisible.",
        "So, for example,",

        "For the selection restriction associated with a case defines what it is to match a corresponding line of (8).",
        "The only way in which a sentence could independently fail to match any line in the paradigm of (8) would be the trivial one of having some number of arguments (say, four or zero) not corresponding to any line of (8).",
        "These case primitives are ultimately the names of relations in the system of semantic representation, just as in the familiar semantic net representations (Simmons 1973) that indicate the instrumentality of say, the action of striking by a labelled arc such as: strike4s...4ic.„..00'hammer INST The representations described here are not of this superficial form for three reasons: a) Semantic nets do not immediately suggest their associated processes, whereas the representations here are intended to be directed towards the processes that operate on them.",
        "b) There is a clear distinction in the present system of represent",
        "ation between the knowledge stored and the patterns sought in language, on the one hand, and the language text actually represented found, on the other; where the latter may not exactly match what was being looked for, This distinction is not always easy to work into a semantic not structure.",
        "c) The present system of representation is intended to be more \"habitable\" in Watt's (1968) sense of providing a language of semantic representation that is appropriate to the way humans express themselves.",
        "That is a highly subjective notion, perhaps, but here it is taken to require at least a dynamic, or readable structure, which nets do not havetThisrequirement rests upon another assumption: that our representation must have the \"one thing after another\" feature that texts have, rather than being static and timeless like most semantic nets (though,'Norman and Rulumelhart (1975) have constructed nets containing ordered assertions, though these are no longer semantic nets in the classic sense).",
        "The case primitives function within a semantic dependency grammar (Hays 1964), intended to express the meaning of word senses and, by extension, of texts.",
        "Each of the case primitives above will have a dependent, which is a type of entity for all the case priM-itives except WAY and GOAL, which take an assertion as dependent.",
        "The case primitive and its dependent (entity or assertion) form a case group which is in turn dependent on a primitive action (except 13 for WITH and POSS which depended on an entity and may therefore .be only semi-cases).",
        "This is best seen by example of the first structure in the system, the formula which expresses word sense in the dictionary° The formula for the action sense of \"break' is as follows:",
        "The general structure of such formulas has been explained in Wilks (1968, 1972, 1975a, 1975b).",
        "They are intended to express the interlingual meaning of the sense of the word, and the primitives that comprise them are intended to be interlingual (as are Fillmore's cases) even though they happen to be mostly Anglo-Saxon monosyllables.",
        "Formulas are trees of left-rit;nt dependencies but the dependence is interpreted differently according to the type of the subformula.",
        "We have already mentioned the dependence of an entity (or assertion) on a case primitive to form a case group, such as (*HUM SUBJ), which means that an agent is (preferably) human.",
        "These case groups (except WITH and POSS) all depend rightwards on some action, so that (*HUM SUBJ) in (10) depends on the main primitive action of the whole fokmula STRIK.",
        "The whole formula is to, be interpreted as \"breaking\" being a STRIKing, done preferably to a *PHYSOBJect, and by a *HUMan SUBJect, using an INSTrument that is a THING and with the GOAL of CAUSing the *PHYSOBJect to BE NOTWHOLE.",
        "This interpretation can be constructed from the following_ general rules for the building and interpretation of formulas: i) Each subgroup in the formulaconsists of a left member depending on a right member, and left or right may be either a single primitive element or another group.",
        "Thus, in (*HUM SUBJ) we have a case group, known to be such because the rightmost member of its pair is the governor and SUBJ.",
        "is the primitive element naming the Agent case.",
        "One level higher (*HUM SUBJ) ,depends on STRIK, the main primitive of the whole formula, to form an assertion group.",
        "Similarly, each of the other main subparts of the formula (whose heads are respectively OBJE, INST and GOAL) depends on STRIK to form in each case an action group which always consists of an action and any case group that is not an Agent group (nor a POSS or WITH group).",
        "15 ii) The dependency within a group is interpreted differently according to the type of the group.",
        "Within an action group ((*PHYSOB OBJE) STRIK) the dependence is that of an action's object on the action and OBJE does no more than name that relation.",
        "In the case■group (*PHYSOB °ME) the relation internally is no more than the preferred type of case filler (physical object) on the name of the case.",
        "With a substantive group like (LINE THING) the dependence is interpreted as specification, i.e. linear object.",
        "*PHYSOB is a name of a class of primitive elements which includes THING, but also other primitives like MAN.",
        "In case subfosmulas, e4c-ept GOAL and WAY, the leftmost item is always the preferred entity type, to function in the corresponding rightwards-named case.",
        "This leftmost item is, if you will, the 'selection restriction' for that case role for whatever action is being coded: i.e. in the formula above, for 'break'.",
        "The reader should not confuse this with being a restriction for the associated primitive STRIK.",
        "This point will be discussed later, but for now the formula is to be taken as no more than a formal expression of the meaning of the action 'break' that can be used in subsequent inference and parsing routines.",
        "However, \"selection restriction\" here is to be read as'pref erring the agent of \"break\" to be human, ',say, I have described elsewhere (Wilks 197 c) how whet text representations are assembled that will be only a preference on the agent of \"break\", and the system will not baulk at assembling a representation for \"The dog broke his bowl\" where the agent is not human, though the system 16 would prefer a human agent if it could find one.",
        "I write of \"assembling representations\" because the elements like *HUM in the formula above are not slots to be filled by, in this case, the agent of some breaking.",
        "The formulas are 'blueprints' for how representations are to b!",
        "assembled elsewhere from whole formulas.",
        "When a representation for \"The man broke _the window\" is assembled the whole formula above (together with a PAST element) will stand at some appropriate node of a higher-level representation.",
        "It is this feature of the system that explains why the head, or principal, element of a formula is easily accessible at one end of it rather than buried in the center as it would be if the formula were in SVO form, rather than SOV form, as above.",
        "Formulas exist for all parts of speech so, for example, a formula for an entity will have not a primitive action head like STRIK, but an entity head like THING or MAN or STUFF (for substance).",
        "Note too, that the preference restrictions for case need not be simple as above but can be as complex as required, including further case restrictions recursively.",
        "So, for example, if we had a formula for 'sew' it might well have a case sub-formula WITH) (LINE THING)",
        "primitive action.",
        "Agents and objects of actions in a formula are normally sought to the left of the primitive action element.",
        "If the whole formula is for an action (as above for 'break') the two leftmost subparts of the formula will always be the preferred agent and object of the head primitive, in that order.",
        "For any actions within the formula (such as CAUSE in the formula for 'break') its preferred agent and object are normally the next agent and object to its left -- which of course, as in the case of 'break' may turn out to yield the same entity as the preferred agent of the whole formula, though this need not be the case.",
        "Moreover, in the case of actions within a formula (i.e. not constituting the head) the agent need not be marked though the object must be if it is an entity type.",
        "This proviso does not apply in the formula above since the agent is the same for CAUSE and STRIK,and CAUSE takes an assertion as object, but within a formula a group (MAN STRIK) would always be interpreted as an assertion group, MAN being an unmarked agent of STRIK, and not as a man being struck which would require a marked object in the action group i.e. ((MAN OBJE)STRIK).",
        "All this implies that some of the subgroups in the formula for",
        "break' are not the apparent ones ie,e.",
        "the dependent of GOAL, as mentioned earlier, must be an assertion, whereas it is bracketted to only (((NOTWHOLE KIND)BE)CAUSE) which can only (during inference procedures called 'extraction' to be described later) become an assertion group by the addition of an agent found to the left namely (*HUM SUBJ.).",
        "CAUSE also requires a dependent object that is an assertion (henc,e (*PHY'SOB OBJE) will not do as its object 'taken alone) and can take, as dependent of that group, an entity to its left marked either OBJE or SUBJ whichever is closest.",
        "Hence the dependent of ((NOTWHOLE KIND)BE) is *PHYSOB and the \"real\" dependent of CAUSE (found by inference) is(*PHYSOB ((NOTWHOLE KIND)BE)) and the real dependent of GOAL is ((*HUM SUBJ)(*PHYSOB((NOTWHOLE KIND)BE)))CAUSE).",
        "This compression of expression can be argued to be \"habitable\" for a formula maker.",
        "It also avoids to a large extent the defect of some fuller conceptual representations of this general type, pointed out by Sandewall (1972), that if the entities like (*HUM SUM) are put into the representation many times but are intended to refer to THE SAME HUMAN, then this must be indicated as it frequently was not.",
        "Where such identity must be specific in formulas, but cannot be achieved by the above compressed expressions, it is obtained by means of the primitives SAME and NOTSAME: the same (or not), that is to say, as the first encountered token of the associated primitive when working in from the top level of the formula.",
        "One point that should emerge",
        "from this is that those who want to use case names as the names of relations, as in semantic nets, and also deal with surface language, must be prepared to extract a number of such relations from a single occurrence of certain formula subparts.",
        "Thus, the formula for 'break' above would contain not only the net links:"

        "All the top link can say is that the primitive action STRIK sometines takes human agents.",
        "In some other formula, for another surface action whose underlying primitive was also STRIK, the preferred agent might be *ANI, a wider class.",
        "Hence, in this system there are not specific semantic restrictions on.",
        "the dependents of the primitives, as in, say Schank (1973).",
        "In the present system, such a restriction could emerge only inductively from a survey of a considerable body of formulas.",
        "It is worth clarifying this issue here: what do underlying representations constitute case frames for?",
        "The issue is related to two others: 20 first the different roles of case frames in analysis and generation, and secondly, the procedural opposition between case frame blueprints, like formulas3 and 'the 'tuner' representations of generative semanticists trees and Schankian 'conceptualizations'.",
        "First , let us note that it has never been as clear as might be wished what case frames are for in Fillmore's work.",
        "The normal introductory account given earlier states that they are for surface verbs like 'break', but in Fillmore (1975) he argues that it is not so simple because he would want to admit sentences like: (12) Noon found Harry sleeping as perfectly well-formed, while not taking account of the usage in the agentive part of the case frame for 'find'.",
        "On the other hand, he wishes to avoid the position of saying that case frames are for underlying verbs like semantic primitives in formulas, or the underlying verbs of Generative Semanticsrepresentations which avoid cases altogether, as in the following for \"I broke the glass with a rock\".",
        "(13).",
        "I use rock enable I act case glass whole change glass whole not I have followed Fillmore's (19753 device here of making (13) easier to read by putting it in SVO rather than the usual VSO (predicate first) form.",
        "It will be seen that it is pretty similar to the above formula for \"break\" except that, in order to avoid case notation, they have had to resort to such philosophically suspect devices as separating the act of using from the basic 'act' inside the tree, even though there was really only one action in the whole business.",
        "An extreme version of the view that case frames belong only to the underlying structure is Schank's (1973) view that case frames are for underlying primitive acts and that all cases that a primitive act takes, it takes obligatorily.",
        "Thus, for example, Schank's primitive act TRANS expresses the 22 underlying content of such actions as \"buy\", \"sell\" and \"take\", and *he would begin the representation of",
        "(14) The man took a book as (S-chank 1973, p. 196) (15) man 1V=4 TRANS book",
        "where the arrows labelled \"R\" and \"0\" indicate Recipient and Objective case respectively, and the Agentive case is in fact indicated by the double arrow linking \"man\", the agent, to the act TRANS.",
        "The details here need not concern us, the point being that Schank is setting up case frames, not for surface verbs of English, like Fillmore (1968), but for these primitive acts, of which he has about twelve.",
        "From the point of view on ease expressed in the system described here, both these strong positions have drawbacks, indeed they have complementary ones.",
        "In the first place, Fillmore's (1968) system, with the aid of which he wants to contrast verbs by means of their frames, only becomes significant if interpreted with the aid of some non-surface representation of actions.",
        "So, for example, Charniak has pointed out (personal communication) that the earlier contrast of the frames for \"hit\" and \"break\" is significant only if there is some common, underlying, action that the two verbs share, and which can be thought of as being substituted for the horizontal line in the frames.",
        "For, if that is not so, then the contrast of the frames for \"kill\" and \"murder\" is of no more interest than the contrast between \"kill\" and Ifremember\", or any other random verb.",
        "In other words, it is only because the two verbs already have something in common, over and above their case frames, that the comparison has point.",
        "Thus, the contrast of the case frames of only surface verbs is, if unsupplemented, unsatisfactory.",
        "Conversely, there may be certain problems inherent in Schank's attempt to both (a) relate surface verbs to underlying primitive actions, and then discuss only the latter, and (b) at the same time make all participants in the case frames for primitives obligatory.",
        "So, for example, Fillmore would express the case frame for \"see\" as (OBJECT DATIVE) and for \"learn\" (OBJECT AGENT).",
        "While Schank (1973 pp.",
        "220-1) expresses both verbs by an underlying primitive MTRANS together with a case frame, for the primitive, containing at least A, 0 and R (Fillmore would call R by D).",
        "The individual letters for cases assigned by different authors need not detain us, nor need their contrasting interpretation of the case names, for the present point is the perfectly general one that, whether or not Fillmore is right with this particular verb pair, it is highly likely that there are pairs of surface verbs like this one whose surface case frames are different and whose Schankian primitive act is the same.",
        "It follows-from (b) above that, for Schank, their \"deep\" case 24 frame must therefore be the same too.",
        "Since, for him, every surface verb has a main act expressing it, there is clearly going to be a problem with this consequence of (b) unless he is prepared to say that there is no necessary relation at all between a verb's case frame and the case frame of its corresponding primitive act.",
        "It may well be possible to defend such a position within his theory, but he will still be left with the difficulty that verbs with quite different semantic behaviour (for Fillmorian case differences are not superficial) have identical behaviour in his system.",
        "There is bound to be a lack of discrimination consequent upon Schank's all-cases-are-obligatory view unless some careful avoiding action is taken, that he has not yet, to my knowledge embarked upon.",
        "However, Schank would probably not wish to take advantage of this last possibility because he does not himself hold the view that conceptual case \"is entirely independent of surface structure consid-erations\", as was wrongly attributed to him by Bruce (ibid.p.338), and for the simple reason that he intends that case structure in conceptualizations shall resolve the case ambiguities present in English preposition constructions.",
        "Schank (1973) makes this quite clear, and I shall return to it when discussing preposition constructions in the next section.",
        "Thus, since Schankian case frames for primitives are not independent of all surface structure considerations, he does have the problem above presented by the contrast of \"see\" and \"learn\".",
        "25 The burden of the last arguments have been to show that three different positiois on the question of \"what are case frames for9\" are unsatisfactory: (i) that they are simply for surface verbs : Fillmore's 1968 position, argued against along the lines sketched above as early as Schank (1969), ( ii) that underlying structures containing primitive actions do not require case frames at all: the Generative Semantics position, for example, Postal (1971), (iii)that underlying structures containing primitive actions are case frames for those primitives and, moreover, are all obligatory case frames: Schank's position just discussed.",
        "Let me now restate the position of the present system, as it concerns formulas.",
        "Formulas are meaning structures for surface word senses.",
        "Formulas for surface verbs can be interpreted as case frames for the verbs, in that they contain case subparts at the top level (i.e. depending directly on the head action primitive) that the formula maker has considered necessary to express as part of the meaning of the verb.",
        "Thus, the formula for \"break\" given earlier (10) contains case subparts at the top level (i.e. depending directly on the head primitive STRIK) INSTrument, GOAL, OBJect and Agent(=underlying SUBJect).",
        "The formula maker is concerned only with specifying, as best as he can, the semantic preferences of the particular surface word in question.",
        "26 If it were a verb he would semantically specify the preferred agent, say, of that action, with.na implicit reference to agenthood as such.",
        "The same goes for the other cases: he would attempt to put those cases into a formula that he thought necessary to specify the meaning of the action° Consider",
        "(16) He lives in Lugano and (17) He drank some Barbera in Lugano.",
        "It is logically true that one must, if one drinks, do it somewhere, but no one woad hold that the notion of location was involved in explaining the meaning of drinking.",
        "However, one might well hold that it was impossible to explain the notion of living, in the sense of inhabiting, without making clear that it was done in some location.",
        "Thus only in the foimula for \"live\" would we expect a location case subpart ( sow .LOCA).",
        "This description of the insertion of case specification into the formula for some given surface verb does not correspond in any clear way to Fillmore's obligatory or optional distinction, though it seems clear that any formula should contain at least Fillmore's obligatory cases for that surface verb and, as we saw , (10) above, for \"break\", does this, since the qnly obligatory case for \"break\" is object.",
        "The main reason for this difference remains the essentially generative quality of a Fillmorean case frame.",
        "Much sophisticated 27 linguistic argument in the past decade has gone into attempting to prove that the term \"zenbrate\" is neutral between \"analyse\" and \"produce\".",
        "One of the best efforts is to be found in Lyons' (1968, p.155).",
        "But, although it is easy to see the productive role of, say, Fillmore's subject selection rule (SSR), it is very hard to see what analytic significance it could have; the surface subject is, after all, usually revealed by simple methods not requiring the notion of case.",
        "The SSR tells one how to choose the subject given the case structure and in that sense is inherently generative in its non-neutral sense meaning 'productive'.",
        "The system presented here however is inherently analytic (its productive aspects have been described in(Herskovits (1973)), and this accounts for a great deal of the difference of approach to the notion of meaning structures Those with practical acquaintance with sentence analysis and production will need little persuasion that the two processes are not in any sense simple inverses of each other (nor does Fillmore himself believe they are, see(Fillmore 1972 p. 23).",
        "Charniak has argued (1975) that the method of formula coding results in top level case subformulas that cannot appear in the surface form of the verb, and he cites (ibid.",
        "p.16) the formula 'for \"drink\":",
        "where the containment group (SELF IN) indicates that the liquid object (FLOW STUFF) is moved into the animate agent (SELF), and the direction group ((MAN(TIBIJ PART))TO) indicates that this movement is in the direction of a human aperture„ These two groups appear at the top level of the formula, and thus dependent on the head primitive action CAUSE.",
        "However, later inferential procedures of extraction (see below) would shows as with \"break\" (10) earlier, that the real dependency of the two groups wAs on MOVE° However, the requirement is observed that the Fillmorean obligatory cases (only Agent presumably) for \"drink\" appear at the top level, and the other case groups - containment and direction - most certainly could appear at the surface with 'drink' as in: (19) John drank the beer up through his nose with a straw and into his brain.",
        "where both cases appear at the surface.",
        "Charniak is confusing what 29 can appear at the surface with what it would normally be redundant to say.",
        "The difference is made clear in (19) if we choose to say something remarkable, and false.",
        "In this section on formulas I have tried to justify the intermediate role of case description in formulas: by claiming BOTH that they give a meaning structure that, under inferences processes, can provide a real underlying structure for text AND that they must include enough of the surface case behaviour(of the verb meaning being expressed) to give procedural power in analyzing the input surface sentences.",
        "It seems to me essential to preserve,both these roles, and to avoid the path taken, in their different manners, by Sthank, Fillmore and the Generative Semanticists, of displa7Ying a full underlying structure directly without the processes that reach it.",
        "I argued earlier that each of those three gave only a filled-in onfinal,structure which in itself gives no hints as to how you get there.",
        "The generative linguist argues, of course, that he is not trying to reach such a structure at all, but to generate surface structures from it, and the \"artificial intelligence critique\" of this aspect of generative linguistics is familiar by now (my own version is in Wilks 1975c).",
        "The way in which Schank emphasises a filled-in structure is a quite different and more interesting matter, His conceptualizations are filled-in structures, with no procedural capacity.",
        "However, at the back of his early papers (i.e. the Appendix to ,Schank et al.",
        "1970) 30 are dictionary entries or skeletons for conceptualizations, which contain selection restrictions on the slots in the conceptualizations (and in (Schank 1973, p. 229)).",
        "These objects are much more fundamental to his approach than is generally realized, for they do give it more procedural power than one could envisage from looking only at the final conceptualizations.",
        "Their role is somewhat like that of the formulas for actions: they are blue'-prints showing what the system would like to be the usage and context of a given action.",
        "But the difference from formulas is this: the gchank dictionary entry has slots, marked, say, HUMAN which, when they are all filled by surface Words yield the filled-in conceptualization.",
        "The formula too has case specifications, like (*ANI SUBJ), but these are not slots.to be filled in, but directions as to how to fill in an agent slot in a higher order entity called a template which consists of whole formulas: essentially, a network based on an agent formula, an action formula and an object formula (although any of these may be dummies).",
        "Schank has no equivalent to formulas for nouns or adjectives, or any part of speech other than verbs.",
        "Thus, if the formula (10) for \"break\" is placed at the action node of a template, its agent preference tries to ensure that a formula for an animate entity will go at the corresponding agent node.",
        "There is a metric for this initial parsing and matching described in (Wilks 1972, 1975a,, 1975b3.",
        "The role of the formulas as data for parsing",
        "here is as follows: templates, matched onto sentences and clauses expressed as strings of formulas, try to pick up surface subjects and use the formulas as blue prints for selecting the best template, by trying to ensure that the surface subject is also the agent.",
        "In the initial matching of the \"The hammer broke the window\" this will not be possible because the formula for \"hammer\", the surface subject, will be placed at the first (or agent} node of the template.",
        "However, since the formula for \"break\" will be at the corresponding action nose the system will know at any point in later processing that the surface subject is not the underlying (anitiate) agent as preferred by the \"break\" formula at the action node of the same template.",
        "This clash will, as we shall, see, lead to later extraction inferencing that deals 'with the etgative paradigm in a uniform manner.",
        "But this clash is only observable in a system which builds structures that retain their preferences built in: i.e. not in one like Schanks' that just fills in slots in dictionary entries.",
        "Fillmore's anomalous \"Noon found Harry sleeping\" causes no trouble here: the formula for \"find\" expresses a preference for an animate agent.",
        "In the template for this sentence, that is not satisfied by the surface subject (a formula for \"noon\", with a head (WHEN POINT)) but no case frame is violated.",
        "Formulas are not used as parsing mechanisms to deal with preposition structures in English.",
        "This is done by other structures called paraplates, to which I will now turn, so as to giv( a fuller 32 account of them than in the past, in (Wilks 1975a).",
        "In what follows templates will be written in short form: not as triples of complex formula trees, but as square brackets round the surface phrase or clause that the template is for.",
        "The words are clustered within the brackets so as to represent the three nodes of the template.",
        "Case in paraplates Paraplates are structures employed to assert a connectivity between two templates, typically between a template representing a main clause and one representing a prepositional phrase.",
        "Thus, if we were analysing",
        "(20) John left his clothes at the cleaners",
        "which would be represented initially in the system by two templates, the correct paraplate, when applied, would assert a spatial location case ( LOCA) tie between the two templates as follows:",
        "(21) [John left his + clothes] LOCA",
        "L[( = Dummv Agant) at the + cleaners] Each paraplate corresponds to one of the cases in the inventory, which is the same as the inventory used to construct formulas.",
        "Many paraplates, however, may correspond to a single case.",
        "A paraplate has the form of two template-skeletons connected by a label indicating the case expressed by the paraplate, where by template-skeleton I mean an 33 entity like a template except that, instead of a foLIuula at each of Its three nodes, it has a function ranging over formulas.",
        "Any template that matches either part of the paraplate must have formulas that satisfy the functions in the corresponding part of the paraplate.",
        "If the functions in both parts of a paraplate are satisfied by a pair of templates (and the template for the prepositional phrase is normally considered to be the right-hand part, though this need not correspond to actual order of occurrence in text) then the case label of the paraplate is asserted in the representation as holding between the two templates.",
        "In earlier descriptions I have distinguished paraplates from inference rules, but in fact they can perfectly well be seen as a form of inference rules as Schank has argued.",
        "However, the essential role of paraplate's is as parsing structures for prepositional phrases.",
        "So, if we were representing \"John picked up the statue made out of wood on the table after lunch\" we would expect paraplates for the various case dependencies to create ties as follows:",
        "The preference semantics system applies paraplates immediately after matching templates and choosing the \"most preferred\" ones (Wilks 1_9750.",
        "In operation, the system inputs small English paragraphs on-line, produces a semantic structure for them, and from that generates a French translation (Wilks 1973b, 1975a; Her4kovits 1973).",
        "Thus, as regards English, the system is an analytic one, and is faced with the standard problem that a single English preposition cat introduce many cases (and can, of course, often be translated by a number of French prepositions depending on the case).",
        "Let us consider \"by\", functioning in the following sentences, all of which may be considered to start, like (23), with \"He left Lugano by ...\", where I have indicated the apparent (though disputable) case of the last clause at the right of each line:",
        "(23) He left Lugano by courtesy of the police SOUR (24) by Cornano 7110 (25) by car INST (26) by stealth WAY (27) by Monday night TLOCA (28) by foLlowing the arrows WAY (29) by stet ling a boat INST",

        "36 The paraplates above (24)' to (29)' are a sublist of those stacked under the name of the preposition \"by\" and under the primitive action MOVE that occurs in action position of the left side of each paraplate.",
        "There will also be other sublists of paraplates stored for \"by\" under other primitive actions.",
        "For example, (30) This painting is by Titian would, during its analysis, also access the paraplates under \"by\" but in this case the sublist under BE.",
        "The sublists of paraplates, for a given preposition, that are names by different primitive actions are not ordered with respect to each other.",
        "However, within any sublist, such as the stack (24)' to (29)' above, the paraplates are ordered, in that the paraplate at the top of the stack is applied first, the next only if that fails and so on.",
        "Let us return to the example to see why.",
        "First, DIST case is largely a default case for MOVE as it is cued in by \"by\", in that almost any entity can be an instrument here if we have no reason to beli've it is anything else.",
        "Thus the more specific (24)' must be applied before (25)' in order to match direction case for (24)' since, if the order were reversed' (25)' might match with what \"ought\" to match with (24)% We could imagine something very Specific in (25)' to match the formula for car (such as a formula expressing \"thing for moving humans\"), but that would risk missing 37 \"by cattle truck\" which is not normally used for transporting people.",
        "However, it should be noticed here that the paraplates as described do not have the power to detect an anomaly such as \"John walked home by car\".",
        "The templatesmatching that sentence would be quite properly tied (as INST) by (2$)'.",
        "Any anomaly in it would have to be revealed by later inference.",
        "This is an example of what Lyons (op.cito) means by the criteria of analytic systems being (initially) weaker than those of productive systems.",
        "A stronger but similar argument applies to putting (28)' above (29)' in a preference stack, given the very weak criterion embodied in (29)', that almost any action upon any physical object would satisfy in default; and one could extend this to putting a (23)' above a less specific (26)'.",
        "The main point here is as follows: it is clear that stich paraplates must be applied in some order, but it is not clear that they should be simply ordered.",
        "For example there is no reason why (28)' should be ordered with respect to (24)'.",
        "There is no formal trouble expressing a partial ordering of this sort procedurally.",
        "I argued in (Wilks 1975a) that in many cases we might expect more than one template attached to a fragment at this stage and that we would \"resolve the ambiguity\" by preferring whichever template matched higher up such a preference stack of paraplates.",
        "Order, then, is important in such paraplates stacks, even if it turns out to be only partial order.",
        "38 If such a stack is only partially ordered then we may, in the case of a prepositional phrase with two or more current templates competing to represent it, expect a draw at some stage: that is to say, two possible templates for the same phrase may match with paraplates that are not ordered with respect to each other.",
        "Such a situation might well correspond to an example such as:",
        "(31) John jumped on the box",
        "where the last phrase is genuinely ambiguous between TO and LOCA case (in the sense in which the substitution of \"onto\" for \"on\" could only be interpreted as TO).",
        "Thus under \"on\" we would properly expect MOVE (for \"jump\") paraplates for TO and LOCA to be mutually unordered.",
        "But let us turn to:",
        "(32) He beat the girl with a withered arm",
        "where the case dependence of the prepositional phrase could be either instrumental or a specification of which girl it was.",
        "In such cases one might imagine some expectational force to be drawn from the case content of the formulas.",
        "Thus, if \"beat\" has an instrument group in its formula, we can conceive of using this fact to decide the draw on the grounds that \"beat\" really \"expects\" an instrument, so why not give it one here, and settle the question.",
        "And there might indeed be somc psychological grounds for doing that.",
        "But in general, it is clear that the paraplates do not function expectationally, except in the sense that by looking first at the paraplates most preferred in the stack (for a given preposition and basic action) one could be said to be expecting it.",
        "And that sense of \"expectation\" is perfectly consistent with trying more than one candidate template, for a given phrase or clause., at the same time against the paraplate stack, as we might have to in•a sentence like (33) He beat the dog with a branch where we would not only be resolving the case of the prepositional phrase, but also, and at the same time, the word sense of \"branch\", where the senses of \"branch\" might give rise to a corresponding number of templates and we would always prefer the one that matched further up the paraplate stack, as in (Wilks 1975a).",
        "The reader may have been struck by an overlap of case content between the paraplates and formulas.",
        "For example, in (10) the formula for \"break\", the head action CAUgE has a dependent (THING INST).",
        "Yet, if we were analyzing the standard sentence \"He broke the window with a hammer\", we would expect to use a stack of paraplates under \"with\", containing a substack whose left-hand action was CAUSE, and in it find the appropriate paraplate for tying together the two templates for that sentence with an INST tie.",
        "This latter information might seem to overlap heavily with that contained in the formula (10) and the question arises whether it need be stated twice.",
        "40 However, although the two forms of information overlap there is no reason to believe they are the same: the paraplates reflect the case ambiguity of English prepositions while the formulas reflect only the sorts of case inferences one might subsequently want to make (in extraction, see below).",
        "There is no reason to suppose that one form for data can suffice for both these activities.",
        "However, Schank does make this assumption, and the point here may become clearer after some brief recall of his position on the point.",
        "In (Schank 1973) an account is given of case inferences from a primitive action.",
        "In (34) John shot the girl with a rifle the underlying primitive is PROPEL which forms the center of any conceptualization for \"shoot\".",
        "An obligatory INST inference is always made for PROPEL or, as it was put earlier, ItasT is part of the (obligatory) case frame for PROPEL, and also (a§ it havepens) an optional part of the Fillmorean surface frame for \"shoot\".",
        "In Schank's scheme Instrumental case involves the insertion of another primitive action into the conceptualization' But that is not essential to tne present point which is that, for Schank, PROPEL \"expects\" an instrument, and criteria can be pastulated such that a rifle will fit those criteria, in a way that hair will not, as in (35) John.",
        "shot the girl with long hair.",
        "Thus, for (34) an INST interpr&ation is achieved for \"with\", while in (35), by default, the hair is taken as a specification of the girl.",
        "These solutions are, of course, correct but the different aspects of the phenomena do not seem to connect in procedural terms.",
        "So, for example, Schank is perfectly well aware of the case ambiguity of the preposition 'with\", and even lists four forms of it (ibid, p. 231) corresponding to different cases, along with four \"conceptual realizations for the syntactic item 'with (noun)' \", and specifies that they should be checked in order \"for conceptual validity\", just as paraplates are.",
        "The correspondence to the notions described in this paper (and in Wilks 1973, in, the same volume) is reasonably clear: the inference of an instrument from PROPEL corresponds to an instrument specification in a formula for \"shoot\" (and for Schank it also comes from shoot', rather than more generally from PROPEL, since otherwise it could not be so specific about the instrument being a gun, as PROPEL does not deal generally in guns); whereas the ordered list of case possibilities for \"with\" is not developed, but corresponds roughly to a paraplate stack for \"with\".",
        "But here is the problem: in Schank (1973) the two forms of information do not actually meet in any general way.",
        "Schank writes as if the list of possible case functions of \"with\" is general (i.e. action independent), but we have shown that it may well be specific to different primitive actions, in that there may well be a separate 42 paraplate substack for ear.h primitive action, and may be no short general list of functions of \"with\".$ Schank suggests that the example (34) is resolved because PROPEL and/or \"shoot\" \"expects an instrument\", but that piece of information does not, and cannot, take accouit of the preexistent ambiguity of \"with\": it just happens to fit this example, because PROPEL \"expects\" an instrument and instrumental case is put at the top of the ambiguity list for \"with\" (ibid.",
        "p. 231).",
        "But will this coincidence hold in general?",
        "If we had been dealing not with PROPEL but with some ether primitive, it is not clear that the same order for \"with\" would help.",
        "I described earlier a MOVE primitive underlying \"leave\" (the primitive and its name are not important, only that it is not PROPEL), and con3idered sentences like (36) I left Lugano with Ewo pounds in my pocket which shows that instrumentality is unlikely to be the \"expectation\" for \"with\" from whatever primitive underlies \"leave\".",
        "Hence Schank's list for.",
        "\"with\" is perhaps specific to its use with PROPEL, and he must develop some structure analogous to paraplates and not assume $ i.e. a \"dictionary entry\" for a preposition (like a paraplate sub-track) will be a function of a primitive action.",
        "that the instrumentality of PROPEL suffices: My point is simply that any attempt to introduce generality here will show that another sort of information structure is required to deal with prepositions, one specific to particular prepositions, and that general case inferences (like instrumentality from PROPEL) could only help in special cases.",
        "Any development of \"with\" lists into paraplate substack structures would, I believe, show that the expectational inferences from the primitives play a far smaller role in analysis becausethe criteria they contain will have been procedurally expressed somewhere else.",
        "It is true, however, that there is a strong expectation of a gun-instrument from \"shoot\", and this phenomenon does not fit easily into the paraplate scheme.",
        "It might be necessary to ensure that if a specific instrument were mentioned in a verb formula then that could override subsequent paraplate matching when, it arose.",
        "However, such specific instruments are not the norm for PROPEL, for this primitive presumably also underlies \"break\" for Schank, and there is no such presumption of specific instrument with that verbo Indeed, such an expectation would be bound to lead to error if any object found after \"with\" were taken as an instrument, rather than using a breadth-first approach like paraplates that considers the ranked possibilities for that preposition and that action.",
        "This is especially true for a system like Schanks that has no backup and no",
        "possibility of recovery if it goes wrong.",
        "Formula and paraplate information do sometimes overlap, and suspect Schank's system, that assumes that the same mechanism can serve both functions, draws much of its force by choosing an example from an area like (3.4) where they do overlap.",
        "But how, in the examples of (23)-(29), could we work in general with the ambiguity of \"by\" by assuming that MOVE had sdme strong single case expectation, over and above the fact that some case paraplate (like (24)' for TO) would have necessarily to appear at the top of any substack.",
        "How could Schank express the action-dependent ordering of the rest of the substack?",
        "Another peculiar feature of Schank's treatment of these phenomena is his suggestion (ibid.",
        "p. 232) that any ordering of preposition functions must go \"from the general to the specific\".",
        "Such limited data as are afforded by substacks like (24)' (29)' indicate that it may turn out to be the other way round, because the most general (right-hand) criteria tend to appear in the paraplate at 'the bottom of the substack.",
        "Much though not all, of what has been said about Schank's approach applies to Riesbeck's (1974) implementation of it.",
        "It is again a strongly expectational system, in practice in Riesbeck's case, and that leads to the mentioned defects of a depth-first approach (if implemented without back-up, as it is),since the whole",
        "notion of \"preference\", in case as elsewhere (Wilks 1973a), depends on following a number of possibilities breadth-first for a while before comparing them and committing the system to only one.",
        "Only in that way could one treat, in a general way, examples like (33) that require comparison of how high up a paraplate stack a given interpretation comes relative to others.",
        "Riesbeck's system generates expectations (called \"requests\") from main sentence verbs and uses these to anticipate the case parts of the sentence.",
        "The main difference from Schank's approach, and which makes it a curious implementation of it, is that it deals with prepositions not, as one might expect, by primitive actions seeking certain cases, but by verbs seeking actual preposition names.",
        "So, for example, \"prevent\" he seeks \"from\" and \"by\", just as the computational linguistic systems of the fifties and sixties did.",
        "It also has less power than Schank's theory (and paraplates) in that Riesbeck specifically says (ibid.",
        "p. 95) that requests (including preposition requests presumably) are not ordered.",
        "All this seems to require that all possible preposition sequents be stored for every surface verb in the system which leaves little scope for semantic generalization (the aim of the whole exercise, presumably).",
        "The strong point of difference, between Riesbeck's system and 46 the one described here, concerns the role of uninhibited \"expectations\".$ The examples presented here suggest that one cannot base a system simply on the observation that if someone uses \"by\" after \"leave\" then it will be expected to introduce an instrument.",
        "For \"He left Lugano by day\" does not fit that and yet cannot be said to be violating any expectation.",
        "It is simply that the structural ambiguity of prepositions must be accounted for in a structured and general manner like that ofiered by the paraplates.",
        "The usefulness of expectation-, in any field, depends on (a) the high chances of it being right, and (b) knowing what to do when it is frustrated, and Riesbeck's system seems to lack both these desiderata.",

        "The difference between paraplates and extractions should be clear from (38) because it contains both an INST paraplate-imposed tie between main clause and preposition phrase templates, and an INST extraction from the main clause template yielding an extracted template equivalent to \"John uses a thing(=a shotgun)\".",

        "Let us see how the extractions in (38) are actually obtained.",

        "By way of illustration, we will look at the OBJE and GOAL extractions from the action formula in (39).",
        "The dependent of the OBJE case in (39) shows that \"fire*at\"",

        "Thus, we get an extracted \"short form\" template (converting STRIK to \"strikes\" for uniformity 52 of expression, though it really remains as the primitive): [[John strikes stags]] The extractions for INST and CAUSE require that we are able to look outside the source template for confirmation to other templates.",

        "That could only be achieved with the \"SOURCE specialist\" in the present system from a very full, specific, formula for 'letter' (and extractions can come from nouns and not only from verbs) in which a person) source was specified at the top level of the formula.",

        "Secondly, this way of describing the ergative paradigm is naturally different from Fillmore's because, as has been noted, he is primarily concerned with restrictions of the generation (=production :) of surface sentences by means of his ordered Subject Selection Rule: \"If there is an agent it is the subject, else if there is an exper-iencer it is the subject, else if there is an instrument 0.0. and so onn This way of 160king at things assumes that John must in effect, already be marked as an, agent, hammer as an Instrument or Object and so on.",
        "Simmons' analysis paradigms for the same example are, as we saw at the beginning, an analytic version of that rule.",
        "The difference between those two approaches and the present one is twofold.",
        "First, that the present system is preferential in that John does not",
        "have to be.rnarked as an agent: no confpsion would be caused here, for example, if he was used as an instrument.",
        "Secondly, and more importantly, the construction here of the ergative representation follows not only from the application of the \"case specialists\", but from the general rule of preference (Wilks 1973(1) that as full (or maximally redundant) a representation should be produced as possible.",
        "This is required, in addition to the case specialists, to produce the extraction [[some+animate broke window]] from, the less redundant ergative, (41).",
        "On this ground I would argue that the phenomenon is dealt with here using a more general rule, and moreover, a general rule that drives this whole preference semantics system of analysis.",
        "58 CHARNIAK' S BRITT ON CASE ILL d recent paper, Charniak (1.975) has argued that AI systems that use case notation in their analysis of natural language are rick really making use of case, and the present system is one of those he criticises in this connection.",
        "Arguments along the same general lines are to be found in Welin (1975).",
        "I think Charniak's arguments are important anti stimulating, though in sore ways misguided.",
        "They have the paradoxical sidt – effect of showing that not even Fillmore is really making use of case.",
        "I shall briefly sutitnarise seven aspects of Charniak's complex argument, and make some reply.",
        "(i) The position argument, Charniak distinguishes between case notation and position notation (ibid.",
        "pp.",
        "3-4).",
        "If we have an event of Jack opening the door with a key then, for Charniak, a case form of that would be: (PREDICATE EV OPEN) (AGENT EV JACK) (OBJECT EV DOOR) (INSTRUMENT EV KEY) whereas OPEN(JACK, DOOR, KEY).",
        "would be pure position notation.",
        "He argues that many AI systems claim to be using case notation but in fact are using only position notation: Using places arbitrarily to pass particular case arguments to a predicate.",
        "(ii) The evacuation argument.",
        "Charniak argues that the standard benefit of case the production of, say, the ergative paradigm for",
        "\"open\" from a case representation as in (i) above, together with a subject selection rule --- tan be obtained equally well with the position notation, (ibid.",
        "p. 1.7).",
        "In other words, the whole business can be evacuated of case altogether, with the case names remaining perhaps as \"mnemonic varia4le names\" (ibid.",
        "p. 27).",
        "(iii)The linearity argument.",
        "Charniak argues that the expression of meaning in terms of case is non-linear.",
        "Schematically, if it was linear it would look like: MEANING(LOOK)=NEANING(OBSERVE)+MEANING(AGENT) while the meaning of \"'see\" would have EVERIENCER where the above has AGENT.",
        "However, in AI systems it tends to be non-linear, like: 14•1EANING(LOOK)=MEANING(OBSERVE,AGENT) or, in other words, the meaning of WANING(AGENT) cannot be computed independently of knowing that the agent is the agent of OBSERVE.",
        "(iv) The production argument.",
        "Charniak argues that the notion of case for Fillmore is essentially connected with its productive generative role in controlling surface grammaticality, and that since AI systems are preoccupied with analysis, they are not making use of case.",
        "(v) The case-content argument.",
        "Charniak argues that we are never told what it is to be an agent as such.",
        "This is a subargument 6 0 of (iii) above that one cannot compute MEANING(AGENT) independently.",
        "(vi) The surface analysis argument.",
        "Charniak demands that the \"semantics-based systems\" in AI also do surface case analysis, of the type found in Fillmore's papers.",
        "He argues that some such analyses, like the formula given earlier for \"drink\", actually exclude the surface forms, but I showed earlier that this is not so.",
        "(vii) The case-inference argument.",
        "Charniak argues that a system using case for semantic representation should provide \"case inferences\".",
        ".The meaning of case CASE would then be \"the set of inferences pne tan make 4bout X, knowing only that X is in case CASE\" (ibid.",
        "p. 19)-, In reply, I think Charniak misjudges where the heart of his argument lies by giving undue prominence to rather bizarre arguments like (i) and (ii), whereas the serious ones are those like (iv) and (vi) that draw attention, as this paper has tried to do from a quite different point of view, to the need to relate the use of case in \"semanticsbased understanding systems\" to its original Fillmorean role as a classifier of superficial formsjlike preposition and other case constructions in English.",
        "I would paraphrase Charniak's 2,r-gument on this point, perhaps unfairly, as claiming that \"case\" takes its meaning from surface phenomena and therefore any attempt to locate it only in a deep semantics, wholly divorced from such phenomena, is to make \"case\" meaningless.",
        "answer to that, and it is a serious charge, is the 61 presentation, here and elsewhere, of a system that both parses surface English by means of case and expresses its underlying semantics in the same notation.",
        "The third aspect of Charniak's arguments, like (v) and (vii), is his concern with the precise content of the cases.",
        "This bothers everyone, including Fillmore, who had been unable to provide it, and so if the production of such definitions is made a necessary condition of using case then Fillmore, like everyone else, fails the test.",
        "Let (me, in conclusion, reply to the arguments above in a little more detail.",
        "(i) is, I think, simply confused.",
        "The two (case and position) are simply equivalent forms of information, provided one knows that the \"first argument is the agent\" etc.",
        "etc.",
        "Charniak himself seems to see this when he admits (ibid.",
        "p. 4) that one could have case notation without case, and case without case notation.",
        "(ii) shows only the triviality that any computatichal system could have all its top level notions replaced by gensyms, like COU567, and function in the same way.",
        "This would not however show that the notions being programmed were not essential to the meaningful function, and interpretation of the system.",
        "In any system doing propositional logic, the notion AND can properly be replaced by a truth-table vector 1000, but that does not show that the notion AND represents is",
        "vacuous, or a mere mnemonic convention.",
        "(iii) does not establish that systems must be wholly linear, in Charniak's sense.",
        "however, it would clearly be a defect in a system if, every time an inference about AGENT was made, the system had to look and see what verb it was the agent of, or what the primitive action coding the verb was.",
        "Some examples of Schank's that Charniak discusses do show that this access to the head primitive is sometimes made, and Charniak then argues that the case is ipso facto dispensible, and the inferences are \"better seen As inferencesfronm-itive action.",
        "But,.",
        "as I pointed out, when discussing extraction, tfte \"case specialists\" in,the present system, at least, do not generally make such reference back to the action head.",
        "So, for example, the \"GOAL-specialist\" did not have to find out, before operating, what the action was that a given GOAL was a goal of.",
        "(iv) and (vi) These arguments are partly true but their points are met by presenting a system, like the preference semantics one, that uses case both as a semantic representation and a parsing mechanism (the paraplates).",
        "(v) It is true that no system, Fillmore's included, has given precise definition of the cases beyond the most general indications, such as that agency is concerned with initiating force etc.",
        "This criticism is true far beyond case: it applies equally to notions of thinghood, causation and movement etc.",
        "It is just a fact that basic",
        "semantic notions are vague,and perhaps necessarily so.",
        "It is certainly no ground for lament, and does not prevent us speaking precisely in everyday life.",
        "Provided, therefore, that a programmed system can perform precisely using these vague notions, we can demand no more.",
        "The fallacy is to imagine that underneath the vague notions used in thought, speech and writing, there must lie precise criteria for their use.",
        "This is a persistent fallacy that has received much attention in Twentieth Century philosophy.",
        "In the present system, as in many others, specifications (select-Tonal or preferential) are given of the agents of particular actions (human for \"thinkV animate for \"see\", and so on).",
        "One could argue that \"agents as such\" are, if anything, the union df all such agents, but that will not, and cannot, yield an intensional definition of the notion.",
        "Extraction operating on such specificatidus (the \"SUBJspecialist\") yields inferences such as that \"some animate does so and se but these do not meet Charniak's uuluand in (vii) above.",
        "It'is worth noting-at this point that Charniak puts his demand (or test for \"using ease\") in such a way (in points (v) and (vii) above) that it is hard to see what could satisfy it: what result of computation could we conceivably expect as the value of NEANING(AGENT)?",
        "I would maintain that extractions, as described above, are most certainly \"case inferences\", but are not \"the set of inferences one 64 can make about X, knowing only that X is in case CASE\" (ibid.",
        "p. 19) because that set is not the sort of thing one wants to know in a language understanding system.",
        "The \"case specialists\" in operation produced inferences by taking information from the appropriate points in the representation; but from knowing merely that John is an agent nothing interesting follows or could follow!",
        "(And from that fact nothing follows to the effect that agency is vacuous, as Charniak seems to think).",
        "The most that could follow would be that John does something or instigates some att.",
        "We could hardly infer at that point that John was animate, because that is presumably information generally attached to \"John\", and, in any case, some verbs (like \"calculate\") may have a selection or preference restriction on their agent that is more general than animate, so that being animate could not follow from being an agent.",
        "To infer anything useful, as in the extractions earlier in the Raper, we have to look not just at what John is the agent of (which would make the whole thing circular for Charniak, by argument jai), but potentially at all the information available in the representation.",
        "It is, perhaps, significant that agent is the case that makes Charniak's point best.",
        "The other extractions answer it better, for example in the way the \" INST-specialist\" creates an extracted template with action USE; or the way the \"GOAL-specialist\" extracted an",
        "inference \"John strikes stags\" in a manner independent of the fact that the source action was \"fire at\", for the \"GOAL-specialist\" did not consult the source verb name or its head primitive action CAUSE.",
        "Or, again, the way in which common-sense inference rules (Walks 1973c, 1975a, 1975b, but not discussed in this paper) would operate on any such extracted GOAL template and infer that the corresponding agent wanted the GOAL (whatever it was).",
        "And an inference rule like this latter can operate only if it can locate the corresponding agent.",
        "So, when we extracted the GOAL equivalent to \"John strikes stags\", we would have (in order to operate the new inference rule) to be able to find that John was the agent of the extracted template if we Wanted tp infer further that John wanted to strike the stags.",
        "The agent (John) will of course be the formula in the first position of the extracted template, and Charniak might then say that that does not require agency but only access to a first template position.",
        "This would be a reversion to the bad position argument (1), and the answer is simply that the mechanism goes to the first position because that is where the agent has been put; in just the way that dollars are written before the decimal point and cents afterwards yet that fact does not allow us to dispense with the notions of dollars and cents in financial calculations.",
        "However, the important point here is that the \"seeker of the agent\" would seek it generally: it would not matter what the action (striking) in the extracted template was.",
        "The real point behind Charniak's \"position\" argument (i) is that no AI systems have such general routines, and hence an agent for one verb could be stored quite differently from that for another because there are no such routines that would ever find this out!",
        "And that I believe is not the case."
