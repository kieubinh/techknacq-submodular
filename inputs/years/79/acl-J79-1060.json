        "All computer based text synthesis systems require a means for generating sentence-level pitch contours.",

        "The pitch contours in currently operational text synthesis systems are still not perfectly natural-sounding and thus computer generation of pitch contours is a topic of current interest.",
        "This interest is shown, for example, by Allen as he discusses pause and duration in text synthesis and then goeson to say: If temporal control presents great problems in the description of speech, then the problems of fundamental frequency 1f0), or pitch control, are at least as difficult.",
        "Once again, problems arise due to the fact that the £0 is correlated wi4th many factors, including vowel tongue height, previous consonant, breath group contour, syntactic and semantic content of words, whether a sentence is a question, intonation effects, and word boundary glottalization.",
        "(Allen, 1976: 440) Given the need for further research in pitch control, a question remains of how to approach the problem.",
        "The authors feel it is important to work within a linguistic model that interrelates semantic and phonetic phenomena.",
        "Later on in Allen's article he makes the following statement (which coincides with our philosophy): The current use of sophisticated means for pitch recording, coupled with increased interaction between linguistic and speech researchers, should, however, lead to significantly Improved pitch control programs which are based on sound linguistically motivated theory.",
        "(Allen, 1976: 441) The need for interation between linguistics and speech research is further explained by Umeda (1976: 450): The message realization forms one structure as a whole.",
        "Its constituents-acoustic realization, higher level 7 prosody, and syntax-semantics-interact with each other very closely; a decision Made at any level derives immediately from the obtained result it the level above, and afferts a decision at the level below.",
        "The remainder of this section consists of a survey of some of the current work in this area in the USA (at MIT, Bell Labs, and Stanford University), in Germany, and in the USSR.",

        "A.",
        "IT At MIT, Allen (1976) is working on pitch control as an element in his overall plan to produce a system capable of producing synthetic speech from unrestricted English text.",
        "He points out that although a syntactic and Semantic analysis is needed, no existing automatic algorithm can provide that analysis reliably for entire sentences of unrestricted text.",
        "So he has elected to do a local analysis of the sentence first and then tie together the local analyses into a sentence level analysis if possible.",
        "The analyzer is thus designed so that if at some point complete sentence analysis is blocked, the partlal analyses are still useful in generating the pitch contour and other prosodic controls such as duration and pause.",
        "In response to tne need for a theoretical framework for relating a text and its pitch contour, Allen is using the ideas of Halliday (1970) (e.g. discourse focus) to .,ivestigate such questions as when and why elements of a verb string are stressed.",
        "For example, he notes that the sentence \"A fatter was eating the carrot\" will receive emphasis on \"eating\" if'it is in response to a question about what the farmer is doing.",

        "Ills method for generating the pitch contour was to record several sentences of the specified type using random words and to average the natural pitch contours to obtairi prototype contours.",
        "Then the contour foir each word vas approximated by a fourth order polynomial to \"facilitate linear stretching and compression of the fundamental frequency contour.\"",

        "Umeda's algorithm for controlling prosodic palaweters is based on a syntactic analysis of the input text.",
        "The analyzer fits each clause into a template consisting of the following optional slots: sentence modifier, subject, verb, object or complement, tail modifier, and punctuation mark.",
        "A point where the above order of template elements is violated is marked as a boundary, knd buundaries are later used to assign pauses and intonation (Umeda, 1975).",
        "which, ultimately, is intended to do synthesis in real time for use in computer-assisted instruction at IMSSS (Levine, 1976).",
        "Their technique is to compile a lexicon of words in LPC code (Atal and Banauerv 1971) and then, when a given sentence is to be synthesized, concatenate the code for each word, adjusting durations and pitch contours as needed.",
        "WhiJe Olive throws away the original pitch contour of each word, the IMSSS approach is to adjust the original contour of the word and then further smooth the contour so that each word will not sound sentence final.",

        "Complementary to pitch contour generation, is the study of the perception of pitch contours.",
        "In Germany Isacenko and Schadlich (1970), performed an interesting series of experiments on the perception of German intonation.",
        "Natural sentences illustrating different intonation patterns were recorded and monotonised at various fundamental frequencies (e.g. 150 Hertz and 178.6 Hertz).",
        "Then the tapes of the monotone versions were cut and spliced at various points.",
        "The spliced tapes thus had an artificially simplified intonation of exactly two tone levels.",
        "The team found that they could change the way listeners perceived certain ambiguous sentences by changing only the points at which tone switches occurred.",

        "(1976) have also performed some experiments in manipulating pitch contours while leaving other parameters constant.",
        "They are interested in finding ways to \"decrease the amount of information necessary for the description of pitch curves without distorting the parameters interpreted by man as prosodic characteristics of a sentence.\"",
        "They base this search on the assumption that man has only a limited short term memory available for storing the pitch contour and so makes decisions concerning the prosody of a sentence by extracting prosodic features which contain considerably less information than that needed to reconstruct exactly the same pitch contour.",
        "They conclude from these experiments that decisions such as declarative versus interrogative are based on the position of the rise or fall in pitch and not on the difference in pitch from high to low.",
        "They also conclude that in determining emphasis, the position of the peak value of the second derivative of the pitch contour is very significant.",
        "F. Brigham Young University (BYD) The research in pitch contour generation to be described in this paper addresses basically the same questions as the various projects surveyed above:",
        "(1) What theoretical base might one use to represent syntactiè and semantic information?",

        "(3) What aspects of the pitch contour (e.g. 1st and 2nd derivatives, transitions relative to key syllables, and actual frequenty) are significant in causing intonation and emphasis options to be perceived?",
        "(4) What synthesis technique should be used to incorporate the",
        "prosodic controls into a working system (e.g. LPC synthesis, formant synthesis, or articulatory synthesis)?",

        "Junction Grammar refers to a linguistic model formulated by Lytle (1974).",

        "For this reason, other researchers (e.g., Allen at MIT, Umeda at Bell Labs, and Levine at Stanford) have chosen to use a simple representation which can be obtained automatically.",
        "The authors' research, however, takes advantage of a larger project (Lytle, 1975) which uses man-machine interaction to obtain a more powerful representation than can be obtained automatically.",
        "Therefore, it was decided to use the full power of Junction Grammar representations in hopes of a future automatic analyzer rather than use some 'restricted version of Junction Grammar And be forced to add to it piece by piece to account for more and more phenomena.",
