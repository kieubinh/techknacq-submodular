        "In such systems, the common alternatives are data-directed rule invocation, in which a rule is considered \"useful\" if its situation part matches the data base, and goal-Li 5 directed rule invocation, in which a rule is \"useful\" if its action part will help the system reach its current goal.",
        "Many systems use a combination of goal and data-directed rule invocation.",
