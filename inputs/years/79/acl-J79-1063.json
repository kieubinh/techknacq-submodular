        "This paper considers a subclass of inferences, known as presupposition and entailment.",
        "We exhibit many of their properties.",

        "The system we have described computes this subclass of inferences while parsing a sentence.",
        "It uses the augmented transition network (AM.",
        "While parsing a sentence, the ATN graph retrieves the tree transformations from the lexicon for any words in the sentence, and applies the tree transformation to the appropriate portion of the semantic representation of the sentence, to obtain entailments and presuppositions.",
        "Further, when a specific syntactic construct having a presupposition is parsed, the ATN generates the corresponding presupposition using tree transformations.",
        "That presupposition and entailment are inferences is obvious.",
        "However, the requirement in their definition that they be independent of the situation (all context not represented structurally) is strong.",
        "Hence, it is clear that presupposition and entailment are strictly a subclass of inferences.",
        "As one would hope in studying a restricted class of a more general phenomenon, this subclass of inferences exhibits several computational and linguistic aspects not exhibited by the general class of inferences.",
        "Some of these are 1) presupposition and entailment seem to be tied to the definitional (semantic) structure and syntactic structure of language, 2) presupposition and entailment exhibit complex interaction of semantics and syntax; they exhibit necessary, but not sufficient, semantics of individual, words and syntactic constructs, and 3) for the case of presupposition and entailment,there is a natural solution to the problem of knowing when to stop drawing inferences, which is an important problem in inferencing, in general."

        "Definitions",
        "In this section, we define the inferences we are interested in( presupposition and entailment), and comment on our use of the terms \"pragmatics\" and \"context\".",
        "In order to specify the subclasses of inferences we are studying, we need some preliminary assumptions and definitions.",
        "Inferences, in general, must be made given a particular body of pragmatic information and with respect to texts.",
        "Since sentences are the simplest cases of texts, we are concentrating on them.",
        "Presuppositions and entailments are particularly useful inferences for studying texts having sentences containing embedded sentences, and they may be studied to a limited extent independent of pragmatic information.",
        "1.1 Subformula-derived We assume that the primary goal of the syntactic component of a natural language system is to translate from natural language sentences to meaning representations selected in an artificial language.",
        "Assume further, that the meaning representations selected for English sentences have a syntax Which may be approximated by a context-free grammar.",
        "By \"approximated\", we mean that there is a context-free grammar of the semantic representations, though the language given by the grammar may include some strings which have no interpretation.",
        "(For instance, the syntax of ALGOL is often approximated by a Backus-Naur form specification.)",
        "Since we have assumed a context-free syntax for the semantic representations, we may speak of the semantic representations as well-formed formulas and as having well-formed subformulas and tree representations.",
        "-7-As long as the assumption of context-free syntax for semantic representations is satisfied, the same algorithms and data structures of our system can be used regardless of choice of semantic primitives or type of semantic representation.",
        "Let S and S' be sentences with meaning representations L and L' respectively.",
        "If there is a well-formed subforaula P of L and same tree transformation F such that L' = F(P), then we say S' may be subformula-derived from S. The type of tree transformations that are acceptable for F have been formalized and studied extensively in computational linguistics as finite-state tree transformations.",
        "The main point of this work is that the presuppositions and entailments of a sentence may be subformula-derived.",
        "We have built a system by which we may specify subformulas P and tree transformations F. The system then automatically generates presuppositions and entailments from an input sentence S. 1.2 Pragmatics and Context We use context to refer to the situation in which a sentence may occur.",
        "Thus, it would include all discourse prior to the sentence under consideration, beliefs of the interpreter, i.e., in short the state of the interpreter.",
        "We use pragmatics to describe all phenomena (and computations modelling them) that reflect the.",
        "effect of context.",
        "1.3 Entailment A sentence S entails a sentence S' if and only if in every context in which S is true, S' is also true.",
        "We may say then that S' is an entailment of S. This definition is used within linguistics more as a test rather than as a rule in a formal system.",
        "One discovers empirically whether S' is an entailment of S by trying to construct a context in which S is true, but in which S' is false.",
        "Entailment is not the same as material implication.",
        "For instance, let S by \"John managed to kiss Mary,\" which entails sentence S', \"John kissed Mary.\"",
        "Givon (1973) argues that even if \"lost is true, we would not want to say that \"John did not manage to kiss Mary.\"",
        "The reason is that \"manage\" seems to presume an attempt.",
        "Hence, if John did not kiss Mary, we cannot conclude that John did not manage to kiss Mary, for he may not have attempted to kiss Mary.",
        "Though S entails S', it is not the case that S 0 S', since that would require futS'povS.",
        "We have shown that entailments may be subformula-derived, that is, that they may be computed by structural means.",
        "As an example, consider the sentence S below; one could represent its meaning representation as L. S entails S', with meaning representation L'.",
        "and the internal negation of S entails S'.",
        "(Other definitions of presupposition have been proposed, Kartunnen (1973) discusses various definitions.)",
        "From the definition one can easily see that all semantic presuppositions S' of S are also entailments of S. However, the converse is not true, as the sentence S and 3' above show.",
        "Again, this definition is primarily meant as a linguistic test for empirically determining the presuppositions of a sentence and not as a rule in a formal system.",
        "Note that the truth of a presupposition of a sentence is a necessary condition for the sentence to have a truth value at all.",
        "If any of the presuppositions are not true, the sentence is anomolous.",
        "For instance, the sentence \"The greatest prime number is°23.\"",
        "presupposes that there is a greatest prime number.",
        "The fact that there is none explains why the sentence is anomolous.",
        "Other authors have referred to the concept of presupposition as \"given information\".",
        "Haviland and Clark (1975) as well as Clark and Haviland (1976) suggest a process by which humans use given information in understanding utterances.",
        "They present much psychological and linguistic evidence that confirms their hypothesis.",
        "As an example of a subformula derived presupposition consider",
        "well formed subformula in this case is all of Ll.",
        "The tree transformation from Ll to Ll' offers a nontrivial example of a subformula-derived presupposition.",
        "Notice that one might wonder, whether sentence S1 and the meaning of \"stop\" were understood if one did not.know that S1' must be true whether John stopped or not.",
        "In this sense, presupposition is necessary (but not sufficient) knowledge for understanding natural language.",
        "We have shown that presuppositions (as we have defined them above) may be subformula-derived.",
        "Henceforth, we will use \"entailment\" to mean an entailment which is not also a presupposition."

        "Men, we may associate with that particular path the tree transformation -28-yielding the presupposition of that syntactic construct.",
        "For instance, cleft sentences are syntactically marked as the word \"it\", followed by a tensed form of \"be\", followed by either a noun phrase or a prepositional phrase, followed by a relative clause.",
        "The path(s) in the graph might be as below.",
        "Associated with this path would be a trivial tree transformation which returns the semantic representation of the relative clause as a presupposition.",
        "The second principle deals with ambiguity.",
        "Even though we have structured the graphs in the way above, the same surface form may arise from two different syntactic constructs, one having a presupposition and the other not.",
        "In such a case, our system (and in fact any parser) should be able to give semantic representations for both parses; with one parse our system yields a presupposition, with the other parse our system would not have the presupposition.",
        "It is the role of general semantic and pragmatic components to distinguish which semantic representation is intended in the context.",
        "In fact, the difference in the presuppositions with the differing parses is one criterion which general semantic and pragmatic components could use to resolve the ambiguity.",
        "For generating presuppositions of words (lexical entries), the chief-problems are how to encode the tree transformation in the lexicon (dictionary) -29-and when to apply it during parsing.",
        "In general a tree transformation would have a left hand side which is the pattern to be Matched if the transformation is to apply and a right hand side giving the transformed structure.",
        "The reason we can encode the left hand side in the grammar is simple.",
        "All of the examples in the literature dealing with presuppositions from lexical entries have in common the fact that the existence of the presupposition depends only upon the syntactic environment of the word and the word itself.",
        "Hence, we can structure the graph of the grammar in a way that the paths correspond to the necessary syntactic environments.",
        "Upon encountering a word of the appropriate syntactic category in such a syntactic environment, the system looks in the lexicon under that word for the (possibly empty) set of right hand sides of tree transformations.",
        "The way of writing the right hand sides assumes that the parser in traversing a path undoes the syntactic construct encoded in that path, and assigns the components of the semantic representation according to their logical role in the sentence rather than their syntactic role.",
        "(This is not a new idea, but rather has been used in several systems predating ours.",

        "Thus, we can assume a convention for naming registers and assigning components of the semantic representation to them, independent of the syntactic environment.",

        "This, then, is how we integrate the tree transformations for presuppositions into the parse.",

        "A further complication was illustrated in section 3, for a chain of entailments must be set up.",
        "For entailments, we encode the left hand side and right hand side in the same way as the lexical examples of presuppositions.",
        "However, for entailments, for each right hand side we also encode three other pieces of information.",
        "They are the precondition of whether negation must be present (or absent), whether the entailed proposition is negative or not, and whether the entailed propositional corresponds to the left sub-tree or right sub-tree.",
        "At each sentential level, we verify that the left hand side of the tree transformation is present.",
        "If it is, we make the transformation indicated in the lexicon and save the resulting proposition along with the other three pieces of information mentioned above associated with it.",
        "We save this in a binary tree, one level of tree per sentential level.",
        "It is a binary tree since all predicates taking embedded sentences seem to permit only one or two of its arguments to be embedded sentences.",

        "Presupposition and entailment comprise a special class of inferences, distinguished in three ways.",
        "First, they both may be computed structurally (by tree transformations), independent of context not inherent in the structure.",
        "Second, although inferences in general are conjectural, presupposition and entailment may be reliably asserted; entailments are true if the sentence entailing them is true; presuppositions are true whether the sentence presupposing them is true or false.",
        "Third, since presupposition and entailment are tied to the definitional and syntactic structure of the language, they do not spawn themselves nor lead to a chain reaction explosion, as other inferences may.",
        "We suggest two areas of future research.",
        "One is to derive a means of accounting for presuppositions arising from syntactic constructs, in a way consistent with using semantic primitives to account for lexical examples of presupposition and entailment.",
        "A second area is suggested by the interaction of syntax and semantics evident in presuppositions arising from syntactic constructs.",
        "A study of phenomena that cut across the boundaries of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics and a computational model incorporating them could prove very fruitful to our understanding of natural languages.",
