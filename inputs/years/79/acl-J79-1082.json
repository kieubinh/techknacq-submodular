        "His continued existence depends on his ability to recognize similarities and differences between objects and events in his physical universe and to make known these similarities and differences linguistically.",
        "Indeed, the very development of the human mind seems to have been closely related to the perception of discontinuities in nature.",
        "In view of this, the study of folk taxonomic systems, which have received a great deal of interest in recent years, has a high significance in interpreting the logical processes going on in our minds, as well as in understanding the application and utility of the taxonomic systems themselves.",

        "However, \"birds have wings\" is expected to be true at all times for all birds; it is a pathological situation if a counterexample is found.",
        "To represent the arguments of occasional predications., the typical (TYP) arc is used.",
        "Thus the \"bird\" in \"birds eat worms\" is as in Figure 2.",
        "It is also possible to use the typical relation to attach occasional properties to members of categories, i.e., to instances.",

        "For example, Wiliam Proxmire before and after his hair transplant is still William Proxmire.",
        "Also an object may participate in many different actions but still preserve its identity, e.g., Albert Einstein playing a violin and Albert Einstein writing on a blackboard remains Albert Einstein.",
        "In the system each different situatign involves a distinct node.",
        "To a node defined by an instance are linked, by manifestation arcs, nodes that correspond to an object in its different guises.",
        "Manifestations of \"William Proxmire\" are shown in Figure 2.",
        "Manifestations do not usually have names different from that of their parent instance; a rare exception to this is the Evening Star and the Morning Star which are both Venus at different times of the day.",
        "Manifestations of varietal and typical concepts are also possible.",
        "The latter are used for properties that are true of the concept but only at some point or period of time, for example, \"vertebrates are born\", Figure 2.",
        "For typical arcs this notion is redundant as typical embodies spatial and temporal indeterminancy.",
        "However manifestation does have a use with the typical arc in representing coreference.",

        "The \"person\" in the encoded event is a typicalised \"person\", but it must be the same person that trips that is hurt.",

        "more will be said later about the formal representation of the causal relation",
        "indicated in Figure 2.",

        "Other systems, Quillian (1969), Rumelhart et al.",
        "(1972), and Schank (1975a), do not use manifestation but capture object constancy by having one and the same node for a participant in all of its propositions.",
        "This is a viable alternative.",
        "Nevertheless, information on the relative standing of the appearances of the participant has to be representable.",
        "If a single node were used in the encyclopedia, the differentiation could be made on the modality nodes of the propositions.",
        "This route was not taken as it is more convenient, for example, to let the nature of the inheritance be determined completely in paradigmatic organization, rather than in a mixture of paradigmatic and discursive structures.",
        "For even without manifestation, the varietal structure will require the process of inheritance.",
        "Of the four arcs, variety, typical, and manifestation can be iterated; instance cannot.",
