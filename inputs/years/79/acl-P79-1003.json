        "Such a mechanism can be viewed in an entirely analogous fashion to the mechanisms just described for performing local disambiguation of word senses.",
        "Rather than word experts, however, the experts on this level are conceptual in nature.",
        "The concept level thus becomes the main level of activity and a new level call it the schema level workspace, turns into the main repository for idterred information.",
        "When a concept bin has closed, a concept expert is retrieved from a disk file, and initialized.",
        "If it is an event concept, its function is to fill its conceptual cases with settings and pictures; if it is a setting or picture, it must determine its schematic role.",
        "The activity on this level therefore, involves higher order processing than sense discrimination, but occurs in just about the same way.",
        "The ambiguities involved in mapping known concepts into conceptual case schemata appear identical to those having to do with mapping words into concepts.",
        "Discovering that the word \"pit maps in a certain context to the notion of a \"fruit pit\" requires the same abilities and knowledge as realizing that \"the red house\" maps in some context to the notion of \"a location for smoking pot and listening to records\".",
        "The implementation of the mechanisms to carry out this next level of inferential disambiguation has already begun.",
        "It should be quite clear that this schematic level is by no means the end of the line -- active expert-based plot following and general text understanding fit nicely into the word expert framework and constitute its logical extension."

        "The Word Expert Parser is a theory of organization and control for a conceptual language analyzer.",
        "Thq control environment is characterized by a collection ot generator-like coroutines, called word experts, which cooperatively arrive at a conceptual interpretation of an input sentence.",
        "Many forms of linguistic and non-linguistic knowledge are available to these experts in performing their task, including control state knowledge and knowledge of the world, and by eliminating all but the most persistent forms of ambiguity, the parser models human processing.",
        "This new model of parsing claims a number of theoretical advantages: (1) Its representations of linguistic knowledge reflect the enormous redundancy in natural languages -- without this redundancy in the model, the inter-expert handshaking (seen in many forms in the example parse) would not be possible.",
        "(2) The model suggests some interesting approaches to language acquisition.",
        "Since much of a word expert's knowledge is encoded in a branching discrimination structure, adding new information about a word involves the addition of a new branch.",
        "This branch would be placed in the expert at the point where the contextual clues for disambiguating the new usage differ from those present for a known usage.",
        "(3) Idiosyncratic uses of language are easily encoded, since the word expert provides a clear way to do so.",
        "These uses are indistinguishable from other uses in their encodings in the model.",
        "(4) The parser represents a cognitively plausible model of sequential coroutine-like processing in human language understanding.",
        "The organization of linguistic knowledge around the word, rather than the rewrite rule, motivates interesting conjectures about the flow of control in a human language understander."
