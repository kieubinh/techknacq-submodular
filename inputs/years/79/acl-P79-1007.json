        "Augmented transition network (ATM) grammars have, since their development by Woods (70), become the most used method of describing grammars for natural language understanding and question answering systems.",
        "The advantages of the ATN notation have been summarized as \"1) perspicuity, 2) generative power, 3) efficiency of representation, 4) the ability to capture linguistic regularities and generalities, and 5) efficiency of operation\" (1,p.191).",
        "The usual method of utilizing an ATN grammar in a natural language system is to provide an interpreter which can take any ATM grammar, a lexicon, and a sentence as data and produce either a parse of a sentence or a message that the sentence does not conform to the grammar.",
        "A compiler has been written (2;3) which takes an ATM grammar as input and produces a specialized parser for that grammar, but in this paper we will presume that an interpreter is being used.",
        "A particular ATM grammar may be viewed as a program written in the ATM language.",
        "The program takes a sentence, a linear sequence of symbols, as input, and produces as output a parse which is usually a parse tree (often represented by a LISP S-expression) or some \"knowledge representation\" such as a semantic network.",
        "The operation of the program depends on the interpreter being used and the particular program (grammar), as well as on the input (sentence) being processed.",
        "Several methods have been described for using ATN grammars for sentence generation.",
        "One method (1,p.235) is to replace the usual interpreter by a generation interpreter which can take an ATM grammar written for parsing and use it to produce random sentences conforming to the grammar.",
        "This is useful for testing and debugging the grammar.",
        "Another method (5] uses a modified interpreter to generate sentences from a semantic network.",
        "In this method, an ATM register is initialized to hold a node of the semantic network and the input to the grammar is a linear string of symbols providing a pattern of the sentence to be generated.",
        "Another method (4] also generates sentences from a semantic network.",
        "In this method, input to the grammar is the semantic network itself.",
        "That is, instead of successive words of a surface sentence or successive symbols of a linear sentence pattern being scanned as the ATM grammar is traversed by the interpreter, different nodes of the semantic network are scanned.",
        "The grammar controls the syntax of the generated sentence based on the structural properties of the semantic network and the information contained therein.",
        "It was intended that a single ATM interpreter could be used both for standard ATM parsing and for generation based an this last method.",
        "However, a special interpreter was written for generation grammars of the type described in 04], and, indeed, the definition of the ATM formalism given in that paper, though based on the standard ATM formalism, was inconsistent enough with the standard notation that a single interpreter could not be used.",
        "This paper reports the results of work carried out to remove those inconsistencies.",
        "A generalization of the ATM formalism has been derived which allows a single interpreter to be used for both parsing and generating grammars.",
        "In fact, parsing and generating grammars can be sub-networks of each other.",
        "For example an ATM grammar can be constructed so that the \"parse\""

        "In our view, each node of a semantic network represents a concept.",

        "The syntactic category of the surface string is determined by the grammar, which can include testa of the structure of the semantic network connected to the node.",
        "In order to express the concept, it is often necessary to include in the string substrings which express the concepts represented by adjacent nodes.",
        "For example, if a node represents a fact to be expressed as a state.. ment, part of the statement may be a noun phrase expressing the concept represented by the node connected to the original node by an AGENT case arc.",
        "This can be done by a recursive call to a section of the grammar in charge of building noun phraaes.",
        "This section will be passed the adjacent node.",
        "When it finishes, the original statement section of the grammar will continue adding additional substrings to the growing statement.",
        "In ATM grammars written for parsing, a recursive push does not change the input symbol being examined, but when the, original level continues, parsing continues at a different symbol.",
        "In the generation approach we use, a recursive push often involves a change in the semantic node being examined, and the original level continues with the original node.",
        "This difference is a major motivation of some of the generalizations to the ATM formalism discussed below.",
        "The other major motivation is that, in parsing a string of symbols, the \"next\" symbol is well defined, but in \"parsing\" a network, \"next\" must be explicitly specified."
