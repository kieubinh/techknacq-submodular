        "KM is a computer program which creates multi-paragraph, Natural Language text from • computer representation of knowledge to be delivered.",
        "We have addressed a number of issues not previously encountered in the generation of Natural Language at the multi-sentence level, viz: ordering among sentences and the scope of each, quality comparisons between alternative aggregations of sub-sentential units, the coordination of communication with non-linguistic activities by a goal-pursuing planner, and the use of dynamic models of speaker and hearer to shape the text to the task at hand."

        "The KDS organization reflects our novel paradigm: FRAGMENT AND-COMPOSE.",
        "KIM decomposes the original network into fragments then orders and aggregates these according to the dictates of the text-producing task, not according to the needs for which the internal representation was originally conceived.",
        "KDS has shown the feasibility of this approach.",
        "The KDS organization is a simple pipeline: FRAGMENT, PLAN, FILTER, HILL-CLIMB, and OUTPUT.",
        "FRAGMENT transforms the selected portion of the semantic net into an unordered set of propositions which correspond, roughly, to minimal sentences.",
        "PLAN uses goal-sensitive rules to impose an ordering on this set of fragments.",
        "A typical planning rule Is: \"When conveying a scene in which the hearer is to Identify himself with one of the actors, express all propositions involving that actor AFTER those which do not, and separate these two partitions by a paragraph break\".",
        "FILTER, deletes from the set, all propositions currently represented as known by the hearer.",
        "HILL-CLIMB coordinates two sub-activities: AGGREGATOR applies rules to combine two or three fragments into a single one.",
        "A typical aggregation rule is: \"The two fragments 'x does A' and 'x does B' can be combined into a single fragment: 'x does A and Ir.",
        "PREFERENCER evaluates each proposed new fragment.",
        "producing a numerical measure of its \"goodness\".",
        "A typical preference rule is: \"When instructing the hearer, increase the accumulating measure by 10 for each occurrence of the symbol 'YOU–.",
        "HILL-CLIMB uses AGGREGATOR to generate new candidate sets of fragments, and PREFERENCER, to determine which new set presents the best one-step improvement over the current set.",
        "The objective function of HILL-CLIMB has been enlarged to also take into account the COST OF FOREGONE OPPORTUNITIES.",
        "This has drastically improved the initial performance, since the topology abounds with local maxima.",
        "KDS has used, at one time or another, on the order of 10 planning rules, 30 aggregation rules and 7 preference rules.",
        "The aggregation and preference rules are directly analogous to the capabilities of linguistic competence and performance, respectively.",
        "OUTPUT is a simple (two pages of LISP) text generator driven by a context free grammar."
