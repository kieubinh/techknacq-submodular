        "It is widely recognized that the process of understanding natural language texts cannot be accomplished without accessing mundane knowledge about the world [2, 4, 6, 7).",
        "That is, in order to resolve ambiguities, form expectations, and make causal connections between events, we must make use of all sorts of episodic, stereotypic and factual knowledge.",
        "In this paper, we are concerned with the way functional knowledge of objects, and associations between objects can be exploited in an understanding system.",
        "Consider the sentence",
        "(1) John opened the bottle so he could pour the wine.",
        "Anyone reading this sentence makes assumptions about what happened which go far beyond what is stated.",
        "For example, we assume without hesitation that the wine being poured came from inside the bottle.",
        "Although this seems quite obvious, there are many other interpretations which are equally valid.",
        "John could be filling the bottle rather than emptying the wine out of it.",
        "In fact, it need not be true that the wine ever contacted the bottle.",
        "There may have been some other reason John had to open the bottle first.",
        "Yet, in the absence of a larger context, some causal Inference mechanism forces us (as human understanders) to find the common interpretation in the process of connecting these two events causally.",
        "In interpreting this sentence, we also rely on an understanding of what it means for a bottle to be \"open\".",
        "Only by using knowledge of what is possible when a bottle is open are able we understand why John had to open the bottle to pour the wine out of it.",
        "Strong associations are at work here helping us to make these connections.",
        "A sentence such as (2) John closed the bottle and poured the wine.",
        "appears to be self contradictory only because we assume that the wine was in the bottle before applying our knowledge of open and closed bottles to the situation.",
        "Only then do we realize that closing the bottle makes it impossible to pour the wine.",
        "Now consider the sentence",
        "(3) John turned on the faucet and filled his glass.",
        "When reading this, we immediately assume that John filled his glass with water from the faucet.",
        "let, not only is water never mentioned in the sentence, there is nothing there to explicitly relate turning on the faucet and filling the glass.",
        "The glass could conceivably be filled with milk from a carton.",
        "However, in the absence of some greater context which forces a different interpretation on us, we immediately assume that the glass is being filled with water from the faucet.",
        "Understanding each of these sentences requires that we make use of associations we have in memory between objects and actions commonly involving those objects, as \"This work was supported in part by the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Department of Defense and monitored by the Office of Naval Research under contract N00014-75-C-1111.",

        "Object Primitives (OP) were designed to act in conjunction with Schank's conceptual dependency representational system (M.

        "By encoding Information in OP descriptions, we were able to increase the interpretive power of the analyzer in order to handle sentences of the sort discussed earlier.",

        "For those unfamiliar with the primitive acts of Schank's conceptual dependency theory, discussions of which can be found in [10,11].",
        "The Ooject Primitive CONNECTOR is used to indicate classes of actions (described in terms of Schank's primitives acts) which are normally enabled by the object being described.",
        "In particular, a CONNECTOR enables actions between two spatial regions.",
        "For example, a window and a door are both CONNECTORs which enable motion (PTRANS) of objects through them when they are open.",
        "In addition, a window is a CONNECTOR which enables the action ATTEND eyes (see) or MTRANS (acquisition of information) by the instrumental action ATTEND eyes.",
        "These actions are enabled regardless of whether the window is open or closed.",
        "That is, one can see through a window, and therefore read or observe things on the other side, even when the window is closed.",
        "In the examples discussed above, the open bottle is given a CONNECTOR description.",
        "This will be discussed further later.",
        "A SEPARATOR disenables a transfer between two spatial regions.",
        "A closed door and a closed window are both SEPARATORs which disenable the motion between the spatial regions they adjoin.",
        "In addition, a closed door is a SEPARATOR which disenables the acts MTRANS by ATTEND eyes (unless the door is transparent) or ears.",
        "That is, one is normally prevented from seeing or hearing through a closed door.",
        "Similarly, a closed window is a SEPARATOR which disenables MTRANS with instrument ATTEND ears, although, as mentioned aoove, one can still see through a closed window to the other side.",
        "A closed bottle is another example of an object with a SEPARATOR description.",
        "It should be clear by now that objects described using Object Primitives are not generally described by a single primitive.",
        "In fact, not one Out several sets of",
        "primitive descriptions may be required.",
        "This is illustrated above by tne combination of CONNECTOR and SEPARATOR descriptions required for a closed window, wnile a somewhat different set 13 required for an open window.",
        "These sets of descriptions form a small set of \"states\" which the object may be in, each state corresponding to a set of inferences and associations approriate to the object in that condition.",
        "A SOURCE description indicates that a major function of the object described is to provide the user of that object with some other object.",
        "Thus a faucet is a SOURCE of water, a wine bottle is a SOURCE of wine, and a lamp is a SOURCE of the phenomenon called light.",
        "SOURCEs often require some sort of activation.",
        "Faucets must be turned on, wine bottles must be opened, and lamps are either turned on or lit depending on whether or not they are electric.",

        "A trash can is a CONSUMER of waste paper, a drain is a CONSUMER of liquids, and a mailbox is a CONSUMER of mail.",

        "An ice cube tray is a CONSUMER of water and a SOURCE of ice cubes.",
        "Many objects can be described in part by relationships that they assume with some other objects.",
        "These relations are described using the Object Primitive RELATIONAL.",
        "Containers, such as bottles, rooms, cars, etc., have as part of their descriptions a containment relation, which may specify defaults for the type of object contained.",
        "Objects, such as tables and chairs, which are commonly used to support other objects will be described with a support relation.",
        "Objects such as buildings, cars, airplanes, stores, etc., are all things which can contain people.",
        "As such, they are often distinguished by the activities which people in those places engage in.",
        "One important way of encoding those activities is by referring to the scripts wnich describe them.",
        "The Object Primitive SETTING 13 used to capture the associations between a place and any script-like activities that normally occur there.",
        "It can also be used to indicate other, related SETTING3 which the object may be a part of.",
        "For example, a dining car has a SETTING description with a link both to the restaurant script and to the SETTING for passenger train.",
        "This information 13 important for the establisnment of relevant contexts, giving access to many domain specific expectations which will subsequently be available to guide processing both during conceptual analysis of lexical input and when making inferences at higher levels of cognitive processing.",
        "The final Object Primitive, GESTALT, is used to cnaracterize objects which have recognizable, and separable, subparts.",
        "Trains, hi-fi systems, and kitchens, all evoke images of objects characterizable by describing their subparts, and the way that those subparts relate to form the whole.",
        "The Object Primitive GESTALT is used to capture this type of description.",
        "Using this set of primitives as the foundation for a memory representation, we can construct a more general hi-directional associative memory by introducing some associative links external to object primitive decompositions.",
        "For example, the conceptual description of a wine bottle will include a SOURCE description for a bottle where the SOURCE output is specified as wine.",

      "text": [
        "It IS important to understand how OPUS differs from previous Inference strategies in natural language processing.",
        "To emphasize the original contributions of OPUS we will compare it to Rieger's early work on inference and causal chain construction.",
        "Since Riegerla research is closely related to OPUS, a comparison of this system to Rieger's program will illustrate which aspects of OPUS are novel, and which aspects have been inherited.",
        "There is a great deal of similarity between the types of inferences used in OPUS and those used by Risser in his description of MEMORY (8].",
        "The causative and resultative inferences used to complete the causal chain in our last example came directly from that work.",
        "In addition, the demons used by OPUS are similar in flavor to the forward inferences and specification (slot-filling) inferences described by Rieger.",
        "Expectations are explicitly represented here as they were there, allowing them to be used in more than one way, as in the case where water is inferred to be the INGESTed liquid solely from its presence in a previous expectation.",
        "There are, however, two ways in which OPUS departs from the inference strategies of MEMORY in significant ways.",
        "(1) On one the level of computer implementation there is a reorganization of process control in OPUS, and (2) on a theoretical level OPUS exploits an additional representational system which allows inference generation to be more strongly directed and controlled.",
        "In terms of implementation, OPUS integrates the processes of conceptual analysis and memory-based inference processing.",
        "By using demons, inferences can be made during conceptual analysis, as the conceptual memory representations are generated.",
        "This eliminates much of the need for an inference discrimination procedure acting on completely pre-analyzed conceptualizations produced by a separate program module.",
        "In MEMORY, the processes of conceptual analysis and inference generation were sharply modularized for reasons which were more pragmatic than theoretical.",
        "Enough is known about the interactions of analysis and inference at this time for us to approach the two as",
        "concurrent processes which share control and contribute to each other in a very dynamic manner.",
        "Ideas from KilL [3] were instrumental in designing an integration of previously separate processing modules.",
        "On a more theoretical level, the inference processes used for causal chain completion in OPUS are more highly constrained than was possible in Rieger's system.",
        "In MEMORY, all possible inferences were made for each new conceptualization which was input to the program.",
        "Initially, input consisted of concepts coming from the parser.",
        "MEMORY then attempted to make inferences from the conceptualizations which it itself had produced, repeating this cycle until no new inferences could be generated.",
        "Causal chains were connected when matches were found between inferred concepts and concepts already stored in its memory.",
        "However, the inference mechanisms used were in no way directed specifically to tne task of making connections between concepts found in its input text.",
        "This lead to a combinatorial explosion in the number of inferences made from each new input.",
        "In OPUS, forward expectations are based on specific associations from the objects mentioned, and only when the objects in the text are described in a manner that indicates they are being used functionally.",
        "In addition, no more than one or two levels of forward or backward inferences are made before the procedure is exhausted.",
        "The system stops once a match is made or it runs out of highly probable Inferences to make.",
        "Thus, there is no chance for the kinds of combinatorial explosion Rieger experienced.",
        "By strengthening the representation, and exploiting an integrated processing strategy, the combinatorial explosion problem can be eliminated.",
        "OPUS makes use of a well structured set of memory associations for objects, the Object Primitives, to encode information which can be used in a variety of Rieger's general inference classes.",
        "Because this information is directly associated with memory representations for the objects, rather than being embodied in disconnected inference rules elsewhere, appropriate inferences for the objects mentioned can be found directly.",
        "By using this extended representational system, we can begin to examine the kinds of associative memory required to produce what appeared from Rieger's model to be the \"tremendous amount of 'hidden' computation\" necessary for the processing of any natural language text."
