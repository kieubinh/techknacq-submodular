        "ABSTRACT: The design and implementation of a paraphrase component for a natural language question-answer system (CO-OP) is presented.",
        "A major point made is the role of given and new information in formulating a paraphrase that differs in a meaningful way from the user's question.",
        "A description is also given of the transformational grammar used by the paraphraser to generate questions.",
        "I.",
        "INTRODUCTION In a natural language interface to a database query system, a paraphraser can be used to ensure that the system has correctly understood the user.",
        "Such a paraphraser has been developed as part of the COOP system [KAPLAN 791.",
        "In CO-OP, an internal representation of the user's question is passed to the paraphraser which then generates a new version of the question for the user.",
        "Upon seeing the paraphrase, the user has the option of rephrasing her/his question before the system attempts to answer it.",
        "Thus, if the question was not interpreted correctly, the error can be caught before a possibly lengthy search of the database is initiated.",
        "Furthermore, the user is assured that the answer s/he receives is an answer to the question asked and not to a deviant version of it.",
        "The idea of using a paraphraser in the above way is not new.",
        "TO date, other systems have used canned templates to form paraphrases, filling in empty slots in the pattern with information from the user's question (WALTZ 78; COW 781.",
        "In CO-OP, a transformational grammar is used to generate the paraphrase from an internal representation of the question.",
        "Moreover, the COOP paraphraser generates a question that differs in a meaningful way from the original question.",
        "It makes use of a distinction between given and new information to Indicate to the user the existential presuppositions made in her/his question.",
        "II.",
        "OVERVIEW OF THE COOP SYSTEM The COOP system is aimed at infrequent users of database query systems.",
        "These casual users are likely to be unfamiliar with computer systems and unwilling to invest the time needed to learn a formal query language.",
        "Being able to converse naturally in English enables such persons to tap the information available in a database.",
        "In order to allow the question-answer process to proceed naturally, COOP follows some of the \"co-operative principles\" of conversation (GRICE 751.",
        "In particular, the system attempts to find meaningful answers to failed questions by addressing any incorrect assumptions the questioner may have made in her/his question.",
        "When the direct response to a question would be simply \"no\" or \"none\", COOP gives a more informative response by correcting the questioner's mistaken assumptions.",
        "The false assumptions that COOP corrects are the existential presuppositions of the question.",
        "* Since these presuppositions can be computed from the surface structure of the question, a large store of semantic knowledge for inferencing purposes is not needed.",
        "In *For example, in the question \"Which users work on projects sponsored by NASA?",
        "\", the speaker makes the existential presupposition that there are projects sponsored by NASA.",
        "fact, a lexicon and database schema are the only items which contain domain-specific information.",
        "Consequently, the COOP system is a portable one; a change of database requires that only these two knowledge sources he modified.",
        "III.",
        "THE COOP PARAPHRASER CO-OP's paraphraser provides the only means of error-checking for the casual user.",
        "If the user is familiar with the system, s/he can ask to have the intermediate results printed, in which case the parser's output and the formal database query will be shown.",
        "The naive user however, is unlikely to understand these results.",
        "It is for this reason that the paraphraser was designed to respond in English.",
        "The use of English to paraphrase queries creates several problems.",
        "The first is that natural language is Inherently ambiguous.",
        "A paraphrase must clarify the system's interpretation of possible ambiguous phrases in the question without introducing additional ambiguity.",
        "One particular type of ambiguity that a paraphraser must address is caused by the linear nature of sentences.",
        "A modifying relative clause, for example, frequently cannot be placed directly after the noun phrase it modifies.",
        "In such cases, the semantics of the sentence may indicate the correct choice of modified noun phrase, but occasionally,, the sentence may be genuinely ambiguous.",
        "For example, question (A) below has two interpretations, both equally plausible.",
        "The speaker could be referring to books dating from the '60s or to computers dating from the 'fiOs.",
        "(A) Which students read books on computers dating from the '50s?",
        "A second problem in paraphrasing English queries is the possibility of generating the exact question that was originally asked.",
        "If a grammar were developed to simply generate English from an underlying representation of the question this possibility could he realized.",
        "Instead, a method must be devised which can determine how the phrasing should differ from the original.",
        "The COOP paraphraser addresses both the problem of ambiguity and the rephrasing of the question.",
        "It makes the system's interpretation of the question explicit by breaking down the clauses of the question and reordering them dependent upon their function in the sentence.",
        "Thus, question (A) above will result in either paraphrase (B) or (C), reflecting the interpretation the system has chosen.",
        "(e) Assuming that there are books on computers (those computers date from the 0s), which students read those books?",
        "(C) Assuming that there are books on computers (those books date from the '60s), which students read those books?",
        "The method adopted guarantees that the paraphrase will differ from the original except in cases where no relative clauses or prepositional phrases were used.",
        "It was formulated on the basis of a distinction between given and new information and indicates to the user the presuppositions s/he has made in the question (in the",
        "\"assuming that\" clause), while focussing her/his attention on the attributes of the class s/he is interested in."

        "As mentioned earlier, the lexicon and the database are the sole sources of world knowledge for COOP.",
        "While this design increases CO-OP's portability, it means that little semantic information is available for the paraphraser's use.",
        "Contextual information is also limited since no running history or context is maintained for a user session in the current version.",
        "The input the paraphraser receives from the parser is basically a syntactic parse tree of the question.",
        "Using this information, the paraphraser most reconstruct the question to obtain a phrasing different from the original.",
        "The following question most therefore be addressed: What reasons are there for choosing one syntactic form of expression over another?",
        "Some linguists maintain that word order is affected by functional roles elements play within the sentence.",
        "* Terminology used to describe the types of roles that can occur varies widely.",
        "Some of the distinctons that have been described include given/new, topic/consent, theme/theme, and presupposition/focus.",
        "Definitions of these terms however, are not consistent (for example, see (PRINCE 79) for a discussion of various usages of \"given/new\").",
        "Nevertheless, one influence on expression does appear to be the interaction of sentence content and the beliefs of the speaker concerning the knowledge of the listener.",
        "Some elements in the sentence function in conveying Information which the speaker assumes is present in the \"consciousness\" of the listener (CHAFE 76].",
        "This Information is said to be contextually dependent, either by virtue of its presence in the preceding discourse or because it is part of the shared world knowledge of the dialog participants.",
        "In a question-answer system, shared world knowledge refers to information which the speaker assumes is present in the database.",
        "Information functioning in the role just described has been termed \"given\".",
        "\"New\" labels all information in the sentence which is presented as not retrievable from context.",
        "In the declarative, elements functioning in asserting information that the listener is presumed not to know are called new.",
        "In the question, elements functioning In conveying what the speaker wants to know (i.e.- what s/he doesn't know) represent information which the speaker presumes the listener is not already aware of.",

        "Of these, (ii) is used here to augment the Interpretation of new information.",

        "(F/RBAS 74; p.31) Although word order vis-a-vis these and related distinctions has been discussed in light of the declarative sentence, less has been said about the interrogative form.",
        "Halliday (HALLIDAY 67) and Krizkova* are among the few to have analyzed the question.",
        "Despite the fact that they arrive at different conclusions**, the two follow similar lines of reasoning.",
        "Krizkova argues that both the wh-item of the wh-question and the finite verb (e.g. - \"do\" or \"be\") of the yes/no question point to the new information to be disclosed in the response.",
        "These elements she claims, are the only unknowns to the questioner.",
        "Halliday, in discussing the yes/no question, also argues that the finite verb is the only unknown.",
