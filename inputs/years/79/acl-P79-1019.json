        "Reports of problem solving actions are often used as evidence about the underlying cognitive processes involved in generating a problem solution, as \"problem solving protocols\" (Newell & Simon, 1972).",
        "However, these reports are obviously a kind of language interaction in their own right, in which the subject is reporting on his/her own actions to the experimenter.",
        "We have analyzed problem solving protocols of people solving a puzzle called \"Missionaries and Cannibals\" and have found that in their reports, people adopt a \"point of view\" with respect to the problem, through a consistent use of spatial deixis.",
        "For example, when a subject says: \"...",
        "I can't send another cannibal across with another missionary or he will be outnumbered when he gets to the other side \" the deixie in her report places her as speaker on the \"from\" side of the considered action.",
        "This is indicated both by the choice of the verb \"send\" and by the description of \"the other side\".",
        "The same subject indicated the \"to\" side as her point of view in another part of her protocol: \"...'oause you've gotta have one person to bring back the boat...\"4 Here, both the verb \"bring\" and the Adverb \"back\" indicate \"point of view\".",
        "Although people almost always unambiguously specify a \"point of view\" within the problem they are solving in their reports, they also deny awareness of taking such a point of view.",
        "However, this point of view is important to the underlying problem solving processes.",
        "The strongest evidence for this comes from the high correlation between point of view and errors in problem solving actions.",
        "Subjects in the Missionaries and Cannibals task can make errors by taking lotions that violate the constraints of the task.",
        "Most of those errors odour on the side away from their current \"point of view\", even though their point of view changes from one physical side to the other during the course of solving the puzzle.",
        "More interesting is that most of the \"undetected\" errors occur on the side away from their point of view.",
        "Some errors are spontaneously detected by the subject immediately after taking the action that leads to a violation; others are \"undetected\".",
        "After the experimenter interrupts to point out these undetected errors, the subjects often switch point of view 30 that the violation condition is now on the same side as the subjects' point of view.",
        "We see the point of view indicated by spatial deixis in the report of problem solving as reflecting an underlying allocation of effort (or attention).",
        "Few errors occur with problem elements that are given processing effort, while constraints that are given little attention are more often violated.",
        "In this way, these reports are reflecting changes in the organization of the problem elements that =our over the course of reaching a solution.",
        "We have also identified other ways in which reports embody the use of different conceptual organizations of the problem, including organizations that vary from abstract to concrete and from perception oriented to action oriented."
