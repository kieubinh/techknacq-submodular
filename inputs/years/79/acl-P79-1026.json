        "The information required by the consultation system is then extracted and passed on to the consultation system in the appropriately coded form.",
        "A core of syntactic, semantic and contextual rules which are applicable to all structured objects is being developed together with a representation of the structured object GLAUCOMA-PATIENT.",
        "There is also a facility for adding domain dependent syntax, abbreviations and defaults.",
        "During the past decade a number of Medical Consultation systems have been developed, for example INTERNIST (Pople, Myers and Miller 1973), CASNET/GLAUCONA (Weiss et.",
        "al.",
        "1978), MYCIN (Shortliffe 1976).",
        "Currently still others are being developed.",
        "Some of these programs are reaching a stage where they are being used in hospitals and clinics.",
        "Such use brings with it the need for fast and natural communication with these programs for the reporting of the \"clinical state\" of the patient.",
        "This includes laboratory findings, symptoms, medications and certain history data.",
        "Ideally the reporting would be done by speech but this is currently beyond the state of the art in speech understanding.",
        "A more reasonable goal is to try to capture the physicians' written \"Natural Language\" for describing patients and to write programs to convert these descriptions to the appropriate coded input to the consultation systems.",
        "The original motivation for this research came from the desire to have natural language input of cases to CASNET/GLAUCOMA a computer-based glaucoma consultation system developed at Rutgers University.",
        "A case is several paragraphs of sentences, written by a physician, which describe a patient who has glaucoma or who is suspected of having glaucoma.",
        "It was desired to have a \"Natural Language Front-End\" which could interpret the cases and pass the content to the consultation system.",
        "In the beginning stages it was by no means clear that it would even be possible to have a \"front end\" since it was expected that some sophisticated knowledge of Glaucoma would be necessary and that feedback from the consultation system would be required in understanding the input sentences.",
        "However during the course of the investigation it became clear that certain generalizations could be made from the domain of Glaucoma.",
        "The key discovery was that under some reasonable assumptions the physicians notes could be viewed as descriptions of instances of a class of concepts called structured objects and the knowledge needed to interpret the notes was mostly knowledge of the relationship between language and structured objects rather than knowledge of Glaucoma.",
        "This observation changed the focus of the research somewhat - to the investigation of the relationship between language and structured objects with particular emphasis on the structured object GLAUCOMA-PATIENT.",
        "This change of focus has resulted in the development of a - - ----- This research was supported under Grant No.",

        "system that has a core of syntax and semantics that is applicable to all structured objects and which can be extended by domain specific syntax, idioms and defaults.",
        "Considerable work on the interpretation of hospital discharge summaries, Which are very similar to case descriptions, has been done by a group at NYU (Sager 1978).",
        "Their work has focused on the creation of formatted data bases for subsequent question answering and is syntax based.",
        "The research reported here is concerned with extracting from the case the information understandable by a consultation system and is primarily knowledge based."
