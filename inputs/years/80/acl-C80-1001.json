        "The following fundamental problems are still latent in most present systems of the natural language processing: (i)how to enable the system to have a higher quality processing that renders the output more feasible; (ii)how to broaden the applicable field of the system; and (iii)how to allow the system to accept more \"natural\" input sentences, including miscellaneous linguistic constructions.",
        "In order to remedy these problems, we will need not only far advanced A.I.",
        "researches on the knowledge representation or deduction, but also more elaborate studies on the surface structures of natural sentences from the engineering viewpoints.",
        "Among other things, the requirement for the linguistic approach on the engineering side is quite urgent for Japanese language processing, since we have no Japanese grammar which is extensive and definite enough for solving, especially, problem (iii).",
        "The authors have been developing a Japanese language parser for a Japanese-English translation system on the following standpoints.",
        "(1)Wide coverage of the input forms; We aim at a system which is powerful enough to accept with less exceptions the sentential forms which appear in the actual, colloquial and written texts (e.g. non-pre-edited sentences in technical papers).",
        "(2)Two-phase parsing; The system first analyzes the local expression which is the syntactical and semantical unit constituting immediately the input sentence, and then analyzes the whole sentence by detecting the relationships between the units.",
        "The first phase, which corresponds to the morphological phase in the ordinary parser of the European language, is designed for analyzing not only the word's inflection but the \"agglutinated\" structure characterizing the Japanese language.",
        "We attach much importance to the first phase which has a great influence on the overall performance of the system.",
        "(3)Elaborate preparation for the first phase; In the first phase, we adopt an elaborate grammatical model that prescribes the internal structure of the above-mentioned units in detail.",
        "The extensive enumeration of postpositional expressions carried out in the model, among others, is quite effective for solving the problem (iii), since they determine the syntactical and semantical \"framework\" of the Japanese sentence.",
        "The inflection of the word can also be manipulated almost without exceptions in a relatively simple way in this model.",
        "(4)Matching of the first phase and higher phases; Most of the atomic postpositional expressions enumerated in the model are idiomatic ones which should be treated without decomposing into words because of their definite and unitary meanings.",
        "This fact yields a good matching of the first phase and the higher semantical phases.",
        "(5)Disambiguation in the first phase; A certain part of the polysemy of the postpositional expression can be reduced by the restriction for the co-occurence on the neighboring positions in the sentence.",
        "Our grammar for the first phase is designed to carry out disambiguation of this type.",
        "This is based on the idea that the syntactical and semantical structure ought to be disambiguated as early and as much as possible from the viewpoint of the system's total efficiency.",
        "In this paper, the above mentioned grammatical model for the first phase of parsing, which may be called \"pseudo-morphological\" phase, is shown and the experimental system developed for the verification of its validity is outlined.",
        "After showing some operational examples and the result of the experiment, we conclude that our model is quite effective for Japanese language processing from the standpoints mentioned above."

        "The information to be extracted from the input sentence by the parser can be generally classified into following three types: (a)the information of the concept which is ordinarily provided by the conceptual word (e.g. noun, verb, adjective); (b)the information of the relationship between concepts; (c)the supplementary information such as of",
        "\"tense\",\"aspect\",\"mood\",etc.",
        "Japanese is an agglutinative language and is very far from European languages from structural viewpoints, i.e. the information of type(b) or (c) is ordinarily given by the annex-expression agglutinated postpositionally to the conceptual expression which gives the information of type (a).",
        "We call the compound which consists of the annex and conceptual expression E-bunsetsut.",
        "The information of type(b) is given as the dependency relation, called kakariuke-relation between E-bunsetsus.",
        "A sentence consists immediately of E-bunsetsus positioned in a relatively free order except for a few con-straintsTi.",
        "Because of this structural feature, we adopt the two-phase approach for the parsing of the Japanese sentence: the first phase for analyzing each E-bunsetsu; the second, for detecting the kakariuke-relational structure of the sentence.",
        "It is apparent that the extensive characterization of the E-bunsetsu yields the wide coverage of input sentential forms to the system.",
        "Specifically, the extensive enumeration of the annex-expressions will drastically broaden the range of acceptable input forms, since they make the syntactic and semantic \"framework\" of the sentence.",
        "However, the annex or conceptual expression may itself be a compound of atomic expressions and is too multiformed to be enumerated extensively.",
        "From these points of view, we have constructed a grammatical model for analyzing the E-bunsetsu by, first, enumerating extensively atomic expressions excepting most of the conceptual ones that are quite numerous; secondly, classifying them by the syntactic and partially semantic functions; thirdly, prescribing the connectability rules of atomic expressions within the E-bunsetsu."

        "Relational Expressions(575).",
        "While the typical example of the relational expression is the particle in the conventional grammar, eighty percent of the relational expressions are idiomatic word-strings.",
        "For example, the word-string,'ni tsui te' is atomic and relational because it has a proper, undividable and self-supported meaning equivalent to that of the pre-position,'about' in English in such context as 'Mary ni tsui te hanasu'('talk about Mary').",
        "(The original meaning of the verb,'tsuku' is almost missing in the context.)",
        "The atomic annex-expressions can be divided roughly into ten categories according to their abilities to indicate the kakariuke-relation.",

        "The auxiliary verb in the conventional school grammar is typically co-predicative but ninety percent of the co-predicative expressions singled out are idiomatic.",
        "For example, the word-string,'ta hou ga yoi',which is equivalent to 'had better' in English provides the information of the modality.",

        "Conjunctive Expressions(122) Besides the traditional conjunction, many conjunctive, idiomatic expressions have been singled out as atomic ones.",
        "For example, the string 'sikasi nagara', wich is equivalent to 'however' in English is conjunctive and atomic.",
        "The conjuctive expression is not annexational, but offers the information of type(b).",
        "There observed two categories: one, denoted by CI, of expressions which can indicate both of the relation between two sentences (',nd the relation – 2--between two E-bunsetsus; the other, denoted by C2, of expressions which indicate exclusively the relation between two sentences.",
        "Suffixal Expressions(403) The conceptual expressions are too numerous to be enumerated exhaustively.",
        "In addition, it is difficult in the present state to settle the extensive rules for constructing the conceptual compound.",
        "We have singled out only the suffixal constituents of the conceptual compounds that are used very frequently and have definite syntactic and semantic functions.",

        "The syntactic and semantic function of the E-bunsetsu can be estimated by recognizing the terminating node in the path.",
        "Generality of Characterization.",
        "In order to verify the generality of the characterization shown in Fig.l, we have inspected approximately 1,500 actual sentences in technical papers by segmenting each sentence into E-bunsetsus applying the above rules.",
        "Table 1 shows the results of the inspection.",
        "From this, it came out that our enumeration of annex-expressions is almost sufficient and all of the sentences inspected can be segmented into E-bunsetsus if we newly register and classify the expressions missing in the enumeration into existing categories.",
        "In addition, it turned out that the idea of the E-bunsetsu, which elucidates a",
        "larger structure than a \"bunsetsu\", is quite effective for reducing the load of the second phase of the parser because it causes fourteen percent decrease of the number of immediate constituents of the sentence.",
        "Moreover, the rate of appearance of the atomic relational expressions which are originally compound was found to be sixteen percent.",
        "These facts assure the generality of the characterization to a reasonable extent.",
        "Detailed Structure of E-bunsetsu In the course of the development of the natural language system, it is a fundamental and crucial problem how much the grammatical rule should be elaborate or how much the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentence should be disambiguated within the grammatical phase of the processing.",
        "We think it profitable for increasing the total efficiency of the system to disambiguate them as much and as early as possible.",
        "From this point of view, we try to do it in the phase of analyzing the E-bunsetsu by refining the characterization of Fig.l without destroying its grammatical features and generality.",
        "Inflectional Endings.",
        "The word-inflection of Japanese language is closely related to the agglutination of words.",
        "The connection represented in Fig.l by the asterisked arrow should be restricted by the inflectional type and inflectional form of the preceding expression, which is inflectable.",
        "While subcategorizing the inflectable expressions by their inflectional types, we gave respective expressions in the ending nodes of the asterisked arrows a dictionary entry denoting what inflectional types and forms it can be connected to.",
        "The inflectional form is known by detecting the ending.",
        "Table 2 shows the paradigm.",

        "Subcategorization.",
        "We subcategorized some of the annex-expressions by their detailed agglutinative functions using a formal algorithms.",
        "It should be noted that the homonymous expression whose meanings have individual agglutinative functions was categorized duplicatively into different categories according to respective functions.",
        "These expressions'",
        "meanings, therefore, can be disambiguated by checking the agglutinative structure of the E-bunsetsu.",
        "Suffixal expressions were also subcategorized mainly by their semantical functions in order to decompose limited types of the conceptual compounds in the experimental system.",
        "The numerical outline of these refinements of the categories is given in Table 3.",
        "The asterisk in the table implies the subcategorization based on the inflectional type.",
        "Refined Connection Rules.",
        "The connection rules were refined by using the finally obtained categories that amount to 142.",
        "The number of these rules is approximately 3,600.",
        "Table 4 shows some examples of the rule and of the expression.",
        "subcategory examples of expressions (their meanings) succeedable categories",
        "The Japanese sentence is ordinarily written in kana(phonetic) letters and Chinese(ideographic) characters without leaving a space between words.",
        "From the viewpoint of machine-processing, however, it is preferable to express clearly the units composing the sentence in such a way as to leave a space between every word as in English.",
        "We have no standard way of spacing the units though the need for this has been demanded for a long time.",
        "Supposing tentatively that a sentence is written in English letters with a space between each E-bunsetsu, we have developed an experimental system which decomposes the input E-bunsetsu into atomic expressions using the refined rules and decides its function.",
        "The system is overviewed as follows:",
        "(1) The system consists of five components: a program; a dictionary of atomic expressions; a table of the connection rules; a paradigm; and a table of euphonical rules(not mentioned in this paper); (2) Each entry expression is given one or more triple of the information in the dictionary.",
        "A triple consists of a code of the (refined) category such as A48 or R56, a code of the inflectional condition of the connection, and a code of the meaning; (3) As to the inflectable expression, the dictionary includes only its stem; (4) E-bunsetsu is decomposed from left to right on it by the \"longest-match method\" and all possible analyses are tried in the \"depth-first\" manner; (5) The category code such as M13 or Y05, of the noun or yougen is used in the input and dictionary for the actual expression in it.",
        "Operational Examples Operational examples follow.",
        "The string of letters parenthesized in the output description is the inflectional ending and '/' denotes the boundary between the conceptual expression and the annex-expression detected by the system.",
        "The arrows in the following illustration show the string of categories which corresponds to a leftmost substring of the input and is assured to be successful by both of the connection rules of the category level and the inflectional conditions given in the dictionary.",
        "On the other hand, the dotted arrow shows that the connection is allowed by the rule of the category level but not by the rule of the inflectional level.",
        "Without checking the refined rules ( of two levels: the category level, and inflectional level), the following two decompositions would have been obtained.",
        "Y06(0)/NA(KAT) T(A) TAME 1-1 • • • • • • • • • • •",
        "• • • •",
        "YO6 A48 ---> A4C A4C A60 While the decomposition 1-1 is successful, 1-2 was rejected because the auxiliary verb,'ta' is prohibited from being connected to the preceding auxiliary verb,'ta' by the inflectional rule.",
        "The triples given in the dictionary to 'tame' are as follows: {R91; \"connectable to adnominal forms of all types\"; CAUSE•REASON }; {R91; \"connectable to adnominal forms - 6 - of verb types\"; PURPOSE }; {A4A; \"connectable to adnominal forms of all types\"; CAUSE•REASON }; {A4A; \"connectable to adnominal forms of verb types\"; PURPOSE }.",
        "In 1-1, since the inflectional type of 'ta' is not verbal, the second and fourth triples are not acceptable.",
        "In addition, the third one is unavailable since the ending form of the input E-busetsu results to be a stem, and inadequate.",
        "Finally, only the first one was accepted and at the same time the meaning of 'tame' was disambiguated.",
        "Without using the rules, the following three kinds of decompositions would have been possible.",
        "The atomic expression, 'si' in 2-2 and 'si' in 2-3, which are understood as a conjunctive verb, and a suffixal expression, respectively, can not be connected to 'nimotoduite'.",

        "There exist latently following eight different decompositions but only 3-1 and 3-6 were accepted by the rules.",
        "M14 TEKI(NA) NO D(E) HA NA(I) 3-8 As for 3-6, it was understood that the atomic expression,'no' was not a particle(R70) which indicates a kakariuke relation between two nominal E-bunsetsus or a particle(R01) of the meaning of AGENT, but a suffixal expression(S47) which nominalizes the predicative expression.",
        "Example 4.",
        "The decomposition was unique but the interpretation of 'to' was twofold as follows.",
        "M20-->A24----->A41 R03 R19 R92 R94 R72 S90 In the first interpretation, 'to' is a conjunctive particle of the meaning,ASSUMPTION, and in the second, it is a particle of the meaning, QUOTATION.",
        "This ambiguity is, therefore, quite reasonable.",

        "The average number of atomic expressions composing an E",
        "number of decompositions number of E-bunsetsus",
        "bunsetsu fed to the system has been 4.8.",
        "The ambiguities of both the decomposition and the category sequence have been reduced sufficiently.",
        "Most of the ambiguities left by the system have been quite reasonable in the sense that further reductions of them would require more detailed information from the outside of the E-bunsetsu.",
        "In addition, the ambiguities to be left to higher phases of parsing for reduction have not been reduced by the system.",
        "As exemplified in Example 1., the disambiguation of the atomic expression's meaning is carried out by selecting the triple of functional information given in the dictionary.",
        "Nine percent of the entry expressions are given plural triples and then their meanings can be reduced by our rules on the bases of its structural surroundings in the E-bunsetsu.",
        "Conclusions Extending the domain of input sentential forms of the natural language processing system enables, in principle, the system to manipulate more precice or delicate meanings and to communicate with men more naturally.",
        "Our grammatical model presented in this paper is so comprehensive that the local structures of colloquial and written sentences actually used in everyday life can almost always be analyzed with it.",
        "It is also elaborate enough to reduce the syntactic and semantic ambiguities of the local structure.",
        "It should be noted that the local structure analyzed by our grammar plays a quite important role in the Japanese language processing because it is not only a larger structure which can include idiomatic strings of words than a bunsetsu, but also a syntactic and semantic unit for sentence construction.",
        "Every atomic expression, which is the smallest component of the sentence, has been chosen to have undividable and self-supported meanings.",
        "Though we have not mentioned it in detail in this paper, we have already settled extensively the meanings of annex-expressions by classifying them."
