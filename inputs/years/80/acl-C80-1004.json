        "A sentence genration process can be a considered to be a process starting from non-linear meaning structures and ending in a linear structure, i.e. a sentence.",
        "Because meaning structures reflect the speaker's intension and a speaker can easily produce a sentence realizing his intension, one tends to think of sentence generation as an easy task.",
        "Famous AI systems including SHRDLU, often adopt a fill-in-the-blank method to generate answering sentences.",
        "Efforts are concentrated on other tasks, such as sentence understanding, planning, deduction, and so on.",
        "Although study of sentence generation has not been receiving much attention, it is valuable for the following reasons:",
        "1) to develope a tool which enables a user to understand what has been understood by an intelligent system.",
        "2) to build a machine translation system.",
        "3) to develop a theory of knowledge representation.",
        "If some formalism of knowledge representation is to be valid, it must be readable.",
        "In other words, it must be easily transformed into sentences.",
        "And this readablity is checked by means of sentence generation.",
        "4) to verify correctness of the various linguistic theories from a computational linguistic point of view.",
        "SGS is an experimental sentence generation system, the inputs of which are frames representing some meaning.",
        "It generates a Japanese sentence with the help of a user-supplied dictionary and grammar.",
        "The generation process of the SGS is top-down with backtracking.",
        "The result is a surface sentence with its derivation tree.",
        "This system does not generate sentences at random but carefully generate one sentence obeying the user's control information which is given in advance of the generation process.",
        "In computational study of sentence generation, building a system is one facet of the study.",
        "The other facet is the extraction of suitable laws for a computer from lingistic phenomena.",

        "Inputs A sentence generation corresponds to the speaker's speech process.",
        "Accordingly, if a sentence of good quality is needed, many factors of a speaker should be incorporated.",

        "Inputs belonging to this category are the frames representing cognitive meaning of the sententence to be generated, and the syntactic category (e.g. SS Simple Sentence) of the sentence.",
        "In this paper, frames in examples are supplied by the Japanese language understanding system EXPLUS.14 The other cateogry is factors governing inter-sentencial phenomena related to \"topic and comments\", such as the distinction between \"wa and ga\" e.t.c..",

        "They can be treated by specifying the arrangement of noun phrases or the surface subject of the sentence.",
        "For example, if one wants to put emphasis on a certain noun whose deep case is THEME, specifying (S-SUBJ = THEME) may compel the system to derive a passive sentence whose surface subject is the specified noun.",

        "They work as surface case markers.",
        "After a sequence of <PP>s, there comes a verb, an adjective, or nothing.",
        "A verb can be followed by SERU•SASERU (causative particles) or RERU RARERU (particles of passive or spontaneity etc.).",
        "These particles are connected to a verb so tightly that thay work as a single word.",
        "Words for <ASPECT>, TE-MIRU(to try), TE-AGERU (to indicate a speaker's attitude to the hearer in which a speaker kindly does something for the hearer), TE-KURERU(opposite to TE-AGERU), etc.",
        "are the last constituents of part A.",
        "These are all verbs.",
        "The second part, B, indicates a speaker's attitude to•the proposition expressed by part A.",
        "This part contains DA(affirmative), NAI(negative), DAROU(guess), RASII(conjecture), etc..",
        "These are all particles.",
        "Expressions in the last part, C, are meant to cause some effect on the hearer.",
        "Among them are KA(interogative), NA(prohibition), NE(suggestion), RO(imperative), etc.. A predicate(verb, adjective) has a case structure.",
        "For example, OK-U (put) has three cases: CACT(causal actant), THEME, and LOCUS.",
        "Each case is accompanied by specific particles.",
        "CACT and GA, THEME and WO, LOCUS and NI or DE are usually used in pairs.",
        "The case system is a basic linguistic structure in itself, but the primary objective of SGS is not the study of case system in Japanese, so SGS utilizes the case system of EXPLUS.",
        "Syntactic rules governing the connection of particles following a predicate are said to be described by a regular grammar.",
        "As for tense representation, TA is used to indicate the past or perfect tense.",
        "TA can be inserted between either part A and part B, or",

        "A compound sentence is composed of simple sentences.",
        "A relative clause in Japanese is derived by the rule <NP> => <S><NP>.",
        "This rule yields a left branching structure peculiar to Japanese in contrast to English.",
        "In this paper an example of a sentence using a relative clause is shown with discussions.",

        "First we discuss the Japanese aspect system which brings a lot of insights useful to computational linguistics.",
        "The basic role of aspectual representation is the distinction between perfect and non-perfect.",
        "It seems to be common to many languages.",
        "However, actual languages provide mechanisms for aspectual representation developed beyond this distinction.",
        "In Japanese, many types of aspects are realized by using aspectual particles following a verb.",
        "TE-IRU and TE-SIMAU are most typical.",
        "For instance, YON-DE-IRU (YON is a contracted form of the verb YOM-U (to read)) means the repeat of reading or the experience of reading.",
        "YON-DE-SIMAT-TE-IRU means being in the state after the achievement of reading.",
        "Several primitive aspects are shown in fig. 4.",
        "There are stative, inchoative, completive, and other aspects.",
        "The stative aspect is sub-classified into three subclasses.",
        "TE-IRU performs an important role in establishing these subclasses.",
        "Verbs in Japanese are classified according to the aspectual meaning of the combination of the verb and aspectual particles.",
        "As a result, aspect features are assigned to a predicate and an aspectual particle.",
        "For example, [-durative, +resultive] is assigned to OK-U.",
        "[+stative, +durative] is assigned to an adjective or a cupulative expression DA, and so on.",
        "With regard to particles, [+stative], [+completive] are assigned to TE-IRU and TE-SIMAU respectively.",
        "Once aspect features are assigned to the predicate and the particles, an interpretation of the aspect of a composite predicate is mechanically deduced by looking only at the aspect features of each consistuent.",
        "The aspect of YON-DE-IRU, for example, is obtained in such a way that the aspect features of YON-U(read) and TE-IRU are examined first.",
        "YOM-U has [-stative, +durative, +resultative] and TE-IRU has [+stative].",
        "Then the features are synthesized in obedience to 'synthesizing rules of aspects'.",
        "In this case the result is [+durative, +resultative, +stative].",
        "It allows two interpretations, which is compatible with the aspectual ambiguity of YON-DE-IRU.",
        "One interpretation, based on the combination [+durative, +stative], is the progressive interpretation---being in the state of reading.",
        "The other interpretation, based on [+resultative, +stative], is the experiencing interpretation being in the state of after reading.",
        "These aspectual ambiguities are resolved by context or adverbials.",
        "Similarly, the aspect of YON-DE-SIMAT-TE-IRU is obtained in the same way.",
        "It is easy to see the advantage of 'aspect description by aspect features'.",
        "It enalbles us to treat the (Japanese) aspect mechanically in both directions -- sentence understanding and sentence generation.",
        "However, though a great deal of progress has been made in the study of Japanese aspects, we have not yet devised a satisfactory system for aspect description by aspect features.",
        "Tense 1,2 It is well known that TA stands for not only past tense but also the speaker's confirmation, recollection, or immediate requirement.",
        "Consequently, we can not simply say that TA indicates past tense.",
        "Instead there are a number of evidences suggesting that TA indicates the perfect as well.",
        "As will be explained in the following, treating TA as a perfect-indicator leads to a succsinct description of tense interpretation in Japanese.",
        "This fact itself, in the author's opinion, is the strongest evidence for TA as a perfect-indicator.",
        "[+perfect], therefore, is assigned to TA.",
        "It is also assigned to a predicate accompanying TA.",
        "If a predicate does not accompany TA, [-perfect] is assigned.",
        "Some definitions are needed before stating tense interpretation in Japanese.",
        "Definition: speech time is the time when a speaker speaks, and event time is the time occupied by the events(facts) refered to by a sentence or a clause.",
        "With this definition, the principle of tense interpretation in Japanese is stated as follows.",
        "• A sentence of a clause containing a predicate of +perfect(-perfect) refers to the events or facts previous(not previous) to the standard time.",
        "The standard time of a simple sentence or a main clause is the speech time.",
        "The standard time of a subordicate clause is the event time refered to by the main clause.",
        "In short, TA asserts something has occured previously.",
        "Detailed tense interpretation using the aspect feature 'stative' is summarized in figure Fig. 5 which is hereafter called 'the principle'.",
        "The principle is applicable to any simple sentence and the majority of complex sentences.",
        "However some complex sentence has exceptional.",
        "tense interpretation.",

        "According to the principle, TA of TABE-TA assures that eating-a-persimmon preceds bell-ringing.",
        "But, unfortunately, such is not the case.",
        "The fact implied by the sentence is the simultaneity of eating-a-persimmon and bell-ringing.",
        "Such an exception may be ascribed to the peculiarity of the conjunctive TOKI.",
        "Since TOKI is also a noun and means time.",
        "TOKI used as a conjunctive is apt to connote 'at the itme when'.",
        "Exceptions to tense interpreation seem to depend on the conjunctive in the case of an adverbial clause, or the head noun in the case of a relative clause.",
        "Therefore case studies of tense interpretation are needed.",
        "Tense interpretation of the sentence type S1-- conj --S2 concerning Japanese tense conjunctives TOKI(when), MAE(before), ATO(after) is summarized in Fig. 6.",

        "The aspect feature +-stative is a feature belonging to the predicate of S2.",

        "'simultaneous' means that the tense interpretiation is exceptional and the simultaneity of the events refered to by S1 and 52.",
        "In the case of relative clauses, a tense interpretation table like the above can be similarly constructed, but the situation is worse in the case of adverbial clauses.",

        "Linguistic knowledge should be thoroughly investigated and digested.",
        "Though the aspect-tense system in Japanese has been investigated to some extent, it is not obvious whether the description of aspect-tense system by features is sufficient to represent temporal knowledge.",

        "In order to form a paragraph the problem of coreference mechanism",
        "must be solved.",
        "Japanese is so rich in ellipsis it is necessary to reveral and implement the ellipsis system.",
