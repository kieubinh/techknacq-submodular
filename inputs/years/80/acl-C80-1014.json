        "As for semantics, some reports have been published.",
        "In the 4tandatd theory and the CaAe gtammaiL, syntactic rules are considered to be powerful enough to describe and manage meanings, but it is insufficient to describe meanings completely with the discrete and branching rules, because meanings have continuous properties.",

        "Lakoff and McCawley's genekative semantius model are not enough to describe meanings, because their semantic rules are treated with the same form of syntax.",
        "In general, their notations adopt classifications based on the categories or binary classifications.",

        "Therefore we have proposed the model that the concept which we want to utter is formed at first as a specified area in the semantic information space, next it is transformed into a phrase-marker (P-marker) in the deep structure, and at last it is transformed in the sentential form in the surface structure being fed-back in each stage."

        "Because in the information space, the domain of property value is defined by the topological information space generative grammar.",
        "This process is divided into two sub-processes: (i) the validity judgement of the conceptual area that is mapped from the words or phrases in the input sentences, i.e. the check for grammatical sentences, (ii) meta-description of a virtual world, i.e. the definition of words or assumtion of property values etc.",
        "\"' A ' is defined to be B '\" is interpreted that the range of (I)(B) is adjusted to (I)(A) by modifying the characteristic functions of A for the virtual view.",
        "[3] Intellectual interpretation The object is definitely prescribed to be in such a situation, and is managed as follows.",
        "(1) The intellectual prescription In this step the focussed conceptual area is pointed out to interprete the communicated intention, and the area is mapped from the words, phrases, clauses or sentences.",

        "As for cases we don't make verbs special treatment as the dependency model, so verbs are assigned cases, too.",
        "The correlated tuples of conceptual areas are filed with cases.",
        "[4] Integration check In bussiness database systems, the conceptual schema for the enterprise is analyzed at set-up-time, and the most suitable schema is selected, and is not time-variant.",
        "And the correspondence between the external schema and the conceptual schema is preset, so the input data is integrated to the conceptual schema automatically.",
        "On the contrary, in the academic use of the database or in our thinking, the universe of knowledge is not fixed, and is growing according to the input data from the circumstances.",
        "So we introduce View (Aspect) for integrating the same object in different records.",
        "A group of experimental data, a group of sentences in a book, etc., have the same view.",
        "This view is different from the view in the relational model.",
        "A group of fragmentary data with the same view is checked whether they can be integrated to one object if they express the same object.",
        "A group of fragmentary data, which has the view that contains or is contained by the input data view, is checked whether they can be integrated to one object or not.",

        "As for the emotional state, the same judgement is executed.",
        "(2) Ordering information interpretation For described events, before-and-after relations on time, and cause-and-effect relations are judged.",
        "These informations are used in deduction and induction of theorems from axioms, and in management of subjunctive mode.",
        "[6] Evaluation of the received contents After the grammatical valuation of input sentences and semantic interpretation in the space, following managements are carried out: evaluation of communicated contents, and judgement of logical validity.",
        "These managements are executed by inferences using deductions, inductions and arithmetic operations on areas in the space.",
        "By these,processing, confirming the validity on the communicated contents, and drawing new conclusions from inputs and knowledge, are executed.",
        "(1) Arithmetic operations",

        "Also suitable procedures are triggered if the estimating value exceeds the threshold in each process.",
        "In case that the algorithm is not cataloged, or the input is not a question, deductions from the input is executed.",
        "We communicate each other with some view, and the received information is interpreted in that view, i.e. if the received data contradicts with the same view data, the input data must be checked whether it is right or not.",
        "And if a contradiction is not deduced, the valuable data deduced from the input are arranged and stored.",
        "In these processes, the deduction is executed by syllogisms or resolution.",
        "(ii) Induction The induction is executed as follows: at first some special predicates in the same view are selected, common variables are searched, universal special predicates are reconstructured by choosing the domain appropreately from the existential special predicates.",
        "These existential predicates are not always valid, but if the contradiction is not found by checking the domain in the information space feeding back the result, the Predicates are regarded to be correct probably, and are stored as a hypothesis, and output.",
        "Where induction is executed on the data which have the same view, and the predicates are selected from the predicates which have the same properties in the same view data.",
        "This operation is useful in creative thinking, for example, from the data gathered, common properties are extracted, and the induction is executed to the predicates which contain the common properties.",
        "As a result, from the experimental data or the observational field data, some valuable hypotheses are generated.",
        "(4) Updating the Memory or Database The received message are parsed and mapped to the semantic level, interpreted and deduced.",
        "As a result new facts or new informations are clarified.",
        "These data are stored in the database.",
        "There are two ways of updatings: one is a permanent amendment: if the data is a principle one, modifications of the information space are needed, so the information space generative grammar is reconstructed, and the corresponding amendments of files are carried out.",
        "The other is a temporary modification in an interim file.",
        "[7] Composition of Intention & Utterance If the question is ambiguous or the answer is not deducible from the database and inputs, the action-driving potential to fill up the information insufficiency is elevated, then the question to resolve the ambiguities is composed and utterd.",

        "If the input is not an interrogation, then the database is updated, and no answer or agreeable responces are made, In every case, the intention is described in file form in the semantic level, i.e. tuples of conceptual areas with cases.",
        "The file is recomposed to the derivation tree in the syntactic level by 0 and q', transformed to the surface description, and uttered."
