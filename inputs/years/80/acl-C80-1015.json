        "â€¢ It is generally understood that there is no one-to-one correspondence between the extralinguistic (real world) time of situations and the grammatical expressions of time in sentences of natural languages.",
        "If there is no correspondence of the extralinguistic situation to the linguistic expressions, it is impossible to simulate this process by a computer model.",
        "This paper proposes a model of automatic processing of time-related expressions by introducing the notion of focus in the cognition level between the extralinguistic time of situations and the linguistic expressions of time.",
        "As well, it points the way toward the computer-realization of the model.",
        "The computer programming language used for this model is SNOBOL.",
        "Failure of correspondence between an extralinguistic situation and linguistic expressions of the time concept can easily be demonstrated in most languages, if not all.",
        "For example, suppose the extralinguistic situation is the speaker's writing during a certain period in the past (say, between two and three o'clock yesterday).",
        "In reference to it, we can use any of the following sentences.",
        "(1) I wrote a letter.",
        "(2) I was writing a letter.",
        "(3) I have written a letter.",
        "(4) I had written a letter (when John came).",
        "The differences among sentences (1) through (4) are attributed to the speaker's different point of view.",
        "Comriel mentions that 'aspects are different ways of viewing the internal temporal constituency of situations.'",
        "The speaker's way of viewing, however, affects not only his choice of aspects but also his choice of tenses.",
        "Note the following examples from Japanese.",
        "(5) ah sokoni aru.",
        "'There it is!'",
        "(6) ah sokoni atta.",
        "'There it was (all the time)!'",
        "There is no difference in the denotative meaning of sentences (5) and (6).",
        "Both sentences can be used when someone has found something he has been looking for.",
        "Whether the speaker uses sentence (5) or sentence (6) depends, again, on his view point."

        "Physical events in the extralinguistic world present themselves as sense data, and are perceived not passively, but actively by an intervention of mind, and are subsequently stored in the momory as experiences.",
        "The experiences represent the material that can be formulated and articulated as the linguistic forms.",
        "We believe that unless we incorporate cognition into the process of generating linguistic expressions we cannot explain the relationship between the extralinguistic situations and the linguistic expressions.",
        "And we consider the notion of focus the most important cognitive element in connection with time-related expressions.",

        "For the model we consider three levels; that is,",
        "1. the extralinguistic (real world) level, 2. the cognition level, and 3. the linguistic level.",
        "Information on extralinguistic situations observed by, the speaker is stored in the extralinguistic level in the form of the situation and its existing period of time.",
        "The speaker's focus in the cognition level is matched against the situation(s) in the extralinguistic level and the way they match or do not match determines the selection of linguistic items such as verbs, adjectives, negation, aspect and tense.",

        "The information includes situation in the form of verbal expressions and their arguments, the starting time of dynamic situations, the ending time of dynamic situations, and the ending time of static situations.",
        "In the number for the time, the first two digits stand for the month, the next two for the day, the next two for the hour, and the last two for the minutes This number system may be expanded to include the year, the second, etc.",
        "Extralinguistic situations are divided into two categories; dynamic and static.",
        "Fo the distinction, let us quote Lyons (p. 483) .",
        "A static situation (or state-of-affairs, or state) is one that is conceived of as existing, rather than happening, and as being homogeneous, continuous and unchanging throughout its duration.",
        "A dynamic situation, on the other hand, is something that happens (or occurs, or takes place): it may be momentary or enduring; it is not necessarily either homogeneous or continuous, but may have any of several temporal contours;...",
        "Dynamic situations are in turn divided into two types.",
        "Those such as 'reading' are situations occurring for a certain period of time.",
        "Therefore situations of this type have a starting time and an ending time.",
        "The second type of dynamic situation, like '(a light) going on', is momentary, and therefore it is understood that the starting time and the ending time are identical.",
        "Static situations, on the other hand, continue for a certain period of time.",
        "But they may be results of dynamic situations and they may also change into other situations again by dynamic situations.",
        "The starting time of a static situation is usually the ending time of a dynamic situation and its ending time, if any, is the starting time of another dynamic situation.",
        "It is worth mentioning here that what are stored in this level are not linguistic expressions but situations.",
        "Therefore, the time period of an existing situation is not influenced by the type of particular linguistic expressions of a particular natural language.",
        "Taking an English expression for example, '(a light) goes on' is considered to be momentary event.",
        "Therefore, we cannot say qta light is going on.'",
        "However, 'lights are going on' is possible, in which case we can identify a different starting time and ending time.",
        "Further, if we could observe the period of duration of a light going on by a high-speed film for instance, the different starting and ending times could be recorded in the data by expanding time digits to second or millisecond.",
        "However, there are some phenomena peculiar to individual languages.",
        "For instance, the situation of 'coming' is",
        "considered to have a time duration in English.",
        "Therefore, 'John is coming' is a paraphrase of 'John is on the way.'",
        "But in Japanese it is considered to be momentary, that is, 'coming' is a sort of switch from 'is not here' to 'is here'.",
        "Therefore there is not Japanese expression equivalent to English 'John is coming.'",
        "Theoretically, this kind of difference among individual languages should be taken care of by elaborating the structure of situations in the data of this level, but in the current model it is taken care of by the linguistic level.",
        "COGNITION LEVEL Now in the cognition level, the focused situation and the period of focus as well as the time of utterance are inserted into the program (Program Nos.",
        "10-27).",
        "The focused situation is in the form of verbal expression and its arguments.",
        "The period of focus is in the form of either a time adverbial such as 'now', 'this morning', 'yesterday' and 'last month', or numbers for chronological time points similar to those of extralinguistic situation time.",
        "When the input is a time adverbial, the program calculates it against the time of utterance and translates it into chronological numbers (Program Nos.",
        "28-40).",

        "Here it is checked whether a particular extralinguistic situation exists within the focused period or moment and, if so, how it is focused.",
        "On the basis of the relationship among the three kinds of time-points of an extralinguistic situation (A,B and C), and the two kinds of focus time-points of the same focused situation (S and E), the cagegories of aspects are determined (Program Nos.",

        "If it is otherwise,",
