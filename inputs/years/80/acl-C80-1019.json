        "The analysis shows that matter concepts are divided into two large classes:\"simple matter concepts\" and \"non-simple matter concepts.\" Furthermore, the latter is divided into \"complex concepts\" and \"derivative concepts.\" About 4,700 matter concepts used in daily Japanese were actually classified according to the analysis.",
        "As a result of the classification about 1,200 basic matter concepts which cover the concepts of real world matter at a minimum were obtained.",
