        "And also, it was discussed in the field of cognitive psychology which dealt with the human information processing mechanism, especially long – term memory (LTM) representation.",
        "The work of Kintsch (1969) in his structure of semantic memory was useful for insight into the conflict resolution in lexical item stored in LTM.",
        "He particularly made his attention on the problems on how one semantically unacceptable a sentence.",
        "If one selects the problem from artificial intelligence field, McDermott's (1974) TOPLE in \"Ring formalism\" was suggestive to a design of inference mechanism which could interprete unacceptable knowledge in a simple world model.",
        "This formarism also guided us about a construction of lexical data in natural language processing.",
        "By following these current issures on knowledge representation, the present study focuses the problem of conflict resolution in semantic analysis of Metaphor both from viewpoints of cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence.",
        "For this purposes, we propose a new semantic model which can deal with the metaphorical interpretation together with the inference mechanism.",

        "with conflict knowledge Metaphor plays an important role in our understanding of language and of the world we describe through language.",
        "Thus, there have been a number of researches on the nature of metaphor since the time of Aristotle.",
        "Recently, historical survey on metaphor was made by Ortony, Reynolds & Alter (1978) on their paper titled \"Metaphor: Theoretical and Empirical Research\".",
        "Their main concerns on metaphor are to develop a model of metaphoric comprehension both from Psychological reaction time study and \"Schema\" based theoretical framework.",
        "To quote their paper: \"The structure of a shema is of a series of variables together with relationships among them.",
        "There are constraints on the values that the variables may take, but these constraints are rarely absolute, although some values are typical than others.",
        "This kind of representation system appears to offer greater flexibility for matching incoming information to previously stored knowledge, and with this flexibility comes a better prospect for dealing with nonliteral use of language.",
        "The metaphorical interpretation would be achieved by finding that schema or those schemata that matched the input in such a way as to minimize the required changes in variable range. \"",
        "Certainly, the idea of schema described above is one of convergences on the knowledge representations proposed by Rumelhart & Ortony (1977) and Bobrow & Norman (1975).",
        "Here, the procedure for the metaphorical interpretation is a kind of pattern – matching process which is based on a semantically acceptable interpretation.",
        "In order to make a discussion more explicit, let us consider the same type of problem which deals with knowledge aquisition through the conflict or contradict resolution.",
        "For this purpose, we focus our attention to the semantic structure which is stored in an understanding system.",
        "In case of Kintsch model, this problem is to define a lexical entry used in the semantic memory.",
        "And further, the notion of acceptability of sentence is defined by the use of production rules which are applied to the set of propositions stored in memory system.",
        "If there exists a production rule for a set of",
        "proposition, the sentence is semantically acceptable.",
        "And if not, the sentence is semantically unacceptable.",
        "Therefore, if two sentences are contradictory, the memory system must decide which one to keep and which one to disregard by choosing the one with acceptability.",
        "In case of McDermot's TOPLE, this kind of contradiction is resolve through the notion of \"ring\" which can absorb the confliction.",
        "This process is accomplished through a procedure called DOUBT.",
        "By this procedure, the system can find the allowable course of action to take to patch up a ring.",
        "In this connection, Tanaka (1980) in his SRL, this procedure is carried out through the use of production rule called \"without description\".",
        "In SRL representation which is an extension of Bobrow & Winograd's KRL, knowledge is organized around conceptual entities with associated descriptions and procedures.",
        "Therefore, by embedding various procedures to knowledge, lexical item is represented by knowledge unit with associated descriptions and procedures.",
        "One type of conceptual entities is the use of hiearchcal relation which was actively utilized by the work of Carbonell's SCHOLAR (1970).",
        "In SRL, hiearchical concept is accomplished through part-whole and class-inclusion relations.",
        "And further, the conflict resolution was made by the use of the without description.",
        "In contrast to TOPLE, a bird like Pengin is represented by the following way.",
        "Although we made a quick overview of the related topic on the knowledge with conflict resolution, it is necessary to consider a semantic model which can accept semantically conflict knowledge.",
        "That is, any lexical item stored in the understanding system should process a change of meaning through the metaphorical use.",
        "In this section, we will propose a new semantic model in which semantic elements are compared to chemical elements.",
        "Here, chemical elements are refered to the dynamic aspect of meaning.",
        "In a sense, the theory can be considered as an extension of Arnold Zwicky's 1973 paper, \"Linguistics as Chemistry\", in Anderson & Kiparsky (Eds.",
        "), A Festschrift for Morris Halle.",
        "In this connection, some preliminary work on \"Linguistic Chemistry\" was carried out by Harada & Mizoguchi (1977) in which semantics and lexical elements were also compared to chemical elements (such as molecules, atoms, protons, neutrons and elecrtons).",
        "A large part of syntax is now compared to a theory of semantic \"bondage\".",
        "The semantic equivalent of 'chemical reaction' is a theory of semantic amalgamation.",
        "The analogy with chemistry may not be completely felicitous, but at the present moment it is a least useful in shaping a new theory of semantics.",
        "The first step for constructing a chemically interpreted model of semantics, or \"Semistry\", so to speak, is to study the bondage among atoms and molecules.",
        "For this, it is necessary to develop a theory of valence.",
        "Valence is defined as the capacity of an atom to enter into chemical (or semantic) combination with other atoms.",
        "It is possible to assign a value to the valence displayed by an atom in particular compound.",
        "This notion must be the reader who is well-informed of the European tradition of \"Valenzgrammatik\".",
        "Here, however, we will develop a theory of valence totally independently of European tradition.",
        "Before going into a detail of Semistry, let us show you a concrete exsample which is selected from Schenk (1973) of his Concepual Dependency theory (CDT for short).",
        "Here, \"Semantic primitives of CDT\" are compared to chemical elements.",
        "In the chemical elements, there are three types of chemical bondages; 1.",
        "Single bond 2.",
        "Double bond 3.",
        "Tripple bond.",
        "If we look at CDT representation of a sentence through the viewpoint of Semistry, we will recognize a Similarity between chemical molecules and CD structure.",
        "From this insight, we can make a analogy of semantic 'isomer', depending on a mode of bondage between the semantic primitives.",
        "For exsample, CD structure of PP(picture producer) and ACT (action) is represented in the Fig.2 in which two way dependency is interpreted as a double bond in case of Semistry.",
        "If one of the valence shifts to another pair of primitive as shown in Fig.2, then the structure is called semantic resonance.",
        "In case of PP with the extra valence, some modifiers will be possible to link the activated part of PP.",
        "If the activation will occur at the ACT, the extra valence part will be embedded with the related case in CDT.",
        "Since it is not the purpose of the present paper to develop an impecable account of Semistry, let us take another example from a lexical item which is related to the present study.",
        "In the analysis of lexical structure, words are not really defined in the standard dictionaries in any precise way in case of the human cognitive system.",
        "There are various means to be employed to indicate their meaning more or less vaguely, but these means are usually sufficient for the cognitive processing.",
        "They may be extralinguistic means (such as diagram) or linguistic definition, both explicit and implicit.",
        "Neither of these",
        "are of much use for the construction of metaphor processing system.",
        "In case of metaphorical analysis, the lexical item must be defined with an inclusion of semantically unacceptable feature.",
        "This is represented by the following way as shown in Fig.3.",
        "The format of lexical item is adapted by the use of distributed semantic links (or Single bonds) between words.",
        "That is, a word or lexical item is surrounded with semantic features S S2' ... Sn.",
        "These bonds between word and semantic features are usually single bonds with homogeneous tention.",

        "Therefore, in order to determine the meaning of a noun phase, there must be an intersection of meaning between M* and M. If such intersection exsists between the first and the second, the double bond is constructed in the Fig.3.",
