        "In addition to these linguistic signals, communicative and cognitive conditions which can have the same effect are discussed.",

        "The explanation component of a natural language AI system is that component whose job it is to generate, in response to a why-question an explanation which is both understandable to the user and appropriate to the current state of the dialogue.",
        "Although there has been relatively little research into the semantics and pragmatics of why-questions115,9117 and the cognitive processes underlying the answering of them, several Al systems do exist which are capable of handling certain types of why-questions.",
        "The practical value of the incorporation of an explanation component lies essentially in the fact that, as Stallman and Sussman have put it, \"such programs are more convincing when right and easier to debug when wrong\".15 Figure 1 provides an overview and comparison of the explanation components which have been implemented to date: BLAH22, DIGITALIS ADVISOR\", EL15, EXPOUND2, HAM-RPM19,21, LUIGI\", myciN12,4, NOAH\", PROSPECTOR', SHRDLU24, TKP21° (The symbol \"-\" signifies that the attribute in question is not applicable to the given system).",
        "This paper presents some results of my experience in designing and implementing an explanation component21; together, they represent a step toward a computational model for the semantics of why-questions.",
        "The explanation component was designed as a module which could in principle be incorporated into any natural language Al system.",
        "It has been tested within the natural language dialogue system HAM-RPM6, which converses with a human partner in colloquial German about limited but interchangeable scenes.",
        "In implementing HAM-RPM we have taken into account the human ability to deduce useful information even in the case of fuzzy knowledge by approximate reasoning.",
        "The model of fuzzy reasoning used in HAM-RPM can be characterized by the following four properties20:",
        "(a) A fuzzy inference rule represents a weak implication; a particular 'implication strength' must thus be associated with each such rule.",
        "(b) The premises of a fuzzy inference rule are often fulfilled only to a certain degree.",
        "(c) The applicability of a fuzzy inference rule in the derivation of a particular conclusion is likewise a matter of degree.",
        "(d) Several mutually independent fuzzy inference rules can corroborate each other in the derivation of a particular conclusion.",
        "The explanation component which I have developed differs from BLAH22, one of the most advanced explanation components which have similar goals, in that on the one hand fuzzy inference rules and facts can be modified by appropriate hedges (in accordance with (a) through (c) above), and on the other hand the system is able in the course of a dialogue to generate multiple justifications for an explanandum (in accordance with (d) above).",
        "A further important difference between this explanation component and the other systems included in Figure 1 is that the system is equipped with a fairly sophisticated natural language generator, which is ATN-based and includes algorithms for generating pronouns and definite descriptions19.",
        "Only two aspects of this explanation component will be discussed in this paper: The signals on the basis of which the explanation component generates an argumentative answer to a question asked by the user and the speech act schemata for the argumentative dialogue sequences which can be"

        "A Formal Description of the Signals Suggesting an Argumentative Answer The purpose of the present section is to list the major types of signals which are capable of setting an explanation component into action.",
        "The resulting classification of linguistic expressions does not, of course, imply that all of the expressions in a given category are completely synonymous.",
        "Signals for Argumentative Answers in the User's Utterances From the point of view of algorithmic recognition, the simplest case is that in which the user elicits an argumentative answer from the system by asking a direct question.",
        "The word why can often be interpreted as a signal for an argumentative answer.",
        "On the other hand, its exact meaning depends on the dialogue context and it can be used within speech acts which have nothing to do with explanation, such as making a suggestion or a comments.",
        "In spite of its ambiguity, the word why represents the only means of eliciting an argumentative answer in most Al systems which have an explanation component.",
        "Special idiomatic expressions such as those listed in (L1) can have the same function as the word why.",
        "In the system HAM-RPM expressions like",
        "(L1) How come, what ... for, how do you know",
        "these are recognized through pattern matching during lexical analysis6.",
        "Indirect questions such as those in (L2) require that the system be able to divide the utterance into matrix sentence and embedded sentence syntactically; only then can it process the latter using the same means as in the case of direct questions containing why or the questions in (L1).",
        "(L2) Please tell me why A, I'd like to know why A",
        "Further types of signals include direct (see L3) and indirect (see L4) requests.",
        "The problem of",
        "(L3) Please explain why A, prove that A (1.4) I'd be interested in hearing why you think that A, Are you prepared to justify your conclusion that A?",
        "how indirect speech acts such as the requests in (L4) can be recognized automatically is one which has recently been attracting much attention from natural language AI researchers3'9.",
        "The word why and the expressions in (L1) needn't accompany the proposition to be explained within a single utterance, as they do in the example (El); they can also be used alone after the system has answered a question to elicit an explanation of the answer (cf. E2).",
        "(El) USER (U): Why is Glenbrook Drive closed?",
        "(E2.1) USER (U): Is Glenbrook Drive closed?",
        "(E2.2) SYSTEM (5): Yes.",
        "(E2.3) USER (U): How do you explain that?",
        "The expressions in (L3) and (L4) can also be used to achieve just the opposite: An argumentative answer is requested in advance, before the corresponding question has been asked of the system.",
        "(E3) Please explain your answer: Do you think that A?",
        "As the continuation of (E2.1) and (E2.2) represented by (E2.4) and (E2.5) illustrates, a speaker often explains a previously given answer when the listener - perhaps using an expression such as the ones in (L5) - shows signs of doubt as to",
        "(L5) Really?",
        "Are you sure?",
        "That's strange.",
        "(E2.4) U: Really?",
        "(E2.5) S: Yeah, they're repaving it.",
        "the truth of the answer.",
        "A kind of signal which suggests an argumentative answer in a still more obvious manner is the category of utterances by the user which indicate an opinion contrary to that expressed by the system (cf. L6).",
        "The idiomatic expressions in (L5)",
        "(L6) I doubt that, That doesn't follow, I can't believe that..., Since when?",
        "and (L6) which always express doubt or a contrary opinion no matter what the current dialogue context may be, can be handled adequately if information concerning their implications is stored in the system's 'idiom lexicon'6.",
        "A further way in which the user can indirectly ask a why-question is by himself suggesting an explanation of what the system has just asserted, while at the same time indicating a desire to have the explanation confirmed by the system.",
        "For example, after the system has given the answer (E2.2), the user should be able, by asking the question (E2.6), to elicit an explanation like (E2.7) from the system.",
        "If this kind of behavior",
        "(E2.6) U: Because of an accident?",
        "(E2.7) S: No, because they're repaving it.",
        "is to be realized in a dialogue system, the program must be able to recognize (E2.6) as a proposed explanation.",
        "Algorithms which recognize explanations in certain contexts have been developed, e.g., for the ICAI system ACE14 and the text-understanding system PAM23.",
        "Leading and rhetorical questions which suggest an affirmative answer may be seen as containing an implicit request to justify the answer if it is negative.",
        "If the system's answer to (E3.1)",
        "(E3.1) U: You aren't going to restrict me to 40k of core today again, are you?",
        "(E3.2) S: Yes, in fact I am.",
        "I've got 47 jobs",
        "logged-in in the moment.",
        "Is not something like (E3.2), but rather simply Yes, in fact I am, the system isn't exhibiting the sort of cooperative behavior which we would like to have in a natural language dialogue system.",
        "These last two types of speech acts cannot at present be handled adequately by Al systems.",
        "The same is true of explanations within the schema reproach-justification (cf. 04.1 and E4.2).",
        "Communicative and Cognitive Conditions as Signals for Argumentative Answers Two further kinds of signals which suggest argumentative answers deserve mention in this section.",
        "In contrast to the preceding types they can be incorporated without difficulty into existing AI systems, e.g. HAM-RPM21.",
        "Both kinds of signal lead to the question's being avers.-anziweked in that they suggest an argumentative answer in the absence of any explicit or implicit request for such an answer in the user's question.",
        "On the one hand, the system may offer an unsolicited explanation for reasons of pantna tactic's if it has already noticed that the user seems to have a tendency to ask for explanations of answers6.",
        "On the other hand, over-answering may even be reasonably expected of the system in the case where the answer is based on uncertain beliefs and approximate or hypothetical reasoning.",
        "This kind of behavior can be modelled to a limited extent if the system is programmed so as to attempt to generate an explanation as soon as its confidence in its own answer sinks below a certain threshold, e.g., because the implication strength (see (a) above) of one of the inference rules it has used is low (cf. E5.1, E5.2).",
        "The",
        "generation of an argumentative answer in such a context falls outside the usual scope of linguistic analysis; it is a good example of an application of the Al paradigm in that the condition which gives rise to the generation of an argumentative answer is a certain property of a cognitive process, namely the inference process by which the answer is derived.",
        "Figure 2 summarizes the various signals for argumentative answers which have been discussed in this section (types of signals which have been implemented in HAM-RPM's explanation component are indicated by a *).",

        "The speech act sequence depicted in schema 1 will serve as a starting point.",
        "In schema 1, as in the schemata to follow, the word why represents the entire class of signals in the user's utterances for argumentative answers which were discussed in the previous section.",
        "Here is an example of a simple argumentative dialogue sequence:",
        "(E6.1) U: Do you know if the Mercedes is cheap?",
        "(E6.2) S: I think so.",

        "(E6.4) S: It's in need of repairs.",
        "Iterated Why-questions and Ultimate Explanations",
        "A sequence such as (E6.1) through (E6.4) may be continued by one or more repititions of schema 2, in which the user requests that the system's argumentative answer itself be explained.",
        "The dialogue sequence (E6.5) through (E6.8) is a continuation of (E6) in which two further why-questions occur.",
        "The answer (E6.8) is an example",
        "of an utt mate exptanatian.",
        "Though it is debatable whether ultimate explanations in a philosophical sense are in fact possible, it is clear that participants in everyday dialogues frequently offer explanations which they are not in a position to explain further.",
        "Some typical formulations which are used in such cases are listed in (L7).",
        "(L7) It's obvious, That's the way it is, Can't you see it?",
        "The Ambiguity of Iterated Why-questions A further problem in connection with iterated why-questions is the ambiguity which they regularly involve.",
        "Each of the why-questions after the first one can refer either to (a) the assertion which constituted the explanans, or (b) the •question",
        "inferential relationship between the explanans and the explanandum.",
        "(S3.1) U: Why Q?",
        "(S3.2) S: Because P.",
        "If the second sort of interpretation is applied to the question (E6.7), an answer such as (E6.9) becomes appropriate.",
        "(E6.9) S: A machine is in need of repairs when one of its parts is in need of repairs.",
        "It is of course possible to eliminate this ambiguity with a more precise formulation of the why-question, as when, for example, (S2.1) is replaced with (S2.11).",
        "Although interpretation (a) is far more common than (b) in nontechnical dialogues, the occurrence of questions such as (S2.1') shows that it is nonetheless worthwhile to provide an Al system with the ability to answer in accordance with either of the possible interpretations.",
        "For interpretation (b), this means that the system must be able, like HAM-RPM21, to verbalize the inference rules it uses.",
        "If the system is requested, via a further why-question, to explain an inference rule that it has verbalized in this way, the existence of a third type of argument in addition to the presentation of factual evidence and the verbalisation of inference rules becomes evident: The system may supply a bacling16 for its inference rule.",
        "A backing usually refers to a convention, a theory, or observations.",
        "An explanation component which uses backings must have access to the corresponding meta-knowledge about its inference rules.",
        "The Elicitation of a Multiple Justification A further variant of schema 2 can be used to exhibit the step-by-step elicitation of a multiple justification.",
        "Instead of simply asking another why-question, the user specifically requests further corroborating evidence for the explanandum.",
        "Some typical expressions are listed in (L8).",
