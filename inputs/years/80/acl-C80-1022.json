        "To implement to above inference, we adopted a frame representation to be easy to represent knowledge in a hierarchical structure, and developed the convenient method to deal with such knowledge.",

        "To answer the questions about a story, it is necessary to refer to the knowledge base and to forecast the event which will happen in the future.",
