        "This thesis represents the results of a computer-aided analysis of aspects of speeches of the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.",
        "Specifically, the analysis has investigated the occurrence of indicators of the efficiency function--tools facilitating the comprehension of a discourse by a hearer or reader--in four speeches of Dr. King.",
        "Contrary to the expectations of many who anticipate complex grammatical structures in the discourse of those who are speechmakers before many and diverse audiences, this study has demonstrated that the speeches of Dr. King are replete with simple structural devices-sequential clauses as opposed to embedded clauses, sentences in which there are clear linkages between clauses, and clear linkages between sentences, to name a few.",
        "The analysis of the texts of Dr. King was accomplished in part by a computer program which used as input a surface semantic description of a sentence as a basis for predicting the syntactic function of elements of the sentence.",
        "Rationale, Scope, and Methodology Nida and Taberl propose norms for determining the functions of stylistic features.",
        "They consider the occurrence of features manifesting the efficiency function--for the enhancement of comprehension on the part of the hearer/reader--and the occurrence of features manifesting the special effects function-serving to stimulate hearer/reader interest in the discourse.",
        "Both formal and lexical features might be utilized to effect either of the two functions.",
        "They further propose that no discourse is restricted to the utilization of a single funtion--either efficiency or special effects--since a speaker/writer would be concerned both that his discourse is understood and that it evokes interest.",
        "This approach to style, in terms of its effects on an audience, has been discussed by others.",
        "See, for example, Chapman2, Holloway3, and Ohmann Martin Luther King, Jr. is considered by many to have been an effective speaker of our times.",
        "Certainly, he was effective in attract - ing large audiences to his podium, and official statistics on the attendance and frequency of turnout at his speeches would bear this out.",
        "Consider, for example, the turnout for the March on Washington where the estimated audience was 200,000.",
        "Reston5 of the New York Times reported: \"It was King who...touched the audience... until then the pilgramage...had been a specta-cle.\"",
        "Whether this attraction was due to his political persuasion, his philosophy of nonviolence, curiosity, or the sheer beauty of his oratory is not a point at issue here.",
        "What is at issue is that he did have a message, and he certainly must have desired his message not only to be heard and understood but to be, in addition, a catalyst to the furtherance of his point of view.",
        "One might expect, then, that the features proposed by Nida and Taber manifesting both the efficiency and special effects function would be present in the discourse of a speaker of the caliber of Dr. King.",
        "This study reflects an acceptance of these proposals as norms, and in so doing endeavors to contribute to the substantiation of them as such by measuring the extent of reliance by Dr. King on specific features manifesting the efficiency function.",
        "This is not to say that features, in general lexical, manifesting the special effects function are not present in the discourse of Dr. King, but explicit in this study is a goal of specifying a computable process (an algorithm /device) for the recognition and identification of formal features.",
        "By statistical accumulation of data evidencing the presence of certain features enhancing the efficiency function, this study will endeavor to show that there is indeed a high occurrence of formal features for the enhancement of the efficiency function in the speeches of Dr. King.",
        "Specific parameters to be addressed herein are:",
        "1) intersentence markers 2) markers of relationships between clauses 3) sentences with simple structure 4) potential terminals in a sentence 5) clauses in sequence in a sentence",
        "To accomplish the statistical accumulations, the research contained herein utilizes a sentence parser which provides semantic coding as a basis for the recognition of the specific units of interest in Dr. King's discourse.",
        "The parsing algorithm will contain tools for a) the recognition of specific kinds of intersentence",
        "markers; b) the recognition of markers between sentences; c) the recognition of simple sentences; d) the recognition of potential terminals in a sentence; and e) the recognition of sequential vs. embedded clauses in a sentence.",
        "Clearly, an investigation into the frequency of occurrence of a limited set of stylistic features in the oratory of a single person will not permit definitive conclusions on the universal set of features present in all oratory.",
        "Nor will it define an algorithm (or device) for the consistent recognition of such features.",
        "'But it is anticipated that these results will serve as substantiation of proposed norms (as mentioned above) and as a cue to both the minimal information necessitated in the processing of natural language as well as a cue to a methodology for the recognition of formal stylistic features.",
        "The appropriateness of an examination of limited stylistic features, however, has been sanctioned by many stylists.",
        "Hough6 states: \"The choice of this word rather than that, of this kind of syntactical construction rather than another, is a visible fact, whose nature and effects can be examined.\"",
        "He further elaborates: \"Study a particular stylistic device as it is employed in an individual work of art.... We are inquiring how a specific configuration is used for a special...purpose....\" Ullman7 is also encouraging: \"This is the way stylistic analysis proceeds: It takes a particular device in a language or in a limited corpus and examines the different effects which emanate from it.",
        "But one could also reverse the process and investigate, for example, the various devices through which irony is expressed in the language or corpus.\"",
        "It is further anticipated that many linguists will insist that a speaker such as Dr. King will have demonstrated a wide variety of structural tools in his oratory.",
        "This study proposes to show evidence, as has Ohmann8 in his analyses of Faulkner, et al., substantiating Milic9 that \"the language of an individual is restricted...though...able to interpret the full range of syntactic patterns...the language affords, for some reason he seems to depend for his expressive needs on merely a selection from the available total.\"",
        "Further discussion of the expectation of restricted use of lanpage tools can be found in Chapman2 and Ohmann.10 Since it is expected that the structural patterns present in Dr. King's oratory are very limited in number and recurring, one anticipates that a parsing algorithm for the recognition of these structural units will be simple.",
        "A parser based on a transformational model, for example, would contain many \"complications...irrelevant to the particular problem...the student of style may wish to feel free to use the simplest grammatical model that satisfies the requirements of his particular job.",
        "\"11 Further, it is anticipated that the algorithm used in this study in identifying the regular recurring structural patterns (the analogies) in the speeches of Dr. King will also identify the anomalies by the rejection of them as analogies.",
        "Given the above considerations concerning the rationale and methodology for the study and the delimiting of the scope, the following section will discuss the specific speeches of Dr. King comprising the corpus for the study.",
        "The Corpus Four speeches have been selected to comprise the corpus for the study.",
        "Text I is popularly known as I had a Dream.12 Text II is the Nobel Prize Acceptance Speech.13 Text III is the text of Dr. King's statement on the eve of his death,14 and Text IV is a sermon delivered by Dr. King at his home church in Atlanta, Georgia.15 The texts cited above were selected as representative of the gamut of the speech types delivered by Dr. King based on the makeup of the audiences which were present.",
        "Text I was delivered to general audience composed of old and young, black and white, rich and poor, educated and uneducated.",
        "Text II was delivered to a more elite audience, probably all highly educated and distinguished in their fields--the Nobel Prize Committee.",
        "The third text represents an impromptu speech delivered by Dr. King on the eve of his death.",
        "The final text was delivered by Dr. King to his usual audience-his flock at his home church.",
        "Text I contains 81 sentences, 1,644 words, and 156 clauses.",
        "The mean (simple average) words per sentence is 20.2, and the mean clauses per sentence is 1.9.",
        "Text II contains 43 sentences with a total of 1,156 words and 122 clauses.",
        "Here, the mean sentence length is 26.91 words, and the mean number of clauses per sentence is 2.7.",
        "Text III consists of 23 sentences, 34 clauses, and 256 words.",
        "The mean number of words per sentence is 11.13, and the mean number of clauses per sentence is 1.48.",

        "The mean sentence length is 17.05 words.",
        "The mean number of clauses per sentence is 1.8.",
        "Combining the data from the four texts, the corpus consists of 283 sentences, 562 clauses, 5,391 words.",
        "The mean sentence length for the corpus is 18.971, and the mean number of clauses per sentence is 1.982.",
        "The standard deviation of the sentence lengths is 12.96 words.",
        "The standard deviation of the clauses",
        "per sentence is 1.32.",
        "Table 1 summarizes the mean sentence lengths in words by text and for the corpus.",
        "Table 2 contains comparable data for clauses per sentence.",
        "These statistics have been obtained by a manual tallying of the sentences, clauses, and words in the texts and as such are",
        "preliminary and for the purpose of demonstrating the volume of information under study.",
        "Further, the tables presented here are for the purpose of describing the raw data worked with in this research.",
        "Further sections contain discussions of the data with respect to the parameters under investigation and the significance of them to the style of Martin Luther King, Jr. A fuller study of the research discussed herein may be found in Smith16 from which this study was extracted.",
        "The reader should be forewarned that this paper is intended to be read by linguists.",
        "It is assumed that the reader is knowledgeable of past and present trends in the branches of linguistics.",
        "Readers who are uninitiated in the field might consider Dinneen17 which is fairly objective in its treatment of the trends in linguistics from ancient times to the mid 1960's."

        "With respect to intersentence markers it has been shown that all of the texts are strongly linked by repetition, anaphora, and introductory relators.",
        "An inspection of the texts shows that there is indeed a preponderance of sentence to sentence links plus links joining early parts of the texts to latter portions.",

        "Twenty-four sentences (8.48% of the corpus) contain sentences in which the interclause boundaries are unmarked or in which embedded clauses are present.",
        "Further, none of the sentences with unmarked clause boundaries contains embedded clauses, and none of the sentences containing embedded clauses has unmarked interclause boundaries.",
        "In considering the fourth device--simple sentences--this study has shown that 132 sentences (46.64% of the corpus) are simple with respect to the number of clauses (one) per sentence.",

        "Finally, with respect to potential terminal points in a sentence, one can see that clauses in sequence provide potential terminal points.",
        "Thus, the 141 multiclause sentences which contain clauses in sequence are evidence of the potential of terminal points in addition to the point at the end of the sentence.",
