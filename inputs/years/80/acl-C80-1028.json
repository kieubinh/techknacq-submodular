        "The present paper presents ideas concerning a methodology of the 'semantics in computational linguistics' (COL- semantics).",
        "There is the following hypothesis underlying: In the field of COL-semantics algorithms and computer programs are developed which deliver structures of linguistic analysis and representation that can be compared with those of formal linguistic semantics and satisfy the adequacy criteria of certain linguistic theories.",
        "They therefore are suitable instruments for developing and testingsuch theories.",
        "COL-semantics hence proceeds in a way different from the semantic processing as it is found in the framework of artificial intelligence (AI-semantics).",
        "AI-semantics is not so much linked to the semantics of formal linguistics or logic but rather to cognitive psychology, problem solving theory and the theory of knowledge representation which has been recently put forward within Al itself.1 Between both branches of semantic processing of natural language that are realized in computer systems there therefore exists a difference in aims, theories and methods.",
        "Starting from a brief sketch ot the aims and theories of both approaches one essential methodological principle of COL-semantics will be elaborated in the second chapter of the paper.",
        "In the third chapter COL-semantic methods will be exemplified by a concrete application, the production of semantic representations in an information system.",
        "Stress will not be laid on the question of what aCOLsemantic representation should look like but h o w levels of a semantic representation can be systematically related with natural language and with each other.",
        "Aims and theoretical concepts of COL-semantics and AI-semantics The difference of aims and methods can only be outlined here as far as it is relevant with respect to the methodological divergence which will be dealt with in detail: Aim of AI-semantics is the simulation of the human language understanding and/or language generating process that is to be understood as a manifestation of intelligent human problem solving behaviour.",
        "Aim of COL-semantics is the algorithmic generation of descriptive structures (of a generativ-semantic, interpretative, logico-semantic or other type) out of a given natural language input.",
        "Both purposes can be partial aims or intermediate steps within a larger project like 'simulation of dialogue behaviour', 'natural language information or question answering system'.",
        "Thus the AI-approach leads to a theory where the object of explanation (or simulation) is \"rational human behaviour\"2 or more specifically human language behaviour as a rational psychic process, whereas in the theory of linguistic semantics language is being objectified as a generated structure or a system which can be considered independently from the associated mental processes.",
        "In linguistic semantics and also in COL-semantics metalinguistic notions which refer to language as a system like 'synonymy', 'equivalence' and (particularly in the formal linguistics based on logic)'truth' and 'entailment' are crucial; in AI-semantics however we have the 'behaviour' oriented concepts of 'inferencing','disambiguating', 'reasoning', 'planning' etc.-3 A methodological principle of COL-semantics A distinctive feature of linguistics, especially logico-linguistic theories, is the separation of different \"expression\" and \"content\" levels ofanalysis and representation and the speci---202- fication of mapping rules between them (surface structure versus deep structure, syntactic structure versus semanticstructure).",
        "In Montague grammar this differentiation between a well defined syntactic level and an also well defined semantic level of description is a methodologically necessary consequence of the \"Fregean\" principle.",
        "The Fregean principle states that the meaning of an expression can be determined on the basis of the meanings of its logically simple constituent expressions and the syntactic structure of the whole expression.",
        "This principle has been revived by Montague and has been realized in his theory of language in such a way that the syntactic and the semantic structure of a natural language expression are respectively represented as expressions of formal systems (syntax and meaning algebras) between which systems there exist well defined formal relationships (homomorphisms).",
        "When this concept is transferred to the operationalizing of linguistic analysis in a computer system it will be excluded to conceive the mapping from natural language into semantic representation as a simple integrated pass, where in the course of parsing a sentence the valid semantic interpretation is assigned to each occurring item or group of items and where the possibilities of inference and association with stored background knowledge are 'locally' realized without ever generating a full syntactic analysis.",
        "Saving an explicit level of syntactic representation seems to be compatible with the Fregean principle only under the condition that the algorithm incorporates a grammar (in the technical sense of a consistent set of generating or accepting syntactic rules), but for reasons of optimization directly associates or applies semantic 'values' or 'rules' in processing the corresponding syntactic 'nodes' or 'rules'4, or even allows a semantic control of rule selection without leaving the parsing mode.",
        "This condition however is mostly not maintained in Al parsing approaches where the one step processing is understood as a cognitively adequate analogue of human linguistic information processing and where even the terminal and non terminal symbols of the \"grammar\" are interpreted as semantic categories.5 Syntactic and semantic representation in an information system The way of processing natural language according to the principles of COL semantics shall be demonstrated by the linguistic component of a natural language information system.",
        "The description is oriented at the application area and the structure of the system PLIDIS (information system for controlling industrial water pollution, developed at the Institut fuer deutsche Sprache, Mannheim).6 Giving only the over all structure of the system we have the following processings and levels: morphological analysis of natural language input syntactic analysis (level of syntactic representation) transduction into formal representation language (level of semantic representation) interpretation (evaluation) against the database answer generation The formal representation language is the language KS an extended first order predicate calculus, where the features going beyond predicate calculus are many sorted domain of individuals, lambda abstraction and extended term building.7 In the following two aspects of the semantic representation will be treated: the mapping between syntactically analyzed natural language expressions and their KS counterparts will be investigated a differentiation between three levels of semantic representation willbe accounted for: (level 1) syntax-interpretative level, (level 2) canonical level, (level 3) database-related level, All three levels follow the same syntax, i.e. the syntax of KS and have the same compositional model theoreticsemantics; they differ in their non logical constant symbols.",
        "Mapping natural language into the semantic representation language KS In analogy with Montague's \"theory of translation\" in \"Universal Grammar\"we assume that the syntactic structures of natural language (NL, here German) and the semantic language (here KS) are similar, i.e. there exists a translation function f, such that the following holds: (1.1.)",
        "Given the categories of a categorial grammar of NL, f is mapping from these categories on the syntactic categories of KS.",
        "I.e.",
        "If a, Di, ., On are basic categories of German, then f(n), f (Di),f(13/1) are syntactic categories of KS.",
        "If a/O1/.../Dri is a derived category (functor category) of NL, then f(a)/f030/.../ .Mn) is a derived category of KS.",
        "(1.2.)",
        "If a is an expression of category 6 in NL(E0), then f(a) is an expression of category f(8) in KS (f(a)f(6)).",
        "(1.3.)",
        "The concatenation of an expression of the derived category a/131/ with expressions of category 131,...driresuiting in an expression of category a",
        "with the category f(a)(concatenation and list construction are defined for categories instead of expressions in order to improve readability).",
        "Thus the 'transduction grammar' NLKS is the triple < GNL, GKs, f > We now specify a minimal categoria1 grammar of German GNL.",
        "A particular of GNL is the analysis of verbs as m-ary pre dicates, i.e. in the categorial framework, as functions from m NP into S8 and the analogue treatment of nouns as functor categories9 taking their attributes as arguments.",
        "Basic categories of NL category of sentences ON category of \"saturated\" common noun phrases NPcategory of noun phrases (singular",
        "Meaning postulates for generating canonical representations Both sentences have received different representations on level 1, they are nevertheless synonymous at least as far as the context of information seeking is concerned.",
        "An important principle in COL-semantics is the notion of structural (not lexical) synonymy.",
        "The following intuitively valid synonymy postulates (meaning postulates) can be formulated.",
        "In such a non-content verb proposition a noun phrase with a place holder attribute can also function as a \"second order\" principal NP, i.e. its unspecified attribute can be replaced by a \"filler\" NP, occurring as argument of the non-content verb: Arsengehalt llegt bei Lauxmann in der Probe vor.is synonymous with Die Probe bei Lauxmann enthdlt Arsen.",
        "Both postulates shall be applied for transducing the level 1 representations of NL sentences into level 2 representations.",
        "We first give a definition of 'principal term', i.e. the KS construction corresponding to a 'principal NP'.",
        "(Def.)",
        "A principal term in a formula containing as PRAED the translation of anon content verb is a term that is capable, according to its semantic and syntactic structure, to embed other argument terms of the translation of the non content verb as its arguments.",
        "The operationalized version of the two principles is now after having shifted them onto the KS level: (1: maximality principle)When a NL-expression has n analysis (n2) in level 1 which only differ in the number of arguments, then the level 2 representation consists of the 'maximal' level 1 expression, i.e. the expression containing the largest number of arguments.",
        "Any failing arguments are to be substituted by (existentially bound) variables.",
        "(2: transformation principle) (2.1.)",
        "When the PRAED of a formula is the translation of a non-content verb, at least one of its arguments must be a principal term.",
        "(2.2.)",
        "A formula containing the translation of a non content verb must be transformed into an expression which contains the PRAED of a principal term as predicate iff there is an unambiguous mapping of the arguments of the translation of the non-content verb a) into arguments of a principal term"
