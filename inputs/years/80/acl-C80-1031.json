        "Model theoretic semantics (MTS) has a special attitude to describe semantics, to characterize both artificial and natural languages by pure mathematical tools and some of the basic properties of this attitude are disscussed.",
        "The arsenal of MTS equipped here with such tools allowing the investigation at such a level of complexity that approximates the real situations.",
        "These tools are developed within the frame of category theory.",
        "1.",
        "The challenge of formal handling of semantics",
        "For long times, natural language has been regarded as some very soft, amorphous, and whimsical phenomenon.",
        "Although theoretical considerations showed that this may not be so, the very fact that actual linguistic methodology was quite soft and intuitive seemed to confirm the conviction that language cannot be treated very rigorously.",
        "It is clear, however, that the more explicit and transparent framework we use for handling a very complex phenomenon, the more can learn about what its complexity really consists of.",
        "It has been the use of more or less mathematical-minded methods improving the situation in recent decades.",
        "A very important first step in the direction of establishing such a framework has been generative grammar.",
        "Using the theory of formal languages it gave a fairly abstract picture of what syntax is, and it has also proved to be an extremely powerful tool in analysing admittedly very subtle syntactic phenomena and, what is even more, in discovering formerly unnoticed interconnections.",
        "Whatever revealing the results of generative grammar should be with respect to syntax, however, it cannot be regarded as paradigmatic if one is interested in a semantics-oriented model of language.",
        "Generative grammarians never put the question of what semantics is and what role it plays in language at the same theoretical level they reached with syntax.",
        "It is reasonable to require that any treatment of semantics be adequate to rigorously formalized methods used for syntax.",
        "For this we should use formalism not as abbreviation but as basic tool of investigation, e.g. relating exact mathematical objects to components of language.",
        "Moreover we aim to characterize language through analysing the corresponding mathematical methods.",
        "An appropriate approach can be borrowed from mathematical logic.",
        "This results the so called model theoretic semantics (MTS).",
        "MTS is an attitude to investigate natural language from the point of view of semantics.",
        "This attitude provides the investigation of natural language on an abstract level.",
        "Namely, it answers the question in the most abstract sense what language is and what its basic components are.",
        "The basic properties of the MTS's attitude are analysed in [3].",
        "2.",
        "What is MTS?",
        "Language can be analysed only through analysing language carriers.",
        "From the different possible functions, the language possesses, we find the cognitive one the most significant and this answers our question above.",
        "Considering a language carrying system /whether it be human or a machine or else/ the cognitive function is realized while the language is used to describe objects and events of the environment under cognition.",
        "Characterising language we abstract from the cognitive process itself and from the internal",
        "organization of the system.",
        "Our mere concern is the outcome of the cognitive process, that is, descriptive texts and their relation to the environment which they refer to.",
        "MTS attitude demands an ideal external observer (EO) who is to model the system (S) and the system's environment world (W).",
        "EO forms models of S, of W and of the SW relation.",
        "In order that EO should be able to form the intended models, he must possess the following kinds of knowledge about the sample situation (and EO being an ideal observer, we assume he really does): (i) E0 knows the aspect and the level at which S may perceive and describe the environment; in other words, EO knows S's sensitivity.",
        "(ii) EO knows those fundamental aspects of W that S may describe.",
        "(i)-(ii) together ensure that EO models W adequately with respect to S.",
        "(iii)E0 knows that S is finite whereas W is both infinite and infinitely complex.",
        "(iv) EO knows that S's actual environment is accidental.",
        "The knowledge S may obtain at each stage of its cognition is compatible with infinitely many possible worlds.",
        "The SW relation is therefore uncertain: the texts of S always correspond to infinitely many environments, rather than a unique one.",
        "On the basis of (i)-(iv) EO forms the following models: The model of S will just be a system producting texts (more precisely, the material bodies of texts, whatever they should be).",
        "In case EO happens to be a mathematician,Model (S) will be a formal grammar capable of generating the texts of the language.",
        "The model of W is a metalinguistic description of the world, adequate to S' s sensitivity.",
        "For purely theoretical purposes, EO only has to take into account that S has some fixed though arbitrary sensitivity, determining the possible character of the objects and phenomena of W S may describe.",
        "When modelling some concrete language, S's sensitivity is also fixed though no longer arbitraryly .",
        "In case EO happens to be a mathematician, Model (W) will be a mathematical object.",
        "Because of the uncertainty of the SW relation,Model(W) is a class of models of infinitely many possible worlds.",
        "The model of the SW relation is some correspondance between elements of texts and things in the world-models.",
        "In case E0 happens to be a mathematician, Model(S-W) can be a class of relations or functions.",
        "We have reached the point where we may define language as it appears at this level of abstraction.",
        "By an abstract language La we mean a triple <Model (S), Model (lar, Model (S-W)>.",
        "Furthermore, we call Model (S) the syntax of La, and Model (W) and Model (S-W) together the semantics of LA.",
        "We emphasize that all these models are formed by an ideal external observer and are described in his own language.",
        "The aboves illustrated by the following figure.",
        "In the case of classical mathematical logic first of all a similarity type t is fixed (t is a function that renders a natural number, the arity, to each relation and function symbols of the basic alphabet, i.e. of the signature).",
        "The set F of all possible formulas generates from the alphabet with logical connectives in the usual way corresponds to Model(S).",
        "The class M of all possible t-type relation structures (models) corresponds to Model(W).",
        "The so called validity relation I= Mt x Ft corresponds to Model (S-W).",
        "Thus a t-type classical first order language Lt is the triple <Ft,Mt,I=>.",
        "3.",
        "MTS in more complex situations",
        "A very simple, we may say, an idealized situation has been considered above.",
        "Namely with respect to S it was supposed that its cognition goes on at a fixed level and aspect of analysis, i.e. with a fixed sensitivity.",
        "We call this type of cognition homogeneous cognition.",
        "However MTS attitude enables us to characterize natural language not only in the above simplicity but in the complexity that approximates more realistic cases.",
        "Indeed a system S can desribe the same objects and events of W from different aspects and at different levels of detailing.",
        "Moreover beyond the great spectrum of sensitivity different environment worlds can be the object of cognition.",
        "Cognition in this situation is said to be heterogeneous cognition.",
        "The situation to be described from the point of view of EO is as follows.",
        "The natural language itself virtually seems to enable us to speak about very different kinds of environment at very different levels from very different aspects.",
        "Thus in this light natural language appears as an extremely rich many-purpose language.",
        "Beyond the surface natural language consits of such parts which themselves are languages as well (cf. with the subdevision of natural language into a set of dialects or sociolects).",
        "These parts, the sublanguages, are historically formed from others.",
        "With the growth of the observable environment the corresponding knowledge also widens.",
        "The latter needs new language elements so as to be described.",
        "Therefore some words change their meanings, new concepts appear which emerge into new sublanguages.",
        "E.g. the word \"tree\" has quite a different meaning for a woodman, for a biologist, for a painter, for a child, for a linguist, for a mathematician, etc.",
        "The different meanings are cone nected with different sublanguages which are but different sociolects in this case.",
        "However the sublanguages are not independent.",
        "They are in a very complex connection, e.g. one may extract lexical morphological or other kinds of connections on the base of which one or other hierarchy of sublanguages can be sorted out.",
        "Such a hierarchy provides a possible \"selection\" for the natural language.",
        "Thus a hierarchy of languages consists of the constituent languages together with the relation considered between them.",
        "Note that one can find a detailed survey of different approaches to sublanguages in [6], where another approach has arisen to analyse sublanguages which are called there subsystems of languages.",
        "How natural language as a many purpose one can be investigated with MTS attitude.",
        "First of all a so called disjunctive approach can be applied for, according to which EO subdivides the language into such parts each of which can be modelled as a homogeneous one, i.e. as a language that corresponds to a unique and fixed sensitivity.",
        "Now it is supposed that S has several languages rather than a single one.",
        "So Model (S) should consist of a conglomerate of sublanguages.",
        "However if the sublanguages were independent then EO could model S as a conglomerate of subsystems.",
        "But this is not the case because among most of the sublanguages there are some transition possibilities e.g. translation, interpretation.",
        "The MTS attitude possesses tools (developed within the frame of mathematical logic) by the use of which the homogeneous cases can be described.",
        "So a conglomerate of languages can also be described by these tools but only as a conglomerate of independent languages.",
        "What about the connection between two languages?",
        "Mathematical logic provides tools only for the case when the languages have the same signature, i.e. when their alphabet is the same.",
        "In this case the notion of homomorphism is powerful enough to describe the connection between the languages.",
        "But such a case is of not much interest to linguists.",
        "Perhaps it is more interesting to analyse the connection between languages of different type (e.g. between a ti-type and t2-type first order classical languages).",
        "Let us see e.g. translation.",
        "Having two different languages say, English and Russian, translating a text from one into the other first of all we require not a direct correspondance",
        "between the words, but a connection between the corresponding \"world concep-tions\" of the languages and only then is it resonable to establish the connection between the syntactical elements.",
        "In MTS this means that for the translation we have to",
        "(i) represent the \"world concep-tion\" of the languages in question.",
        "A \"world conception\" is but a set of sentences (knowledge) that determines a subclass of Model(W); (ii) establish the connection between the corresponding subclasses of models, i.e. between the \"world conceptions\"; (iii) establish the connection among the corresponding syntactical elements.",
        "But up to now MTS has not been in possession of tools to satisfy the above requirements (i)-(iii).",
        "Note that in mathematical logic a set of sentences determines a theory.",
        "A theory T determines a subclass Mod (T) of models, namely those models where each sentence of T is valid.",
        "(Thus a theory T induces a new language <Ft'Mod(T), >.)",
        "Thus first of all a connection between the corresponding theories, is required for the translation.",
        "However translation between any two languages may not always exist.",
        "E.g. let us have two languages physics and biology and we want to establish connection between them.",
        "For this we should analyse the connection between the corresponding knowledges.However this analysis, as usual, cannot be established directly.",
        "A mediator theory is needed.",
        "The mediator is an interdisciplinary theory, e.g. the language of general system theory (see e.g. [2]).",
        "By the use of the mediator a new language with a new kind of knowledge arizes from the input languages, namely biophysics.",
        "Our aim is the extension of the MTS attitude to analyse the semantics of many-purpose languages and language hierarchies.",
        "We develop such tools (within the frame of mathematical logic) by the use of which EO can model a language carrying system not only in a homogeneous situation, but in a heterogeneous one too, the complexity of which approximates the real cases.",
        "Here we only outline the basic idea providing the basic notions, since the bounds of this paper do not allow us to give a detailed description of the tools",
        "A similarity type t is a pair t=<H,t'> such that 't' is a function,t': Dom t'--N where N is the set of natural numbers and 0(tN, and H Dom (t').",
        "Let <r,n>Et' (i.e. let t'(r) n).",
        "If rEH then r is said to be an n-1 -ary function symbol, if ritH then r is said to be an nary relation symbol.",
        "* Let a be an ordinal.",
        "Ft denotes the set of all t-type formulas containing variable symbols from a set of variables of cardinality a.",
        "Thus a t-type first order language is <ET,Mt, > .",
        "If",
        "A pair T = <Ax,q>, where Ax Ft is said to be a theory in a variables.",
        "* Note that a theory provides a sub-language of Lt, namely the triple",
        "The set of the concepts of a theory T is CTa= Ft /----7= (Fa / =7-, means the factori- d T' zation of the set of formulas into such classes any two elements of which are semantically equivalent w.r.t.",
        "T.) * Thus in the case of a given theory T C contains all the formulas which are T compatible with T. Moreover Cm determines what can be described at all about the models by the use of theory T. Note that to Cm a Boole algebra can be corresponded where 0 and 1 correspond to \"false\" and \"true\" respectively and the operators correspond to the logical connectives.",
        "Let us consider the following",
        "Let t = <0,{<R,1>}> be the simularity type and T = <0,F> be a theory.",
        "(Note that this theory is axiomless.)",
        "We write x instead of xo, Rx instead of R(x) and T instead of T / The concept algebra CT looks as follows where we use the following notations: c=3xRxA]x1Rx , d=VxRxVVx1Rx , e=Rx-..VxRx , f=111x.-Vx1Rx , g=RxAEx1Rx , h=1RxA3xRx , i.--3xRx-(RxAx1Rx), jr..x1Rx-(1RxA3xRx).",
