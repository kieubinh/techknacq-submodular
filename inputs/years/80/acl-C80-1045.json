        "In the computer processing of the Japanese language informations, the input method is much more difficult than in other Indo-European languages because thousands of kinds of characters in mainly two classes, Kanji(ideograms) and Kana(phonograms), are used together in writing regular sentences.",
        "Conventional Japanese typewriters are equipped with least 2000 Kanji(Chinese characters) which are frequently used in daily use.",
        "A typewrite of this sort is difficult for us to handle and its typing speed is much lower than that of alphabetic typewriters because operators must look for characters one by one.",
        "One of the most promising input methods to overcome this intrinsic input difficulty is Kana-Kanji translation system, in which all the sentences are input with Kana only using a regular 44-Key keyboard and then translated into regular Kanji-Kana sentences automatically in the computer.",
        "The automatic translation system consists of two processes; the segmentation and the word identification processes.",
        "The problems in Kana-Kanji translation The problems in Kana-Kanji translation are:",
        "(a) segmentation of input sentences.",
        "(b) word identification from homonyms.",
        "These problems are basic in the processing of Japanese sentences as language informations.",
        "Japanese sentences in Kanji and Kana have no spaces between words as English ones do.",
        "However, in order to make the computer process Kana sentences easy, it would be necessary to put a space as a segmental symbol between words or some units in sentences.",
        "Therefore, some spacing methods, listed in Fig.l(concluding non-segmented sentence for convenience), was already adopted in Kana-Kanji translation systems.1-3 NAAmalo,4-LtH",

        "(1) segmented between words (2) segmented between an independent word and a sequence of dependent words (3) segmented between Bunsetsu (4) segmented between Kanji and Kana (5) non-segmented Fig.l Examples of segmentations in a Japanese sentence.",
        "However, these pre-editing methods of word segmentation or unit segmentation are not only an too laborious for most of the Japanese people who are not accustomed in segmenting each sentence into words but also apt to be erroneous.",
        "It is, therefore, necessary in Kana-Kanji translation system to segment the Kana strings into words or other units automatically.",
        "The number of different syllables in Japanese is much less than in English or in Chinese, while the number of Kanji is much more.",
        "Consequently, there are many groups of Kanji which have the same pronunciation.",
        "This fact makes word identification more difficult in Kana-Kanji translation since there is no one-to-one correspondence between Kanji and Kana.",
        "For example, Kana strings ..,v/corresponds to 25 words in an ordinary dictionary and a part of these are shown below.",
        "The segmentation process Bunsetsu A Japanese sentence is composed of the sequences of syntactic units called Bunsetsu pronounced without pausing.",
        "Bunsetsu usually consists of two parts: an independent part and a dependent part.",
        "The independent part consists of an independent word or its derivative, and the dependent part consists of a sequence of dependent words, given as follows: Bunsetsu=(independent part)•(dependent part) independent part =[prefix].",
        "(independent word).",
        "[suffix] dependent part =[dependent word]* independent word=noun/pronoun/adverbs/ verb/adjective/verbal adjective/ attributive/conjuction/interjection dependent word=auxiliary verb/particle or postposition Here, brackets indicate optionality, the asterisk indicates one or more repititions or non-existing and the slants indicate alternatives.",
        "The independent words(ejiritsugol) are divided into two main groups: inflected words which consist of verbs, adjectives and verbal adjectives(lkeiyodoshif), and non-inflected words which consist of nouns, pronouns and others.",
        "On the other hand, the dependent words consist of particles and auxiliary verbs which have their inflections.",
        "There are grammatical connectabilities between a preceding word and its succeeding word in Bunsetsu.",
        "This is explained using an example in Fig.2.",
        "An indicative form 'ika' of a verb 'iku' can be concatenated not only by inflectional form 'nakere' of auxiliary verb 'nai' in this example but also by all of inflectional forms of 'nai'.",
        "And the particle 'ba' is preceded by the conditional form of 'nai'.",
        "Thus, these properties are decided upon each inflectional form of the preceding word(if the word is an inflected word) and its succeeding word.",
        "These connectability features in Bunsetsu constitute the basis of the segmentation of Kana strings described in later For segmentation, each independent word is, in the order of length, first separated by comparing the Kana strings with the vocabulary of a word dictionary, and is stored with the informations such as parts of speech and inflectional forms if necessary for further morhological analysis.",
        "Then, the dependent words in the rest of the strings are recognized using the dependent-word list and grammatical connectabilities between the dependent word and the independent word are examined.",
        "This analysis is continued until no succeeding word is found in the successive Kana strings.",
        "Thus, the candidates of a Bunsetsu are extracted from Kana strings as below.",
        "Example.",
        "souiuzassiwo ... (a part of strings)",
        "The same analysis as mentioned above is executed for the rest of the strings from which each candidate of Bunsetsu is separated.",
        "Consequently, the sequence of two candidates of Bunsetsu is extracted from Kana strings, and then the Bunsetsu in the sentence is appropriately identified so as to make the total length of two consecutive strings of their candidates maximum.",
        "This algorithm decides only the boundary between two consecutive Bunsetsu.",
        "In other words, the preceding Kana strings and these constituents for the Bunsetsu are recognized.",
        "On the other hand, the decisions for succeeding Bunsetsu are tentative at this stage.",
        "These processes named as the longest string-match method of two Bunsetsu4 are executed sentence by sentence and at length the input sentences are converted into Bunsetsu and homonyms in Bunsetsu are stored.",
        "An example is illustrated in Fig.3.",
        "souiuzasshiwo...",
        "1) souiu zasshiwo... 2) soui... 3) soui iu... Fig.3 Segmentation process of Kana strings by the longest string-match method of two Bunsetsu.",
        "The successive candidates of Bunsetsu in 1) and 3) are compared since the succeeding Kana strings are not analyzed in 2).",
        "As the total length of two analyzed strings in 1) is longer than that in 3), the segmentation in 1), namely the Bunsetsu 'souiu' is decided as the result.",
        "The proccessing of unknown words The word identification process among homonyms The longest string-match method of two ' Bunsetsu is based on the grammatical character-ristics of the words, and so is not applicable to unknown words to the word dictionary.",
        "Hence, it would be easily expected that the appearance of an unknown word in a sentence makes the segmentation impossible.",
        "Therefore, it is necessary in non-segmented sentences to take account of the processing of unknown words.",
        "The dependent words are divided into two main groups by their connectability characteristics.",
        "One is the word class, named as A, that is preceded by nouns or non-inflected words.",
        "The other is the word class that is preceded by inflected words and is further subdivided into four sub-classes, named as B, C, D and E, according to the preceding word conjugations which are of indefinite form, conjunction form, final form and conditional form, repectively.",
        "The dependent words and their classes of connectabilities are given in Table 1.",
        "Now, suppose that the search for the word dictionary fails.",
        "Then, the word in the above dependent word list is searched for the rest of the strings without being segmented.",
        "If a dependent word is found and its preceding Kana corresponds to an inflected word-ending succeeded by it – vowels of inflectional endings of indefinite, conjunction, final and conditional forms are '-a', '-i' or '-e', '-u' and '-e', respectively, then the dependent word is recognized and its succeeding Kana strings are analyzed morphologically as mentioned in the preceding section.",
        "Consequently, the dependent word sequences are extracted and utilized for next segmentation.",
        "As mentioned above, a part of words in input sentences is identified in grammatical or•morphological analysis.",
        "But there are still many homonyms which have the same grammatical characteristics in general.",
        "Therefore, further word identification will need for syntactical and semantical analyses in a given sentence.",
        "The usage dictionary The usage dictionary contains the informations of word uses which play an important role on word identification from homonyms.",
        "Informations of word uses would be divided into two groups: colloqual information of words such as derivatives, compound words and ideoms, and semantic informations such as \"semantic pattern\" representative of nouns and verbs.",
        "Case relations accompanied with verbs in a sentence are explicitly marked with particles attached by nouns.",
        "Usually, the particles 'ga', 'wo' and 'ni' indicate nominative, objective and dative respectively, whose case relations are fundamental, and so these are called 'go.' case, 'wo' case and 'ni' case, respectively.",
        "Accordingly, the so-called case frame of each verb has been studied with an emphasis on these particles.",
        "Example.",
        "[watashi] ga aruke [I] walk [hon] wo yomu read [book] [mono] ni sawaru touch [thing] where, [x] means a semantic feature or semantic category of x.",
        "One of difficulties of doing the work is the semantic classification of each word.",
        "To avoid this burden, the semantic category of each word is identified according to the system of \"The Word List by Semantic Principles\" edited by the National Language Research Institute, in which about 32,600 words are divided into 798 semantic categories.",
        "The particle 'ni' also occurs after locative noun which mean the location.",
        "However, it is empirically assumed that either locative nouns or dative nouns occur with each verb in a simple sentence.",
        "The example is given as follows, [hito] ni [ie] ni itta ...said to the men to the house... ...went The above example is unusual and this fact means that semantic features of nouns with 'ni' are derived from surface structures of sentences.",
        "The case frame6 of each verb is different, and so semantic categories of nouns and standard particles used as semantical \"identifiers\" are described in the usage dictionary.",
        "The particles 'de', 'kara', and 'he' with respective semantic categories are filled up in the usage dictionary in the above example.",
        "For adjectives and verbal adjectives, semantic categories of nominative nouns are only filled up in the usage dictionary.",
        "The example is given as follows:",
        "Where, 'kireida' is a verbal adjective in Japanese which corresponds to an adjective in English.",
        "As a result, we have investigated \"semantic pattern\" for 3421 inflected words which consist of verbs, adjectives, verbal adjectives and verbs conjugated with 'suru' which are called 'sahenmeishi', since their word stems are regarded as nouns in Japanese.",
        "These words are extracted from the vocabulary frequency table edited by the National Language Research Institute.",
        "( On the other hand, informations about nouns, namely, their derivatives composed with prefixes and suffixes, compound words and idioms are collected from an ordinary dictionary.°The example of a part of the usage dictionary is illustlated in Fig.4.",
        "Characteristics of Kakariuke relations in a sentence are given as follows:",
        "(1) A final word or an inflectional form in a Bunsetsu decides what kinds of words to modify, on the other hand each of the independent words decides how to be modified.",
        "(2) Each Bunsetsu as a dependent always appears before its governor in a sentence.",
        "(3) Kakariuke relations between any two Bunsetsu do not cross with each other in a sentence.",
        "For simplicity of the parsing, we adopted the following two assumptions that would be correct in most sentences.",
        "(4) A Kakariuke relation is decided on the smallest distance between a dependent and its probable governors.",
        "(5) Each Bunsetsu can be a dependent of only one Bunsetsu appearing after it except the Bunsetsu at the end of a sentence.",
        "The relations among Bunsetsu are searched taking account of the following three factors: five conditions mentioned above, final word as a dependent and an independent word class as a governor.",
        "The term noun phrase is used for Bunsetsu in which an independent part is a noun, and similarly a verb phrase for Bunsetsu consisting of a verb and its dependent part.",
        "But, for the phrase of the form of a noun and some of auxiliary verbs, which are called as copulas ('desu', 'da' etc.",
        "), it is necessary to regard the phrase as a predicate in a sentence.",
        "The parsing After segmenting sentences into Bunsetsu, the parsing phase begins, in order not to take out so-called tree structures but to extract the syntactic relations between Bunsetsu or words.",
        "The parsing of the sentence is executed on the basis of the Kakariuke relations(something like the dependency relations) between Bunsetsu.",
        "The Kakariuke is the term in Japanese traditional school grammar.",
        "(She is my daughter.)",
        "In the above example, an underline denotes a word and a slant does a segmental symbol between Bunsetsu.",
        "An arrowed line denotes the Kakariuke relation between Bunsetsu.",
        "Usually, the Kakariuke relation between Bunsetsu, 'watashino' and 'musumedesu', is determined by the particle 'no' and the noun 'musume', on the other hand the relation between 'kanojowa' and 'musumedesu' is determined by the particle 'ha' and the auxiliary verb 'desu'.",
        "The preprocessing for the word identification In Japanese, the different semantic relations are reduced to the same syntactic relations of verbs with nouns intermediated by particles in active voice as in passive voice.",
        "The passive or causative voice is represented explicitly by the attachment of auxiliary verbs ('reru, rareru') or auxiliary verbs('seru, saseru') to inflectional forms of verbs.",
        "Accordingly, the semantic normalization is necessary in the cases below.",
        "(i) passive: N1 ga N2 ni V+reru(or rareru).",
        "-4 N2 ga N1 ni V. (ii) causative:",
        "N1 ga N2 ni N3 wo V+seru(or saseru).",
        "-+ N2 ga N3 wo V. where N1, N2 and N3 denotes a noun and V denotes a transitive verb.",
        "The auxiliary verbs (reru and seru) are used for the consonant conjugation verbs(godan katsuyo doshi), on the other hand the auxiliary verbs(rareru and saseru) for the vowel conjugation verbs(ichidan katsuyo doshi).",
        "The meaning of independent part which consists of an independent and a suffix is substituted for the meaning of its suffix.",
        "Similarly, the meaning of the number that consists of the set of the numeral plus counter is representative of the meaning of its counter.",
        "Example [nihon+jin] -*[jin] [100+nin] [nin] where,'jin'and'nin' are a suffix and a counter, respectively that mean the word \"human\".",
        "The dependent part composed of more than two dependent words are substituted for a dependent word representing a case in order to consult the usage dictionary in next steps.",
        "Example Tokyo•he•mo itta – 0 Tokyo•he itta (went to Tokyo, too) (went to Tokyo) Word selections from homonyms Word selections from homonyms an executed using both colloqual informations and informations about cases with verbs.",
        "Word selection based on noun-to-verb relation Word selections from homonyms are executed particle attached to each noun.",
        "At that time, each particle is converted into the \"standard particle\" in the preprocessing phase.",
        "And so, each semantic category of homonyms (nouns) is compared with the corresponding semantic category code in the usage dictionary, and the most matched word is selected.",
        "When homonyms are verbs, the verb and the nouns as case elements of the verb are selected taking account of the numbers of case found in the sentence.",
        "The nouns related with verbs intermediated by the particle 'no' are referred to the nominative nouns.",
        "As it is assumed that the noun attached by copulas such as 'desu' are in the synonymous relation to nominative nouns, each pair is selected from homonyms.",
        "As it is difficult to estimate the case relations between verbs and nouns modified by their verbs because of no occurrence of particles, the reference to the case elements not identified yet are tried.",
        "In the example below, the words 'hon' are examined whether they are nominative or objective elements of the verb 'morau'.",
        "Kare ni moratta hon (book received from him ) hon ga morau hon wo morau Word selection based on noun-to-noun relations For the Bunsetsu composed of prefixes and/or suffixes and independent words, the derivative is decided according to their prefixes and suffixes in the usage dictionary.",
        "When the successive nouns are found, each registration is examined, and the registered word in the usage dictionary is selected if any.",
        "Informations as for idioms are also, referred for nouns and verbs in the Kakariuke relation because their words are identified in colloqual expressions.",
        "In the sequence of two nouns, either of which is 'sahenmeishi', it is often assumed that the semantical relation between two nouns is based on the case relation because 'sahenmeishi' also have the characteristics as verbs.",
        "Example jouhou shori (information processing) jouhou wo shorisuru (... process informations...) The semantic category of alternative nouns 'jouhou' are compared with semantic categories of case elements of a verb 'shori + suru' are so qii* is selected from homonyms(iYiA)5, etc.)",
        "As it is assumed that two nouns intermediated by the conjunctive particles('to', 'ya', 'dano', tnaril, etc.)",
        "are in the relation of the same or similar semantic categories.",
        "The pair of nouns is selected, whose semantic category codes are close to each other.",
