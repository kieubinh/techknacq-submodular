        "The development of the theory of library classification and of subject indexing, for the organisation, storage and retrieval of subjects embodied in documents has a striking parallelism to the search for 'universal forms' and deep structure 'in language and linguistic studies.",
        "The significant contributions of the theories of classification and subject indexing are the subject analysis techniques of Rangenathan and Bhattacharyya's POPSI.",
        "A computer based system, for generating an information retrieval thesaurus, from modulated subject-propositions, formulated according to the subject analysis techniques, enriched with certain codes for relating the terms in the subject-propositions has been developed.",
        "The system generates hierarchic, associative, coordinate and synonymous relationships between terms and presents them as an alphabetical thesaurus.",
        "Also, once a thesaurus is generated in one language it is possible to produce the same thesaurus in different languages by just forming a table of equivalent terms in the required language.",
        "Information Retrieval Thesaurus An information retrieval thesaurus could be defined as \"a controlled dynamic vocabulary of semantically related terms offering comprehensive coverage of a domain of knowledge\".",
        "Its main use is in the subject characterization of documents and queries in information storage and retrieval systems based on concept coordination 26.",
        "The application of computers for updating, testing, editing and printing thesaurus 25 has gained much importance due to the use of thesaurus as a vocabulary control device in bibliographic information storage and retrieval systems, at the input stage for controlled indexing and at the retrieval stage for expanding the 'search query' to increase recall - both in batch and an-line modes of processing 18, 22, 62, 64, Automatic Generation of Thesaurus Several experiments in automatic generation of thesaurus have been carried out in which relationships between terms have been determined by taking into account the number of documents in which the respective terms occur jointly 27, 65.",
        "Various clustering techniques have been investigated out of a range of similarity criteria.",
        "The role played by similarity criteria in obtaining the environment of each term and the use of this environment for retrieval have been explored 57.",
        "Computational procedures for generating thesaurus include keyword statistics, 9alculation of Tanimoto coefficient 01, matrix inversion, formation of similarity matrix, automatic cluster analysis using minimal tree procedure and compilation of groups and main groups of descriptors 1, 29, 54, 56, 58, 65, 66.",
        "But, \"the difficulty, however, is that text-scanning is more effective in syntactic and morphological analysis where there is sufficient repetition to justify the belief that a particular fact is significant\" 31, 32.",
        "Further, all these techniques use a lot of computer time and are capable of producing a list of selected and grouped keywords.",
        "But it has also been observed that, although a large variety of clusters and associated query expansions have been obtained, no significant improvements in the document retrieval performance have been achievedIn other words, an information retrieval thesaurus is something more than 0 list of grouped and ranked keywords 44,"

        "There are two basic aspects of thesaurus construction.",
        "They are: 1 selection of keywords/descriptors of the subject for which the thesaurus is constructed; and",
        "2 establishment of interrelationships among these selected keywords as to whether the terms form a broader or narrower or related or synonymous or 'use' relation.",
        "Using computers alone for both the above mentioned aspects of thesaurus construction is not practicable for, using computers for selecting the keywords from free language text is not an economic approach, and it is not feasible to make a computer automatically distinguish the relationship between terms as to broader, narrower, synonymous etc.",
        "Metalanguage for Information Organisation It was realised that the failure of experiments with automatic abstracting, indexing etc., \"should be sought above all, in an insufficient knowledge of the structure of the text from the standpoint of relationships between an apparent formal linguistic representation an bne hand and an the other hand, the informational content involved in the textAs the result of such investigations we can arrive, among others, at various descriptive formulas of the structure of scientific texts\"28.",
        "One way of arriving at structures that reflect specific textual content is to make use of the restrictions in language usage which are characteristic of the texts in a particular subject matter that is, to exploit the fact that on a particular topic, only certain words in certain combinations actually appear 55.",
        "In other words, it was realised that what is required is a special purpose artificial language, to cater to the needs of information storage, processing and retrieval.",
        "The Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee (1966) realised and reported that \"A deeper knowledge of language could help ... to enable us to engineer artificial languages for special purposes... and to use machines as aids in translation and in information retrieval\"40 Subsequently, suggestions for a metatheory of linguistics and information science, with a metalanguage having all the properties of a classification schema have been proposed.",
        "The term 'metalanguage' specifies a 'public' metalanguage, such as a document classification system, as distinguished from the 'object language' represented by the documents.",
        "The written record of a document classification schema is not really parallel to the surface structure of the object language - the natural language sentences of a document.",
        "A classification schema is intended to classify, and, therefore the language of the schema is mainly classificatory.",
        "In other words, the metalanguage does not explicitly include all relevant terms in the object language, but the object language does include all terms in the metalanguage.",
        "Moreover, superset-subset (class inclu- sion) relations are usually explicitly given by he structure of the classification 3.",
        "Thus some of thellogical semantic' relatims, specifically those of implication 34 are specified in the so-called 'surface structure' of the metalanguage, but not in the surface structure of the object language 38 Universal Forms and Subject Representation Parallel to the search for universal linguistic forms such as that expounded by Chomsky, Fodor and others (the discovery that certain features of given languages can be reduced to universal properties of language and explained in terms of deeper aspects of linguistic form, 11, 12, 37; and that such deep structure of sentences determine the semantic content while their surface structures determine the phonetic interpretation), steps towards the formulation of generic framework for structuring the representation of the name of a subject for the development of classification schemes and subject, tude/ng languages were investigated 411 4,, 4.48.",
        "Such universals are being arrived at and used in various other areas dealing with information and information processing.",
        "For instance, in the area of data modelling, now the basic problem is to identify the world as a domain of objects with properties and relations 10.",
        "Such categorisation of objects of study is not new to the library profession.",
        "As early as 1930s, the use of categorisation of component ideas forming the name of a subject into Personality/core object of study, Matter/ property/method, Energy/action, Space/ place and Time, and defining an order of these categories to form a 'logical, classificatory language' resulting in 'faceted' library classification schemes was known in India 45, 47, It is interesting to note that it has been realised now that the above mentioned Ranganathan's categories Personality, Matter and Energy, are \"general categories building the system's structure as a spatiotemporal -304 - neighbourhood relationship \" useful in deriving meta informational, for a process of automatic analysis too 13, 14.",
        "The order of the component ideas denoting the different categories in the name of a subject as prescribed is context-dependent order.",
        "More specifically it is context-specifying order.",
        "Every component category sets the context for the next and following ones.",
        "Also in this classificatory language, every category should explicitly have the corresponding superordinate component ideas preceding it.",
        "The reason for fixing the superordinates before the component elements concerned is to render the component elements denote precisely the ideas they represent.",
        "Nrther, it has been conjectured that 401 52 the syntax (order) of representation of the component elements in the name of a subject as prescribed by the principles for sequence - facet sequence 49 - is more or less parallel to the Absolute Syntax - ie., the sequence in which the component ideas of subjects falling in a subject-field arrange themselves in the minds of a majority of normal intellectuals.",
        "If the syntax of the representation of the component ideas of subjects is made to conform to, or parallel to the Absolute Syntax, then the pattern of linking of the component ideas - ie., the resulting kn9wledge structure is likely to be 42"

        "Due to the development of techniques for structuring of subjects and for classification of subjects, several experiments were conducted at the Documentation Research and Training Centre to use them for thesaurus construction.",
        "To begin with, a faceted library classification scheme for a specific subject field was used in t4R computer generation of thesaurusin which it was possible to incorporate the hierarchic relationships of terms.",
        "But it was not possible to incorporate the generation of non-hierarchic associative relationship of terms.",
        "Terms that have associative relationship to each other have to be established only by consensus of experts in the field concerned.",
        "But the validity of the assumption that, knowledge based on the consensus of experts in a field is different from the knowledge expressed in the literature of the field has been challenged, as the two lists of keywords, One given by experts and the other formed by analysis of published literature were not significantly different 33.",
        "In other wards, terms that are related to each other associatively could be easily ascertained by an analysis of the statement of the name of the subject of a document or of a reader's query.",
        "For instance, whether \"x-ray treatment\" is associatively related to \"cancer\", or not, could be established if there exists a document on \"x-ray treatment of cancer\".",
        "In other words, a published document on \"x-ray treatment of cancer\" brings into associative relationship both \"x-ray treatment\" and \"cancer\".",
        "Also it is unimportant which terms co-occur frequently in the names of subjects for, any term that is used once in the statement of the name of a subject is enough to be admitted into the thesaurus for that subject and is related with other terms in that name of the subject in some particular way.",
        "In order to incorporate associatively related terms in thesauri, experiments were conducted 35, 53 using subject representations formulated for the purpose of developing classification schedules, which were arrived at by",
