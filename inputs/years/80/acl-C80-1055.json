        "In the past years we have been applying semantic ATN-grammars - as introduced by Brown & Burton (1974) - to natural language question-answering tasks (e.g. a LISP-Tutor [Barth, 19771, a question-answering system about the micro-world of soccer IRathke Sonntag, 19791).",
        "We found that semantic grammars execute efficiently, but become large very quickly even with moderate domains of discourse.",
        "We therefore looked for ways to support parsing by domain-dependent knowledge represented in an inheritance network [Laubsch,19791.",
        "In this paper we first briefly describe our representation language Objtalk, and then illustrate how it is used for building an understanding system for processing German newspaper texts about the jobmarket situation.",

        "We have developped an object-oriented representation language - called ObjTalk - in which objects are frame-like data structures which have behavioral traits and communicate through message passing.",
        "The objects (classes and instances) are organized into a (multiple) inheritance hierarchy.",
        "ObjTalk is an extension to Lisp and was inspired by SMALLTALK FGoldberg&Kay, 19761, PRL [Roberts&Goldstein, 19771, and KLONE rBrachman, 19781.",
        "(ASK CLASS NEW: <concept-name> SUPERC (<concept-namel>...) GENERIC-PROPERTIES",
        "The effect of sending NEW: to CLASS is to define a class with the given <concept-name> as a subclass of the named superclass(es).",
        "Instances are made by sending the concept a message that causes to fill its slots with fillers which satisfy the filler description.",
        "If an object receives a message, this will be matched against the method-filters.",
        "In case of success the corresponding method's body will be evaluated.",
        "Concepts inherit methods and generic properties from, their superclass(es) recursively upto the root node Object (which implements the system-defined messages).",
        "Objects may be further specified dynamically by adding slots or methods, or filling slots.",
        "For schema-driven parsing, a semantic subATN should be activated whenever a particular word is found, or concept is expected.",
        "The basic mechanism is to attach trigger-keys to a schema that state which words",
        "which words or concepts make a schema active.",
        "Once active it puts the named subATN-nodes in a preferred activatable state.",
        "The ATN-machine has been extended to prefer PUSH arcs from non-deterministic states if they are activatable.",
        "This is implemented by primitives for activating a subATN, deactivating an active one, and a test for activation.",
        "The subATNs of the trigger-atn form (or those ones in filler descriptions) are made activatable if",
        "(1) a concept has been partially instantiated (an instance of this concept or one lower in the hierarchy was made, but not all obligatory roles are filled), or (2) one of the concepts mentioned in trigger-keys has been instantiated, or (3) one of the words mentioned in trigger kys was found by the scanner.",
        "Arc actions of the ATN may send messages to concepts, and thus (partially) instantiate a concept.",
        "Application to newspaper understanding We are currently applying ObjTalk to understanding newspaper reports about the jobmarket situation.",
        "Reports of this kind are highly stereotypical: They describe the present jobmarket situation in terms of a few attributes and their respective changes.",
        "These indicators are interpreted and discussed within the framework of a simple model of jobmarket fluctuations by officials of the issuing organization.",
        "Sometimes the data are also commented upon by political speakers of different views.",
        "The knowledge-base We have built a knowledge-base of (ObjTalk-) concepts in order to proess news articles of this type.",
        "The design was guided by the principle of providing an active schema for everything that would be considered a \"thema\" in the reports.",
        "The most global frame is the one for \"job-market-situation\" (jms).",
        "It combines in its roles all what would \"normally\" be reported in our texts and should therefore be expected by the system: time, region, relevant aspects or indicators - i.e. jobless-rate, open-jobs, new employments ... - , explanations for the general situation, general predictions.",
        "(Think of a jms-frame as a \"snapshot\" of the jobmarket-developments; Schankian people may think of it as analoguous to a script).",
        "The relevant aspects are in a sense constituting the jms, technically spoken: are in a part-of relation to the jms-frame.",
        "Their frames themselves are combined from frames for the static and the dynamic part of the jobmarket-factor,i.e.",
        "an index and an index-change-frame.",
        "Each concept for an individual jobmarket-aspect also involves encoded knowledge for a (specific) evaluation, explanation and prediction.",
        "The common traits of the individual jm-indices are organized in the jm-index-frame, which itself inherits knowledge (slots,...) from a more general index-frame that combines the shared traits of all such indices (cf. above).",
        "This organization should later allow easy extension of the system.",
        "Examples Jobmarket reports are prototypical for related Parsing the sentence IN ENGLAND 1ST IM \"official statistical reports\" (e.g. \"DIE ZAHL DER ARBEITSLOSEN 1,509 MILLTONEN developments of population, crime, stockmarket MAT UM 14000 AUF PERSONS IN ENGLAND etc.).",

        "Writing semantic ATNs is simplified by the chance to specify only one generic PUSH arc (e.g. NP) that processes a class, instead of the possibly large set of more specific PUSHes (e.g. NP/PERSON, NP/OFFICIAL/PERSON, NP/JOBMARKET/ OFFICIAL/PERSON, ...).",
        "If the parser is in the starting state of such a generic PUSH and a schema is active whose roles are to be filled by semantic subATNs, then those standing in subclass relation to the generic PUSH are preferred.",
        "E.g., if an unfilled slot expects a NP/OFFICIAL/PERSON, and the parser expects a NP, then, since NP/OFFICIAL/PERSON is a specialisation of NP, it is activated and - in case of success - the result is used to fill that slot.",
        "In general, several schemata can be active at a time, in the sense that some of their slots are unfilled.",

        "Then all of the attached subATNs are activatable.",
