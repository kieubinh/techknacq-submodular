        "However, this system is a good example of MTsystems whose SL's and TL's belong to quite different language families, in which a lot of interesting problems have arisen that have been concealed in the systems whose language pairs are rather close in language families.",
        "We will discuss in the paper some of the design principles without referring to the detailed linguistic phenomena.",
        "The system has been implemented on FACOM M-200 (Kyoto University Computing Center)mostly by LISP.",
        "Only exception is the morphological analysis of Japanese, which is done by PL/1 program.",
        "The system basically follows to 'transfer approach' advocated by several other groups such as TAUM,GETAetc.",

        "The system is based on several guiding principles.",
        "Among these, the followings would distinguish our system from the other MT systems.",
        "The analysis proceeds as follows:",
        "1. morphological analysis 2. segmentation of an input sentence into a set of simple sentence fragments (each fragment contains only one predicative term such as verb, predicative adjective, copula, etc.)",

        "2-1.",
        "Lexicon Based Analysis Procedure for Japanese In order to discuss the other analysis steps, we have to mention certain syntactic aspects of Japanese.",
        "Among those, it should be noted that case relationships between noun phrases and verbs are usually marked by case suffixes attached to noun phrases.",
        "An example is shown in Fig. 3.",

        "In Japanese, noun phrases which bear some grammatical relationships with a verb always precede the verb in a surface sentence.",

        "(WO)OBJECTIVE and 'e(de) INSTRUMENTAL cases, respectively.",
        "However, this direct correspondence between surface case suffixes and deep cases may not be preserved in actual sentences.",
        "In other words, case suffixes indicate only surface grammatical relationships between noun phrases and a verb, and these grammatical relationships may not coincide with deep semantic cases.",
        "We should distinguish them carefully, as C. Fillmore did in English.",
        "He tried to set up general rules to relate deep cases with surface grammatical relationships in English.",
        "Unfortunately, his model is based on generating sentences and gives us no clue as to how to parse them.",
        "Moreover, we observed that, at least in Japanese, this surface and deep correspondence is more or less specific to individual verbs.",
        "The same phenomena have been observed in English by J. Bresnan and other linguists.",
        "(2)They have treated these phenomena by setting up 'lexical interpretation rules' which are specific to individual verbs, and which translate the surface grammatical structures into deep semantic ones.",
        "From computational view points, this fremework leads us to lexicon-based analysis procedures.",
        "Instead of general syntactic rules, we describe specific surface-deep mappings for individual verbs in the analysis dictionary, as shown in Fig. 4.",
        "One of the main purposes to establish transformation rules was to relate surface structures with deep ones by the rules.",
        "In our framework, most of this task is done by surface-deep mappings described in the dictionary.",
        "Therefore, a simple pattern matching is sufficient to analyze sentence fragments, that contain only one verb.",
        "However, there still remain certain sets of transformations which seem not to be well captured by the surface-deep mappings of individual verbs.",
        "We also treat them as lexical rules.",

        "2-2.",
        "Transformations as Lexical Rules Transformations treated by our system can be classified into the following categories (Notice that we use here the term 'transformations' in a broader sense than in traditional TG.",
        "And also notice that, though 'scrambling' operations are very conspicuous in Japanese which are applied after transformation cycles in traditional TG's, we do not consider them as transformations here, because they can be embodied in pattern matching operations, i.e., pattern matchings without considering orders of elements).",

        "In fact, a relative ordering of case suffixes exists and higher case suffixes in the ordering can easily be replaced with an adverbial suffix without any surface traces.",
        "Moreover, this relative ordering of case suffixes depends on individual verbs, depending on how intimate a relationship the concept expressed by each noun phrase bears to the action expressed by the verb.",
        "We may be able to capture this intimacy hierarchy by setting up several different levels of connections between noun phrases and verbs, as Chomsky does in his X-theoryP)However, from computational view points, especially from recognition view points, it is convenient to mark in each surface pattern what ordering exists and which case suffixes can be replaced by which adverbial suffixes.",

        "On the other hand,(wo)' in TSP shows that 'he' has the grammatical relationship with the main verb 'believe', but should be semantically interpreted in relation to the verbal complement 'be right'.",

        "General Transformations : Clefted constructions, for example, also appear in Japanese.",
        "Because the transformations in the above are more or less dependent on individual verbs which govern the transformed structures, we treat them by lexical rules, i.e., we assume that transformations of surface patterns have been done beforehand, and that the transformed patterns are also stored in the individual verb entries in the analysis dictionary.",
        "In the conventional approaches, there are a set of general transformational rules, which will be inversely applied in turn to input sentences, in order to obtain appropriate 'deep' structures.",
        "It has been well known that this inverse application of rules results in combinatorial proliferation of possible structures, partly because such rules are not general rules and only applicable to specific classes of verbs.",

        "During the analysis, it only selects appropriate surface patterns (transformed or not) from the dictionary and matches them with the input sentences.",
        "You may object to us that such a configuration requires a large memory space for the dictionary.",
        "However, it is possible to reduce the dictionary size by using macro expressions, if you can classify verbs and decide which transformations are applicable to which verb classes.",
        "These macro expressions will beexpanded when the dictionary entries containing the macros are retrieved.",
        "When you find a spcific verb behaves quite differently from others, you can specify both its surface patterns and transformed patterns directly in the dictionary without using macros.",
        "Our approach is: First, we assume that every verb is specific, and exceptional, i.e., it has its own usages and transformed usages and, if we can find some classes of verbs which behave in the same way, then it is possible to generalize them by using macros.",
        "In the current version of our system, transformations 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 can be analyzed.",
        "That is, dictionary descriptions for them are prepared (However, because our system is an experimental prototype, the dictionary contains only about 80 verbs).",

        "Especially, case elements in a sentence are frequently omitted in Japanese, when they are easy to recognize from the context.",
        "Though the current system tries to find appropriate surface English words and structures at the English synthesis phase which do not require the omitted elements, it would be inevitable to incorporate contextual processings.",

        "However, one of the recent trends in this area, which we also support, is to lay more emphasis on the importance of syntactic processings, or at least, syntactic structures of sentences.",
        "This attitude is, we believe, especially important for MT systems.",
        "The various transformed syntactic structures described in section 2 have been overlooked by the researchers of computational linguistics so far.",
        "We hope that our approach, the lexicon based analysis procedure, provides an appropriate framework to integrate syntactic structures and operations with the other kinds of processings such as semantic and pragmatic ones."
