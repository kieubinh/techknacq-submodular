        "Failure to recognize that MT must be treated in a problem-solving setting, that is, as a class of problems to be solved in various environments and according to various quality and cost criteria, has led and still leads to impassionate, antiscien-tific attitudes, ranging polemically between dreamy optimism and somber pessimism.",
        "Using the fairly large body of experience gained since the beginning of MT research, we try in this paper to extract the most essential facets of the problem and to propose some paradigms, alongside each of those facets, for usable computer systems which should appear in the near - or middle - term future.",
        "As a matter of fact, the phrase \"Machine Translation\" is nowadays misleading and inadequate.",

        "Here, the final output must be a good translation.",
        "Second generation systems were designed with this goal in mind, and with the assumption that good enough translations cannot now be obtained automatically on a large scale, but for very restricted domains (see METEO).",

        "The first MT researchers programmed directly in machine language.",
        "Until now, SYSTRAN systems are essentially made of programs and tables written in IBM 370 macroassembler.",

        "Now, the programming languages used to write the linguistic part of AT systems include usual programming languages such as macroassembler, FORTRAN, ALGOL, PL/1, LISP, as well as specialized languages (see above).",
        "2.",
        "The need for powerful data and control structures In our view, usual programming languages are inadequate as metalanguages to be used for writing the linguistic data and procedures in an AT system.",

        "Note that parallelism may be of two different kinds : processors working independently on independent data structures and processors working on a common data structure (e.g. a normal context-sensitive grammar is not equivalent to the same grammar used in parallel, see S AB, A a/-B, B b/A-).",
        "Many recent specialized programming languages include a form of non-determinism, but very few have parallelism (ROBRA) or control functions for heuristics (PROLOG, ATEF, REZO).",
        "Of course, these metalanguages should include more classical control structures such as iteration, recursion or selection.",

        "Hence, no general bound or estimate for the dynamic complexity of programs written in that formalism may be given.",
        "On the other hand, as all we want to program in AT systems is certainly subrecursive, another approach is to define several subrecursive algorithmic models with associated known (or studyable) complexity classes.",
        "This was the original approach at GETA, with the ATEF, ROBRA, TRANSF and SYGMOR algorithmic models, designed to be decidable and of linear complexity.",

        "However, general constraints imposed to guarantee decidability may make certain things unnecessarily clumsy to write.",
        "Perhaps a better idea (implemented in ATNs, ATEF and ROBRA) is to build algorithmic models as extensions of decidable models, in such a manner that sources of undecidability are easy to locate, so that particular decidability proofs may be looked for.",

        "As applied to AT, these methods have only been incorporated in very small size test programs incorporating at most some hundreds lexical units.",
        "However, we feel that their simplicity and relative economy in coding effort make them usable in near-term AT systems, under the essential condition that, as in Wilks' model, it is not necessary to code completely every lexical unit, and that the associated computing effort is controlled by the linguist and undertaken only when necessary, that is when a problem (like ambiguity or anaphoric reference) has not been solved by simpler means.",
        "The second class of AI proposals relates to dynamic semantics and originates in the \"frames\" proposed by Minsky [12], and now proposed by other teams as \"scripts\", \"plans\" or \"goals\" [9, 27-29].",
        "They are certainly very attractive, but have been demonstrated on very particular and very small size situations.",
        "As we said above, texts to be translated with AT systems are more likely to be technical documents, abstracts, instructions for use, maintenance manuals, etc., than stories about restaurants or earthquakes.",
        "Each text doesn't rely on one clear-cut \"script\", or \"type of situa-tion\", known a priori.",

        "Charniak's frame for painting [12], although admittedly incomplete, is 19 pages of listing long (in a high-level language !",
        "), and we suppose he spent rather a long time on it.",
        "Just think of what it would cost to code 5000 basic frames, which we believe would be reasonable for, say, the domain of computers.",
        "Second, if the texts describe types of situations, then it is necessary to understand these texts in order to code the necessary scripts, which will be used ... to understand the text again !",
        "This circularity has two consequences.",
        "First, only very general scripts might be humanly coded by using general previous knowledge about the domain.",
        "Second, if we want to use such methods extensively and at levels of detail at which they begin to give better results than simple approaches, then AI researchers should provide methods for the automatic extraction of scripts or frames from large bodies of texts, in an efficient (and perhaps interactive) way.",
        "That is, the use of such methods on wide domains and large amounts of texts entails automatic learning.",
