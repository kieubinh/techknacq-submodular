        "The original version of this paper is very detailed.",
        "Space limitations for publication in COLING's proceedings have forced us to reduce it by a factor of five.",
        "The more detailed version has been proposed for publication in \"Linguistics\".",
        "This paper is an attempt to present the computer models and linguistic strategies used in the current version of the Russian-French translation system developed at GETA, within the framework of several other applications which are developed in a parallel way, using the same computer system.",
        "This computer system, called ARIANE-78, offers to linguists not trained in programming an interactive environment, together with specialized metalanguages in which they write linguistic data and procedures (essentially, dictionaries and grammars) used to build translation systems.",
        "In ARIANE-78, translation of a text occurs in six steps : morphological analysis, multilevel analysis, lexical transfer, structural transfer, syntactic generation, morphological generation.",
        "To each such step corresponds a computer model (nondeterministic finite-state string to tree transducer, tree to tree transducer,...), a metalanguage, a compiler and execution programs.",
        "The units of translation are not sentences, but rather one or several paragraphs, so that the context usable, for instance to resolve ana-phores, is larger than in other second-generation systems.",
        "As ARIANE-78 is independent of any particular application, we begin by presenting its main features in Part I.",
        "Some of them are standard in second-generation systems, while others are original.",
        "Among these, we insist on the multilingual aspect of the system, which is quite unique, on the very powerful control structures embodied in the supported computer models (non-determinism, parallelism, heuristic programming), and on its interactive database aspect.",
        "In the second and larger part, we successively describe each step of this Russian-French application.",
        "We first present the underlying computer model (there are 4 of them, as the second, third and fourth step use the same one), then the organization of the linguistic data.",
        "A small text is used throughout the text as a standard example.",
        "Examples of translations of larger texts appear at the end.",
        "I - Current GETA translation system The computer system ARIANE-78, together with appropriate linguistic data, constitutes a multilingual automatized translation system.",
        "The system is a rather sophisticated second generation system.",
        "It relies on classical as well as more original principles.",
        "I.",
        "Classical second-generation principles Intermediate structures The process of translation of a text from a \"source\" language in a \"target\" language is split up into thtee wan Zogicat zteo, as illustrated below : anoLey44.z, thanz6en and genekation.",
        "The output of the analysis is a \"6-auctunat dacA4ton\" of the input text, which is transformed in an equivalent structural descriptor in the target language by the transfer phase.",
        "This target structural descriptor is then transformed into the output text by the generation phase.",
        "Essential in our conception is the fact that analysis is performed independently of the target language(s).",
        "The \"deeper\" the analysis, the shorter the distance between the two structural descriptors.",
        "Ideally, one could imagine a \"pivotal\" level, at which they would be the same.",
        "In the past, Pr.",
        "Vauquois' team tried a slightly less ambitious possibility [Vauquois, 19757, namely to use an \"hybrid\" (Shaumjan) pivot language, where the lexical units are taken from a natural language, so that the transfer phase is reduced to a lexical transfer, without any structural change.",
        "As it is not always possible, or even desirable, to reach this very abstract level, one may choose not to go all the way up the mountain and to stop somewhere in the middle.",
        "This is why we call our structural descriptors \"intetmediate Lt/Luctu/Lee.",
        "Note that ARIANE-78 imposes nothing of that kind, both extremes are still possible, and in fact the linguistic teams have agreed on \"multilevel\" intermediate structures which contain very deep as well as low level types of information, ranging from logical relations to traces (see details below).",
        "Separation of programs and linguistic data The second classical principle is to offer metalanguages, in order to keep the particular linguistic data (grammars, dictionaries) separated from the programs.",
        "For instance, dictionary lookup is a standard function, which should not be modified in any way when a new language is introduced in the system.",
        "This separation also corresponds to a division of work and enhances transparency : dictionary lookup may be optimized by the programmers without the linguistic users ever being aware of it.",
        "The same goes for more complex functions, like pattern-matching in tree manipulating systems.",
        "In these metalanguages, linguists work directly with familiar concepts, like grammatical variables, classes, dictionaries and grammars.",
        "The grammar rules are rules of some formal model (context free, context sensitive, transduction rules).",
        "That is, one may also consider such metalanguages as very high level algorithmic languages offering complex data types and associated operators.",
        "Although this principle of separation has been criticized as imposing too much \"rigidity\" on the users, critics have failed to understand that this is only the case when the metalanguages are not adequate.",
        "A good comparison may be found in classical programming, where for example, the compiler and runtime package of PL/I is separated from programs written PL/I in exactly the same sense."

        "Morphological analysis, lexical transfer and morphological generation are undoubtedly very much simpler than the order steps, and it has seemed reasonable and linguistically motivated to keep them separate and to use simpler algorithmic models to realize them.",
        "However, this could not be the case in other environments, for example if the input would be very noisy (oral input).",
