        "It is believed that, in the course of development of present information society, the amount of documents, such as technical writings, correspondences, to be exchanged in every international community has become huge.",
        "This great amount of documents have to be translated since no unique universal language is available.",
        "But obviously, there is a definite limitation on translation speed by hand.",
        "This situation urges on us the importance of development of a machine translation system.",
        "Around 1960 when computers were becoming widely used, various experimental studies were done on machine translation.",
        "However, most of them brought about almost no commercial products, and shortly after that, even such kind of researchs seem to have disappeared.",
        "Among a few developed systems of that period, only the Russian-English translation systems, MARK2 used by the U.S. Air Force and another used by the Atomic Energy Commission at Aok ridge which was designed at Georgetown University, were widely known.",
        "The revised version of the latter system named SYSTRAN, has been on the market, and is currently being used by the EC and other few organizations.",
        "At that time, a 'word-for-word' translation was shiefly considered.",
        "Such systems are classified in first generation translation systems2.",
        "After first generation systems, second generation translation systems which rely on intermediate language model instead of a 'word-for-word' translation, are now under development.",
        "The features in the approaches of this new generation systems are: (1) it performs a translation between intermediate languages constructed over source language (SL) and target language (TL) respectively (called transfer approach ), as shown in fig. 1, (2) it encourages to separate linguistic data from programs2.",
        "In the transfer approach, the intermediate languages are strongly required to retain the characteristics (including syntactical charcterlistics) of the original ones.",
        "This approach seems to be effective for translation among languages of the same linguistic family (in the sence that there are similallities in syntax and meaning of a",
        "synthesis intermediate representation word) such as English, German, and French, because translation of words and some transformation on syntactic structures are merely needed.",
        "However, it is not seemed to be quite effective when performing translation among non-related languages, for example, Japanese and English, because of the need for large structural transformation.",
        "Among examples of this approach are TAUM of University of Montreal and GETA of Grenoble University.",
        "In our translation system from Japanese into English, conceptual structure is introduced and utilized in translation process.",
        "In this paper, we discuss why con-ceptural structure is needed, what benifits are obtained from our approach, what conceptual structure is, and in what way our system performs."

        "Let us think of the process we take for natural language translation.",
        "Do people really construct intermediate representation for both SL and TL, and then carry out translation between them?",
        "Surely they don't. Instead, when translating, they first understand the meaning of a text, and then perform its translation.",
        "Furthermore, in addition to explicit meaning in the text, they usually comprehend implicit meaning behind word order (i.e., syntactic information), and a choice of words by the text in language A writer.",
        "In other words, to understand a text is to extract concepts represented by words or phrases and their mutual relaions from a text.",
        "Therefore, from this obsevation, we can conclude correct translation cannot bypass intermediate semantic representation of sentences (we call conceptual structure ) in the process of translation.",
        "This conceptual structure is constructed upon concepts in SL, but these concepts are considered as universaly general to the extent that they can be translated into any languages.",
        "That is because it is considered peoples will only create concepts which can be understood by every people since they share the same space and physical laws in their life on the globe.",
        "In a case where a concept in one language does not correspond to one in other language, it is supposedly possible to express such a concept with other concepts in another language.",
        "In this sence, we can assume every concept has universality so that it is always possible to find a word or a phrase representing a given concept.",
        "As illustrated in fig. 2, in a translation process from language A into B, conceptual structure is constructed from concepts in A, and subsequently is represented with language B.",
        "There also exists reverse process, namely from B into A.",

        "Thus conceptual structure plays an important role for translation, but incorporating it into a machine translation system will bring out difficulties, such as how to extract meanings out of sentences, and how to represent meanings in conceptural structure.",
        "Nevertheless, we do consider our approach is better than transfer approach, because the latter might involve much more complex treatment, as discussed later.",
