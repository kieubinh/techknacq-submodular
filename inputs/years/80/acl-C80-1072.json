        "This paper addresses the control problem in language understanding systems.",
        "Many formalisms have evolved for representing the syntactic, pragmatic, and semantic data of language, but the ability to access them in a flexible and efficient manner has not proceeded apace.",
        "This delay is understandable: one needs to know what to control before one can control it.",
        "Although the isolation of the subproblems is a valid methodology, there comes a time when a deeper understanding of the language system requires that the data and control aspects of the problem be considered together.",
        "Linguistic theory has not offered much insight in the control of linguistic processes; Chomsky (1965) finessed the problem by creating \"competence\" as the proper view for theoretical linguistics, rather than the study of \"performance\".",
        "In fact, it is this study of process that is one of the contributions of computational linguistics to the study of language (Hays, 1971).",
        "An overview of control strategies Within automated language understanding systems we find a variety of strategies: Linear control.",
        "A logical approach is to adopt a linear control strategy in which syntactic analysis is followed by semantic interpretation (Woods, 1971).",
        "Unfortunately, this places an overwhelming burden on semantic processing which has to interpret each complete parse when the ambiguity may only lie in part.",
        "Further, there are cases where syntactic relations cannot be determined by syntactic analysis alone, for example, the role of \"tree\" in (1).",
        "John was hit by the tree.",
        "01 Semantic grammars.",
        "Faced with a need to access semantic information during syntactic analysis, one suggestion is to construct a \"semantic grammar\" (Hendrix, 1977) in which some categories in the syntactic rules are replaced by semantically based categories of the domain, e.g., verbs may be subclassified as verbs of movement, containment, excitement, etc.",
        "(Sager, 1975).",
        "The disadvantage of this approach is that the domain becomes an integral part of the grammar, with the result that either the number of syntactic rules is considerably enlarged, or the rule set has to be rewritten to move to another topic area.",
        "Semantic parsing.",
        "Other approaches have managed to achieve success by avoiding the problem of integration completely: the systems have essentially one component.",
        "Schank (1975) has systems based on the hypothesis that language understanding is driven from the semantics with minimal use of any syntactic analysis.",
        "But such systems can go astray because of their high semantic expectation.",
        "For example, the word \"escape\" carries with it the prediction that it is an action",
        "of terrorists (Schank, Lebowitz, & Birnbaum, 1978); this causes an erroneous analysis of a sentence such as \"The policeman escaped assassination...\" Others have proposed procedural systems built around semantic knowledge (Rieger & Small, 1980).",
        "In the Rieger and Small system the knowledge is on the word level.",
        "Their main drawback is an inability to easily change domains."

        "The power of syntax diminishes as more complex constituents are encountered.",
        "Syntax can give good descriptions for the structure of phrases, becomes less detailed when describing the role of phrases within clauses, has relatively little to say about the clause structure of sentences, and even less about sentences in discourse.",
        "As syntactic forces diminish, semantic relations describe the structure -- discourse cohesion is semantic (Halliday & Hasan, 1976).",
        "Consequently we believe that a language understanding system should have the ability to bring syntactic and semantic knowledge to bear on the analysis at many points in the computation in order to prevent the flow of extraneous analyses to later steps in the analysis.",
        "We agree with Schank (1975) that the goal of analysis is not to produce a parse tree.",
        "It should not even be a subgoal, as is the case in systems that first produce a parse tree then perform semantic interpretation.",
        "The parse tree should be considered as a data structure that should either be constructed, incidentally to the analysis, or be capable of being constructed should it be needed.",
        "But syntax cannot be ignored.",
        "Often it may not appear to be contributing much, but it is clear that syntactic structure is of use in determining antecedents of proforms, for example.",
        "Schank's (1975) hypothesis of semantic prediction appears to us to be a good approach.",
        "The goal is certainly to build a meaning representation of the linguistic act and top-down analysis can lead to greater efficiency.",
        "Top-down systems tend to leave open the question of what to do when there is no prior knowledge to guide the analysis.",
        "We envisage a system that can flow into a predictive mode when the situation is appropriate, but otherwise has a default control structure of syntax-then-semantics.",
        "In short, we want a data-driven control structure."

        "We have experts that know about the organizing principles of syntax and of semantics.",
        "The experts are then interpretive, which gives flexibility in changing to another language, or to a new domain.",
        "We have experts for case-frames, scripts, clauses, subjects, and the like.",
        "The experts will at points in time become associated with domain knowledge, i.e., the grammar of a language, or world knowledge for a problem area.",
        "The job of an expert can be to instantiate a model that it has been given (top-down analysis), or if it was not given a model, then to find a model (bottom-up analysis).",
        "The process of instantiation is performed by eliciting information from other experts who can use their expertise on the problem; they of course may have to consult further experts.",
        "Some experts are not instantiators, rather they are processes that are common to several other experts; for parsimonious representation we give them expert status.",
        "The output of the system is a semantic description of the input as instantiated case-frames.",
        "The novelty of the situation is captured by the way in which the case-frames are linked and by their spatio-temporal settings.",

        "We are not proposing the system as a serious tutor;",

        "Yet greater efficiency can be achieved if the prediction can be directly associated with the input.",
        "In other schemes for processing language, the flow of control is constrained to follow the organization of the data.",

        "To progress to a systematic study of robustness we need to examine schemes by which all of linguistic knowledge may be flexibly invoked; thus we believe that the systems that contain less than this knowledge will not be a suitable vehicle.",

        "(5) The goal of the system is to create a meaning representation by instantiating a CF.",
        "Through meta-links, a CF can be equivalent to a complex of CF's; thus the top-level instantiation may be achieved by instantiating the lower rank CF's.",
        "A CFE normally has a model of a CF that it is trying to instantiate.",
        "Initially this.cannot be the case and the system has to revert to a bottom-up approach.",

        "The CLE has to find a clause using the rules of the grammar in Figure 1.",
        "The clause rules show that a \"subject\" expert has to be invoked.",

        "asking an \"input\" expert, which prompts the user.",
        "The NP expert selects those rules that can be part of a model consistent with the input.",
        "The syntactic instantiation is similar to a chart parse (Kaplan, 1973) showing the hierarchical arrangement of constituents.",

        "The next input word is taken by the CLE.",

        "Once the verb expert has functioned, the information is available and so the the stative verb.",
        "The grammar then predicts that a \"state\" will follow.",
        "This is confirmed by the word \"flat\".",
        "After receiving the response from the CLE, the CFE has the following instantiation: CF1: ( Agent - TIREl Act - STATE Obj - FLAT) This episode becomes part of the encylopedia.",

        "For the sake of brevity in this example this information is made explicit, in the actual program it can be determined by tracing other links.",
        "The CFE has now processed the first case frame to the beat of its abilities and sets out to instantiate the prediction.",
        "As the CFE has CF2 as its model, it can work in a top-clown manner.",
        "When the prediction is passed to the CLE and translated, \"tire\" will be available as a match for the pronoun \"it\".",
        "The instantiation of the model produces CF3: ( Actor - self (from \"I\") Act - Change:tire obj - Tirel (from \"it\") ) The CFE seeks to set up more predictions for the dialogue.",
        "It looks to see if this action is contingent on any others.",
        "To do this it calls up chronology and requests the LAST-EVENT for CF3.",
        "Chronology calls upon taxonomy which ascends variety links to the \"perform\" act in \" do:job\".",
        "The taxonomy expert also checks to see if the meta-node has any contingencies, but in this case it doesn't.",
        "If it did, that would also be returned to chronology.",
        "It finds CF4: ( Agent - self Act - GET Obj - TOOL6 ).",
        "This is then passed back to the CFE to serve as a prediction for the next input.",
