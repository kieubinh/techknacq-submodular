        "Recent computer application to the so-called office automation is characterized by the increasing use of intelligent software systems.",
        "These systems are offen required to interface with textual information via users who are more or less trained or expertized to deal with the kinds of information to be processed.",
        "The ideal goal of such a text processing system is to transfer all experts'processing tasks to the system.",
        "It must be well recognized, however, that even with regard to the most advanced knowledge-based natural language processing systems such as SOPHIE(1), SAM(2), FRUMP(3), GUS(4), EXPLUS(5) this ideal goal seems to be still far from the present state of the natural language (NL) processing techniques, though they are very promissing.",
        "There are many reasons why existing NI systems can hardly be applied to the above goal.",
        "Two of them may be formulated as follows: (a) The present relatively robust NI systems have been basically designed to deal with each separate sentence and not with a set of semantically related sentences.",
        "There are many research efforts aiming at this point (cf. eg.",
        "approaches of the Yale NI school).",
        "(b) Because the NL understanding systems are generally concerned with deep understandings of sentences, they often take care too much of general relations and (common sense) reasonings in every detail, to which readers don't pay attentions so much in understanding them.",
        "Human readers skillfully control depth and details of understandings being conscious of their potential usefulness.",
        "In short, the present NL systems are not enough explicitly designed to extract purposeful meaning of sentences (cf.(4)).",
        "In this developing state of NL processing and knowledge representation techniques we set a practical goal of our project to design an interactive system which digests news and reports on the foreign computer industry to support experts by a reactive knowledge data base.",
        "At the moment such a knowledge data base is urgently needed for experts to do their tasks such as writing reports to be submitted to some governmental institutions, industrial credit bureaus or agencies and the like.",
        "2.Interactive assimilation and abstraction Typical experts' tasks in an industrial credit bureau above mentioned are, for instance , to collect information about a special world such as the news world of computer industry.",
        "They collect clippings of news papers or journals, make memos from other news media and classify them according to their topics or themes.",
        "Their understanding of such information means that they not only understand the meaning (surface semantics) of each article literally , but also assimilate it into their related knowledge base (deep semantics) in such a way that it can be effectively used in some future contexts.",
        "That is, they identify relations of the new information with",
        "some parts of their knowledge and recognize its potential usefulness for their new conceptualization to advocate, to emphasize or build up their opinions, judgements or beliefs.",
        "The way of summing-ups by abstraction and assimilation of successive information to construct a special knowledge-base strongly depends on the purposes, as it is generally stated in empirical epistemology(15,16).",
        "In our practical case this means that the experts purposefully 'understand' the news to write a comprehensive report on the computer industry in which they draw from it conclusions such as future tendencies or proposals for some industrial policies, etc.",
        "Taking both available techniques and reality of problems into account, we decided on the whole not to directly apply NI processing approaches to our expert support system.",
        "Instead, we extensively use NL techniques for case by case.",
        "Starting with the lowest intelligent level of interaction, we hope that we could continuously elevate the intelligent level of the machine processings in the recycling course of design and experiences (6).",
        "The interface of the machine-expert interaction is based on the multiple window display communication (s.sect.5) and the mechanical representation of experts knowledge is founded on the frame-like formalism (s.sect.3 and 4).",
        "In the interactive text analysis and meaning representation an expert reads a news article from his special domain of computer industry and has various levels of understandings typically reflecting his special domain dependent knowledge and his evaluation of news values.",
        "Some part of his special knowledge is activated, new information from the article is eventually added on it, a part of the existing knowledge is acknowledged, refined, amplified or reversed, etc.",
        "In contrast to this explicit flow of information from texts to the expert user there is a implicit counter flow of predictive, expective or focal information which is feedbacked to the texts.",
        "In this sort of \"backed-up\" interaction between text source and expert's knowledge, there are roughly two classes of information to be represented: (i)Conceptual information Generally speaking, the content of a news article is expressed in text sentenses, ie a restricted set of natural language in which they are written.",
        "However, for the expert of a special news world texts are a set of key concepts mostly well defined and structured within his knowledge, though they are organized by general syntactic rules of the language on a surface level.",
        "These key concepts indicate for him how to use them.",
        "The methods of using his knowledge, are described in procedures and structurally inherent in the concepts.",
        "The expert's responses to",
        "a key concept scanned from a given text are that (a) related concepts around a given key concept are stimulated (b) some concepts are expected in the subsequent scanning of the texts.",
        "(c) These stimulated or expected concepts interact with each other to constrain and filter their semantic roles.",
        "(ii) Control information",
        "The interactive flow of conceptual information is controlled by control information which is partly invoked by the former.",
        "The experts responses (a) (b) (c) can be viewed as the evaluation results of the control information caused by understanding the conceptual information.",
        "this means that conceputal information implies the control information which specifies how the former should be processed or interpreted under which conditions and what should be done when the former is to be perceived.",
        "For (a) the control information specifies the activation of all concepts that are related to the",
        "key concepts in some way, for (b) it specifies the search of a term which satifies a given condition and for (c) it specifies the context to which all activated concepts in terms of a key concept must be subject.",
        "The cognitive interaction between texts and expert can be actively supported by a system in that both sorts â€¢ of information are directly or indirectly transferred to the system in the course of data base organization process.",
        "This triadic relation between texts, expert and system can be modelled as a double production system (Fig.l), in which an ST M L7fl (Fig 1) A double production system Texts/User User/KDB expert user plays a double role of production rules in LTM against the scanning texts and the stored knowledgte data base as well.",
        "However, with increasing amount of information transfer from the expert user to the system, this role of the expert user as LTM against the knowledge data base system is gradually changed to the role of STM.",
        "Then the user's control function of interactive process is taken over by the system.",
        "As a result the expert user plays an intermediate role for making decisions on long term purposeful representations of textual meanings following advices and suggestions from the system with the help of its control information.The transition degree of theuser's role from LTM to STM is continuous and goes down to the extent that the expert user only takes care of such tasks as selection of key terms or deep abstractions with regard to the future applications, those are too hard and time concuming for the system though not impossible."

        "Following reasons are more or less specific for our case: (1) Expert's knowledge about the computer industry and its developments are organized around the conceptual units which are more or less standardized.",
        "E.g. \"Main-frame-makers\" is e concept for the expert that is used in conjunction with the computer-policy-making in Japan.",

        "Eg.",
        "MBI is a rival of a national main-frame-makers and the national industrial Ministry ITIM, which specifies market strategic policies.",
        "(3) Because of the reason (2) control information associated with each role of a conceptual unit is well formulated.",

        "(5) The frame-like representation is directly formulated to the form displayed in windows (s. sect.5) where the expert user interactively fills slots with key words or modifies descriptions.",
        "Other reasons are based on our pragmatic attitude that we could eventually find an existing frame-like representation system which fits our special target world and approach; if not completely, we could use it by minor modification, or in the worst case we could design a new one by using existing system as a design guide line.",
        "Our home-made frame-like representation language is called OBJTALK (8) which is characterized by the object-oriented idea of SMALLTALK (9).",
        "Frames called objects are organized into knowledge structures by message passings which activate procedural properties of the recipient object.",
        "In generalization heterarchies of objects, slot properties as well as procedural properties of super objects are inherited by subordinate objects.",

        "It is interesting to note that, practically the expert user always tend to directly define concrete instances Or individuals representing his knowledge, though frame-like languages such as OBJTALK are all designed to be used in a top-down way, ie.",
        "before he describes MBI-JPN as an instance of a concept, he is supposed to define the data type of MBI-JPN, ie.",
        "foreign-computer-industry.",
        "This top-down definition requested from the language structure doesn't necessarily correspond with the natural verbal behaviour of users, as it is stated in a general learning theory of languages.",
        "For bottom-up definitions of higher level concepts (super concepts) we need some methods for generalization and abstraction of individual or instance objects intuitively defined in terms of real data.",
        "OBJTALK offers a simple massage (ask <default class-name> generalize <instance-name>) language of the form (ask <default class-name> abstract <individual>) (ask <object> <message>) By generalizing a instance or abstracting an individual we can create",
        "a class of instances or individuals according to their perspectives, such that it prescribes property conditions to be satisfied by sample objects.",
        "This generalized class or abstract class must be modified by those other instances or individuals that belong to the same class.",
        "Theoretical backgrounds for this bottom-up generalization or abstraction process are given by learning by examples (10) and grammatical inference (11).",
        "Another practical problem we have in direct application of our object oriented language is that given a message of some properties it is a very time consuming task to identify an object with them in its inheritance hierarchy.",
        "Particularly, it is hard to find some procedural property in it, which is triggered by matching a pattern described as a prerequisite condition in it.",
        "At the moment a pattern matcher of OBJTALK does this task.",
        "Starting from the recipient object of a message the matcher searches through a inheritance hierarchy of the object a procedure called method which can be matched with the message body.",
        "For simple descriptions of passive properties SRL (semantic epresentation language) of EXPLUS (5) avoided this time consuming problem of property by making an external which represents a property relations called semantic feature systems.",
        "For more complicated property descriptions such as procedural patterns we need a sort of global associative bitmap memory which mappes the procedural property-space onto the object space so that, given a procedural property by a message, those objects associated with this property can be retrieved very fast without any searches.",
        "This associative bitmap memory must dynamically store any new relations between objects and properties.",
        "Such a global associative memory contradicts the from-like object-oriented representation principle which dictates the distribution of properties among objects.",
