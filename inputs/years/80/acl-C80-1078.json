        "The main problems arising with the development of an information retrieval system for the Japanese text are the need for saving man-power, standardizing information storage, and the realization of efficient retrieval.",
        "In the case of the English text, the stop-word removing method for automatic keyword extraction has been put to practical use.",
        "However, in the case of the Japanese text which consists of Kanji and Kana characters, a keyword extraction method utilizing statistical word frequency data has been reported by a Kyoto University group.3 This paper proposes a new method of automatic keyword extraction and \"role\" setting for Japanese news information retrieval.",
        "The \"role\" characterizes semantic identification of each keyword in a sentence and is classified into six categories, i.e., human subject, human object, time, place, action, and miscellaneous important information.",
        "The main features of Japanese sentences can be characterized as follows: (1) The structure of a sentence is determined by the noun-predicate verb dependency.",
        "(2) The case indicating words(kaku-joshi) play an important role in deep case structure.",
        "Taking these features into account, D.G.Hays's.",
        "dependency grammarl and C.J.Fillmorels case grammar2 arc utilized in the sentence structure analysis.",
        "The sentence pattern table containing a noun-predicate verb dependency relationship plays an important function in the analysis.",
        "By utilizing the meaning of a noun as it depends on each predicate verb, restricted semantic processing becomes possible.",
        "An automatic indexing systems, equipped with a man-machine interactive error-correcting function, has been developed based on the method described.",
        "Evaluation of the system has been done by applying it in news information retrieval.",
        "2.",
        "Pole Setting Criteria",
        "The employed criteria for the role setting of each keyword in a news sentence are as follows:",
        "(1) \"Action\"(A for short) is assigned to verbs which express movement and are elements of the \"predicate\" set.",
        "(2) \"Time\"(T for short) can be assigned without ambiguity.",
        "(3) \"Human subject\"(HS for short), \"human object\"(HO for short), \"place\"(P for short) and \"miscellaneous important information\" (MI for short) are assigned to noun words according to the following criteria: (a) Words which express humans or organizations have either role \"HS\" or \"HO\".",
        "The distinction can be made by examining the subsequent kaku-joshi.",
        "(b) Words which express things without consciousness have role \"MI\".",
        "(e) A country name has role \"HS\" if it is presumed to have consciousness as an organization.",
        "It has role \"P\" if it means territory.",
        "(d) An airplane or a ship have role \"HS\" when they are personified together with the driver, role \"P\" when they express the place, and role \"HI\" when they mean things.",
        "(e) Ambiguities in item (c) and (d) are removed by knowing which predicate verb the word depends on and this determine which human, organization, place or miscellaneous matter it expresses.",
        "To clarify the description, some examples are .given below:",
        "ex.1) \"State A\"ga \"State E\"wo shihai,suru.",
        "HS HO A (control) <State A controls State B.>",
        "In this sentence \"ga\" and \"wo\" are kaku-joshis.",

        "word is determined by considering the following three elements: i.e.,",
        "(a) the predicate verb which the noun word depends on (b) the meaning of the noun word (c) the kaku-joshi which is concatenated to the noun word 3.",
        "Japanese Sentence Structure Analysis",
        "The basic Japanese sentence pattern is expressed as \"NF1NF2--NFnPV\", where NFi, which is called umeishi-bunsetsu\",.is composed of a noun word and case indicating words, and where PV is a predicate verb.",
        "The Japanese sentence structure is characterized by the following points.",
        "i.e., (1) The predicate verb is put at the end of the sentence.",
        "(2) The position of a \"meishi-bunsetsu\" in a sentence is not fixed.",
        "(3) A \"meishi-bunsetsu\" could be omitted in a discourse which consists of several sentences.",
        "Utilizing D.G.Hays's dependency grammar, noun7predicate verb dependency relationships are formulated.",
        "In this formulation the relationships between nouns are irrelevant.",
        "Therefore, the Japanese sentence structure becomes independent of noun-word order, and a word omission is expressed in terms of the presence of a dependency relationship in the sentence.",
        "Since \"role\" is semantic identification of a word, by applying C.J.Fillmorels case gramraar2, it can be assigned to each keyword by clarifying the case structure of the predicate verb.",
        "(Figure 1) In Japanese sentence structure analysis, the predicate verb is identified first and then dependent noun words are determined in order of nearness to the predicate verb.",
        "The sentence is parsed by using top-down analysis.",
        "The bottom-up method is not adopted because it causes much ambiguity in the parsing of words which do not directly depend on the predicate verb.",
        "The need for classification of noun words in terms of their meaning is mentioned in chapter 2.",
        "Noun words are classified into seven semantic classes in order to analyze noun-predicate verb dependency relationships efficiently and to set \"role\"s to them, i.e.,",
        "(i) Organization (ii) Person (iii) Literature (iv) Place (v) Action (vi) Name of matter, Abstract idea, etc.",
        "(vii) Time",
        "Predicate verbs are classified by taking into account the meaning of the dominated words and their cases.",
        "(Figure 2) The sentence pattern table is constructed based on this predicate verb classification.",
        "(Figure 3) In the news retrieval system, about 5600 predicate verbs are classified into 586 classes; this classification is called case-information(A4-code).",
        "The sentence pattern table contains 1686 patterns.",
        "A Sentence pattern in the table is composed of four triplets at most.",
        "Elements of the triplet are the semantic class identification code of the noun word, kaku-joshi, and the \"role\" which is determined in terms of the values of the first two elements.",
        "For example \"shihai-suru\"(control) and \"kogeki-suru\"(attack) belong to No.46 category.",
        "The predicate verb of this category has six sentence patterns and each sentence pattern has two triplets.",
        "The first sentence pattern has triplets (ga,A,1) and (wo,1,2).",
        "The first code of the triplet is \"kaku-joshi\", the second",
        "(1) Freedom in the position of \"meishi-bunsetsu\" (2) Omissibility of \"meishi-bunsetsu\" in a discourse (3) \"Meishi-bunsetsu\" is composed of a noun-word and case indicating words.",
