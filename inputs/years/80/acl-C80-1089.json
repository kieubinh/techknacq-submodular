        "This paper aims at presenting a methodology for automatic thesaurus construction in order to help the search of documents and we want to obtain the development of classes for specific topics (for a given corpus) without a priori semantic information.",
        "Information contained in the thesaurus lead to new search formulations via automatic and/or user feedback.",
        "This presentation even being theoretical is oriented toward a database implementation.",
        "Preliminary remarks Different strategies used in Information Retrieval Systems must be developped to increase \"recall\" and \"precision\"80.",
        "The classic one is the construction of thesaurus.",
        "A thesaurus is usually defined as a set of terms (called descriptors) and a set of relations between these terms.",
        "This study is made for an information retrieval system using an inverted file (bitmap, each keyword points to a set of documents containing this keyword).",
        "For formulating a request the user defines a set of keywords and boolean operators on this set (for example MISTRAL, GOLEMPASSAT, STAIRS systems).",
        "When entering a document into the database, a module (e.g. PIAF)495 generates stems from the data (several grammatical variants of the same word are reduced to a canonical form).",
        "We call this form an item.",
        "Thesaurus construction in the context of local documents Our object is to find a method for the construction of non-hierarchical relations and the definition of item clusters from these relations.",
        "A point to be underlined is that this methodology could efficiently be used only on homogeneous collections of texts.",
        "To this purpose, we only consider a database subset : the local set of all documents returned from a given query.",
        "The local clustering method makes use of the common occurrences of items within a certain \"neighborhood\", this method has been studied by R. ATTAR and A.S. FRAENKEL (in \"Local feedback in full-text retrieval\") 1.",
        "Let be D1 the local set of documents retrieved from a given query and Ti the set of items contained in Of.define a metrical function which is inversely proportional to the distance between items in the same sentence.",
        "Each item is defined by its coordinates (DN, SN, IN) where DN is the document number, SN the sentence number and IN the item number within a sentence.",
        "For any item tE Tz, let wt(i) be the coordinate of the ith occurrence of t. For any couple (s,t) E Tt x Tz, we define d = Iw(i)ws(j)I the distance between the ith occurrence of t and jth occurrence of s. In fact",
        "Let be F a function of the distance d s, 1/d if wt(i), w5(j) are in the same sentence with d20 .",
        "0 otherwise.",
        "For s and t e T we define",
        "where the summation is over all occurrences i and j of s and t.",
        "In order to normalize the function, we take b(s t) pR' (s t) -'where f(t) is the number of f(t) occurrences of t for all local documents DR 0pR(s't)I.",
        "Through this function, we obtain for an item s a reference vector Rs which is a list of items t related to s, such as pR(s,t) is greater (or equal) than a threshold a.",
        "These values form an eigenvector : ER.",
        "Taking into account new local information in thesaurus updating Without excluding for the thesaurus the search of hierarchical relations (specific or generic), we try to build a set or a group of items having a notion of \"similarity\" or \"liaison\" between themselves.",
        "This thesaurus is built as the answers of the used Information Retrieval System are analysed.",
        "It must be structured so that the updating should be dynamic and automatic ; the implementation study has not yet been examined.",
        "The main problem of updating is to take into account \"liaisons\", \"proximities\" or \"similarities\" between the already registered items in the thesaurus and the new liaisons found after a new query.",
        "For any query, we obtain a set of items related to s. Let be R the previous reference vector $ (pRs its associated function) and R' the newly calculated vector (pit, its associated function).",
        "(2) F(wt(i),ws(j)) = 586--A new reference vector may be calculated from Rs and R using two functions m(s,t) and M(s,t)",
        "The function M involves all the items t which are related, or not, to s in Rs and R' (see Table I).",
        "The function m allows us to consiger only the items which are both in Rs and in R' <see Table I).",
        "One might consider m and M to be respectively the union and intersection of items t related to s.",
        "Use of the functions in and M for thesaurus construction and updating For an item x, only the items related to x in several local contexts must be considered in the thesaurus.",
        "Thus, it is necessary to keep records of the initial queries into a pseudo-thesaurus.",
        "In this pseudo-thesaurus is registered, for any item x, the set of items related to x in one or more local contexts.",
        "Let be",
        "for x belonging to the set of items T, (T = uTt).",
        "Concerning an item x of Tk, three reference vectors (and their associated functions) can be yielded : R , PSx and Tx which are the sets of items t refated to x respectively considered in the treated local context, in one or more local contexts kept in the pseudo-thesaurus, and in the global context kept in the thesaurus.",
        "These sets can be void, also several cases can be encountered 1) PSx and Tx are not void The updating process is performed in three steps Step 1 : Treatment of new data In order to know, if the newly calculated liaisons in Rx already exist in other local context, we compare Rx and PSx.",
        "Only the common items of these two reference vectors are considered, and we form a temporary reference vector Px using the function m (formula (4)).",
        "In Px only items from Rx which are previously related to x in at least one context are retained.",
        "The stronger connections are decreased (see Table 1) because we can suppose they are only local.",
        "Step 2 : Thesaurus updating procedure The thesaurus updating is made in two different ways (i) if Pxand Tx contain the same items t, only the eigenvector ET (of Tx) is modified using the function M (formula (4)) -587--(ii) if the items t in Tx are different from those occuring in Px, then a new reference vector Tx is constructed combinating the values of functions pT and pusing M (formula",
        "-We do not calculate the new association function between two items for Tx with m (formula (4)), because we do not introduce new items related to x in the thesaurus, when new items appear in several local contexts.",
        "-The function M uses the common or not common items and introduces in the thesaurus the new items, which are related to x in at least two local contexts.",
        "Step 3 : Pseudo-thesaurus updating procedure The pseudo-thesaurus updating must take into account the new items occuring in R. The new association function for PSx is calculated from the association function pR and the old association function pps using M tformula (5)).",
        "2) PSx and Tx are void This case corresponds to the situation where x is never appeared in any local context.",
        "We create the reference vectors PS in the pseudo-thesaurus and Rx with the association function pR (PSx = Rx).",
        "No information about x is kept in the thesaurus (Tx = 0).",
        "3) PSx is not void and Tx is void This corresponds to the case where x is already appeared in only one local context.",
        "If Rx 0 0, then we can build the initial reference vector Tx in the thesaurus.",
        "We use the association func-Jon(formula (4)) calculated from the values of association functions pR and p(respectively contained in the eigenxvectors fRx and EPS ).",
        "The present experimentation exhibits among the items related to x in Tstep) local synonyms, some global synonyms and many paresis tic items.",
        "After a few thesaurus updatings the values of the association function for parasistic items rapidly decrease, and the values for local and global synonyms increase.",
        "It is clear that reliability of such a thesaurus can be reached only after a large number of queries.",
        "In such a situation new updating procedures might be considered so that new parasistic items should not be introduced in Tx (thus breaking the stability of Tx).",
        "Global treatment of thesaurus Let be T the large set of items registered in the thesaurus.",
        "In order to classify T (i.e. to split T into classes of similar items), we consider the couple of reference vectors Tx and Ty (so ET and ET ) for any items x and y.",
        "Let be r(x,y) a similarity measure r(x,y) -",
        "We can use an association matrix (i.e. term-term matrix) between items and found a partition of T in equivalence classes.",
        "Moreover, this method hardly applies to a great many items and does not seem realistic for a large scale dictionnary (6000 or 10000 items, for example) which are common in information retrieval field.",
        "To overcome this drawback, we may try to build up the global association matrix from the local ones.",
        "Some ideas have been suggested2 using the fuzzy sets theory6,13 but there are still theoretical approaches.",
        "Feedback query processing Number of papers are related to the feedback query processing' 0,12 and our approach is similar.",
        "We think to adopt the following strategy, though we lack practical results to assert better \"score\" on queries.",
        "After a query we have therefore a set Rs of items related to s (for each s E Ti) and a partition of Tk into equivalence classes F. In the thesaurus we might have both a set T (items related to s) and a partition of the glogal set T into equivalence classes C.",
        "Several strategies can be used, they are detailed in an other paper4.",
        "We can use only local context, global context or both global and local context.",
        "We summarize some of the solutions below: 1) use of only global context A query is automatically generated with t instead of x when t belongs to the reference vector T and pT (x,t) is greater or equal than a threZold a.x If the user agrees, a new query is generated with t when x and t are equivalent in the thesaurus.",
        "2) use of both local and global context When an item t is considered as \"similar\" to x both in local context (Rx) and in global context (Tx) and pRx (x'Tx t)p (x,t)' t automatically replaces x in the query.",
        "When Rx and Tx have common items, we can purpose to the user new queries with item t appearing in Tx but not in Rx (pT (x,t)a).",
        "As previously mentioned we can use the same strategy using the local equivalence classes F. and global equivalence classes Ci (automatic fed back query processing with x E Ci n ri, and under user control with )c E C. but x C. 0r and C. n r. 0 0).11j In this last case, we can think global synonymies allow to retrieve new documents originally left out.",
        "the previous analysis, it seems that the best strategies should be those using both local and global contexts, but this needs to be verified.",
        "Conclusions We conclude from present experimentation on small number of french texts that the thesaurus updating method shall give horizontal thesaurus relations.",
        "Moreover unexpected relation between items should appear in the thesaurus, that is association which strongly reflects the corpus' content and which could not a priori be established and enhanced.",
        "The methodology presented above does not exclude any further intervention on the thesaurus to refine semantic information about some particular cases, such as modifying values of the association function for some items, enriching definition of synonyms.",
        "Our next goal for such a design of the thesaurus is twofold 1) we wish to make possible non boolean queries through the use of fuzzy keywords and subsequent improvement of dialogue 2) we wish to cluster documents with a dynamic indexing mechanism."
