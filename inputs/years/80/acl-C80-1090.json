        "In the composition of a dictionary,those involved in the definition of each word have to study very consciously its set of concordances, so that no meaning or use is missed.",
        "there are, of course, some difficulties since on one hand, the sample is never large enough as to insure the occurrence of all the different meanings and uses of every word to be defined.",
        "This problem is solved by consulting other dictionaries and expertees on the particular subject.",
        "On the other hand, there are words having a very large number of occurrences, making their analysis a very difficult task, since it is not possible to have present in mind everything that is being analysed.",
        "At first thought this could be solved by taking at random a smaller number of concordances; however, when reducing in this way, one is about to loose the grammatical and semantic information contained in all those concordances to be taken away; hence a method had to be implemented as to attain the maximum possible information.",
        "In order to solve this problem, the DEM presents a method whose aim is to obtain optimal information with the minimum number of concordances to be handled.",
        "This method consists of, for each concordance to analyse and compare four words to the left and to the right of word W together with their grammatical category associated, and establishing which one of them is identical to which other in a particular context: A tree structure is generated.",
        "Having known this, it is proceeded to reduce the number, by selecting some of them considered to be representatives."
