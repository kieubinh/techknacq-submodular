        "A truly natural language processing system does not have to have a perfect model of human language use, but it should have knowledge of whatever limitations its model has.",
        "Then, for a user who has exceeded these limitations, the system can interactively aid the user to rephrase the input in an acceptable way.",
        "This is a prerequisite to any practical application, whether it be natural language communication to a data base, a medical consultation system, or an office automation system.",
        "Users will not find such a system practical unless it gives helpful feedback when the system fails to understand an input.",
        "As an example of how a user's input can exceed the system's model, we repeat an anecdote of Woods (1973b) about his system for answering natural language queries about lunar rock samples.",
        "One question asked was, \"What is the average weight of all your samples?\" This overstepped the system's model in at least three ways.",
        "It surpassed the syntactic model, which did not provide for a predeterminer such as \"all\" preceding another determiner, such as \"your\" or \"the\".",
        "Therefore, the sentence could not be parsed, even though \"What is the average weight of all samples\" or \"What is the average weight of your samples\" could have been.",
        "The semantic capabilities were also surpassed, because semantic rules for translating \"weight of\" to a functional representation had not been incorporated.",
        "Indeed, no data had been included for the weights of the samples.",
        "The third problem was that no semantic translation rules for possession were present.",
        "The input violated the system's model of pragmatics, for the designers had not attributed possession of the samples to the machine.",
        "This paper presents three ideas for giving useful feedback when a user exceeds the system's model.",
        "The ideas help to identify and explain the system's problem in processing an input in many cases, but do not perform the next step, which is suggesting how the user might rephrase the input.",
        "These ideas have been tested in one of two systems: (1) an intelligent tutor for instruction in a foreign language and (2) a system which computes the Copyright 1980 by the Association for Computational Linguistics.",

        "In general, the presuppositions or given information (defined later), of a user's input must be true in the system's model of context, for they represent facts that must be shared among the participants of a dialogue.",
        "For each presupposition not true in the machine's model, the system should print the false presupposition to identify an assumption that the user cannot make.",
        "Section 3 presents a technique for relaxing constraints to accept sentences that would not parse otherwise.",

        "The meaning of particular words is the source of other examples.",

        "Certain quantifying phrases carry given information, as in \"Only project J1 receives parts from New York companies\", which presupposes that project J1 receives parts from New York companies.",
        "An analogy can be drawn between given information and preconditions or \"input assertions\" on a procedure.",
        "Given information for definite noun phrases corresponds to predicates on the value of a variable.",
        "Given information from the meaning of predicates such as \"describe\" corresponds to assertions about the state on entry of a procedure.",
        "Therefore, given information includes preconditions on the execution of a user request.",
        "Furthermore, such preconditions are directly traceable to particular phrases in that request.",
        "The psychological validity of given and new information has been demonstrated by Clark and Haviland (1977) and Haviland and Clark (1974).",
        "The psychological process they suggest is that (1) given and new information are first sorted in processing a sentence, (2) memory is then searched to establish that the given information holds in context, and (3) the new information is then asserted in memory.",
        "We have modelled this process in natural language systems.",
        "Research reported in Joshi and Weischedel (1977) and Weischedel (1979) demonstrated how to organize an augmented transition network and lexicon to compute the given and new information of a sentence.",
        "In another system, we implemented the second of the three parts of the psychological process suggested by Clark and Haviland.",
        "That system was an intelligent tutor which pinpointed errors a student makes while answering questions in German during a reading comprehension exercise (Weischedel, et.al., 1978).",
        "A text presented to English-speaking students in German provides a relatively closed world for the tutor system, since questions refer to entities presented in the text and facts about them.",
        "Therefore, these can be included as a detachable module of world knowledge specific to the particular text, along with any other world knowledge that is applicable to the set of questions.",
        "It is still possible for the student to refer to knowledge not contained in the model, but it is unlikely.",
        "Though the students have vast amounts of knowledge not in the system model, they have insufficient vocabulary and syntactic forms to be able to express this knowledge initially.",
        "Thus, in the environment of foreign language instruction, the system is in the unique position of having more vocabulary and syntactic forms than the user and, therefore, has more domain knowledge than the",
        "user can express.",
        "Obviously most systems do not have this property.",
        "Presuppositions were very effective in the German tutor system, though they are a crucial semantic check for natural language systems in general.",
        "Checking presuppositions against the world model of the German tutor provides recognition for several types of errors.",
        "First, given information of questions presented by the system must be inferable from a student's answer; otherwise the answer is inappropriate for the question.",
        "Consequently, the tutor diagnoses misunderstanding of a question by checking that the given information of a question (which it knows independently) is among the inferences of a student's answer.",
        "Only a very simple inference mechanism is used.",
        "Second, given information in the student's answer is checked against the world model.",
        "If the given information does not exist in the system's knowledge base, the tutor finds one of two errors.",
        "If the presupposition is from a definite noun phrase, the tutor prints the noun phrase and informs the student that it knows of nothing that it could refer to.",
        "If the presupposition is associated with the semantics of a particular word, it assumes that this student, who is just learning German, has used the word incorrectly.",
        "For instance, essen presupposes that the one eating is human; fressen presupposes that the one eating is an animal.",
        "Given information is important for any question-answering system with natural language input.",

        "(We will refer to the input component as a \"parser'', though we do not presume that a parse tree is ever explicitly computed.)",
        "An important way that an input may fail to parse is when the user employs incorrect forms of the language.",
        "If particular forms are anticipated, they may be explicitly included in the syntactic model along with the appropriate translation mechanism.",
        "In the German tutor mentioned in the previous section, there are several examples of this.",
        "For instance, English-speaking students frequently forget to put past participles at the end of a clause; e.g. using \"Ich habe gegessen das Fleisch\" rather than the correct \"Ich habe das Fleisch gegessen,\" (I have eaten the meat).",

        "In a similar way, any natural language processing system may include all anticipated forms and translation rules for them whether or not they are strictly proper for the language.",
        "Another way for a system to accept incorrect forms of language is suggested by observing a common style of writing grammars.",
        "Syntactic input components are often designed using a context-free grammar where each grammar rule may be augmented by predicates operating on the semantic representations or on the constituents linked by the grammar rule.",

        "A solution would be simply to remove the predicate from the rule.",
        "However, Grishman (1973) reports from their experience in processing scientific texts that the predicates effectively eliminate a large number of spurious parses.",

        "(Instead of assuming that all failed predicates have equal weight, one could assign a partial order to them; but we have not yet investigated this.)",

      "text": [
        "We tested these ideas on a parser written in 1975 as part of a Ph.D. thesis (Weischedel, 1975).",
        "The purpose of the parser was to demonstrate how to compute two special classes of inferences, presuppositions and entailments of English sentences, by using an ATN and a lexicon.",
        "Because of its special purpose, the system included many constructions and lexical items of interest for their presuppositional or entailment content.",
        "For the same reason, many frequently occurring constructions of English were not implemented, e.g. conjunction reduction, reduced relative clauses, several consecutive prepositional phrases, and adverbials.",
        "A subset of constructions were selected from the linguistic analysis of Anderson (1970), which was a basis of defining the lexical classes of the Linguistic String Parser, described in Sager (1973) and Grishman (1973).",
        "Anderson's analysis defined lexical classes by the left contexts (subject) in which a predicate (verb or noun) could occur, the right contexts (object) in which a predicate could occur, and the transformations which could act upon these strings of subject, predicate and object.",
        "(Note, in this section the word \"predicate\" refers to part of an English clause, not a boolean test as in Section 3.)",
        "Such strings define the parsable sentential forms; the transformations acting upon the strings give further forms.",
        "Of course, our ATN parser encoded all surface forms in the graphs explicitly.",
        "The actions on the ATN arcs had the effect of inverting the transformations given by Anderson while moving along an ATN path matching the surface form.",
        "Conditions on the arcs were very significant in the style of our parser.",
        "For instance, a condition before POPping from the sentential level checks whether the left and right contexts matched for the word or predicate X form a string in the linguistic model of Anderson (1970).",
        "In the lexical entries each semantic representation for a word was associated with corresponding lexical classes.",
        "Finding the semantic representation of a sentence, therefore, required determining lexical classes for each of the words.",

Black Responding Intelligently to Unparsable Inputs The arc condition which checks whether a predicate X occurred in appropriate right and left contexts was not one of the ones we declared to be \"failable\", because this condition was necessary and sufficient for determining associated semantic representations.",
        "When the condition was not satisfied, the parser did not have in its lexicon a semantic representation for the word X. Consequently, the condition offered a very tight constraint for ascertaining when the parser had no semantic representation corresponding to an interpretation.",
        "Maintaining such tight control over what the system could and could not translate is somewhat akin in philosophy to using strongly typed programming languages with much error checking.",
        "People do not seem to have such a style in using natural languages; however, it might be a useful engineering principle for natural language systems where accuracy of understanding is crucial.",
        "Another consciously applied strategy in designing the parser was to separate into distinct paths many strings which conceivably could have been merged.",
        "The criterion for making a distinct path was whether a string which was syntactically differentiable also had a distinct semantic representation.",
        "For instance, cleft sentences, such as \"It was Mary who won\", could have been incorporated by simply listing left and right contexts for \"be\" in the lexicon.",
        "However, the syntactic form has distinct meaning, namely in the example, the presupposition that \"Someone won.\" Therefore, the parser has a special path for cleft sentences.",
        "This aspect of style yielded several relatively long paths with little branching.",
        "For such paths, the messages for a blocked parse can pinpoint the interpretation that was being followed and what was expected next.",
        "Examples of this are provided in section 4.3.",
        "One of the major advantages of testing our ideas on this parser was the fact that there were many ways in which a sentence could fail to parse.",
        "The parser was already available, but more important for the assigning of meaning to its states, its designer was readily available.",
        "A further reason for selecting this parser was that it did cover a wide range of constructions and was not a toy grammar.",
        "In general, we specifically avoided enhancing the grammar to remove limitations.",
        "We wanted a full range of tests and example problems to exercise our ideas as thoroughly as possible.",

        "For instance, in the environment of an intelligent tutor for computer-assisted language instruction, the user is learning or has learned many informal grammatical concepts of the language (though these may not directly correspond to the formal ones implemented in the parser).",

        "We have drawn eight conclusions from our experience with the two systems on which our heuristics were tested.",
        "First, computing the presuppositions, or given information, of user input provides a means for detecting some of the user's assumptions inherent in the input.",
        "These may be checked against world knowledge in the system to recognize discrepancies between the user's model and the system's world model and to point out an incorrect assumption to the user.",
        "Second, an effective strategy for increasing the robustness of a parser is to allow relaxation of predicates (on ATN arcs) that the parser designer designates as relaxable, or \"failable.\" The system will prefer parses where no such predicates are false.",
        "If no parse can be found with all predicates true, the system will relax the predicates designated as failable, and will search for a parse with the fewest failable predicates false.",
        "The remaining conclusions regard our technique of assigning meanings to states as a means of generating responses when no parse can be found.",
        "The third conclusion is that the meanings of states, used with the longest path heuristic, can often pinpoint the cause of an input not parsing.",
        "Fourth, though the cause of the input not parsing can often be pinpointed with the technique, describing the cause to the user may be quite difficult because of the technical nature of the problem in the input.",
        "Fifth, the effectiveness of the longest path heuristic in correctly selecting the state corresponding to the actual problem in processing the input depends on the style of the grammar and the extent of the subset of language covered.",
        "The more constrained the language used in the application domain, the less possibility for the parser continuing beyond the point of the problem.",
        "Alternatively, the more syntactic and semantic constraints used as expectations by the parser, the greater the likelihood that the problem in the input will correctly correspond to a violated expectation, since violated expectations will help prevent the parser from going beyond the point of the problem.",
        "This does not conflict with the notion of relaxing predicates, since the longest path heuristic is used only after no parse can be found even after relaxing predicates.",
        "In our grammar, the longest path heuristic selected the correct state in over 90% of the test cases.",
        "Sixth, based on the two previous conclusions, the heuristic of responding using the meaning of states will be most effective in semantic grammars or in parsers that interact closely with semantic processes.",
        "Seventh, the longest path heuristic adds only a small fraction to the computing time and memory usage during parsing.",
        "Furthermore, adding the condition-action pairs to represent the meaning of states does not require a lot of programming, but does require a better understanding of the parser.",
        "Eighth and last, the technique of assigning meaning to states is applicable to explaining compile-time errors in programming languages as well.",
        "We also suggest four areas for further work.",
        "First, the heuristics should be tested in a parser that interacts closely with semantics while parsing.",
        "The purpose for that is twofold: (1) to more effectively respond to the user by paraphrasing the partial interpretation and semantic expectations when the input is unparsable and (2) to test further the effectiveness of the longest path heuristic.",
        "Second, the user's goals and intent are critical constraints which we have not incorporated in any of our heuristics.",
        "The aforementioned work on computational models of speech acts and dialogue games provide a starting point for this.",
        "A third area is to combine the ideas presented here with the heuristics in LIFER (Hendrix, et.al., 1978); the combination could provide a very user-oriented, flexible interface.",
        "Fourth, the effectiveness of our technique for responding to unparsable sentences should be examined in the domain of programming language compilers, because the user of a compiler knows many technical terms which the parser writer can employ in messages to convey effectively the cause of a blocked parse."
