        "This is not to say that explanation can be totally decoupled from description, and, in fact, the use of the general model of actions to derive ISA forms has significant explanatory potential.",
        "To fully account for differences in ISA forms, however, we must have a good characterization of what these differences are.",

        "Two approaches to the characterization of indirect speech acts have been particularly influential for both computational and traditional linguists: the views proposed by Gordon and Lakoff and by Searle.",
        "Since the rules presented in this paper combine properties of each approach, we start with a brief description of each.",
        "We consider first the approach taken by Gordon and Lakoff [12].",
        "Concentrating primarily on request, Gordon and Lakoff propose a set of what they call sincerity conditions and then give a single powerful rule to account for the different ways that a request can be framed.",
        "They say that to make a sincere request a speaker must, first, want the action done, second, believe that the hearer can do the action, third, believe that the hearer wants to do the action, and, fourth, believe that the hearer would not do the action unless asked to.",
        "The first of these sincerity conditions is called speaker-based and the remaining three are called hearer-based.",
        "The rule given is: One can convey a request by (a) asserting a speaker-based sincerity condition or (b) questioning a hearer-based sincerity condition.",
        "This formulation is attractive because it is so elegant and simple, but it is also, as the authors are the first to observe, only a preliminary answer.",
        "The conditions associated with request are incomplete, since they lack any mention of obligation relationships; these are discussed below in Section 3.3.",
        "More problematic is the lack of detailed guidelines for extending the theory beyond requests.",
        "A second major approach to ISA regularities is that of Searle.",
        "Searle presents a more complete account of ISAs, proposing generalizations associated with the five major classes of speech act defined in [26].",
        "In [25] he lists four generalizations for directives and five others for commissives.",
        "The generalizations are differentiated according to the parts of the speech act identified in [24], i.e. propositional content conditions, sincerity conditions, and preparatory conditions.",
        "(Gordon and Lakoff's sincerity conditions, in contrast, seem to be an amalgam of Searle's sincerity and preparatory conditions.)",
        "Searle's contribution is a valuable one, in that he has succeeded in accounting for a broad range of speech acts.",
        "At the same time, Searle's generalizations can be questioned on the count that they are too specific.",
        "Generalizations are stated in terms of types of preparatory conditions, rather than in terms of preparatory conditions as a whole.",
        "A more serious problem is the relegation of the notion of speaker and hearer-based conditions to an informal role, as opposed to giving it an explicit place in the theory.",
        "The theory proposed in this paper is both a synthesis and a generalization of the two approaches.",
        "Rather than derive ISA forms from a single set of conditions associated with the speech act, as do Gordon aid Lakoff, I follow Searle in looking for important classes of ISA forms based on different parts of the speech act.",
        "The theory presented goes a step further, however, looking beyond the structure of individual speech acts to derive ISA forms from very general principles of goal formation."

Brown Characterizing Indirect Speech Acts within the larger model, since structural information can be used in a number of different ways.",

        "Thus, action representations are not merely programs for doing something, they are also knowledge structures that may be used by other processes.",
        "We start with the notion of a method, a representation of an action.",
        "Methods have three main parts: a header, argument specifications, and a procedural body.",
        "The header is the method's unique name.",
        "Argument specifications, organized by semantic cases, are used for type checking of inputs to the method (input cases) or to specify the form of results (output cases).",

        "The paint brush may also end up red, but this is not the principal result.",
        "Turning to the method's procedural body, we need to know that procedure steps may correspond to sub-actions, i.e. they may be used as calls to other methods.",
        "Beyond this, procedure steps have a good deal of interesting structure, discussion of which is not necessary for the purposes of this paper.",
        "As for prerequisites, the ones that are of interest here are states.",

        "Preconditions are constraints on the beliefs, desires, or other intentions of the agent of the method (the participant responsible for the action) that should be satisfied before the speech act gets underway.",

        "The reason for this, I suggest, is that the UNMARKED-ASK rule is a mitigator: questions, in general, promote politeness by giving P2 an opportunity to answer, allowing P2 to refuse to accept P l's goals in uttering the speech act.",

        "A goal stated explicitly leaves P2 very little room to refuse P1 without doing so explicitly.",

        "This paper has characterized a significant number of ISA forms, with attention to representational issues.",
        "As noted in the introduction, these are the only claims made, although the ultimate motivation of the work was not only computational but was directed by a particular computational philosophy of language recognition.",
        "This philosophy will be described briefly here, with emphasis on the way that the theory presented fits into it.",
        "Due to the number of issues involved, I 160 American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 6, Number 3-4, July-December 1980 Gretchen P. Brown Characterizing Indirect Speech Acts will again consider only ISA pattern identification, i.e. proposing the candidate matches for a particular utterance form.",
        "Issues related to choosing between alternatives are discussed in [4], along with a framework for using dialogue context to aid in this choice.",
        "The approach to ISA pattern identification suggested will be contrasted with two other computational approaches, that of Moore, Levin, and Mann [18,19] and Allen, Cohen, and Perrault [1,8,21].",
        "We start with a summary of each approach.",
        "The central structure in the process model of dialogue developed by Moore, Levin, and Mann is called the dialogue game.",
        "Dialogue games are procedures that include steps for speech acts and their standard range of responses.",
        "Indirect speech act forms are related to these larger structures according to the general principle that any utterance that can establish the parameters of a dialogue game can serve as an ISA.",
        "For recognition, the correspondence between particular ISAs and parameters is done by applying rule-like transformations using partial match and plausible inference techniques.",
        "Representations of utterances are placed in a pool of facts about the dialogue where correspondences are drawn by highly parallel \"anarchic\" control structures.",
        "The second computational approach to ISAs, that of Allen et al., focuses on the speech act planning process.",
        "Allen's work is most relevant here, because it deals in detail with ISA recognition.",
        "Allen introduces the notion of an obstacle, a type of condition in the speech act planning process that provides the subject matter for many varieties of ISAs.",
        "This approach appears to generate a more constrained set of possible ISA forms than the approach of Moore et al.",
        "and gives more basis for an explanation of the variety of forms.",
        "To draw the correspondence between ISAs and speech act plans, Allen et al.",
        "propose a general inference process guided by heuristics such as the principle that inference stops when a non-obvious condition is proposed as the topic of the ISA.",
        "These approaches and the one advocated here have in common the reliance on representation of actions to characterize indirect speech acts.",
        "Allen, Cohen, and Perrault view the speech act as an independent unit; Moore, Levin and Mann relate ISAs to larger units of activity that have speech act components and that are defined according to the goals achieved by the speech acts.",
        "This difference between the approaches of Allen et al.",
        "and Moore et al.",
        "is, I think, primarily one of presentation rather than substance.",
        "The approach advocated here is a combination of the two perspectives.",
        "A complete system would need both the ability to handle the prototype speech act plus response sequences (called core dialogue methods in [4]) and the ability to treat speech acts as basic building blocks within other sequences.",
        "By focusing on independent speech acts in this paper, I do not intend to rule out their incorporation within larger actions.",
        "A more substantive difference among the approaches is the mechanism envisioned for drawing correspondences between individual ISAs and ISA patterns.",
        "Both of the approaches summarized above are theoretical in a traditional sense, in that they posit one mechanism powerful enough to account for any utterance, i.e., a mechanism powerful enough to handle the most difficult case.",
        "Coupled with the interest in maximizing power is the interest in maximizing simplicity; redundancy in the representation structure is not expected or exploited.",
        "In contrast, the proposals in this paper are motivated by an \"appropriate technology\" view of ISA pattern identification.",
        "From this perspective, ISA patterns are assumed to be particularly adapted to communication, so that identifying candidate ISA patterns is not typically a general problem solving process.",
        "(I emphasize here pattern identification; choosing between the alternative candidates identified appears to be a more open-ended process.)",
        "Given these assumptions, the search is for a way to identify the most frequently used ISA forms simply, short of full-blown problem solving.",
        "The solution could include a hierarchy of processing strategies, differentiated to handle different levels of complexity.",
        "The descriptive model presented in the preceding sections relates to this philosophy on two counts: matching processes and the choice of levels of representation.",
        "Each is considered in turn.",
        "Section 5 described several different types of match between particular ISA representations and patterns: first, those matches using only predefined classification links in the knowledge base; second, those requiring evaluation of representations, possibly augmented by contextual information, to establish classification links; and, third, those using definition and method component links, again with or without the use of additional contextual information.",
        "While these distinctions can be used to guide a general inference mechanism, they could also be used in the development of specialized matching strategies, to take advantage of properties of the representations and links involved.",
        "Along with the use of specialized processors for ISA pattern identification can come the use of specialized, and to an extent redundant, representations.",
        "This is most evident in the preceding pages in the distinction between using the goal formation process as a conceptual organization of ISAs (and, hence, to an extent as an explanation) versus its use as a direct basis for drawing correspondences with individual ISAs.",
        "The ISA patterns assumed are at least three levels removed from any actual goal formation procedure: the use of maxims is an abstraction of the proce-American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 6, Number 3-4, July-December 1980 161 Gretchen P. Brown Characterizing Indirect Speech Acts dure; generalized rules are based on maxims; and then ISA patterns are produced by applying rules to individual speech acts.",
        "This is in contrast to plan deduction of Allen et al., which uses only very general rules coupled with the representations of the plan deduction process.",
        "Similarly, what was called the better-knowledge principle was \"precompiled\" into rules, rather than combined with more general rules by inference.",
        "The thrust of the effort is to push ISA patterns to a level as close as possible to the representations of particular ISAs; in fact, in many cases this paper has not gone as far as possible, and I think, as ultimately desirable, in producing highly specific ISA patterns.",
        "This representational style is expected to have three effects.",
        "First, for many cases, it avoids problems inherent in general inference processes of controlling the direction of inference toward the \"interesting\" cases.",
        "Second, the more specialized the patterns, the simpler the individual match processes, and the more forms can be handled by cheaper processes.",
        "Third, the various ISA patterns give a natural place to associate information about idiomaticity and specialized information about implications of ISA choice.",
        "Note that these various mechanisms and representations cannot be introduced arbitrarily.",
        "To be effective, they must be chosen based on an understanding of the structure of indirect speech act classes, i.e. on an appropriate descriptive theory.",
        "This brings us back to the original claims of the paper; it is hoped that the proposals made are a step toward such a theory.",
        "Finally, it should be emphasized that the computational apparatus sketched here complements, rather than seeks to replace, a generalized problem solving mechanism for ISA pattern identification.",
        "The hypothesis is that only a relatively small proportion of ISAs require the more general (and more expensive) mechanism.",
        "It is possible that the use of redundant mechanisms and representations can lead to good computational solutions to the problem of modelling a large body of indirect speech acts.",
