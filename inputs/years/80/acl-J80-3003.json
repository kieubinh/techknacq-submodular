        "Austin [1962] was one of the first to stress the distinction between the action(s) which a speaker performs by uttering a sentence (such as informing, requesting, or convincing) and the truth conditions of propositions contained in the sentence.",
        "Actions have effects on the world, and may have preconditions which must obtain for them to be felicitously performed.",
        "For actions whose execution involves the use of language (or speech acts), the preconditions may include the speaker holding certain beliefs about the world, and having certain intentions or wants as to how it should change.",
        "As well as being important to the study of natural language semantics, speech acts are important to the designer of conversational natural language understanding systems.",
        "Such systems should be able to recognize what actions the user is performing.",
        "Conversely, if such a system is to acquire information or request assistance from its user, it should know how and when to ask questions and make requests.",

        "We are only concerned here with a competence theory.",
        "In Perrault, Allen, and Cohen [1978] we suggested that it is useful to consider speech acts in the context of a planning system.",
        "A planning system consists of a class of â€¢parameterized procedures called operators, whose execution can modify the world.",
        "Each operator is labelled with formulas stating its preconditions and effects.",
        "A plan construction algorithm is a procedure which, given a description of some initial state of the world and a goal state to be achieved, constructs a plan, or sequence of operators, to achieve it.",
        "It is assumed there, and in all our subsequent work, that language users maintain a model of the world (their beliefs) and a set of goals (their wants).",
        "One person S's beliefs may include beliefs about another person A's beliefs and wants, including A's beliefs about S, etc.",
        "We do not concern ourselves with obligations, feelings, etc., which clearly can also be affected by speech acts.",
        "CP discuss criteria for judging the correctness of the preconditions and effects of the operators corresponding to speech acts, and specifically those of the acts INFORM and REQUEST.",
        "However, the conditions on INFORM and REQUEST given in CP are at best necessary and certainly not sufficient.",

        "lar they say nothing about the form of utterances used to perform the speech acts.",
        "Several syntactic devices can be used to indicate the speech act being performed: the most obvious are explicit performative verbs such as \"I hereby request you to ...\", and mood (indicative for assertions, imperative for requests to do, interrogative for requests to inform).",
        "But the mood of an utterance is well known to not completely specify its illocutionary force: l.a-b can be requests to close the door, l.c-e can be requests to tell the answer, and 1.f can be an assertion.",
        "(1.a) I want you to close the door.",
        "(1.b) Will you close the door?",
        "(1.c) Tell me the answer.",
        "(1.d) I want you to tell me the answer.",
        "(1.e) Do you know what the answer is?",
        "(1.f) Do you know that Jack is in town?",
        "Furthermore, all these utterances can also be intended literally in some contexts.",
        "For example, a parent leaving a child at the train station may ask l.g expecting a yes/no answer as a confirmation.",
        "(l.g) Do you know when the train leaves?",
        "The object of this paper is to extend the work in CP to account for indirect use of mood, loosely called indirect speech acts.",
        "The solution proposed here is based on the following intuitively simple and independently motivated hypotheses:",
        "(1) Language users are rational agents engaged in goal seeking behaviour.",
        "Among these goals are the modification of the beliefs and goals of other agents.",
        "(2) Rational agents are frequently capable of",
        "identifying actions being performed by others and goals being sought.",
        "An essential part of helpful or cooperative behaviour is the adoption by one agent of a goal of another, followed by an attempt to achieve it.",
        "For example, for a store clerk to reply \"How many do you want?\" to a customer who has asked \"Where are the steaks?\", the clerk must have inferred that the customer wants steaks, then he must have decided to get them himself.",
        "This might have occurred even if the customer had intended to get the steaks him or herself.",
        "Cooperative behaviour must be accounted for independently of speech acts, for it often occurs without the use of language.",
        "(3) In order for a speaker to successfully perform a speech act, he must intend that the hearer recognize his intention to achieve the effects of the speech act, and must believe it is likely that the hearer will be able to do so.",
        "This is the foundation for the philosophical account of speech acts.",
        "(4) Language users know that others are capable of achieving goals, of recognizing actions, and of cooperative behaviour.",
        "Furthermore, they know that others know they know, etc.",
        "A speaker may intend not only that his actions be recognized but also that his goals be inferred.",
        "(5) Thus a speaker can perform one speech act A by performing another speech act B if he in",
        "tends that the hearer recognize not only that B was performed but also that through cooperative behaviour by the hearer, intended by the speaker, the effects of A should be achieved.",
        "The speaker must also believe that it is likely that the hearer can recognize this intention.",
        "The process by which one agent can infer the plans of another is central to our account of speech acts.",
        "Schmidt et al. [1978] and Genesereth [1978] present algorithms by which one agent can infer the goals of another, but assuming no interaction between the two.",
        "We describe the process in terms of a set of plausible plan inference rules directly related to the rules by which plans can be constructed.",
        "Let A and S be two agents and ACT an action.",
        "One example of a simple plan inference rule is: \"If S believes that A wants to do ACT then it is plausible that S believes that A wants to achieve the effects of ACT.\" From simple rules like this can be derived more complex plan inference rules such as: \"If S believes that A wants S to recognize A's intention to do ACT, then it is plausible that S believes that A wants S to recognize A's intention to achieve the effects of ACT.\" Notice that the complex rule is obtained by introducing \"S believes A wants\" in the antecedent and consequent of the simple rule, and by interpreting \"S recognizes A's intention\" as \"S comes to believe that A wants\".",
        "Throughout the paper we identify \"want\" and \"intend\".",
        "We show that rules of the second type can account for S's recognition of many indirect speech acts by A, i.e. those in which S recognizes A's intention that S perform cooperative acts.",
        "To distinguish the use of, say, the indicative mood, in an assertion from its use in, say, an indirect request, the speech act operators REQUEST and INFORM of CP are reformulated and two further acts S.REQUEST and S.INFORM are added.",
        "These surface level acts are realized literally as indicative and imperative utterances.",
        "An S.REQUEST to INFORM is realized as a question.",
        "The surface level acts can be recognized immediately as parts of the higher level (or illocutionary level) acts, to which the simple plan construction",
        "and inference rules can apply.",
        "Alternatively, the complex rules can be applied to the effects of the surface acts, and the intended performance of one of the illocutionary acts inferred later.",
        "For example, there are two ways an agent S could be led to tell A the secret after hearing A tell him \"Can you tell me the secret?\".",
        "Both start with S's recognition that A asked a yes/no question.",
        "In the first case, S assumes that A simply wanted to know whether S could tell the secret, then infers that A in fact wants to know the secret and, helpfully, decides to tell it.",
        "In the second case S recognizes that A intends S to infer that A wants to know the secret and that A intends S to tell A the secret, and thus that A has requested S to tell the secret.",
        "In general, several of the plan inference rules could apply at any time, and none of them guarantees a valid consequence.",
        "The application of the rules is controlled by a set of heuristics which rate the plausibility of the outcomes.",
        "Following a review of the relevant aspects of speech act theory in section 2, section 3 outlines our assumptions about beliefs, goals, actions, plans, and the plan inference process.",
        "Section 4 shows how the speech act definitions and the plan inference process can be used to relate literal to indirect meanings for REQUESTs and INFORMs.",
        "We show how utterances such as 1.h-1, and even 1.m can be used as requests to pass the salt, and what the origin of the several interpretations of 1.m is.",
        "(1.h) I want you to pass the salt.",
        "(1.i) Do you have the salt?",
        "(1.j) Is the salt near you?",
        "(1.k) I want the salt.",
        "(1.1) Can you pass the salt?",
        "(1.m) John asked me to ask you to pass the salt.",
        "Similarly we show how 1.n can be used to inform while 1.o cannot.",
        "Section 5 relates this work to the literature, while section 6 suggests further problems and draws some conclusions.",
        "(1.n) Do you know that the train is late?",
        "(1.o) Do you believe that the train is late?",
        "The speech act recognition process described here has been implemented as a computer program and tested by having it simulate an information clerk at a railway station.",
        "This domain is real, but sufficiently circumscribed so that interchanges between clerk and patrons are relatively short and are directed towards a limited set of goals.",
        "The program accepts as input simple English sentences, parses them using an ATN parser, and produces as output the speech act(s) it recognized and their associated propositional contents.",
        "It can handle all the examples discussed here.",
        "Details of the implementation can be found in Allen [1979]."

        "We have given evidence in this paper for an account of indirect speech acts based on rationality (plan construction), imputing rationality to others (plan inference), surface speech act definitions relating form to \"literal\" intentions, and illocutionary acts allowing a variety of realizing forms for the same intentions.",
        "The reader may object that we are suggesting a complex solution to what appears to be a simple problem.",
        "It is important to distinguish here the general explanation of indirect speech acts (which is presented here partly through an algorithm) from the implementation of such an algorithm in a practical natural language understanding system.",
        "We claim that the elements necessary for a theoretically satisfying account of indirect speech acts are independently motivated.",
        "It is almost certain that a computationally efficient solution to the indirect speech act problem would short-cut many of the inference chains suggested here, although we doubt that all searching can be eliminated in the case of the less standard forms such as 4.6a.",
        "The implementation in Brachman et al. [1980] does just that.",
        "However, the more fundamental account is necessary to evaluate the correctness of the implementations.",
        "Many problems remain.",
        "Other syntactic forms that have significance with respect to illocutionary force determination should be considered.",
        "For example, tag questions such as \"John is coming to the party tonight, isn't he?\" have not been analysed here (but see Brown [1980]).",
        "Furthermore, no \"why\" or \"how\" questions have been examined.",
        "Besides the incorporation of more syntactic information, another critical area that needs work concerns the control of inferencing.",
        "To allow the use of specialized inferences, a capability that is obviously required by the general theory, much research needs to be done outlining methods of selecting and restricting such inferences.",
        "This paper has concentrated on recognition.",
        "Allen [1979] shows how the construction algorithms would have to be modified to allow the generation of surface acts, including indirect forms.",
        "McDonald [1980] discusses the planning of low-level syntactic form.",
        "According to the definition of INFORM of section 4.1, any utterance that causes S to infer that A has a plan to achieve KNOW(S,P) by achieving BSWA(KNOW(S,P)) is considered by S to be an INFORM.",
        "Strawson [1964] argues that one level of recognition of intention is not sufficient for the definition of a speech act.",
        "Schiffer [1972] gives a series of counterexamples to show that no finite number of conditions of the form BsWA(BsWA(...(KNOW(S,P))) is sufficient either.",
        "The solution he proposes is that the recognition of intention must be mutually believed between the speaker and the hearer.",
        "Cohen and Levesque [1980] and Allen [forthcoming] show how the speech act definitions given here can be extended in this direction.",
        "We have only considered acts to request and inform because many of their interesting properties can be based on belief and want.",
        "At least primitive accounts of the logics of these propositional attitudes are available.",
        "Clearly there is room for much work here.",
        "Extending the analysis to other speech acts, such as promises, will require a study of other underlying logics such as that of obligation.",
        "There also remain many problems with the formalization of actions.",
        "We believe this work shows that the concepts of preconditions, effects, and action bodies are fruitful in discussing plan recognition.",
        "The operator definitions for speech acts used here are intended to facilitate the statement of the plan construction and inference rules.",
        "However, their expressive power is insufficient to handle complex actions involving sequencing, conditionals, disjunctions, iterations, parallelism, discontinuity, and a fortiori requests and promises to do such acts.",
        "They are also inadequate, as Moore [1979] points out, to express what the agent of an action knows (and does not know) after the success or failure of an act.",
        "Moore's logic of action includes sequencing, conditionals, and iterations, and is being applied to speech acts by Appelt [1980].",
        "Much remains to be done to extend it to parallel and discontinuous actions typical of multiple agent situations.",
        "These difficulties notwithstanding, we hope that we have helped show that the interaction of logic, philosophy of language, linguistics and artificial intelligence is productive and that the whole will shed light on each of the parts."
