        "A dream of many computational linguists is to produce a natural language analyzer that tries its best to process language that \"almost but not quite\" corresponds to the system's grammar, dictionary and semantic knowledge base.",

        "To these ends.",
        "I developed the project and integrate algorithm, a method of inducing possible meanings of unknown words from context and storing the new information for eventual addition to the dictionary [1].",
        "While useful, this mechanism addresses only one aspect of the larger problem - accruing certain classes of word definitions in the dictionary.",
        "In this paper, I focus on the problem of augmenting the power of a semantic knowledge base used for language analysis by means of metaphorical mappings.",
        "The pervasiveness of metaphor in every aspect of human communication has been convincingly demonstrated by Lakoff and Johnson [4], Ortony [6], Hobbs [3] and many others.",
        "However, the creation of a process model to encompass metaphor comprehension has not been of central concern.2 From a computational standpoint, metaphor has been viewed as an obstacle, to be tolerated at best and ignored at worst.",
        "For instance, Wilks [9] gives a few rules on how to relax semantic constraints in order for a parser to process a sentence in spite of the metaphorical",
        "usage of a particular word.",

        "There appear to be a small number of general metaphors (on the order of fifty) that pervade commonly spoken English.",
        "Many of these were identified and exemplified by Lakoff and Johnson [4].",
        "For instance: more-is-up.",
        "less-is-down and the conduit metaphor - Ideas are objects, words are containers, communication consists of putting objects (ideas) into containers (words), sending the containers along a conduit (a communications medium, such as speech, telephone lines, newspapers.",
        "letters).",
        "whereupon the recipient at the other end of the conduit unpackages the objects from their containers (extracts the ideas from the words).",
        "Both of these metaphors apply in the examples discussed below.",
        "The computational significance of the existence of a small set of general metaphors underlies the reasons for my current investigation: The problem of understanding a large class of metaphors may be reduced from a reconstruction to a recognition task.",
        "That is, the identification of a metaphorical usage as an instance of one of the general metaphorical mappings is a much more tractable process than reconstructing the conceptual framework from the bottom up each time a new metaphor-instance is encountered.",
        "Each of the general metaphors contains not only mappings of the form: \"X is used to mean Y in context Z\", but inference rules to enrich the understanding process by taking advantage of the reasons why the writer may have chosen the particular metaphor (rather than a different metaphor or a literal rendition).",
        "3.",
        "Steps Towards Codifying Knowledge of Metaphors I propose to represent each general metaphor in the following manner: • A Recoanition Network contains the information necessary to decide whether or not a linguistic utterance is an instantiation of the general metaphor.",
        "On the first-pass implementation I will use a simple discrimination network.",
        "• The Basic Maiming establishes those features of the literal input that are directly mapped onto a different meaning by the metaphor.",
        "Thus, Any",
        "upward movement in the more-is-up metaphor is mapped into an increase in some directly",
        "quantifiable feature of the part of the input that undergoes the upward movement.",
        "• The Imolicit-Intention Comoonent encodes the reasons why this metaphor is typically chosen by a writer or speaker.",
        "Part of this information becomes an integral portion of the semantic representational of input utterances.",
        "For instance.",
        "Lakoff identifies many different",
        "metaphors for love: love-is-a-journey, love-is-war, love-is-madness, love-is-a-patient, love-is-a-physical-force (e.g., gravity, magnetism).",
        "Without belaboring the point, a writer chooses one these metaphors, as a function of the ideas he wants to convey to the reader.",
        "If the understander is to reconstruct those ideas, he ought to know why the particular metaphor was chosen.",
        "This information is precisely that which the metaphor conveys that is absent from a literal expression of the same concept.",
        "(E.g., \"John is completely crazy about Mary\" vs. \"John loves mary very much\".",
        "The former implies that John may exhibit impulsive or uncharacteristic behavior, and that his present state of mind may be less permanent than in the latter case.",
        "Such information ought to be stored with the love-is-madness metaphor unless the understanding system is sufficiently sophisticated to make these inferences by other means.)",
        "• A Transfer Maiming, analogous to Winston's",
        "Transfer Frames [101, is a filter that determines which additional parts of the literal input may be mapped onto the conceptual representation, and establishes exactly the transformation that this additional information must undergo.",
        "Hence, in \"Prices are soaring\", we need to use the basic mapping of the more-is-up metaphor to understand that prices are increasing, and we must use the transfer map of the same metaphor to interpret \"soar\" ( = rising high and fast) as large increases that are happening fast.",
        "For this metaphor, altitude descriptors map Into corresponding quantity descriptors and rate descriptors remain unchanged.",
        "This information is part of the transfer mapping.",
        "In general, the default assumption is that all descriptors remain unchanged unless specified otherwise - hence, the frame problem (5] is circumvented.",
        "1.",
        "Attempt to analyze the input utterance in a literal, conventional fashion.",
        "If this fails, and the failure is caused by a semantic case-constraint violation, go to the next step.",
        "(Otherwise, the failure is probably not due to the presence of a metaphor.)",
        "2.",
        "Apply the recognition networks of the generalized metaphors.",
        "If one succeeds, then",
        "retrieve all the information stored with that metaphorical mapping and go on to the next step.",
        "(Otherwise, we have an unknown metaphor or a different failure in the originai semantic interpretation.",
        "Store this case for future evaluation by the system builder.)",
        "3.",
        "Use the basic mapping to establish the semantic framework of the input utterance.",
        "4.",
        "Use the transfer mapping to fill the slots of the meaning framework with the entities in the input, transforming them as specified in the transfer map.",

        "The information encoded in the general metaphors must be brought to bear in the understanding process.",
        "Here, I Quill.the most direct way to extract maximal utility from the general-metaphor information.",
        "Perhaps a more subtle process that integrates metaphor information more closely w ti other conceptual knowledge is required.",
        "An attempt to implement this method in the near future will serve as a pragmatic measure of its soundness.",
        "The general process for applying metaphor-mapping knowledge is the following: Can gold soar?",
        "Can a market soar?",
        "Certainly not by any literal interpretation.",
        "A language interpreter could initiate a complex heuristic search (or simply an exhaustive search) to determine the most likely ways that \"soaring\" could modify gold or gold markets.",
        "For instance, one can conceive of a spreading-activation search starting from the semantic network nodes for \"gold market\" and \"soar\" (assuming such nodes exist in the memory) to determine the minimal-path intersections, much like Ouillian originally proposed [7].",
        "However, this mindless intersection search is not only extremely inefficient, but will invariably yield wrong answers.",
        "(E.g., a gold market ISA market, and a market can",
        "sell fireworks that soar through the sky to suggest a totally Spurious connection.)",
        "A system absolutely requires knowledge of the mappings in the more-is-up metaphor to establish the appropriate and only the appropriate connection.",
        "In comparison, consider an application of the general mechanism described in the previous section to the \"soaring gold market\" example.",
        "Upon realizing that a literal interpretation fails, the system can take the most salient semantic features of \"soaring\" and \"gold markets\" and apply them to the recognition networks of the general metaphors.",
        "Thus, \"upward movement\" from soaring matches \"up\" in the more-is-up metaphor, while \"increase in value or volume\" of \"gold markets\" matches the \"more\" side of the metaphor.",
        "The recognition of our example as an instance of the general more-is-up metaphor establishes its basic meaning.",
        "It is crucial to note that without knowledge that the concept up (or ascents) may map to more (or increases), there appears to be no general tractable mechanism for semantic interpretation of our example.",
        "The transfer map embellishes the original semantic framework of a gold market whose value is increasing.",
        "Namely, \"soaring\" establishes that the increase is rapid and not firmly supported.",
        "(A soaring object may come tumbling down -> rapid increases in value may be followed by equally rapid decreases).",
        "Some inferences that are true of things that soar can also transfer: If a soaring object tumbles it may undergo a significant negative state change -> the gold market (and those who ride it) may suffer significant negative state changes.",
        "However, physical states map onto financial states.",
        "The less-is-down half of the metaphor is, of course, also useful in this example, as we saw in the preceding discussion.",
        "Moreover, this half of the metaphor is crucial to understand the phrase \"bracing for a crash\".",
        "This phrase must pass through the transfer map to make sense in the financial gold market world.",
        "In fact, it passes through very easily.",
        "Recalling that physical states map to financial states, \"bracing\" maps from \"preparing for an expected sudden physical state change\" to \"preparing for a sudden financial state change\".",
        "\"Crash\" refers directly to the cause of the negative physical state change, and it is mapped onto an analogous cause of the financial state change.",
        "More-is-up, less-is-down is such a ubiquitous metaphor that there are probably no specific intentions conveyed by the writer , in his choice of the metaphor (unlike the love-is-madness metaphor).",
        "The instantiation of this metaphor should be remembered in interpreting subsequent text.",
        "For instance, had our example continued: Analysts expect gold prices to hit bottom soon, but investors may be in for a harrowing roller•coaster ride.",
        "We would have needed the context of: \"up means increases in the gold market, and down means decreases in the same market, which can severely affect investors\" before we could hope to understand the \"roller-coaster ride\" as \"unpredictable increases and decreases suffered by speculators and investors\".",
        "Consider briefly a second example: Press Censorship is a barrier to free communication.",
        "I have used this example before to illustrate the difficulty in interpreting the meaning of the word \"barrier\".",
        "A barrier is a physical object that disenables physical motion through its location (e.g., \"The fallen tree is a barrier to traffic\").",
        "Previously I proposed a semantic relaxation method to understand an \"information transfer\" barrier.",
        "However, there is a more elegant solution based on the conduit metaphor.",
        "The press is a conduit for communication.",
        "(Ideas have been packaged into words in newspaper articles and must now be distributed along the mass media conduit.)",
        "A barrier can be interpreted as a physical blockage of this conduit thereby disenabling the dissemination of information as packaged ideas.",
        "The benefits of applying the conduit metaphor is that only the original \"physical object\" meaning of barrier is required by the understanding system.",
        "In addition, the retention of the basic meaning of barrier (rather than some vague abstraction thereof) enables a language understander to interpret sentences like \"The censorship barriers were lifted by the new regime.\" Had we relaxed the requirement that a barrier be a physical object, it would be difficult to interpret what it means to \"lift\" an abstract disenabiement entity.",
        "On the other hand, the lifting of a physical object implies that its function as a disenabler of physical transfer no longer applies: therefore, the conduit is again open, a\",nd free communication can proceed.",
        "In both our examples the interpretation of a metaphor to understand one sentence helped considerably in understanding a subsequent sentence that retered to the metaphorical mapping established earlier.",
        "Hence, the significance of metaphor interpretation for understanding coherent text or dialog can hardly be overestimated.",
        "Metaphors often span several sentences and may structure the entire text around a particular metaphorical mapping (or a more explicit analogy) that helps convey the writer's central theme or idea.",
        "A future area of investigation for this writer will focus on the use of metaphors and analogy to root new ideas on old concepts and thereby convey them in a more natural and comprehensible manner.",
        "If metaphors and analogies help humans understand new concepts by relating them to existing knowledge.",

        "I set the former issue aside remarkino that if a small set of general constructs can account for the bulk of a complex phenomenon, then they merit an in-depth investigation.",
        "Other metaphors may simply be less-often encountered mappings.",
        "The latter issue, however, requires further discussion.",
        "I propose that typical instantiations of generalized metaphors be recognized and remembered as part of the metaphor interpretation process.",
        "These instantiations will serve to grow a hierarchy of often-encountered metaphorical mappings from the top down.",
        "That is, typical specializations of generalized metaphors are stored in a specialization hierarchy (similar to a semantic network, with ISA inheritance pointers to the generalized concept of which they are specializations).",
        "These typical instances can in turn spawn more specific instantiations (if encountered with sufficient frequency in the language analysis), and the process can continue until until the fixed-phrase level is reached.",
        "Clearly.",
        "growing all possible specializations of a generalized mapping is prohibitive in space, and the vast majority of the specializations thus generated would never be encountered in processing language.",

        "Only those instantiations of more general me.,ohors that are repeatedly encountered are assimilated into 11,e hierarchy.",
        "Moreover, the number or frequency of requited instances before assimilation takes place is a parameter that can be set according to the requirements of the system builder (or user).",
        "In this fashion, commonly-encountered metaphors will be recognized and understood much faster than more obscure instantiations of the general metaphors.",
        "It is important to note that creating new instantiations of more general mappings is a much simpler process than generalizing existing concepts.",
