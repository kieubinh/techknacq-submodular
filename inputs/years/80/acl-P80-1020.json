        "The chief independent variable of interest is the impact of computerized conferencing as a communications mode upon the process and outcome of group decision making, as compared to face-to-face discussions.",
        "Two different types of tasks were chosen, and group size was set at five persons.",
        "The subjects were Upsala College undergraduate, graduate and continuing education students.",
        "The communications process or profile was quantified using Bales Interaction Process Analysis (see Bales, 1950).",
        "In computerized conferencing, each participant is physically alone with a computer terminal attached to a telephone.",
        "In order to communicate, he or she types entries into the terminal and reads entries sent by the other participants, rather than spesking and listening.",
        "Entering input and reading output may be done totally at the pace and time chosen by each individual.",
        "Conceivably, for instance, all group members could be entering comments simultaneously.",
        "Receipt of messages from others is at the terminal print speed of 30 characters per second.",
        "Even when all five participants are on-line at the same time, there is considerable lag in a computer conference between the time a discussant types in a comment, and when a response to that comment is received.",
        "First, each of the other participants must finish what they are typing at the time; then they read the - waiting item; then they may type in a response; then the author of the original comment must finish his or her typing of a subsequent item and print and read the response.",
        "There is thus a definite \"asynchronous\" quality even to \"synchronous\" computer conferences.",
        "As a result, computer conferences often develop several simultaneous threads of discussion that are being discussed concurrently, whereas face to face discussions tend to focus on one single topic at a time and then move on to subsequent topics.",
        "(See Hilts and Turoff, 1978, for a complete description of CC as a mode of communication).",
        "A variable of secondary interest is problem type.",
        "Muth experimental literature indicates that the nature Of the problem has a great deal to do with group performance.",
        "One type of problem that we used is the human relations case as developed by Bales.",
        "These are medium complex, unsettled problems that have no specific \"correct\" answer.",
        "The second type was a \"scientific\" ranking problem (requiring no specific expertise), which has a single correct solution plus measurable degrees of how nearly correct a group's answer may be.",
        "The ranking problem, \"Lost in the Arctic\", was adapted for administration over a conferencing system by permission of its originators (See Eady and Lafferty).",
        "The experiments thus had a 2 x 2 factorial design (see figure one).",
        "The factors were mode of communication (face-to-face vs. computerized conference) and problem type (human relations vs. a more \"scientific\" ranking problem with a correct answer).",
        "These factors constituted the \"independent variables.\"",
        "Each problem-mode condition included a total of eight groups."

      "text": [
        "Working at the Laboratory of Social Relations at Harvard, Bales and his colleagues developed a set of categories and procedures for coding the interaction in small face-to-face decision-making groups which became very widely utilized and generated a great deal of data about the nature of communication and social processes within such groups.",
        "Coding of the communications interaction by Interaction Process Analysis involves noting who makes a statement or non-verbal participation (such as nodding agreement); to whom the action was addressed; and into which of twelve categories the action best fits.",
        "These categories are listed in subsequent tables and explained below.",
        "The distribution of communications units among the twelve categories constituted one of the main dependent variables for this experiment.",
        "We expected significant differences associated with mode of communication.",
        "We also expected some differences associated with task type.",
        "We did not feel that we had enough information to predict the directions of these differences.",
        "For almost every category, we could think of some arguments that would lead to a prediction that the category would be \"higher\" in CC, and some reasons why it might be lower.",
        "M2THOD The number of Bales units per face to face group was much greater than the number for a cc group.",
        "Therefore, each individual and group was transformed to a percentage distribution among the twelve categories.",
        "Then statistical tests were performed to determine if there were any significant differences in IPA distributions associated with mode of communication, probblem, order of problem, and the interaction among these variables in relation to the percentage distribution for each of the Bales categories.",
        "There are many different ways in which the percentages could be computed.",
        "To take full advantage of the design, we computed the percentage distribution for each individual, in each condition.",
        "Thus, we actnally have the Bales distributions for each of 80 individuals in a face to face conference, and in a computerized conference.",
        "The mode of analysis was a two by two factorial nested design.",
        "If there was no significant group effect, then the error terms could be \"pooled\", meaning we could use the 80 observations as independent observations for statistical test purposes.",
        "We also performed a non-parametric test on the data.",
        "for each Bales category, which gave us similar results."

        "Two of the detailed analysis of variance tables on which the summary here is based are included as an Appendix.",
        "Note that the analyses were first performed separately for the two problems, using communication mode as the independent variable.",
        "For each problem, we tested the significance of mode of communication, order (whether it was the first or second problem solved by the group), and the interaction between mode and order.",
        "Listed in figures two and three is a summary of the statistical results of the 24 analyses of variance which examined observed differences between communication modes for each of the two tasks.",
        "The first two columns show the mean percentage of communications in each category.",
        "For example, in the first table, results for Forest Ranger, the first column shows that on the average less than 1% of an individual's communications were verbally \"showing solidarity\", but in CC, 3.22% fell into this category.",
        "The third column shows that the results for the 16 groups in the nested factorial design were significant at the .005 level, meaning that the probability of the observed differences oc-curing by chance in a sample this size is one in 200.",
        "The fourth column shows the level of significance if the group was not a significant variable and the observations could be pooled, with the 80 individuals treated as independent observations.",
        "In this case, group was significant, so the pooled analysis could not be done.",
        "In looking at these data, there is an apparent coding problem.",
        "Even for the Forest Ranger problem, face to face, we obtained a somewhat different distribution of coding than did persons coding problem discussions such as this who were directly trained by Bales.",
        "(See Bales and Borgatta, 1955, P. 400 for the complete c.'qtributions).",
        "Our coding has 20% more of the statemtats classified as \"giving opinions\" than Bales and Borgatta code, and correspondingly lower percentages in all of the other categories.",
        "This means that our results cannot be directly compared to those of other investigators, since apparently the training for coding interpreted many more statements as representing some sort of analysis or opinion than \"should\" be there, according to the distributions obtained for similar studies by Bales and his colleagues.",
        "(Other possible explanations are that Upsala College has produced an unusually opinionated and analytic set of students or that the effect of pre-experimental training in cc raises opinion giving even in subsequent FtF discussions.)",
        "It does not affect the comparisons among problems and modes for this study, since all of the coders were coding the data with the same guidelines and interpretations.",
        "In the majority of cases, the same pair of coders coded both the CC and FtF condition for the same group.",
        "In any case, the seven individuals who did the coding had been trained to an acceptable level of reliability."

        "The twelve categories in Bales Interaction Process Analysis can be combined into four main functional areas.",
        "Categories 1-3 and 10-12 are the \"social-emotional\" functions, oriented towards internal group process.",
        "The first three are called \"social-emotional positive\", while 10-12 are \"negative\".",
        "Categories 7-9 are \"Task oriented\", giving answers or contributions to solving the problem faced by the group, and categories 4-6 are varieties of \"asking questions\" in the task oriented area.",
        "It will be noted, by way of further introduction, that there are some very strong differences in the profiles, even in the same medium, depending upon the type of task faced by the group, and that there is some interaction between task type and medium.",
        "For example, more tension was shown in the arctic problem in the CC condition; more in the Forest Ranger problem in the FTF condition.",
        "We will take each of the categories, deL.cribing more fully what is included in them, and then discuss the extent to which there appear to be significant differences between the media in the relative prevalence of communications of that type.",

        "1.",
        "\"Shows solidarity, raises other's status, gives help, reward\"",
        "Included in this category are initial and responsive acts of active solidarity and affection, such as saying \"hello\" and making friendly or congenial remarks to \"break the ice\"; praising or encouraging the other(s); giving support or sympathy or offers of assistance; urging harmony and cooperation.",
        "These are all overt attempts to improve the solidarity of the group.",
        "Note that there is a significantly greater amount of \"showing solidarity\" in computerized conferencing.",
        "This is probably because much of the behavior of this type in a face to face situation is non-verbal, such as smiling in a friendly manner while nodding encouragement.",
        "Non verbal acts in this category are not codable from the tapes of the discussions.",
        "In the CC condition, however, the participants realize that they must put such things into words.",
        "Another possible explanation is that the greater tendency towards overt, explicit showing of solidarity is an attempt to compensate for the perceived coldness and impersonality of the medium.",
        "2.",
        "\"Shows Tension Release, jokes, laughs, shows satis-faction\"",
        "This includes expressions of pleasure or happiness, making friendly jokes or kidding remarks, laughing.",
        "There was significantly more tension release overtly expressed in the face to face groups.",
        "Much of this was waves of laughter, particularly in the arctic problem.",
        "The participants did not put this into words in the conference when typing.",
        "Observing them, however, there was much private laughter and verbal expressions showing \"tension release\", but these do not appear in the transcript.",
        "It is part of the private \"letting down of face\" that occurs but is not communicated through the computer.",
        "3.",
        "\"Agrees, shows passive acceptance, understands, concurs, complies\" This occurs as concurrence in a proposed course of action or carrying out of any activity which has been requested by others.",
        "There is significantly more agreement overtly expressed in face to face conferences than in computerized conferences.",
        "We suspect that this is related to the pressure to conform created by non-verbal behavior and the physical presence of the other group members.",

        "\"Asks for orientation, information, repetition and confirmation\" There is a significant tendency for this to occur more often in face to face discussions.",
