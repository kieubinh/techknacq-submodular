        "We have developed an approach to natural language processing in which the natural language processor is viewed as a knowledge-based system whose knowledge is about the meanings of the utterances of its language.",
        "The approach is oriented around the phrase rather than the word as the basic unit.",
        "We believe that this paradigm for language processing not only extends the capabilities of other natural language systems, but handles those tasks that previous systems could perform in a more systematic and extensible manner.",
        "We have constructed a natural language analysis program called PHRAN (PHRasal ANalyzer) based in this approach.",
        "This model has a number of advantages over existing systems, including the ability to understand a wider variety of language utterances, increased processing speed in some cases, a clear separation of control structure from data structure, a knowledge base that could be shared by a language production mechanism, greater ease of extensibility, and the ability to store some useful forms of knowledge that cannot readily be added to other systems."

        "The problem of constructing a natural language processing system may be viewed as a problem of constructing a knowledge-based system.",
        "From this orientation, the questions to ask are the following: What sort of knowledge does a system need about a language in order to understand the meaning of an utterance or to produce an utterance in that language?",
        "How can this knowledge about one's language best be represented, organized and utilized?",
        "Can these tasks be achieved so that the resulting system is easy to add to and modify?",
        "Moreover, can the system be made to emulate a human language user?",
        "Existing natural language processing systems vary considerably in the kinds of knowledge about language they possess, as well as in how this knowledge is represented, organized and utilized.",
        "However, most of these systems are based on ideas about language that do not come to grips with the fact that a natural language processor needs a great deal of knowledge about the meaning of its language's utterances.",
        "Part of the problem is that most current natural language systems assume that the meaning of a natural language utterance can be computed as a function of the constituents of the utterance.",
        "The basic constituents of utterances are assumed to be words, and all the knowledge the system has about the semantics of its language is stored at thy word level (Virnbaum et al., 1979) (Riesbeck et al., 1075) (Wilks.",
        "1973) (Woods, 1970).",
        "However, many natural language utterances have interpretations that cannot be found by examining their components.",
        "Idioms, canned phrases, lexical collocations, and structural formulas are instances of large classes of language utterances whose interpretation require knowledge about the entire phrase independent of its individual words (Becker, 1975) (Mitchell, 1971).",
        "We propose as an alternative a model of language use that comes from viewing language processing systems as knowledge-based systems that require the representation and organization of large amounts of knowledge about what the utterances of a language mean.",
        "This model has the following properties:",
        "1.",
        "It has knowledge about the meaning of the words of the language, but in addition, much of the system's knowledge is about the meaning of larger forms of utterances.",
        "2.",
        "This knowledge is stored in the form of pattern-concept pairs.",
        "A pattern is a phrasal",
        "construct ox varying degrees of specificity.",
        "A concept is a notation that represents the meaning of the phrase.",
        "Together, this pair associates different forms of utterances with their meanings.",
        "3.",
        "The knowledge about language contained in the system is kept separate from the processing strategies that apply this knowledge to the understanding and production tasks.",
        "4.",
        "The understanding component matches incoming utterances against known patterns, and then uses the concepts associated with the matched patterns to represent the utterance's meaning.",
        "5.",
        "The production component expresses itself by looking for concepts in the data base that match the concept it wishes to express.",
        "The phrasal patterns associated with these concepts are used to generate the natural language utterance.",
        "6.",
        "The database of pattern-concept pairs is shared by both the understanding mechanism and the mechanism of language production.",
        "7.",
        "Other associations besides meanings may be kept along with a phrase.",
        "For example, a description of the contexts in which the phrase is an appropriate way to express its meaning may be stored.",
        "A person or situation strongly associated with the phrase may also be tied to it.",
        "PHRAN (PHRasal ANalyzer) is a natural language understanding system based on this view of language use.",
        "PHRAN reads English text and produces structures that represent its meaning.",
        "As it reads an utterance, PHRAN searches its knowledge base of pattern-concept pairs for patterns that best interpret the text.",
        "The concept portion of these pairs is then used to produce the meaning representation for the utterance.",
        "PHRAN has a number of advantages over previous systems: 1.",
        "The system is able to handle phrasal language units that are awkwardly handled by previous systems but which are found with great frequency in ordinary speech and common natural language texts.",
        "2.",
        "It is simpler to add new information to the system because control and representation are kept separate.",
        "To extend the system, new pattern-concept pairs are simply added to the database.",
        "3.",
        "The knowledge base used by PHRAN is declarative, and is in principle sharable by a system for language production (Such a mechanism is now under construction).",
        "Thus adding information to the base should extend the capabilities of both mechanisms.",
        "4.",
        "Because associations other than meanings can be stored along with phrasal units, the",
        "identification of a phrase can provide contextual clues not otherwise available to subsequent processing mechanisms.",

        "When a noun-phrase is followed by the verb 'to be followed by the perfective form of some verb, the routine instructs PHRAN to consider the passive uses of the last verb.",
        "The phrasal pattern that will recognize the expression 'by and large is found at the node reached only after seeing those three words consecutively.",
        "In this manner this pattern will be suggested only when neccessary.",
        "The main problem with this scheme is that it does not lend itself well to allowing contextual cues to influence the choice of patterns FRAN should try.",
        "This is one area where future research will be concentrated.",
        "5.0 COMPARISON TO OTHER SYSTEMS There are a number of other natural language processing systems that either use some notion of patterns or produce meaning structures as output.",
        "We contrast PHRAN with some of these.",
        "An example of a natural language understanding system that produces declarative meaning representations is Riesbeck's conceptual analyzer (Riesbeck, 1974).",
        "Riesbeck's system (and the various systems that have descended from it) works by attaching routines to individual words.",
        "These routines are generally responsible for building pieces of a meaning representation.",
        "When a word is reed by the system, the routines associated with that word are used to build up a meaning structure that eventually denotes the meaning of the entire utterance.",
        "While our aims are much in the spirit of Riesbeck's analyzer, we believe there are both practical and theoretical difficulties inherent in his approach.",
        "For example, in Riesbeck's conceptual analyzer, specific understanding routines are needed for each word known to the system.",
        "Thus extending the system's vocabulary requires the creation and debugging of new code.",
        "In addition, these routines function only in the understanding process.",
        "The knowledge they embody is inaccessible to other mechanisms, in particular, to production procedures.",
        "Moreover, because Riesbeck's approach is word-oriented, it is difficult to incorporate phrasal structures into his model.",
        "Some word of the phrase must have a routine associated with it that checks for that phrase.",
        "At best, this implementation is awkward.",
        "One of the earliest langusge understanding systems to incorporate phrasal patterns is Colby 's PARRY.",
        "PARRY is a simulation of a paranoid mental patient that contains a natural languege front end (Parkinson et a), 1077).",
        "It receives a senten as input and analyzes it in several separate \"stages' .",
        "In effect, PARRY replaces the input with sentences of successively simpler form.",
        "In the simplified sentence PARRY searches for patterns, of which there are two basic types: patterns used to interpret the whole eentence, and those used only to interpret parts of it (relative clauses, for example).",
        "For PARRY, the purpose of the natural language analyzer is only to translate the input into a simplified form that a model of a paranoid person may use to determine an appropriate response.",
        "No attempt is made to model the anelyzer itself after a human language user, as we are doing, nor are claims made to this effect.",
        "A system attempting to model human language analysis could not permit several unrelated passes, the use of a transition network grammar to interpret only certain sub-strings in the input, or a rule permitting it to simply ignore parts of the input.",
        "This theoretical shortcoming of PARRY - having separate grammar rules for the complete sentence and for sub-parts o it - is shared by Hendrix's LIFER (Hendrix, 1077).",
        "LIFER is designed to enable a database to be queried using a subset of the English languege.",
        "As is the cape for PARRY, the natural language analysis done by LIFER is not meant to model humans.",
        "Rather, its function is to translate the input into instructions and produce a reply as efficiently as poesible, and nothing resembling a representation of tne meaning of the input is ever iormed.",
        "course.",
        "the purpose of LIFER is not to be the .",
        ".",
        "front end of a system that understands coherent texts and which must therefore perform subsequent inference processes.",
        "While LIFER provides a workable solution to the nature] language problem in a limited context, many general problems of language analysis are not addressed in that context.",
        "SOPHIE (Burton, 1976) was designed to assist students in learning about simple electronic circuits.",
        "It can conduct a dialogue with the user in a restricted subset of the English language, and it uses knowledge about patterns of speech to interpret the input.",
        "SOPHIE accepts only certain questions and instructions concerning a few tasks.",
        "As is the case with LITER, the language utterances acceptable to the system are",
        "restricted to such an extent that many natural language processing problems need not be dealt with and other problems have solutions appropriate only to this context.",
        "In addition, SOPHIE does not produce any representation of the meaning of the input, and it makes more than one pass on the input ignoring unknown words, practices that have already been criticized.",
        "The augmented finite state transition network (ATM) has been used by a number of researchers to aid in the analysis of natural language sentences for example, see Woods 1970).",
        "However, most systems that use ATM's incorporate one feature which we find objectionable on both theoretical and practical grounds.",
        "This is the separation of analysis into syntactic and semantic phases.",
        "The efficacy and psychological validity of the separation of syntactic and semantic processing has been argued at length elsewhere (see Scha 1975 for example).",
        "In addition, most ATN based systems for oxample Woods' LUNAR program) do not produce representations, but rather, run queries of a data base.",
        "In contrast to the systems just described, Wilks' English-French machine ranslator does not share several of their shortcomings Wilks, 1973).",
        "It produces a representation of the meaning of an utterance, and it attempts to deal with unrestricted natural language.",
        "The main difference between Wilk's system and system we describe is that Wilks' patterns are matched against concepts mentioned in a sentence.",
        "To recognize these concepts he attaches representations to words in a dictionary.",
        "The problem is that this presupposes that there is a simple correspondence between the form of a concept and the form of a language utterance.",
        "However, it is the fact that this correspondence is not simple that leads to the difficulties we are addressing in our work.",
        "In fact, since the correspondence of words to meanings is complex, it would appear that a program like Wilks' translator will eventually need the kind of knowledge embodied in PHRAN to complete its analysis.",
        "One recent attempt at natural language analysis that radically departs from pattern-based approaches is Rieger and Small's system (Small, 1978).",
        "This system uses word experts rather than patterns as its basic mechann1F7 'ineir system acknowledges the enormity of the knowledge base required for language understanding, and proposes a way of addressing the relevant issues.",
        "However, the idea of putting as much information as possible under individual words is about as far from our conception of language analysis as one can get, and we would argue, would exemplify all the problems we have described in word-based systems."
