        "The capacity of sophisticated modern computers to manipulate and display symbols offers remarkable opportunities for natural language communication among people.",
        "Text editing systems are used to generate business or personal letters, scientific research papers, newspaper articles, or other textual data.",
        "Newer word processing, electronic mail, and computer teleconferencing systems are used to format, distribute, and share textual data.",
        "Traditional record keeping systems for payroll, credit verification, inventory, medical services, insurance, or student grades contain natural language/textual data.",
        "In these cases the computer is used as a communication medium between humans, which may involve intermediate stages where the computer is used as a tool for data manipulation.",
        "Humans enter the data in natural language form or with codes which represent pieces of text (part number instead of a description, course number instead of a title, etc.).",
        "The computer is used to store the data in an internal form incomprehensible to most humans, to make updates or transformations, and to output it in a form which humans can read easily.",
        "These systems should act in a comprehensible \"tool-like\" manner in which system responses satisfy user expectations.",
        "Several researchers have commented on the importance of letting the user be in control [1], avoiding acausality [2], promoting the personal worth of the individual [3], and providing predictable behavior [4].",
        "Practitioners have understood this principle as well: Jerome Ginsburg of the Equitable Life Assurance Society prepared an in-house set of guidelines which contained this powerful claim: 'Nothing can contribute more to satisfactory system performance than the conviction on the part of the terminal operators that they are in control of the system and not the system in control of them.",
        "Equally, nothing can be more damaging to satisfactory system operation, regardless of how well all other aspects of the implementation have been handled, than the operator's conviction that the terminal and thus the system are in control, have 'a mind of their own,' or are tugging against rather than observing the operator's wishes.\" I believe that control over system function and predictable behavior promote the personal worth of the user, provide satisfaction, encourage competence, and stimulate confidence.",
        "Many successful systems adhere to these principles and offer terminal operators a useful tool or an effective communication media.",
        "An idea which has attracted researchers is to have the computer take coded information (medical lab test values or check marks on medical history forms) and generate a natural language report which is easy to read, and which contains interpretations or suggestions for treatment.",
        "When the report is merely a simple textual replacement of the coded data, the system may be accepted by users, although the compact form of the coded data may still be preferable for frequent users.",
        "When the suggestions for treatment replace a human decision, the hazy boundary between computer as tool and computer as physician is crossed.",
        "Other researchers are more direct in their attempt to create systems which simulate human behavior.",
        "These researchers may construct natural language front ends to their systems allowing terminal operators to use their own language for operating the computer.",
        "These researchers argue that most terminal operators prefer natural language because they are already familiar with it, and that it gives the terminal operator the greatest power and flexibility.",
        "After all, they argue, computers should be easy to use with no learning and computers should be designed to participate in dialogs using natural language.",
        "These sophisticated systems may use the natural language front ends for question-answering from databases, medical diagnosis, computer-assisted instruction, psychotherapy, complex decision making, or automatic programming."

        "When computer systems leave users with the impression that the computer is thinking, making a decision, representing knowledge, maintaining beliefs, or understanding information I begin to worry about the future of computer science.",
        "I believe that it is counterproductive to work on systems which present the illusion that they are reproducing human capacities.",
        "Such an approach can limit the researcher's scope of thinking, may yield an inappropriately complex system, and potentially exaggerates the already present fear of computers in the general population.",
        "2.1 NATURAL LANGUAGE LIMITS THE RESEARCHER'S SCOPE In constructing computer systems which mimic rather than serve people, the developer may miss opportunities for applying the unique and powerful features of a computer: extreme speed, capacity to repeat tedious operations accurately, virtually unlimited storage for data, and distinctive input/output devices.",
        "Although the slaw rate of human speech makes menu selection impractical, high speed computer displays make menu selection an appealing alternative.",
        "Joysticks, lightpens or the \"mouse\" are extremely rapid and accurate ways of selecting and moving graphic symbols or text an a display screen.",
        "Taking advantage of these and other OPtputer-specific techniques will enable designers to create powerful tools without natural language commands.",
        "Building computer systems which behave like people do, is like building a plane to fly by flapping its wings.",
        "Once we get past the primitive imitation stage and understand the scientific basis of this new technology (more on how to do this later), the human imitation strategies will be merely museum pieces for the 21st century, joining the clockwork human imitations of the 18th century.",
        "Sooner or Later we will have to accept the idea that computers are merely tools with no more intelligence than a wooden pencil, If researchers can free themselves of the human imitation game and begin to think about using computers for problem solving in novel ways, I believe that there will be an outpouring of dramatic innovation."

        "Constructing computer systems which present the illusion of human capacities may yield inappropriately complex systems.",
        "Natural language interaction with the tedious clarification dialog seems archaic and ponderous when compared with rapid, concise, 'and precise database manipulation facilities such as Query-by-example or commercial word processing systems.",
        "It's hard to understand why natural language systems seem appealing when contrasted with modern interactive mechanisms like high speed menu selection, light pen movement of icons, or special purpose interfaces which allow the user to directly manipulate their reality.",
        "Natural language systems must be complex enough to cope with user actions stemming from a poor definition of system capabilities.",
        "Some users may have unrealistic expectations of what the computers can or should do.",
        "Rather than asking precise questions from a database system, a user may be tempted to ask how to improve profits, whether a defendant is guilty, or whether a military action should be taken.",
        "These questions involve complex ideas, value judgments, and human responsibility for which computers cannot and should not be relied upon in decision making.",
        "Secondly, users may waste time and effort in querying the database about data which is not contained in the system.",
        "Codd [5] experienced this problem in his RENDEZVOUS system and labeled it \"semantic overshoot.\" In command systems the user may spend, excessive time in trying to determine if the system supports the operations they have in mind.",
        "Thirdly, the ambiguity of natural language does not facilitate the formation of questions or commands.",
        "A precise and concise notation may actually help the user in thinking of relevant questions or effective commands.",
        "A small number of well defined operators may be more useful than ill-formed natural language statements, especially to novices.",
        "The ambiguity of natural language may also interfere with careful thinking about the data stored in the machine.",
        "An understanding of onto/into mappings, one-to-one/one-to-many/many-to-many relationships, set theory, boolean algebra, or predicate calculus and the proper notation may be of great assistance in formulating queries.",
        "Mathematicians (and musicians, chemists, knitters, etc.)",
        "have long relied on precise concise notations because they help in problem solving and human-to-human communication.",
        "Indeed, the syntax of precise concise query or command language may provide the cues for the semantics of intended operations.",
        "This dependence on syntax is strongest for naive users who can anchor novel semantic concepts to the syntax presented."

        "One more note of concern before making some positive and constructive suggestions.",

        "This approach can reveal mistaken assumptions, demonstrate generality, show the relative strengthof effects, and provide evilence for a theory of human behavior which may suggest new research.",
        "A natural strategy for evaluating the effectiveness of natural language facilities would be to define a task, such as retrieval of ship convoy information or solution of a computational problem, then provide subjects with either a natural language facility or an alternative mode such as a query language, simple programming language, set of commands, menu selection, etc.",
        "Training provided with the natural language system or the alternative would be a critical issue, itself the subject of study.",
        "Subjects would perform the task and be evaluated on the basis of accuracy or speed.",
        "In my own experience, I prefer to provide a fixed time interval and measure performance.",

        "At the same time there should be a careful analysis of how the computer system can provide assistance by representing and displaying data in a useful format, providing guidance in choosing alternative strategies, offering effective messages at each stage (feedback on failures and successes), recording the history and current status of the problem solving process, and giving the user comprehensible and powerful commands.",
