        "The need to identify an action is obvious in utterances containing verbs like \"do\", \"have\", and \"use\", as in \"I've done it\", \"what tool should I use?\", or \"I",
        "have it\".",
        "In these utterances the verb does not name the action, but rather refers to it more generally, much as pronouns or \"nonspecific\" nouns (e.g., \"thing\") refer to objects.",
        "Even when more specific verbs are used, complex reasoning may be required to ascertain the particular action being referred to.",
        "For example, the utterance \"I've glued the pieces together\" can refer to different steps in a task â€“ depending on what objects \"the pieces\" refers to, because each gluing action is a different step.",
        "Similarly, the verb \"cut\" refers to different types of cutting actions when used with different objects, as in \"cut grass\", \"cut wood\", or \"cut cake\" (Searle, 1978).",
        "A variant of this problem is deciding whether a verb is intended to refer to a general or a specific action.",
        "For example, \"cutting wood\" can refer to the general activity of cutting many pieces of wood or it can refer to the action of cutting a particular piece.",

        "Knowledge about actions and events includes both general knowledge about possible actions and events and more specific knowledge about those that occur during a particular task.",
        "We have developed a formalism, process models, for encoding information about actions (Grosz et al., 1977).",
        "This formalism enables the specification of a hierarchical decomposition of actions into subactions, as well as the description of individual types of actions.",
        "It is an extension of the network formalism used for representing other knowledge about objects and relationships, as described by Hendrix (1979).",
        "The description of each action type includes information about its participating actors and objects, the preconditions for its enactment, its effects, and the alternative sequences of substeps that may be followed to accomplish it.",

        "The plot steps have many of the same participants as the main action.",
        "In addition the second plot step, \"secure with bolts\", introduces another set of participants, BOLTS, indicated by the FASTENER arc.",
        "During a task, a record of progress is kept by filling in, or instantiating, the schema for an action as that action is performed and then incorporating the newly created piece of network into the model of the current situation.",
        "Records of actions are linked both temporally by a time lattice and through their taxonomic relationships with other events and objects in the task.",

        "The action of locating bolts represented by node 4 is not an explicit step in the task, but is necessary for its performance.",
        "Node 4 has an associated knowledge-state goal: \"know the location of the bolts\".",
        "All these goals have associated actions that, in the process model formalism, are specific instantiations of actions, not action schemata.",

        "In the context of the task steps shown in Figure 2, \"I am attaching the pump\" states that an attaching action (node 1), is being performed.",
        "This establishes the direct domain goal that the pump be attached.",
        "\"Should I tighten the bolts?\" indicates that the tightening action (node 3) might be performed, establishing the potential domain goal that the bolts be tight.",
        "A direct knowledge-state goal can be established, for example, by the utterance \"where are the bolts?\", which establishes the knowledge-state goal \"know the location of the bolts\" (node 4).",
        "A potential knowledge-state goal would be established by an utterance such as \"I'd like to read more Plato\" which implies the potential knowledge-state goal of knowing more about the philosophy of Plato.",
        "Direct and potential goals are distinguished from one another because of the different roles they play in the interpretation of verbs.",

        "In the TDUS system, a potential goal can be introduced either by the apprentice who is performing the task or by the system which is acting as an expert advisor.",
        "These goals can be introduced in at least three different ways.",
        "(1) The apprentice can introduce a potential goal by mentioning a possible future action, while not explicitly stating that it will be performed.",
        "This distinguishes between \"I am going to take the lid off now\" and \"should I take the lid off now?\" The former expresses a direct goal because the speaker explicitly says s/he is planning to perform the action.",
