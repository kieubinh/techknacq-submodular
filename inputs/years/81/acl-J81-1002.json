        "For example, there are large simulation programs that get into very complicated states we would like to be able to understand easily.",
        "There are data base systems with complex knowledge buried in them, but real problems in extracting it.",
        "There are status-keeping systems from which we would like to get snapshots.",

        "The circumstances that make it particularly attractive to deliver this knowledge in natural language are: a) complexity of the source knowledge, so that its notation is not easily learned, b) unpredictability of the demands for knowledge, so that the actual demands cannot be met with specific preprogrammed output, and c) the need to serve a large pool of untrained or lightly trained users of these systems.",
        "For a number of the kinds of systems mentioned above, getting the information out is one of the principal limitations on the systems' uses.",
        "If the information could be accessed more easily, then far more people could use the systems.",
        "So we are talking in part about facilitating existing systems, but much more about creating new opportunities for systems to serve people.",
        "If computer systems could express themselves in fluent natural language, many of these difficulties would disappear.",
        "However, the necessary processes for such expression do not exist, and there are formidable obstacles even to designing such processes.",
        "The theory of writing is sketchy and vague, and there are few interesting computer systems to serve as precedents.",
        "Any research effort to create such systems systems that know how to write â€“ can be significant both in its practical implications and for the knowledge of writing that it produces.",

        "Of course, in a limited sense, programs already deliver knowledge in natural language by using \"canned text.\" A person writes some text, possibly with the use of blank segments, and the text is stored for use in association with a particular demand.",
        "The machine fills in the blanks as needed in a way anticipated as sufficient for the demand.",
        "This is a very useful technique, but it does not tell us much about the task of writing, and it does not generalize to situations in which the need for text has not been well anticipated in the programming stage.",
        "The basic organization and writing of canned text are done by a person, so that sort of \"writing\" falls outside the scope of this paper.",
        "The idea that natural language would be a useful output medium for a computer system is quite old, but the research to make such output possible is still in a very primitive state.",
        "Most of it has concentrated on sentence generation, in which problems such as word selection or translation to natural language from logical formulas have been chosen for study.",
        "These are important, but the needs for knowledge delivery simply cannot be satisfied by single sentences.",
        "It is necessary to have multiple sentences to communicate complex information, and multiple paragraphs would be even more valuable.",

        "In the future, we expect to see the Fragment-and-Compose paradigm reapplied extensively.",
        "We expect to see goal-pursuing processes applied to text organization and style selection.",
        "We expect distinct processes for aggregating fragments and selecting combinations on a preference basis.",
        "We also expect a well developed model of the reader, including inference capabilities and methods for keeping the model up to date as the text progresses.",
