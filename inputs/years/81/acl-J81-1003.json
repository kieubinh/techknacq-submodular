        "Natural language question answering systems have been the subject of much research over approximately 20 years.",
        "In only very few cases have such systems been exposed to real users trying to solve real problems, another example perhaps being Krause (1979).",
        "In an attempt to see if a useful natural language query system could be built for an application which existed independently of the research program, an approach was made to the Planning Department of the City of White Plains asking them to take part in such an experiment.",
        "Their incentive was the free use of an interactive query facility which would allow them to explore their data base more freely than the batch computer facility run by the city could do.",
        "The remainder of the paper describes the user environment, describes the operation of the TQA system, and discusses the operating results in the first year of operation, 1978."

        "When the experiment was first being discussed, the Planning Department had five professionals plus the services of a consultant more or less constantly available.",
        "The main files used for planning were the parcel file and the geobase file, which had been converted to machine readable form under a grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development.",
        "Department members were very familiar with these files, in many instances knowing the correspondence between codes in the file and their English equivalents.",
        "The parcel file contained a record for each parcel of land in the city, approximately 10,000 of them, which had a taxable existence.",
        "Each record contained the account number, the block, the owner, the address, land use information, number of dwelling units, area, taxes, and the like.",
        "The geobase file contained a record for each city block, telling what census tract it was in, what traffic zone, what neighborhood association, etc.",
        "Selected summaries of these files had been prepared by the City's computing center, and the files themselves had been printed in a couple of large volumes.",
        "Ad hoc queries required special programs to be written by the computing center, with sufficient delay that this was seldom done.",
        "Thus, we were told that during the 1974 gasoline shortage, the parcel file was searched by hand on the land use code field to find the locations of all the gas stations so that police could be routed there to direct traffic.",
        "Other uses of the files are apparent from inspection of the questions asked of the system, a sample of which are given in Figure 1.",
        "Although the terminal was located in an open area available to all members of the department, it turned out that most of the questions were asked by one of the department members, who had been designated as our liaison.",
        "The reason for this was never clear, but may have simply been normal reluctance to experiment with radically new technology on the part of the older members of the department.",

        "During the course of the experiment, a new planning director was appointed, who changed the mission of the department somewhat.",

        "An experimental application using business statistics had been quite satisfying.",
        "For the White Plains application, major additions were made to the lexicon, new grammar rules extending coverage were written, a new component for interfacing the grammar and a data base was developed, and an interface was built to an existing data base management system, the RSS.",
        "The system was installed in White Plains late in 1977 for final debugging, and turned over to the planners at the beginning of 1978.",
        "It was disconnected at the end of 1979 partly for legal reasons and partly because we felt little new could be learned by leaving it there.",
        "A generalized flow diagram of the TQA system is given in Figure 2, and an example of processing in Figures 3a-g.",
        "The structures printed in Figure 3a are a bracketed terminal string representation of structures which are stored and manipulated as trees by the processing programs.",

        "Many of the feature names should be obvious, but, e.g., PL stands for The recognizer attempts to find an underlying \"place\", PAG for parcel aggregate, i.e., an aggregate structure for each surface tree (Plath 1973, 1976).",
        "of separate parcels, and CINS for \"cardinal insertion', Typically, only one of a set of surface trees will result i.e., can be followed by a cardinal number.",

        "In the example, the struc",
        "ture in which the prepositional phrase was attached to \"gas station\" survives.",
        "The underlying structures are similar to those proposed under the variant of transformational grammar called generative semantics.",
        "This is not the place to defend that particular theory or its use on the TQA system; suffice it to say that a considerable body of grammatical work on English has been done in a style compatible with this theory.",
        "To simplify, every S in the underlying structure has a predicate and some number of noun phrase arguments.",
        "The noun phrases may dominate imbedded S's.",
        "In the example, the top level predicate is LOCATED with arguments of \"gas station\" and \"some place\".",
        "The NP for \"gas station\" dominates an S which also has a main predicate of LOCATED and arguments of \"X4\", i.e., the same index as that for \"gas station\", and \"traffic zone 579\", i.e., the gas station located in traffic zone 579.",
        "Notice that the parser has supplied both",
        "instances of \"located\".",
        "A fuller explanation is given in Plath (1973, 1976).",
        "The data base has no predicate, i.e., column heading, named \"located\".",
        "Even if it did, the two LO-CATEDs in the underlying structures are different, one for address and one for traffic zone.",
        "The underlying structure is designed to reflect the linguistic structure of the query, but, as in this case, that structure",
        "may not match a particular data base organization.",
        "There are many approaches one could take to make this match.",
        "We have chosen to implement the matching function as a separate transformational component in the grammar (Damerau 1977).",
        "The underlying structure itself is therefore input to the transformational recognizer, using a (small) set of grammar rules tailored to a specific data base and produces a query structure.",
        "Query structures are similar to underlying structures in form, but reflect the particular meaning",
        "constraints resulting from the format and content of a given data base.",
        "In Figure 3g, one can see that the first instance of LOCATED has been changed to the",
        "predicate ADDRESS and the second instance to the predicate TRAFFIC ZONE.",
        "The query structure tree is processed by a Knuth-style semantic interpreter (Petrick 1977), producing a logical form.",
        "A logical form can best be thought of, in our context, as a retrieval expression which is to be evaluated, producing an answer to the English input query.",
        "Referring to Figure 3a, the logical form can be read as: Find the set of things X11 such that for at least 1 of the things X63 in the set of things X4 where the traffic zone of X4 is 579 and the LUC (land use code) is 0553, (viz., the set of account numbers having both these properties), the address of X63 is X11.",
        "The process of answer extraction from the data base is accomplished by a combination of LISP and PL/I programs (Damerau 1978), and an experimental relational data base management system called Relational Storage System (RSS) (Astrahan, et al., 1976).",
        "The RSS provides the capability to generate a data base of nary relations, with indexes on any field of the relation, and low-level access commands like OPEN, NEXT, CLOSE, with appropriate parameters, to retrieve information from such a data base.",
        "This particular data base had just one relation of 40 columns.",
        "The LISP programs examine the logical form to establish relationships between variables and to generate requests to the data base component to find items with specified properties.",
        "In the example, one retrieval request would find the qualifying account numbers, i.e., the X4s, and a second request would find the addresses of those account numbers.",
        "Notice that the logical form simply specifies a set of addresses as the answer.",
        "This is clearly unsatisfactory, and the data base interface program supplies the account number for each address as part of the answer.",
        "The long numbers in the answer are the parcel identifiers, (ward-block-lot) referred to above as account numbers and sometimes called lot numbers.",

        "This was not always possible, but a great many changes were incorporated into the system during the course of the year.",
        "An attempt to compensate in part for the effect of this situation on the statistics was made by rerunning all the sentences which failed during the year with the system in use in May, 1979.",

        "In addition, when the computing system failed, this second file was sometimes lost, although the basic log file seldom was.",
        "As a result, the statistics in the tables may be in error by a percentage point or two.",

        "Such words were displayed back, with the option of changing the word entered or entering an entire new question.",
        "PARSING FAILURE means that the system did not reach the point of producing a query structure.",
        "NOTHING IN DATA BASE means that a logical form was generated and a query issued to System/R, but nothing satisfied the query.",
        "This could happen for a variety of reasons, including an erroneous parse, a wrong logical form, a mistake in the program which generated the search request, or a real case of missing data.",
        "Detailed analysis of each case would be required to be sure what proportion fell into each category.",
        "The other categories are more or less self-explanatory.",
        "ABORTED is an indication that query",
        "processing did not reach a normal termination, usually because of a machine failure, i.e., hardware or system software, but sometimes because of a problem in the TQA code.",
        "The USER COMMENTS line comes from a feature we had included in the system in an attempt to collect ongoing user reaction to system behavior.",
        "At the end of each question, before producing the message \"TYPE NEXT QUESTION\", we displayed a request for comment on the preceding question.",
        "It turned out that users found this something of a nuisance, since mostly they were satisfied with the answer, so we made an early change to the terminal read program such that a reply to the prompting message for comments which ended in \"?\" would be treated as a null comment and another question, in effect making the comment optional.",
        "Student users took the prompt somewhat more seriously than the regular employees and made more comments.",
        "The two MESSAGE categories refer to a system facility enabling a user to send messages to the TQA operator and the reverse.",
        "One can see that it is usually used by the TQA operator as a somewhat more convenient means than the telephone for advising a user about the nature of a problem or for warning that the system was to be stopped, and the like.",
        "PROGRAM ERROR is an error in the TQA program which was detected and caused a query to abort but left the system able to accept another input.",

        "This is used when the user realizes he made a mistake or when processing seems to be going on too long.",
        "The category LEXICAL CHOICE indicates how often the system asked the user to clarify the meaning of a word.",

        "This has two primary causes.",
        "In the first place, the planning office was being rebuilt during the period and the work space was often disrupted.",
        "The major cause, as mentioned above, was a reorientation of the planning department activities by a newly appointed director.",
        "The department members now spend the major part of their time on administrative activities; planning activities, like land analyses and drafting of new zoning districts, are now carried out by off-premises consultants who do not have ready access to the terminal.",
        "From the latter part of 1978 through 1979, the system was used only intermittently by the planners, who occasionally needed some of the basic land record data, and by others, like the fire department, who wanted to have a list of tall buildings.",
        "There is an obvious rise in USER COMMENTS, LOOKUP FAILURES, and PARSING FAILURES during June, July, and August.",
        "During this period, the planning department had a number of student interns who were using the system, sometimes in a play mode.",
        "It is easy to understand that new users exploring the system would have more than an ordinary number of parsing failures.",
        "The increase in lookup failures is a little more puzzling, although part of the increase has the same cause, i.e., some of the questions were outside the domain, and consequently the words used were not in the lexicon.",
        "The large percentage for the NOTHING IN DATA BASE category in January comes in large part from two queries which had four underlying structures, all of which resulted in the answer \"NOTHING IN THE DATA BASE.\" This was caused by a problem in the grammar which has since been corrected.",
        "Some of the other instances of this message during the year resulted from an inadvertently, and unfortunately, successful example of subtle user training or conditioning.",
        "We discovered that users tended to respond to the system by echoing, sometimes exactly and sometimes, only partially, what the system had printed to them, no matter if their initial phrasing had been accepted or not.",
        "Some input word sequences are treated as phrases by the strategy of scanning an input query against a phrase lexicon first before looking in the regular lexicon.",
        "An entry like \"gas station\" came out of the phrase lookup represented as \"GAS_STATION\" for purposes of lexical lookup.",
        "The users would sometimes input that, or some variant like \"Gas Station\", which would be taken as a proper name.",
        "The result would then be interpreted as a query having to do with an owner named \"Gas Station\".",
        "We now echo what the user has typed, or some variant which will be acceptable if typed.",
        "Most of the instances of the category NOTHING IN DATA BASE really are the response to a request for information which is not in the data base.",
        "Many of these are requests for information about people who are not owners of property, or about addresses which are not legitimate.",

        "time for string transformations, and transformational processing both typically consume around 4 seconds.",

        "User-caused delays tend to occur when a reply is needed to correct a lookup failure or to resolve an ambiguity, and when the answer to a query requires more than one screen for display.",
        "In the latter case, the display has a built in delay of up to one minute, or can be held indefinitely by depressing a key.",
        "The hold feature is often used for the long displays, because the user is writing down information from the display.",
        "The user is, of course, not concerned with his own delays, but only with the system delay.",
        "In order to keep him informed of progress through the query, and give him assurance that the computer is still operating, a CPU time clock is displayed in the lower right corner of the screen, along with an indication of the processing phase being carried out at that time.",
        "In general, these users did not become concerned with response time, possibly because they had no experience with other interactive computer systems.",
        "However, if the system was slow, a user might well choose to look up a single piece of information in the printed listing of the data base rather than ask through the computer system.",
        "Figure 5 shows that most queries have a one line answer, but that the tail is very long.",
        "Generally speaking, users were interested in totals or averages of data fields like \"dwelling units\" or \"parcel area\" for aggregates of parcels specified by land use, neighborhood, census tract, and the like, often in combination.",
        "Questions of this kind are not readily answered from the printed copies of the parcel file, and specific patterns do not occur often enough to make it worthwhile to ask for a batch program to be written by the City computer staff.",

        "The motivation for publishing this paper with its long appendices was to make it possible for a reader to come to some conclusion of his own regarding the utility of the TQA system or something like it in a real environment.",
        "For reasons mentioned above, none of us thinks this experiment provides a definitive test for our system or even that very strong claims about percent of success can be made.",
        "For such purposes, a controlled experiment using a fixed system is clearly necessary, and we hope to make such a test in the near future.",
        "However, those of us working on the project are encouraged by the results summarized here, and even more by our conversations with the users of the system, who have been very positive.",
        "Within the limitations established by the subset of English that the system can recognize, it appears that non-data processing professionals can extract useful information from their files with almost no training.",
        "A number of the gaps in our system can certainly be plugged if we can find the resources to work on them.",
        "Our next step will be to make the TQA system a front end to an existing formal query language system, probably SQL-based System R, developed at the IBM San Jose Research Laboratory, a version of which has been announced as an IBM Program Product for use under the DOS/VS operating system.",
        "Such a step will permit us to devote all of our resources to the problems of language and knowledge representation, instead of spending part of that effort on data management.",
        "Beyond that, we will consider seriously the question of moving to different environments, both to new situations in the city planning domain and to completely different domains, without having to rewrite all or even a major portion of our base system."
