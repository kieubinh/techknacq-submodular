        "These might be rejected, but as Wilks (1976) stresses, \"... understanding requires, at the very least, ... some attempt to interpret, rather than merely reject, what seem to be ill-formed utterances.\" This paper investigates several language phenomena commonly considered ungrammatical or extra-grammatical and discusses techniques directed at integrating them as much as possible into the conventional framework of grammatical processing performed by NLU systems.",

        "Similar ideas have recently been integrated into the Augmented Phrase Structure Grammar model by Miller, Heidorn, and Jensen (1981).",

        "They may be constructed as needed by special macro arcs or they may be constructed for future use through an expectation mechanism.",
        "As the expectation-based parsing efforts clearly show, syntactic elements, especially words, contain important clues on processing (Riesbeck and Schank, 1976).",
        "Indeed, we also have found it useful to make the ATN mechanism more \"active\" by allowing it to produce new arcs based on such clues.",
        "To achieve this, the CAT, MEM, TST, and WRD arcs have been generalized and four new \"macro\" arcs, known as CAT*, MEM*, TST*, and WRD*, have been added to the ATN formalism.",
        "These are similar in every way to their counterparts, except that as a final action, instead of indicating the state to which the traversal leads, a new arc is constructed dynamically and immediately executed.",
        "The difference in the form that the new arc takes is seen in the following comparison:",
        "In this example, <creat act> is used to define the dynamic arc through the use of BUILDQ and similar structure-building functions, while <term> represents any terminal action (usually a TO action).",
        "Arcs computed by macro arcs can be of any type permitted by the ATN, but one of the most useful arcs to compute in this manner is the pattern arc discussed above.",
        "This allows a prescribed path of arcs to be attempted in processing the sentence.",
        "An example of much of what was just described is the following macro arc:",
        "This WRD* macro arc attempts to find the word AND at the current position of processing the input.",
        "If successful, it computes a pattern arc with the pattern left to be automatically generated upon execution.",
        "While the macro arc forces immediate execution of an arc, arcs may also be computed and temporarily added to the grammar for later execution through the expectation mechanism.",
        "Expectations are performed as actions within arcs (analogous to the HOLD action for parsing structures) or as actions elsewhere in the NLU system, e.g., during generation, when particular types of responses can be foreseen.",
        "Two forms are allowed: (essentially) produce the arc: (EXPECT <creat act> <state>) (EXPECT <creat act>) In the first case, the arc created is bound to a state as specified.",
        "When later processing leads to that state, the expected arc will be attempted as one alternative at that state.",
        "In the second case, where no state is specified, the effect is to attempt the arc at every state visited during the parse.",
        "The range of an expectation produced during parsing is ordinarily limited to a single sentence, with the arc disappearing after it has been used; however, the start state, S/, is reserved for expectations intended to be active at the beginning of the next sentence.",
        "These will disappear in turn at the end of processing for that sentence."

        "As they are presented and implemented, the test and category relaxation methods can be too non-specific in permitting relaxation of these types, since all arcs with the named tests and categories become potentially relaxable.",
        "But, the same function can be used for different purposes.",
        "For example, the function GETR can be used just to retrieve a value for a later test or as a predicate when used as a register containing a true/false flag.",
        "Weischedel and Black (1980) allow for such cases by having each instance of a test individually predicated.",
        "A compromise that would allow more generality to be captured would be to specify some or all of the arguments to the relaxable function when describing the form of relaxable function calls.",

        "The interpreter does prefer to skip as few words as possible; however no preference is given as to where to skip them.",
        "Thus, even if patterns of extraneous words are identified precisely, the word skipping mechanism would simply not be able to allow for them.",
        "One weakness in the pattern arc is the treatment of register settings in optional arcs that are skipped.",
        "Rather than ignoring the use of registers that would have been set in the arc, it would be better to devise a default strategy to force their setting.",
        "It is instructive to compare our conjunction technique to the SYSCONJ facility of Woods (1973).",

        "Here, the ellipsis occurs before, not after, the conjunction.",
        "To utilize techniques in our style on the above examples, it would be necessary to extract the proper pattern from the entire path of traversed arcs.",
        "However, unlike SYSCONJ, our technique can handle the obvious elliptical cases such as gapping, or the tightly constrained cases such as correlatives.",
        "One of our original hopes for this work was that each of the relaxations would be applicable to a broad set of individual grammars.",
        "However, it quickly became obvious that the relaxations and grammar work best if they are developed together.",
        "The test relaxations that depend on the use of the predicates in the grammar are an obvious case in point.",
        "Another example is the case of conjunction arcs, which work best when constituent boundaries in the grammar reflect the structures that can be conjoined.",

        "At the moment, we inspect question forms and add predefined patterns to accept their elliptical answers.",
        "In order to produce these patterns automatically, a theory of question-and-answer dialogue is necessary.",
