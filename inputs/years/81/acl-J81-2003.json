        "The User Specialty Languages (USL) System translates input in natural language German into expressions in the formal language of the data base system associated with USL, accesses the data base with these expressions and transmits the results to the user either directly or after performing additional operations on the output.",
        "The system was developed at the Heidelberg Scientific Center of IBM Germany by H. Lehmann, N. Ott, the students K. Horlander and W. Sauermann, and the author.",
        "USL was designed to provide data base access for user groups whose requirements are not satisfied by standard programs and for whom having special programs written or learning to program themselves would not be feasible.",
        "The system was to be capable of dealing with natural language in a variety of different application contexts and not restricted to a particular field or world.",
        "This purpose determined the methods used and the corresponding limitations of the system.",
        "Within these limits, we have tried in the implementation to incorporate the syntactic constructions to be expected in the context of data base interaction and to provide the correct interpretations for them.",
        "The data base management system is an implementation of the relational model, the Peterlee Relational Test Vehicle (PRTV, Todd, 1975) with its data base language ISBL.",
        "This is the target language of the translation process.",
        "The method of translation is a substantial extension of the methods used in the REL System (Rapidly Extensible Language, Thompson et al., 1969, Dostert et al., 1971).",
        "This system treats natural language much like a formal language in that syntactic constructions and function words are interpreted by the system according to the semantics of the language built into the system, but nouns, verbs, and adjectives are treated as variables of which only the data type – the word class – is known.",
        "The underlying assumption is the following: The meanings of prepositions, dates, verbs like HAVE and BE and syntactic constructions, on the one hand, are independent of the subject matter; on the other hand, nouns, verbs, and adjectives and their meanings vary from application to application.",
        "In the context of a given data base, these words identify the names of relations; their meaning is restricted to the association between word and corresponding relation.",
        "Names and numbers identify values within tuples.",
        "In USL, these words can be added to the system by the user to match the shape of the relations in his data base.",
        "A prompting routine guides the vocabulary definition and makes sure that all information needed by the system is entered.",
        "The advantage of not providing the user with the vocabulary of his application already built into the system is that he is not restricted in his choice of words, and new words can be added easily.",

        "To copy otherwise, or to republish, requires a fee and/or specific permission.",
        "advantage is that the system knows only what has been explicitly defined by the user, and common sense knowledge, e.g. that an employee is a person or that a salary does not own a house, is not reflected in the system and is not used in the interpretation process.",
        "This also means that the interpretation can make only very restricted use of deep case relationships, because the information on deep cases would have to be obtained from the user.",
        "We see no way as yet to elicit this information reliably and consistently, without confusing or boring the user.",
        "When used for an application, then, the system works with two vocabularies, one user-defined, containing the nouns, verbs, and adjectives referring to the data base of his application, the other system-defined, containing prepositions, quantifiers, interrogatives, particles, names of days and months, nouns referring to operations like minimum, maximum, plus, minus, etc., the verbs BE and HAVE, and adjectives like GREATER, MORE, and LESS.",
        "The system-defined words and their meanings to the system are the same for all applications.",
        "The purpose of this paper is to discuss and demonstrate the interpretation of one of these system-defined words: the verb HAVE when used as the main verb of a sentence.",
        "(HAVE as an auxiliary has not been implemented.)",

        "This is followed by a discussion of HAVE in general and possible representations of it in USL.",
        "The solution proposed here and implemented in USL uses the transformational relationship between HAVE-sentences and OF-phrases to represent and search data contained in HAVE-sentences in the relation addressed by the accusative of HAVE.",
        "This interpretation is applied to a list of representative queries and phrases against a small data base as a test of the interpretation and as an illustration of the interpretation process.",

        "Data base and data base language",
        "The system contains about 800 syntactic and 200 lexical (system-defined words) rules.",
        "The rules are mostly context-free, with some context-sensitive and some transformational rules, written in a modified Backus Normal Form (BNF).",
        "Each rule contains the name of an interpretation routine written in PL/1, which performs operations in correspondence to the meaning of the syntactic construction.",
        "The parser and function processor are USAGE (User Application Generator), developed at the IBM Paris Scientific Center, along the principles of Kay (1967), with considerable modifications and extensions.",
        "It works from left to right, bottom-up, through the input string.",
        "The input is tested against the rules, and rules are applied wherever there is a match, lexical rules first.",
        "The result is several disconnected subtrees, which are discarded, and one or more trees spanning the entire input.",
        "Only the full parses are processed further.",
        "Each node in the tree contains the name of the interpretation routine from the grammar rule used in its construction.",
        "The function processor walks down the tree and calls the interpretation routines associated with each node.",
        "In the original concept developed for REL, the interpretation routines were executed on the spot and the result was passed as an input parameter to the next routine.",
        "This procedure proved insufficient for the interpretation of quantifiers, negation, and coordinated structures.",
        "The original concept was changed so that now the interpretation routines do not simply pass on a result, but successively build a structure reflecting semantic dependencies indicated by the syntactic structures, the names of the relations, columns and values taking part in these dependencies, as well as information on syntactic function and scope of individual elements in the tree.",
        "This structure is processed recursively and translated into expressions in the data base language ISBL (cf. Ott, 1979, and Lehmann, 1978, for detail on the interpretation process).",
        "The resulting ISBL strings are passed to the database management system to access the data base and perform the update or retrieval operations requested.",
        "In the simple case, if the answer is a list or table of items, and the question calls for nothing more, the answer is formatted and printed.",
        "For yes/no questions, the return code from the data base is translated to the proper answer.",
        "Questions involving some types of quantification and arithmetic need further processing on the answer.",
        "The data base is relational.",
        "Relations can be thought of as tables with rows and columns.",
        "Noun, verbs, and adjectives refer to relation names; they can be words in the language or words invented for a specific purpose.",
        "Names of columns within relations, so-called role names are standardized in USL.",
        "They correspond to the complements of the nouns, verbs, or adjectives.",

        "But, as we are going to show, the interpretation leads to incorrect results and should be abandoned.",

        "Furthermore, the fact that the items in the third column are names of relationships and not names of individuals is significant in itself.",
        "This leads to the conclusion that HAVE should not be regarded as a primitive predicate at all, but as a derived predicate, derivable just in case some other American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 7, Number 2, April-June 1981 111 Magdalena Zoeppritz The Meaning of OF and HAVE in the USL-System to relationship exists between the individuals in question.",
        "With different aims and from a different point of view, this has already been observed by Bach (1967:476-77): It has often been said that be has no meaning by itself but only in connection with Predicate, the passive construction, and so on.",
        "The same is true of have.",
        "The two forms are distinguished syntactically from most true verbs by the fact that they have no selectional restrictions in themselves, but occur in constructions where the selections reach across from \"subject\" to \"object\" or complement.",
        "Likewise, from a semantic point of view, their contribution to the meaning of the sentence is determined completely by the items that they link.",
        "Conversely, HAVE can only be used meaningfully to link elements where some other relationship determining the nature of that link is expressed or can be inferred.",
        "The vague term \"some other relationship\" needs more clarification than can be given at this time.",
        "It is clear that the relationship must be representable as a two-place predicate, but many such predicates do not serve as the basis for deriving HAVE.",
        "It seems, for instance, that the relations expressed by action verbs do not permit HAVE to be derived directly, though their agent nominalizations often do: John teaches Jack John has Jack o Jack has John John is the teacher of Jack = Jack has John as his teacher The relationships most often associated with HAVE are those of possession and ownership.",
        "That the meaning of HAVE is much wider is commonplace.",
        "(A detailed analysis of the syntactic properties of HAVE and their association with different meanings is found in Pitha 1971 and 1972).",
        "Still, the verbs OWN and POSSESS can be replaced by HAVE without intervening nominalization and the extension of John has a bicycle John owns a bicycle John has a bicycle in his possession seems artificial.",
        "On the other hand, the conclusion: If John has a bicycle, then he owns a bicycle is plausible and often true, but not necessarily so, and will be false with different choices of objects.",
        "In the case of inalienable possession as the objects of HAVE sentences, the conclusion is absurd, so that the objects of HAVE and OWN are taken to refer to different entities (Bierwisch, 1965).",
        "Nevertheless, while it is clearly impossible to restrict the interpretation of HAVE to possession, any other interpretation will face the problem that HAVE is often used as a synonym of OWN or POSSESS (cf. section 6).",
        "This may be the reason why HAVE is often regarded as a primitive for possession (e.g. Langacker, 1975).",
        "There is a transformational relationship between HAVE and OF, already discussed e.g. in Bach (1967): Peter has a daughter Joan Joan is the daughter of Peter But there is a peculiarity: Whereas HAVE can be used with names, as well as with names and common nouns, whereby a relationship is implied if if is not overtly expressed (e.g., We each have our own room, I have A101), OF is rarely used only with names: Peter has A202 ?",
        "(The) A202 of Peter but Peter has a room The room of Peter This seems to show that, unlike HAVE-sentences, OF-phrases are acceptable only where the relationship between individuals is not implied but overtly stated.",
        "There is no base relationship underlying the use of OF, the base relationship is the one preceding OF in the OF-phrase.",
        "Furthermore, OF-phrases seem to be the specific means to express such relationships.",
        "The \"secretary of Peter\" is the individual which is related to Peter via the relationship \"secretary of\".",
        "OF-phrases cannot be expanded in the same way as HAVE-sentences can be expanded by AS-complements to introduce the \"real\" base relationship.",
        "And, because the base relationship is overtly stated, OF-phrases cannot be reversed: ?",
        "(The) Peter of the secretary In this sense, OF-phrases can be considered as being more explicit than the HAVE-sentences into which they can be transformed.",
        "This led to the decision to interpret HAVE sentences in USL as transformations of OF-phrases and consequently to search or store information in HAVE-sentences not in a relation representing the verb, but in the columns with the role-name OF in relations addressed by the nouns in the sentence.",
        "The following uses of OF are not transformational-ly related to HAVE and are excluded here: Helen of Troy piece of chalk distance of 3 miles love of God angel of a nurse the destruction of the city basket (full/out) of wood man of property For the purposes of data base query, some of these constructions with OF do not seem to be necessary.",
        "Measure expressions are desirable, but have not been implemented.",
        "An unsolved problem is how OF-phrases resulting from nominalizations of verbs can be related within the USL framework in a general way to from 112 American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 7, Number 2, April-June 1981 Magdalena Zoeppritz The Meaning of OF and HAVE in the USL-System the verb or to the event referred to.",
        "The remaining uses of OF have a range of meaning similar to HAVE in expressing not only possession and part-of relationships, but also any number of other relationships which, in the case of OF, are explicitly named by the noun preceding OF and, in the case of HAVE, can be inferred from the nouns or occur explicitly in the AS-complement.",
        "All uses where OF is related to HAVE, as well as some of the other uses, can in German also be expressed by genitive attributes (not all are possible in English because of the restricted use of the genitive).",
        "The uses related to HAVE also appear as possessive pronouns.",
        "Genitive attributes, as well as possessive pronouns, are interpreted in the same way as OF-phrases.",
        "An additional selection operation for possessive pronouns is necessary to obtain a match between the individual members of the sets referred to by the possessive and addressed by the head noun of the possessive.",
        "If the transformational relationship between HAVE-sentences and OF-phrases is to be used, and HAVE-sentences access the OF-column of relations (the column with the role name OF), there are still two possibilities: Given the sentence: Which manager has a secretary?",
        "a first interpretation addresses the OF-column of MANAGER and compares the contents of that column with the list of secretaries: \"Is there a manager of somebody, is that somebody a secretary, and if so, who is the manager\": The set of x, such that x is a manager of y and y is a secretary:",
        "This interpretation is valid only where secretaries are managed by the people whose secretary they are, but fails for: Which manager has room 35?",
        "unless the room of the manager is also contained in the OF-column of MANAGER.",
        "In general, this interpretation will work only where everything a manager can have is contained in the OF-column of MANAGER and is therefore not useful as a general solution.",
        "Furthermore, the interpretation is unable to handle correctly sentences like: Which manager has a musician as his secretary?",
        "Which manager has a secretary as his musician?",
        "1 It assigns the following interpretation to both sentences:",
        "though their meaning is clearly different.",

        "searches in the OF-column of the accusative, SECRETARY, for an entry that is also listed in MANAGER: \"Is there a secretary of somebody, is that somebody a manager, and if so, who is it\":",
        "The set of x such that the room of x is 35 and x is a manager: fx I A(x,35) A M(x)} The second solution does not require that everything a manager can have is found in the OF-column of manager.",
        "The selection starts with the relation named by the direct object of HAVE.",
        "In this way it is also guaranteed that the relation specified actually obtains between the respective individuals.",
        "In the example: Which manager has a secretary?",
        "the secretary requested is not just any secretary, but the secretary of this manager, not perhaps a colleague of this manager and the secretary of another.",
        "This interpretation also distinguishes between the two sentences with AS-complements, whereby the complement takes the place of the accusative and the accusative is treated as an apposition to it.",
        "Which manager has a musician as his secretary?",
        "The set of x such that y is secretary of x and y is a musician and x is a manager: Ix I Ey(S(y,x) A M(x) A Mu(y))} Which manager has a secretary as his musician?",
        "The set of x such that y is musician of x and y is a secretary and x is a manager: {x I Ey(Mu(y,x) A M(x) A S(Y))1 The first solution could be used as an escape if the other interpretation does not yield a result, but it leads to multiple interpretations with the same result for relations that are defined as converses of one another.",
        "In other cases, this interpretation leads to.",
        "answers where the answer should be undefined: Which manager has 5000?",
        "(salary, personnel, or what) Which manager has A202?",
        "(room, car, personnel number) As a result, the second interpretation has been implemented in its strict form: There is generally no answer defined for queries in which the object of HAVE does not contain a relation.",
        "In human dialogue, such questions can often be answered because either it is clear that HAVE means POSSESS or BE PART OF, or American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 7, Number 2, April-June 1981 113 Magdalena Zoeppritz The Meaning of OF and HAVE in the USL-System because what corresponds to the relation appears from the context.",

        "In order to see whether relating the subject of HAVE to the OF-column of the accusative of HAVE is a correct and general solution to the problem of interpreting HAVE, this interpretation was tried out with sentences containing HAVE and six types of noun phrases relevant in USL: names, quantified common nouns, common nouns preceded by interrogatives, relative pronouns, interrogative pronouns, and noun phrases with apposition, all both in subject and object positions.",
        "Coordinated noun phrases were not tested separately, because they are expanded into as many separate sentences as there are noun phrases in the coordination.",
        "Similarly, where there is no negation, common nouns preceded by quantifier or preceded by interrogative do not require different interpretations with respect to HAVE.",
        "Quantifiers trigger several transformation operations on the ISBL-string resulting from the translation (Ott, 1977), but the translation is the same.",
        "Interrogatives indicate which columns of the result are to figure in the answer.",
        "Appositions of the type \"secretary Moser\", \"Moser as secretary\" (including AS-complements of HAVE) have been included, because the first type furnishes a selection from the relation addressed, and the second type the relation itself.",

        "But there is no mechanism that automatically would look for such relations and either access them directly or resort to them if the standard interpretation fails.",
        "A solution to this problem is for the user to define HAVE as a synonym for POSSESS.",
        "He can then delete the system-defined HAVE altogether, if he is sure to use HAVE only in the sense of OWN.",
        "But he will probably want his definition in addition to the system defined HAVE.",
        "This leads to two parses and interpretations.",
        "In many cases only one of them will bring results, but sometimes both lead to the same answer.",
        "Thus, Does John have a secretary?",
        "will be interpreted both as: Is there a secretary of John?",
        "and Does.",
        "John own a secretary?",
        "where the second interpretation will fail.",
        "But the query Does John have a car?",
        "can bring answers to both interpretations, depending on the structure of the data base.",
        "A consequence of not having a relation HAVE on the one hand and on the other of expecting all adverbials and prepositional phrases to refer to columns in relations causes difficulties where prepositions are used in conjunction with HAVE and also with BE, as in questions like: Where does Peter have his office?",
        "To whom is Peter married?",
        "When is Peter's birthday?",
        "Is Peter's birthday on Friday?",
        "The German equivalent of the last two questions uses the verb HAVE: Wann hat Peter Geburtstag?",
        "Hat Peter am Freitag Geburtstag?",
        "For sentences with HAVE and BE as the main verb, the adverbials and prepositional phrases which have been attached to the verb by the grammar are relocated to the noun phrase addressing the relation that contains the corresponding columns.",
        "For the examples above, this means the columns LA, P=to, and TA, respectively, in the relations OFFICE, BIRTHDAY, and MARRIED.",
        "A serious problem for which we currently have no solution results from the fact that there is no interpretation where the accusative does not contain a relation.",
        "As can be seen from the examples, it is often intuitively clear what the interpretation of such sentences could be.",
        "\"The secretary who has Sauer\" could easily be the secretary of Sauer in the context of \"who has whom to work for\", but in the context of \"who has which manager\", the \"secretary who has Sauer\" can be the one whose manager is Sauer.",
        "As was shown above, the predicate HAVE is a derived predicate, it is applicable only where a more basic association exists between the elements in question.",
        "This predicate is found explicitly expressed, where HAVE sentences are expanded by AS-complements.",
        "Peter has a musician as secretary If there is no AS-complement and the accusative of HAVE contains a common noun, that noun generally points to the predicate; the AS-complement would be redundant.",
        "Peter has a musician can be read as Peter has a musician as his musician But in the proper context, the base predicate can be clearly something else: In a conversation about hobbies of secretaries, the same sentence \"Peter has a musician\" can mean Peter has a musician as his secretary In human dialogue the general rule that the base predicate appears in the accusative noun phrase can be overridden by special contexts, but in the general case the rule holds and can be used in the framework of data base interaction.",
        "In the absence of reference to a predicate in the accusative of HAVE, the base predicate can only be deduced from the context.",
        "It can be one of the properties of the element in the accusative, e.g. Sauer's being a manager, a father, or an employer, or it can coincide with the predicate referred to by the nominative.",
        "Therefore, the attempt at interpretation of such sentences would lead to choosing among plausible alternatives, choices that would remain arbitrary even if carefully made, and the results would be unreliable.",
        "We have avoided this at the cost of not providing general interpretations for these cases, even though the individual case is often intuitively interpretable, because we feel that in the framework of data base interaction it is more important for the system to react consistently and reliably than to simulate human dialogue.",
        "Since this paper was originally written, the USL System has moved to using System R as the data base management system, with SQL as the query language and target language for the interpretation.",
        "The PRTV-version of USL has been used by small groups in their applications, and initial results are encouraging (Lehmann et al., 1978, Krause, 1979).",
        "Further study is necessary, particularly with respect to database design and vocabulary definition by users."
