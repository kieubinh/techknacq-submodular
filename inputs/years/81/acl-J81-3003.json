        "We now feel that ambiguity control is one of the major considerations in designing an adaptor.",
        "The work of coping with ambiguity and complexity is presented below in a series of retrospective (non-chronological) design decisions.",
        "Given our previous decision that the program should work on a word-by-word basis, one could (in principle only) design an adaptor which would work perfectly, without any internal linguistic knowledge except a table of word correspondences.",
        "The program would, for each given word, look up the adapted word.",
        "The difficulty with this for Quechua is the practical impossibility of providing the word table.",
        "Morphological productivity would yield a table of millions of words, simple in structure but of unmanageable size.",
        "Also, the process of building the word table would continue indefinitely, and much of the relevant, systematic knowledge could not be used at all.",
        "This perception leads to the initial design decision: Decision 1: The basic linguistic unit which the program manipulates should be the morpheme rather than the word.",
        "Since we would like to be able to adapt from many SD's to many TD's with minimal effort of change, this leads to another decision on the particular morphemes to be used: Decision 2: The program should analyze text into proto-Quechua morphemes where appropriate, and should synthesize text from proto-Quechua morphemes by recapitulating actual historical processes.",
        "Discovering words in text is trivial, but discovering distinct morphemes is not.",
        "The decision to use morphemes as the basic unit makes it necessary for the program to contain an analyzer to reduce individual words into sequences of morphemes.",
        "This is the major part of the Word Analyzer above.",
        "One might hope that distinct morphemes would have distinct spellings, and that they could be discovered effectively by seeking concatenations of morpheme spellings which would yield the word.",
        "Unfortunately, as we have seen, spelling is a hopelessly inadequate basis for morphological analysis.",
        "Use of spelling alone leads to truly amazing numbers of analyses, as was demonstrated above with aywaykan.",
        "This is so frequent that, for efficiency, the program must never even produce the set of spelling-based readings inter",
        "nally.",
        "Rather, the analysis must be constrained by knowledge other than spelling.",
        "This fact leads to another design decision: Decision 3: The program must incorporate a strongly constraining morphology in its analysis.",
        "The morphology used [2] makes it possible to exploit the characteristic of Quechua (mentioned in 2.1) that the category of a morphological unit strongly constrains what suffix may follow the unit.",
        "On the basis of the morpheme categories alone, the number of distinct analyses of aywaykan drops from 56 to 2.",
        "The program applies these morphological constraints as the analysis of a word proceeds, so that an invalid analysis can be rejected as soon as it is proposed if it contains an invalid pair of adjacent morphemes, rather than delaying rejection until the word analysis is complete.",
        "The program also uses several other kinds of criteria for rejecting analyses, including a set of programmed tests which apply to whole words, used as soon as an analysis is complete.",
        "They eliminate analyses containing defects such as incorrect lowering, improper ordering, and the improper use of certain special morphemes such as -paq 'future'.",
        "These methods eliminate nearly all of the potential ambiguity (well over 99 percent of it), but still leave a significant residue.",
        "In the experiment, about 25 percent of the words were still ambiguous under all of these constraints applied jointly, and this ambiguity contributed about 1 excess reading for every 2 words.",
        "If this amount of ambiguity were to appear in the final text, it would be a significant impediment.",
        "Fortunately, as we will see, most of it goes away.",
        "In synthesizing words in the target dialect from their morpheme definitions, the many allomorphs and associated conditions must be treated properly.",
        "A TD morpheme may have multiple allomorphs in surface forms of the TD, only one of which is allowed by conditions in the remainder of the word.",
        "There is a great diversity of conditions.",
        "Composing TD words without reference to these conditions would yield incomprehensible text.",
        "This leads to the final design decision: Decision 4: The program must contain linguistically sound methods for selecting correct allomorphs in context.",
        "About one third of the words in our experimental text had possible allomorph variants when adapted to JuQ.",
        "Virtually all of this variation is subject to conditioning, which can be represented computationally by systematic environmental filtering rules.",
        "Application of this elaborate collection of environmental filtering rules causes essentially all allomorph variation to be resolved during synthesis.",
        "The final ambiguity-resolution \"method,\" the one which resolves about 93 percent of the residue, is not really a method at all.",
        "It turns out that when the various readings of an ambiguous SD word are synthesized in the TD, they seldom differ.",
        "The predominant case is that only one spelling (rendering) arises from an ambiguous word, so that the final text has only a single word form even though the analysis and synthesis of that word were ambiguous.",
        "On a 576-word sample of text adapted to JuQ, there were 151 ambiguous words.",
        "For these, WA produced 850 readings (1.47 readings per word).",
        "But the \"collapsing effect\" reduced the number of readings to 587 (1.02 readings per word), so that only 11 words were indicated as ambiguous in the final text.",

        "(This was an extreme; all helpers for other dialects suggested far fewer changes of the same material).",
        "So the program seems capable of doing between 80 percent and 95 percent of the necessary or advisable dialect-related changes.",
        "These figures are of less practical importance than the qualitative fact that the program made these texts fully comprehensible to the native helpers.",
        "Of the corrections which field testing brought to light, a rough estimate suggests that well over 90 percent could also have been made (and eventually will be made) by the program by simple modifications of the data lists made available to it.",
        "(The bulk of these changes involve the spelling of Spanish loans, which in the experimental tests were written as in Spanish but which will eventually be written according to Quechua orthography).",
        "This means that only a very small residue of changes will not be made by the program, these changes being left for the checker/editor.",
        "The computer-adapted text was – with very few exceptions – completely intelligible to the checker/editors, and this would not have been the case for material which had not been pre-adapted.",
        "Thus it seems safe to say that one consequence of computer adaptation is that the resultant text could be checked by a person who knew only the target dialect, his task being to make the text sound more natural in his dialect.",
        "On the same basis, computer adaptation can make an existing translation in a related language or dialect accessible to a native translator.",
        "It has been our feeling that pre-adapting with a computer would enable the checker/editor to consider more significant changes because it relieved him of the (overwhelming number of) rather superficial and systematic changes.",

        "Second, the translations of a particular source text used in neighboring dialects will differ principally only in being dialect variants.",
        "More fundamental differences could lead to disputes about which is the more accurate or appropriate rendering of the text; dialect-based differences in texts are not likely to do so.",
        "Third, the SD and TD texts will be more error-free than would otherwise be the case, in several ways.",
        "Because WA usually succeeds in analyzing a word only if it is spelled exactly right, the program has the effect of identifying essentially all of the typographical errors in the SD text.",
        "And since the computer does an impeccable job of fabricating the TD word, that word is spelled correctly, and consistently from instance to instance.",
        "Fourth, the corrections required to convert the computer-adapted text into a final TD text are not so numerous as to require retyping of the text.",
        "This is not the case for most manual adaptations.",
        "The final text can be produced by on-line editing of the computer-produced text, with significant savings of proofreading effort.",
        "Fifth, the program leads to a greater understanding of 1) the structure of the SD, (since WA must contain a fully explicit morphology), and 2) the dialect situation.",
        "It provides a medium in which to express these insights in a fully explicit manner."

        "This project has explored the feasibility of using a computer to assist in the adaptation of material from one dialect to another, using central Quechua dialects as its test-ground.",
        "All the results suggest that a computer can be programmed to do a significant amount of adaptation, but this depends on incorporating a significant amount of knowledge about the source and target dialects into the program in order that it be able to analyze source dialect words, make changes, and reconstruct a correct target dialect word."
