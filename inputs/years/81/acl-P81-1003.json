        "This paper argues that comparatives can be structurally analyzed on the basis of syntactic Information alone via a strictly surface-based grammar.",
        "Such a grammar is given in Ryan [5], based on the co-representational model of Kac [1].",
        "While the grammar does not define a parsing algorithm per se, it nonetheless expresses regularities of surface organization and Its relationship to semantic interpretation that an adequate parser would be expected to incorporate.",
        "This paper will discuss four problem areas in the description of comparatives and will outline the sections of the grammar of [5] that apply to them.",
        "The central problem in parsing comparatives involves identifying the arguments of comparative predicates, and the relations borne by these arguments to such predicates.",

        "Since no particular analytic procedure is associated with CORG, the assignment of particular analyses may be thought of either as a comparison of complete potential relational analyses with the principles, whereby all potential analyses of the string not consistent with the grammar are discarded, or as a process of sequential assignments of partial analyses where each step is checked against the principles.",

        "This means that run cannot FF-TiEluded as part of the OBJ(more).",
        "This is guaranteed by the Comparative Object Restilaion (13).",
        "Both of the analyses shown in (46) and (47) are possible for sentence (34) since knows may take predicational objects (in this case, more doctors than lawyers run) or it may take nonpredicational objects such as the complex comparative term in (47).",
        "Sentences (39) and (40) do not have possible analyses since hired cannot take predicational objects (such as that shown in (46)), and the presence of either an intransitive verb (run) or a transitive verb with an overt object (debate psychiatrists) after the comparative predicate, forces such a structure because of rules (10) and (13).",
        "Sentence (41) would have a structure similar to (47).",
        "Sentences (42) - (44) would all have structures similar to the partial analysis in (46).",
        "This is forced by the subcategorization of thinks, which takes only predicational objects.",
        "There-117o possible analysis for (45) since the subcategorization of spoke to, unlike debate, requires the presence of an overt object.",
        "But if an object is assigned to spoke to, the result will ultimately be a structure like t-git shown in (47).",
        "But the structure shown in (47) is a term and therefore nonpredicational.",
        "This means it could not be analyzed as OBJ(thinks), while requires a predicational (complement) structure.",
        "Finally, it is precisely because a sentence with spoke to as the third verb must have a structure like (4/T-nonpredicational) that sentence (41) has a possible analysis in contrast to (45).",
        "That is, the structure of the string more doctors than lawyers spoke to in (49) has a nonpredicational (comparative term) structure.",
        "Since it is a term and not a predication, any verb taking it as an argument must be subcategorized for nonpredicational arguments.",
        "Think in (45) takes only predicational arguments in thi-aject relation, while hired in (41) takes only nonpredicational arguments in the object relation.",
        "Thus, only the sentence with hired may take the comparative term as an argument.",
        "But sooke to does not allow the string more doctors than lawyers to simply be analyzed as its subject, since no possible object would then be available for spoke to.",
        "However, if the string more doctors than lawyers is not analyzed as SUBJ(spoke to), it will not be possible to analyze the string as a predication Pr/spoke to, thus blocking the analysis of the string as OBJ(think).",

        "4.3.2 CONCLUSION The degree of ellipsis and the subcategorization of the surrounding predicates interact to affect the possible number and type of interpretations for each of the sentences in this section.",
        "That interaction can be most clearly seen in a comparison of (34) and (35) and (36).",
        "The verb know is subcategorized for either predicational or nonpreTrational arguments.",
        "This allows the string more doctors than lawyers debate to have two possible structures corresponding to the structures shown in (46) and (47).",
        "The structure in (46) is a predicational structure while the structure in (47) is a nonpredicational structure.",
        "The subcategorization of knows allows either of those as possible interpretations of the OBJ (knows).",
        "Verbs subcategorized for only one type of argument, say predicational, will allow only one of those possible structures of more doctors than lawyers debate, in this case the predicational one shown in (46), to be analyzed as the object of that verb.",
        "This is one way in which the subcategorization of surrounding predicates affects the type and number of possible interpretations a sentence may have.",
        "The effect of the subcategorization of the following predicate parallels the effect of no ellipsis after than.",
        "Thus sentences (35) and (36) each have only one possible interpretation and the relation of the string more doctors than lawyers is the same in each case; that is, it is the same as the oredicational structure shown in (46), being the subject of the following predicate.",
        "Thus, the presence of an intransitive verb or the presence of a transitive verb plus an overt object to its right as in (35) and (36) forces a predicational structure of the type shown in (46).",
        "Since knows takes predicational objects, these sentences are still grammatical.",
        "If hired is substituted for knows as in (39) and (40), the sentences are no longer grammatical, since the subcategorization of hired does not allow predication arguments.",
        "The last type of effect of the predicate following than is in some cases to force a nonpredicational structure like that shown in (47).",
        "The verb spoke to is not an object deletable verb, while the verb debate does allow unspecified objects.",
        "For this reason, the verb sooke to cannot be part of a structure like that shown in-TUT-since it would require the object of spoke to to be analyzed as \"unspecified\".",
        "Thus, the presence of a verb like spoke to after than forces the nonpredicational structure of the type shown in (47), since in this structure the object of spoke to would be overt.",
        "Since the presence of spoke to forces a nonpredicational structure for the string more doctors than lawyers spoke to, it can only occur as part of an object of a verb which allows nonpredicational objects, like know or hired.",
        "It follows from this that if the striTi-more doctors than lawyers spoke to occured after a verb which took predicational arguments only, such as thinks, the result would be an ungrammatical sentence.",
        "This is in fact the case, as can be seen from sentence (45).",
        "SEC.",
        "5 CONCLUSIONS The rules presented here provide an axiom system which allows only one possible analysis for each interpretation of a sentence, and no possible analysis for sentences which are ungrammatical.",
        "The rules specifically proposed for comparatives have been shown to apply to a wide variety of construction types; for example, the Comparative Object Restriction and the Term Definitions figure crucially in the analysis of sentences in all the subsections of section 4.",
        "In addition, these rules are based on observations about characteristics of the sentences which are either directly observable in the string (e.g. left to right relative order) or which are a necessary part of any grammatical description (e.g. subclassification and subcategorization of verbs).",
        "Such a grammar can provide useful and accessible information for the problem of parsing as well as grammatical description."
