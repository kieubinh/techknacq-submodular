        "Further these features were all to the phonetic representations.",
        "claimed to have two values; the feature was either present or absent.",
        "There has been a (2) fair amount of dispute about the specific URs features, and several additional ones have PHONY been proposed, e.g. gravity, advanced tongue Pronounciations root.",
        "There has also been considerable (phonological analysis) dispute about whether the features are all Rules binary.",
        "Nevertheless most phonologists use the original binary features, often with a few additional ones.",
        "Phonological rules are operations upon sets of these feature .",

        "The phonological rules generate the various pronounciations of the morphemes from their underlying representations.",
        "The representation provides a language in which to express hypotheses.",
        "The task is to find statements in this language to express the data.",
        "Thus the representation implicitly defines the search space.",
        "The search space is restricted by the following constraint on the 'distance' between a UR and its pronounciations.",
        "Every feature specification in the UR must be present in a 'corresponding' segment in at least one of the phonetic forms.",
        "Consider, for example, morpheme 1 from (3) above; it has three pronounciations Csarap7, [sarab], [sarav].",
        "This constraint restricts its possible URs to /sarap/, /sarab/, /sarav/, /saraf/.",
        "Even [f] does not appear in any of the pronouciations of this morpheme, its +continuant specification occurs in [v] and its voice specification occurs in [p]: its other feature specifications are common to Cp3, [b], [v].",
        "This constraint is weaker than the \"strong alternation condition\" (cf. [43), which would restrict the final UR segment to be /p/, /b/, or /v/.",
        "The term \"alternation\" will be important of the discussion below; here [p] vs. [b] vs. [v] is an alternation.",
        "THE PROBLEM OF MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS It should be pointed out that most often several sets of combinations of underlying representations and phonological rules can be used to derive the same pronounciations.",
        "This could happen in several ways.",
        "It could be unclear what the UR is, and different URs together with different rules could derive that same pronounciatons.",
        "i.e. the directionality of the rule could be unclear.",
        "Consider morpheme 5 from (3) above:",
        "The symbol $ represents a word boundary, and the symbol + represents a morpheme boundary.",
        "The difference in the pronounciation of the last segment of this morpheme, d vs. t, is called an alternation.",
        "Given this alternation, one could make two hypotheses.",
        "One could hypothesize that the UR is /ad/ and that there is a rule which changes d to t when it occurs at the end of a word, or one could hypothesize that the UR is /at/ and that there is a rule which changes t to d between as.",
        "Also some phenomena could be explained by a single more general rule or by several more specific rules.",
        "Generally, there are two approaches that could be taken to deal with the problem of multiple possible solutions.",
        "One could attempt to impose restrictions on what could constitute a valid solution, or one could use an evaluation procedure to decide in cases of multiple possible solutions.",
        "One could also use both of these approaches; in which case the more restriction, the less evaluation is necessary.",
        "An original single evaluation criterion - 'simplicity', as manifested in the number of feature specifications used - has not proved workable.",
        "Also no particular proposed restrictions have been embraced by the vast majority of phonologists.",
        "Individual phonologists are generally guided in their evaluations of solutions, i.e. sets of rules and URs, by various criteria.",
        "The weighting of these criteria is left open.",
        "In this connection the 'codifying function' of the development of expert systems is particulary relevant, i.e. in order to be put into a program the criteria must be formalized and weighted.",
        "[5] Although it has sometimes been claimed that no set of discovery procedures can be sufficient to produce phonological analyses, this program is intended to demonstrate the feasibility of a procedural definition of the theory.",
        "The three most widely used criteria and the manner in which they are embedded in PHONY will now be discussed."

        "This involves the preference of solutions based phonological environment rather than to those in which reference is made to morphological or lexical categories or involving the division of the lexicon into arbitrary classes.",
        "In other words, in doing phonological analysis the categories or meanings of morphemes will not be considered, unless no solution can be found based on just the sounds or sound sequences involved.",
        "This criterion is embodied in PHONY, since no information about morphological or syntactic categories is available to PHONY.",
        "If PHONY cannot handle an alternation by reference to phonological environment, it will return that this is an 'interesting case'.",
        "The ability to identify the 'interesting cases' is a most valuable one, since these are often the cases that lead to theory modification.",
        "It should be mentioned that PHONY could readily be extended (Extension 1) to handle a certain range of syntactically or morphologically triggered phonological rules.",
        "This would involve including in the input information about syntactic category, and, where relevant, morphological category of the constituent morphemes.",
        "This informaton would be ignored unless PHONY was unable to produce a solution, i.e. would have returned \"interesting cases.",
        "It would then search for generalizations based on these categories.",

        "Although natural processes are often phonetically plausible, this is not always the case.",

        "The more general rules require fewer feature specifications.",
        "Also the smaller number of",
        "rules can lead to a reduced number of feature specifications.",
        "The various proposed constraints on what can be valid solutions generally would correlate with the differences in the testing process of PHONY.",
        "Most of these involve differences in allowable orderings of rules (e.g. 'unrestricted extrinsic ordering', 'free reapplication', 'direct mapping'; cf. [3]).",
        "At present PHONY's testing process involves checking if hypothesized rules hold, i.e. do not have counterexamples, in the phonetic representations (such a criterion disallows opacity of type 1; cf. [4]).",
        "PHONY could be extended (Extension 2) to allow the user to choose from several of the proposed constraints.",
        "This would involve using different testing functions.",
        "This extension would allow analyses of the same data under different constraints to easily be compared.",

        "In order to generate more general rules this relacesentation is modified to two matrices for each segment - one representing those features which must be positive in the environment and the other for those features which must be negative.",

        "These are produced by attempting in turn to eliminate each segment in GCDed rule; the new rule is generated and tested, and if valid the segment is out, otherwise it remains.",

        "There is a \"grinding\" quality to this process.",
        "Phonologists only resort to a similar grind, when all their heuristics have led to deadends.",

        "(Possible decision criteria to be used in evaluating differing sets of heuristics could be the number of tests of the input corpusand the number of \"interesting cases\".)",
        "These heuristics could improve efficiency of PHONY by obviating much of the \"grinding\" process.",
        "At the same time METAPHONY could also be making discoveries about phonologies of natural languages in general.",
        "For example, in the process of generating LCDs instead of going segment by segment and feature by feature, METAPHONY could acquire and incorporate in PHONY knowledge about what aspects of pronounciation are not/rarely pertinent to rules affecting a certain feature."
