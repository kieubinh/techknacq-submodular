        "Is evaluation, like beauty, in the eye of the beholder?",
        "The answer is far from simple because it depends on who is considered to be the proper beholder.",
        "Evaluators may range from casual users to society as a whole, with system builders, sophisticated users, linguists, grant providers, system buyers, and others in between.",
        "The members of this panel are system builders and linguists -- or rather the two fused into one -- but, I believe, interested in all or almost all actual or potential bodies of evaluators.",
        "One of our colleagues expressed a forceful opinion while being a member of a similar panel at last year's AL conference: \"Those of us on this panel and other researchers in the field simply don't have the right to determine whether a system is practical.",
        "Only the users of such a system can make that determination.",
        "Only a user can decide whether the NL (natural language] capability constitutes sufficient added value to be deemed practical Only a user can decide if the system's frequency of inappropriate response is sufficiently low to be deemed practical.",
        "Only a user can decide whether the overall NL interaction, taken in toto, offers enough benefits over alternative formal interactions to be deemed practical\" M. It is hard for me to disagree, since I argued as forcefully on the basis of my study of users' evaluation of machine translation (21 -- a study which was prompted by the evaluations of the quality of machine translation as viewed by linguists and users, ranging from 35% acceptable for the former to 90% for the latter.",
        "What the study also showed was that the practicality of the output could indeed only be judged by the users, since even incomplete and stylistically very inelegant translations were found quite useful in practice because they, on the one hand, provided, however crudely, the information sought by the users, and, on the other hand, the users themselves brought knowledge that made the texts far more understandable and useful than might appear to a nonspecialist linguist.",
        "But this endorsement on my part of the user as the ultimate judge in evaluations does not preclude my fully subscribing to Norm Sondheimer's (31 introductory comments to this panel stating that to \"make progress as a field, we need to be able to evalu-ate.\" We are now less likely to confuse the issue of the evaluation by people like ourselves and the judgment of the users, less likely to be surprised at the discrepancies, and less likely to be surprised at the users' acceptance of the limitations of our ML interfaces.",
        "Also, we are far more aware of the fact that evaluations of \"worth\" or \"quality\" have to be conducted in the contexts of the actual, perceived needs.",
        "In extensive studies on evaluation of innovations, Hosteller (41, the recently retired president of AAAS, found that \"successful innovators better understand user needs; (and] pay more attention to marketing.",
        ".",
        ".",
        ".\" The same source, however, leads me to the notorious difficulties of evaluation given the wide range of evaluators and their purposes.",
        "We are all undoubtedly convinced of the value of ELI for the society as a whole, but the evaluation of experiments with these interfaces is another matter.",
        "Hosteller was faced with social, sociomedical, and medical fields.",
        "Let me recount some of the studies he and his team made for reasons which will soon become obvious.",
        "His team scored a given program on a scale from plus two to minus two with zero meaning there was essentially no gain.",
        "Accordingly, a study of delinquent girls that identified them but failed to prevent them from delinquency received a zero.",
        "Likewise, a zero was assigned to a probation experiment for conviction for public drunkenness in which three methods were used: (1) no treatment, (2) an alcoholic clinic, and",
        "(3) Alcoholics Anonymous.",
        "Since the \"no treatment\"",
        "group performed somewhat better, short-term referrals were considered of no value.",
        "A minus one was given to a study whose results were opposite to those hoped for: a major insurance company increased outpatient benefits in the hope of decreasing hospital costs, but the outpatient group's hospital stays increased.",
        "Finally, a double plus was awarded to an experiment involving the Salk vaccine, which was, predictably, very successful.",
        "Now this kind of evaluation may be justified when the needs of the society are at stake.",
        "I have gone into these details, however, for the purpose of expressing the opinion, in which I know I'm not alone, that negative results are as important as positive ones, that evaluation in our case is almost equivalent to the amount of information obtained in an experiment.",
        "An experiment whose results would be totally predictable would be almost useless, but one with results different from those hoped for might be embarrassing but very valuable.",
        "Another comment prompted by those evaluations is that the application of any rigid, fine scale is totally inappropriate in the case of ML!",
        "evaluations."

        "It had been widely taken for granted some time ago that NLI is as good as is its grammar, and a grammar is as good as it is extensive.",
        "The specific needs of users, the requirements of special tasks and the like took a back seat.",
        "The nature of human discourse was yet to be explored.",
        "Happily, we have been in a different situation for some time.",
        "When the EEL (5, 6, 71 system was getting into a reasonably sturdy shape with respect to speed and bugs, I started planning experiments Co test it.",
        "There was important literature about discourse, especially in sociology, such as the work of Schegloff.",
        "It was thus clear that successful NLI experiments had to be based on knowledge of human discourse.",
        "It was also clear that that was the way to make the interface more natural.",
        "This assumption has already been fruitful: the ML interface in POL (91, a successor to EEL, has already been extensively improved as a result of the EEL-related experiments.",
        "Experiments were made in three modes: in addition to face-to-face and human-to-computer, terminal-to-terminal communication was examined, since at present that is the only practical mode of accessing the computer.",
        "Through early 1980, over 80 subjects, 80,000 words, and over 50 hours were analyzed in great detail.",
        "In the fall of 1980, another 13 subjects were tested in the computational mode only, adding approximately 20 hours.",
        "From the start, the experiments were encouraging, although limited to two modes: FF and T-T. Interactions not only showed a great deal of structure but extensive similarities in both modes, the most important being the constancy of the number of words in sentences (about 70%); the length of sentences (about 7 words); the existence of fragments (70% of messages in FF and 50% in T-T containing them); and phatics (10% of total for FF and 5% for T-T).",
        "Thus similarities between the modes were a candidate for consideration in experiments in the computational mode, the T-T mode being seemingly quite far removed from natural FF.",
        "The sentence having historically been the unit of analysis (and since phatics were considered of lesser importance from the computational view, although of great interest in general), my attention turned to fragments.",
        "EEL allowed for three non-sentence type structures: \"HP?\" (including number parsed into NP); \"all/none or number\" answers; and",
        "definitions introducible by the user which make it possible to include individual knowledge and terminology.",
        "The analysis of FF and T-T protocols, however, showed the existence of other fragment categories, finally analyzed into a dozen categories (see (81).",
        "Since they constitute a considerable amount of FF conversations and even T-T protocols, they clearly had to be watched for in computational experiments.",
        "The experiments for actually observing user-system interaction were conducted in the winter term of 1979/80 and produced 21 protocols, the analysis of which was compared with results of eight FF and four T-T experiments.",
        "Another 13 computational experiments done in the fall confirmed the results of the earlier ones.",
        "The task in all three modes was a real one: loading cargo onto a ship, the data coming from the actual environment of loading U.S. navy ships by a group in San Diego, California.",
        "In the FF and T-T experiments, two .persons were involved -- one given cargo items to be loaded, the other information about decks (details in Op.",
        "In the computational mode (H-C) the ship data was in the computer and the list of cargo to be loaded was handed to the subjects, all with Caltech background.",
        "Details being available elsewhere and space limited here, only some major results are given here.",
        "Table 1 shove the comparison of the three modes.",
        "As can be seen, several statistica show similarities: sentence length, message length, fragment length, percentage of words in sentences and fragments.",
        "The closeness of the average of messages in T-T and parsed and nonparsed inputs in H-C is striking.",
        "Table 2 (the meaning of abbreviations is given below the table) deals with fragments.",
        "It is mostly self-explanatory, as is the absence of definitions from FF and T-T (although some abbreviations used there fall in this category) and the absence of some other categories from T-T and H-C. At least two comments, however, are necessary.",
        "The surprisingly low use of terse questions in H-C may be accounted for by the tendency toward a formal style in computational interaction.",
        "The definitions used were often of quite complex character, although far fever than could be hoped for due apparently to lack of familiarity with this capability.",
        "The complex character of definitions undoubtedly had soma effect on the length of sentences in the H-C mode.",
        "the other speaker's string.",
        "Often an NP, but it may be an elliptical structure of various forms.",
        "ADD (Added Information): An elliptical structure, often NP, used to clarify or complete a previous utterance, often one's own, e.g., \"It doesn't say anything here about weight, or breaking things down.",
        "Except for crushables.\", \"It's smaller.",
        "36\"x20\"x17\".\" Spelling out words was included here.",
        "CORR (Correction): This may be done by either speaker.",

        "FS (False Start): These are also abandoned utterances, but immediately followed by usually syntactically and semantically related ones, e.g., \"They may, they may be identical el .\", 'Well, the height, the next largest height I've got is 34.\""
