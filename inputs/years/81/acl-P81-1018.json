        "Numerous systems have been proposed to model human use of language in conversation (speech acts [1], MICS (3], Grosz [5]).",
        "They have attacked the problem from several different directions.",
        "Often an attempt has been made to develop some intersentential analog of syntax, despite the severe problems that grammar-oriented parsers have experienced.",
        "The program described in this paper avoids the use of such a grammar, using instead a model of the conversation's topics to provide the necessary connections between utterances.",
        "It is similar to the ELI parsing system, developed by Riesbeck and Schenk [7], in that it uses relatively small, independent segments of code (or \"rules\") to decide how to respond to each utterance, given the context of the utterances that have already occurred.",
        "The program currently operates in the role of a graduate student discussing qualifier exams, although the rules and control structures are independent of the domain, and do not assume any a priori topic of discussion.",
        "The main goals of this project are:",
        "• To develop a small number of general rules that manipulate internal models of topics in order to produce a coherent conversation.",
        "• To develop a representation for these models of",
        "topics which will enable the rules to generate responses, control the flow of conversation, and maintain a history of the system's actions during the current conversation.",
        "This research was sponsored in part by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DOD), ARPA Order No.",
        "3597, monitored by the Air Force Avionics Laboratory Under Contract F33615-78-C-1551.",
        "The views and conclusions contained in this document are those of the author and should not be interpreted as representing the official policies, either expressed or implied, of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency or the US Government.",
        "• To integrate information from a semantic network, scripts, dynamic goal trees, and the current conversation in order to allow intelligent action by the rules.",
        "The rule-based approach was chosen because it appears to work in a better and more natural way than syntactic pattern matching in the domain of single utterances, even though a grammatical structure can be clearly demonstrated there.",
        "If it is awkward to use a grammar for single-sentence analysis, why expect it to work in the larger domain of human discourse,.",
        "where there is no obviously demonstrable \"syntactic\" structure?",
        "In place of grammar productions, rules are used which can initiate and close topics, and form utterances based on the input, current topics, and long-term knowledge.",
        "This set of rules does not include any domain-specific inferences; instead, these are placed into the semantic network when the situations in which they apply are discussed.",
        "It is important to realize that a \"topic\" in the sense used in this paper is not the same thing as the concept of \"focus\" used in the anaphora and coreference disambiguation literature.",
        "There, the idea is to decide which part of a sentence is being focused on (the \"topic\" of the sentence), so that the system can determine which phrase will be referred to by any future anaphoric references (such as pronouns).",
        "In this paper, a topic is a concept, possibly encompassing more than the sentence itself, which is \"brought to mind\" when a person hears an utterance (the \"topic\" of a conversation).",
        "It is used to decide which utterances can be generated in response to the input utterance, something that the focus of a sentence (by itself) can not in general do.",
        "The topics need to be stored (as opposed to possibly generating them when needed) simply because a topic raised by an input utterance might not be addressed until a more interesting topic has been discussed.",
        "The data structure used to represent a topic is simply an object whose value is a Conceptual Dependency (or CD) [8] description of the topic, with pointers to rules,, utterances, and other topics which are causally or temporally related to it, plus an indication of what conversational goal of the program this topic is intended to fulfill.",
        "The types of relations represented include: the rule (and any utterances involved) that resulted in the generation of the topic, any utterances generated from the topic, the topics generated before and after this one (if any), and the rule (and utterances) that resulted in the closing of this topic (if it has been closed).",
        "Utterances have a similar representation: a CD expression with pointers to the rules, topics, and other utterances to which they are related.",
        "This interconnected set of CD expressions is referred to as the topic-utterance graph, a small example of which (without CDs) is illustrated in Figure 1-1.",
        "The various pointers allow the program to remember what it has or has not done, and why.",
        "Some are used by rules that have already been implemented, while others are provided for rules not yet built (the current rules are described in sections 2.2 and 3)."

        "The system under implementation is, as the title says, a rule-based conversation participant.",
        "Since language was originally only spoken, and used primarily as an immediate communication device, it is not unreasonable to assume that the mental machinery we wish to model is designed primarily for use in an interactive fashion, such as in dialogue.",
        "Thus, it is more natural to model one interacting participant than to try to model an external observer's understanding of the whole interaction."

      "text": [
        "One of the nice properties of rule-based systems is that they tend to have simple control structures.",
        "In the conversation participant: the rule application routine is simply an initialization followed by a loop in which a CD expression is input, rules are tried until one produces a reply-wait signal, and the output CD is printed.",
        "A special token is output to indicate that the conversation is over, causing an exit from the loop.",
        "One can view this part of the model as an input/output interface, connecting the data structures that the rules access with the outside world.",
        "Control decisions outside of the rules themselves are handled by the agenda structure and the interest-rating routine.",
        "An agenda is essentially a list of lists, with each of the sublists referred to as a \"bucker.",
        "Each bucket holds the names of one or more rules.",
        "The actual firing of rules is not as simple as indicated in the above paragraph, in that all of the rules in • a bucket are tested, and allowed to fire if their test clauses are true.",
        "After all the rules in a bucket have been tested, if any of them have produced a reply-wait signal, the \"best\" utterance is chosen for output by the interest-rating routine, and the main loop described above continues.",
        "If none have indicated a need to wait, the next bucket is then tried.",
        "Thus, the rules in the first bucket are always tried and have highest priority.",
        "Priority decreases on a bucket-by-bucket basis down to the last bucket.",
        "In a normal agenda, the act of firing is the same as what I am calling the reply-wait signal, but in this system there is an additional twist.",
        "It is necessary to have a way to produce two sentences in a row, not necessarily tightly related to each other (such as an interjection followed by a question).",
        "Rather than trying to guarantee that all such sets of rules are in single buckets, the rules have been given the ability to fire, produce an utterance, cause it to be output immediately, and not have the agenda stopped, simply by indicating that a reply-wait is not needed.",
        "It is also possible for a rule to fire without producing either an utterance or a reply-wait, as is the case for rules that simply create topics, or to produce a list of utterances, which the interest-rater must then look through.",
        "The interest-rating routine determines which of the utterances produced by the rules in a bucket (and not immediately output) is the best, and so should be output.",
        "This is done by comparing the proposed utterance to our model of the goals of the speaker, the listener, and the person being discussed.",
        "Currently only the goals of the person being discussed are examined, but this will be extended to include the goals of the other two.",
        "The comparison involves looking through our model of his goal tree, giving an utterance a higher ranking for matching a more important goal.",
        "This is adjusted by a small amount to favor utterances which imply reaching a goal and to disfavor those which imply failing to reach it.",
        "Goal trees are stored in long-term memory (see next section).",
        "2.2.",
        "Memories There are three main kinds of memory in this model: working memory, long-term memory, and rule memory.",
        "The data structures representing working memory include several global variables plus the topic-utterance graph.",
        "The topic-utterance graph has the general form of two doubly-linked lists, one consisting of all utterances input and output (in chronological order) and the other containing the topics (in the order they were generated), with various pointers indicating the relationships between individual topics and utterances.",
        "These were detailed in section 1.",
        "Long-term memory is represented as a semantic network [2].",
        "Input utterances which are accepted as true, as well as their immediate inferences, are stored here.",
        "The typical semantic network concept has been extended somewhat to include two types of information not usually found there: goal trees and scripts.",
        "Goal trees [6, 3] are stored under individual tokens or classes (on the property GOALS) by name.",
        "They consist of several CD concepts linked together by SUBGOAL/SUPERGOAL links, with the top SUPERGOAL being the most important goal, and with importance decreasing with distance below the top of the goal tree.",
        "Goal trees represent the program's model of a person or organization's goals.",
        "Unlike an earlier conversation program [3], in this system they can be changed during the course of a conversation as the program gathers new information about the entities it already knows something about.",
        "For example, if the program knows that graduate students want to pass a particular test, and that Frank is a graduate student, and it hears that Frank passed the test, it will create an individual goal tree for Frank, and remove the goal of passing that test.",
        "This is done by the routine which stores CDs in the semantic network, whenever a goal is mentioned as the second clause of an inference rule that is being stored.",
        "If the rule is stored as true, the first clause of the implication is made a subgoal of the mentioned goal in the actor's goal tree.",
        "If the rule is negated, any subgoal matching the first clause is removed from the goal tree.",
        "As for scripts [9], these are the model's episodic memory and are stored as tokens in the semantic network, under the class SCRIPT.",
        "Each one represents a detailed knowledge of some sequence of events (and states), and can contain instances of other scripts as events.",
        "The individual events are represented in CD.",
        "and are generally descriptions of steps in a commonly occuring routine, such as going to a restaurant or taking a train trip.",
        "In the current context, the main script deals with the various aspects of a graduate student taking a qualifier.",
        "There are parameters to a script, called \"roles\" • in this case, the student, the writers of the exam, the graders, etc.",
        "Each role has some required preconditions.",
        "For example, any writer must be a professor at this university.",
        "There are also postconditions, such as the fact that if the student passes the qual he/she has fulfilled that requirement for the Ph.D. and will be pleased.",
        "This postcondition is an example of a domain-dependent inference rule, which is stored in the semantic network when a situation from the domain is discussed.",
        "Finally, we have the rule memory.",
        "This is just the group of data objects whose names appear in the agenda.",
        "Unlike the other data objects, however, rules contain Lisp code, stored in two parts: the TEST and the ACTION.",
        "The TEST code is executed whenever the rule is being tried, and determines whether it fires or not.",
        "It is thus an indication of when this rule is applicable.",
        "(The conditions under which a rule is tried were given in the section on Control, section 2.1).",
        "The ACTION code is executed when the rule fires, and returns either a list of utterances (with an implied reply-wait), an utterance with an indication that no reply wait is necessary, or NIL, the standard Lisp symbol for ''nothing\".",
        "The rules can have side effects, such as creating a possible topic and then returning NIL.",
        "Although rules are connected into the topic-utterance graph, they are not really considered part of it, since they are a permanent part of the system, and contain Lisp code rather than CD expressions."
