        "During the past two decades, much work in linguistics has focused on sentences as minimal units of communication, and the project of rigorously characterizing the structure of sentences in natural language has met with some success.",
        "Not surprisingly, however.",
        "sentence grammars have contributed little to the analysis of discourse.",
        "Human discourse consists not just of words in sequences, but of words in sequences directed by a speaker to an addressee, used to represent situations and to reveal intentions.",
        "Only when the addressee has apprehended both these aspects of thc message communicated can the message be interpreted.",
        "The analysis of discourse that emerges from Austin (1962), grounded in a theory of action, takes this view as central, and the concept of the speech act follows naturally.",
        "An utterance may have a conventional meaning, but the interpretation of the actual meaning of the utterance as it is used in discourse depends on evaluating the utterance in the context of the set of intentions which represent the illocutionary mode of its presentation.",
        "Put another way (paraphrasing Searle (1975:3)).",
        "the speaker's intention is to produce understanding, consisting of the knowledge of conditions on the speech act being performed.",
        "If we are to take seriously Scarle's (1969:16) assertion that \"the unit of linguistic communication is not ... the symbol, word, or sentence, ... but rather the production or the issuance of the symbol, word or sentence in the performance of the speech act.\"",
        "then we should be able to find some formal method of characterizing speech acts in discourse.",
        "Unfortunately, linguists have too often employed speech acts as taxonomic conveniences, as in Dore (1977), Labov and Fanshel (1977), and elsewhere, without attempting to give anything more than a descriptive definition.",
        "Only in the artificial intelligence literature, notably in the work of Allen, Bruce, Cohen, and Perrault (e.g. Allen (1979), Bruce and Newman (1978), Cohen and Perrault (1979), Cohen (1978), Perrault, Allen, and Cohen (1978)), does one find an attempt to define speech acts in terms of more general processes, here specifically, operations on planning networks."

      "text": [
        "A great problem for the computational linguist attempting to find a formal representation for speech acts is that the set of speech acts does not map uniformly onto the set of sentences.",
        "In terms of \"goodness of fit\" with sentences, several types of speech acts can be described.",
        "One type, the so-called performatives, including ASSERT, DECLARE, etc.. can be effected in a single utterance.",
        "But even some of these can undergo further decomposition.",
        "For example, assuming that the usual felicity conditions hold (cf. Searle (1969:54f1)).",
        "both (1) and (2) below can count as an apology, though neither sentence in (2) alone has the effect which their combination achieves.",
        "(1) I apologize for what I did.",
        "(2) I did a terrible thing I'm very sorry.",
        "In (2), the first sentence contributes to the effect of an apology only to the extent that an addressee can infer that it is intended as part of an apology.",
        "The second sentence, which makes overt the expression of contrition, also expresses the sincerity which is prerequisite for a felicitous apology.",
        "But its success, too, depends on an inference by the addressee that it is intended as part of an apology.",
        "If the addressee cannot make that inference -- because, for example, the addressee believes that the speaker is speaking sarcastically -- the effect of the apology is lost not only for the second sentence, but for the first as well.",
        "In this case, the illocutionary effect APOLOGIZE can be regarded as supra-sentential.",
        "though, as in (1), appropriate single sentences can be used to achieve its effect.",
        "There are other types of speech acts, however, that cannot be performed in single utterances, but require several or even many utterances.",
        "For example, DEFEND (as in a lawyer's action on behalf of his client), REFUTE (as in polemical argumentation) and PROVE (as in demonstrating effects from specific causes) cannot be effected as performatives: one cannot make a refutation by uttering the words, l refute X, as one might make an assertion by uttering the words.",
        "I assert X.",
        "One might wonder whether these supra-utterance modes should count as speech acts.",
        "Certainly, the term \"speech act\" has traditionally been used in reference to single sentences or to certain classes of non-sentential expressions which have single utterance independence in discourse (e.g. Hello).",
        "But consider again the traditional definition.",
        "Paraphrasing Searle (1969:48ft), a speech act is the use of an utterance directed at an addressee in the service of a set of intentions, namely,",
        "1.)",
        "the intention to produce a certain illocutionary effect in the addressee, 2.)",
        "the intention to produce this effect by getting the addressee to recognize the intention to produce the effect, and 3.)",
        "the intention to produce this recognition by means of the addressee's knowledge of the rules governing the utterance.",
        "There is nothing in this characterization that requires that utterance be understood as sentence.",
        "'use crucial point is that the utterance (of whatever length) serve the set of intentions represented by 1.)",
        "- 3.).",
        "A valid speech act can be regarded as defining an illocutionary mode which is governed by conventions which constrain the sorts of interpretations that can be given to utterances which occur within that mode (including our judgments on their appropriateness).",
        "These conventions also define the conditions that must be met for the target effect to be achieved.",
        "Thus for the utterance / will be home by noon to count as a promise (and not, say, as a prediction), it must be viewed as an utterance issued in the illocutionary mode of promising, which not only defines certain well-formcdness conditions on the utterance itself (making statements in the past tense e.g.",
        "I was home by noon impossible as direct speech act promises2), but also gives the criteria which determine whether the act is successful (including the felicity conditions.",
        "etc.).",
        "Similarly, for a series of utterances to count as a refutation, they must be seen as operating in the illocutionary mode of refutation, as for example, in the text below:",
        "(3) You have stated that 2 + 2 = 3.",
        "Rut take any two individual objects and any other two individual objects and place them in a",
        "row.",
        "Then count them.",
        "say, from left to right.",
        "What do you get?",
        "Not 3 but 4.",
        "Therefore, 2 + 2 cannot equal 3.",
        "We cannot interpret any of these utterances accurately unless we recognize that each contributes to the achievement of a focused goal.",
        "viz, a refutation.",
        "Once that intention is recognized, appropriateness and well-formedness conditions can be applied to the text: and the success of the act can be measured against the set of criteria which are relevant to refutations, including the usual felicity conditions, but also specific conditions on the production of factual evidence and the demonstration of contradiction.",
        "Following this new characterization of speech acts, yet another type can be described, operating not at the utterance level, or the supra-utterance level, but at the sub-utterance level.",
        "As an illustration of the phenomenon involved, consider the following unexceptionable utterance:",
        "(4) I told the guy at the door to watch out, but he wouldn't listen.",
        "The second reference to the guy of the first clause is made via the anaphoric pronoun he.",
        "But suppose, instead, a definite referring expression were used.",
        "Consider the following: (5) I told the guy at the door to watch out, but the person wouldn't listen.",
        "The person is a distinctly odd coreferent, and seems inappropriate3.",
        "An examination of this context reveals that the only definite4 referring expressions which corefer felicitously are pronominal epithets, such as the idiot, the fool.",
        "etc.",
        ": descriptions which can be given an interpretation as derogatives.",
        "such as the sophomore; and expressions whose literal interpretation contributes some sense of explanation to the situation being represented -- viz, that, though warned, the guy at the door didn't heed the warning -- as in the deaf:mute.",
        "It can be shown that the principle involved is a speech act-like phenomenon.",
        "First, it can be noted that the choice not to use the unmarked coreferent he.",
        "signals that the speaker has some special intention in mind.",
        "Second.",
        "following a suggestion in Bolinger (1977:7f1), it can be argued that a repeated definite description functions not only to refer but also to characterize the referent as having the sense of the definite description.",
        "Finally, it can be shown that all the acceptable definite descriptions in this context can be interpreted uniformly as offering an explanation5 for the failure to listen expressed by the second clause.",
        "Note that the choice of corefercnt in the case of the use of a definite referring expression is not, strictly speaking, lexically governed.",
        "Furthermore, the use of selectional features, as in Chomsky (1965) and more recent work on generative grammar, cannot constrain the context for such a choice.",
        "In short, the problem is one of interpretation, and appropriateness is governed by the intention being served by the choice of the referring expression.",
        "Consider, then, an utterance such as the following: (6) 1 told the guy at the door to watch ou4 but the idiot wouldn't listen.",
        "The difference between (4) and (6) is not merely one of different lexical items (he and the idiot).",
        "Rather, the use of the idiot makes (6) a more complex utterance than (4), involving an embedded speech act, namely, a characterization whose purpose is to express an attitude and thereby (indirectly) offer explanation."

        "If speech acts or speech act-like phenomena are found at many levels of discourse, and if it is not possible to give a syntactic definition of a speech act how can the notion of speech acts be integrated into a formal, and in particular, a computational analysis of discourse?",
        "The natural alternative to a syntactic definition is a semantic one6, and the approach to semantics which offers the greatest promise in treating discourse is the situation semantics being developed at Stanford by Jon Barwisc and John Perry (cf. Barwise (forthcoming), Barwise and Perry (1980), Elarwise and Perry (forthcoming, a), and Barwise and Perry (forthcoming, b)).",
        "Briefly, this new semantics is informed by the notion that the actual world can be thought of as consisting of situations, which in turn consist of objects having properties and standing in relationships.",
        "Any actual situation is far too rich in detail to be captured by any finite process, so in practice, perceptions of situations.",
        "beliefs about situations, natural language descriptions-of situations, etc.. are actually situation-types, which are partial functions characterizing various types of situations.",
        "(Cf. Barwise (1981) for a more complete discussion of this point) In situation semantics, sentences do not map directly to truth-values, but rather arc understood as designating situation-types.",
        "Totally understanding a statement would entail that one t able to derive a situation-type which includes all the objects, properties, and relationships represented in the statement.",
        "A series of statements in discourse can be viewed as creating, modifying, embellishing, or manipulating sets of situation-types.",
        "Some utterances invoke situation-types; some act as functions taking whole situation-types as arguments.",
        "For example, an initial act of reference coupled with some proposition about the referent can be seen as initiating the construction of a situation-type around the referent: an act of coreference, with some proposition, can be seen as adding a new property or relationship to an individual in an existing situation-type.",
        "The discourse situation, too, can be represented as a set of situation-types, initially containing at least the speaker, the addressee, and the mutual knowledge of speaker and addressee that they are in a discourse situation.",

        "It is in representing the effect of the utterance that the theory of speech acts has application.",
        "The dynamic process of discourse can be modelled as a step by step modification of the discourse situation, with each step taking the set of situation-types of the discourse situation, coupled with the interpretation of the utterance, to a new set of situation-types of the discourse situation.",
        "There arc many interesting details to this model which must be ignored in a paper of this scope, but several observations relevant to speech acts can be made.",
        "First,.",
        "this model accommodates the distinction made by most speech act theorists between what a speaker says – the locutionary act -- and what a speaker intends to communicate (or means) – the illocutionary act7.",
        "This distinction is repeated and captured here in the treatment of the actual discourse as a pair of sets of situation-types.",
        "One gives the set of situation-types of the text (written or spoken) St – and can be regarded as representing the locutionary aspect of the act.",
        "The other gives the set of situation-types of the discourse situation (including author and reader or speaker and addressee) -- sd – and can be regarded as representing the state of knowledge about the discourse -- including the information revealed by inferring the intentions of the speaker – at the time the utterance is produced.",
        "The interpretation of st relative to sd.",
        "f (<st. sda).",
        "gives a new set of situation-types of the discourse situation.",
        "sd'.",
        "The illocutionary act can be thought of as difference between sd' and sd.",
        "Second.",
        "this characterization of an illocutionary act is consonant with psychological features of actual discourse.",
        "In actual interaction, what the speaker says -- the locutionary act – is highly volatile: the exact words of an utterance more than a few seconds past may be lost forever.",
        "What remains is the effect of those words, in particular, as composed in longer-term memory.",
        "What is remembered represents the state achieved by the discourse, and that reflects directly what the addressee has inferrred about' the speaker's intentions.",
        "Put another way, what becomes stored as memory represents what the addressee inferred about what the speaker meant by his utterance.8 Third.",
        "one can regard the problem of interpreting the current status of the discourse as similar to the problem of deriving the current state in a STRIPS-like system (cf. Fikes and Nilsson (1971)): the correct version must be the result of the application of a series of operations, in correct order, to all previous states.",

        "Case (d) accounts for those instances where a situation-type is clearly established and a single word or reference can effect a change in the situation-type.",

        "speaker to watch out, and of having not listened, manifesting the violation of supposed normative behavior.",
        "The fact that the guy at the door has been referred to as the idiot has added a further property, or characterization.",
        "The situation-type of the text at the end of the utterance of the second clause includes the speaker with the property of having told the guy at the door to watch out and having judged him as an idiot for not listening, and the guy at the door who had been told to watch out by the speaker but who did not listen, and who has been judged to have behaved idiotically.",
        "(There actually are other relationships here, but a more complete description adds nothing to the general point being illustrated.)",
        "In this case, then, there are at least three steps in the \"semantic\" parsing of the utterance: the initial creation of the situation-type (the first clause), the interpretation of but, and the modification of the initial situation-type to accommodate the information in thc second clause.",

        "But more importantly, a speech act is not successfully performed until the addressee recognizes that its performance was attempted: and that recognition effects a change in the relationship between the speaker and the addressee.",
        "This change in relationship can be regarded as an effect of an operation on the set of situation-types of the discourse situation (not of the text).",
        "But a speech act, even if clearly understood as intended, is not successful unless it effects specific changes in the set of situation-types of the text.",
        "as well.",
        "Therefore, speech acts can be thought of as the effects of the application of one or more inference enabling functions to the pair of sets of situation-types giving the model of the discourse (f (<st, sd>)).",
        "It is possible to use situation-types as the basis of a definition of speech acts by requiring that speech acts be the result of the application of an inference enabling function to an utterance in a discourse situation such that the derived situation-type conforms to one of a (finite) number of speech act-types.",
        "In other words, for an utterance or a series of utterances to count as a speech act, the utterance or utterances must minimally",
        "(i) perform an operation on a situation-type, and",
        "(ii) derive a situation-type which is defined (for speaker and addressee) as the legitimate cnd state of a speech act.",
        "Sub-utterance speech acts can be accounted for, now, by viewing the situation-types of the text which they achieve as being dependent on or coincident with the situation-types achieved by the whole of the utterance in which they are embedded.",
        "Of course, there must be an accompanying operation on the situation-type of the discourse situation representing the effect of the perceived intention to achieve the sub-utcrance speech act -- as in the marked choice of a definite referring expression instead of a simple pronoun, as in (6).",
        "Supra-utterance speech acts can also be captured in this framework.",
        "A speech act like REFUTE, for example, cannot be defined in terms of any specifiable number of steps, or any specifiable ordering of operations.",
        "Its only possible definition is in terms of a final state in which all the conditions on refutation have been satisfied.",
        "In terms of situation semantics, this corresponds to a set of situation-types -- albeit very complex -- in which all the necessary relationships hold.",
        "Since such complex sets of situation-types represent the accumulated effects of all the operations which have occurred, without representing the order of application of those operations, there is nothing in the definition of REFUTE that requires that a specific order of operations be carried out.",
