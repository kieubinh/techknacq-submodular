        "Decomposition of the problem of \"language understanding\" into manageable subproblems has always posed a major challenge to the development theories of, and systems for, natural-language processing.",
        "More or less distinct components are conventionally proposed for handling syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and inference.",
        "While disagreement exists as to what phenomena properly belong in each area, and how much or what kinds of interaction there are among these components, there is fairly widespread concurrence as to the overall organization of linguistic processing.",
        "Central to this approach is the idea that the processing of an utterance involves producing an expression or structure that is in some sense a representation of the literal meaning of the utterance.",
        "It is often maintained that understanding what an utterance literally means consists in being able to recover this representation.",
        "In philosophy and linguistics this sort of representation is usually said to display the logical form of an utterance, so we will refer (somewhat looseT77- to the representations themselves as \"logical forms.\" This paper surveys what we at SRI view as some of the key problems encountered in defining a system of representation for the logical forms of English sentences, and suggests possible approaches to their solution.",
        "We will first look at some general issues related to the notion of logical form, and then discuss a number of problems associated with the way information involving certain key concepts is expressed in English.",
        "Although our main concern here is with theoretical issues rather than with system performance, this paper is not merely speculative.",
        "The DIALOGIC system currently under development in the SRI Artificial Intelligence Center parses English sentences and translates them into logical forms embodying many of the ideas presented here."

      "text": [
        "The first question to ask is, why even have a level of logical form?",
        "After all, sentences of natural languages are themselves conveyers of meaning; that is what natural languages are for.",
        "The reason for having logical forms is to present the literal meanings of sentences more perspicuously than do the sentences themselves.",
        "It is sometimes said that natural-language sentences do not \"wear their meanings on their sleeves\"; logical forms are intended to do exactly that.",
        "From this perspective, the main desideratum for a system of logical form is that its semantics be compositional.",
        "That is, the meaning of a complex expression should depend only on the meaning of its subexpressions.",
        "This is needed for meaning-dependent computational processes to cope with logical forms of arbitrary complexity.",
        "If there is to be any hope of maintaining an intellectual grasp of what these processes are doing, they must be decomposable into smaller and smaller meaning-dependent subprocesses operating on smaller and smaller meaningful pieces of a logical form.",
        "For instance, if identifying the entities referred to by an utterance is a subprocess of inferring the speaker's intentions, there must be identifiable pieces of the logical form of the utterance that constitute referring expressions.",
        "Having logical forms be semantically compositional is the ultimate expression of this kind of decomposability, as it renders every well-formed subexpression a locus of meaning--and therefore a potential locus of meaning-dependent processing.",
        "This is probably a more telling argument for semantic compositionality in designing language-processing systems than in analyzing human language, but it can be reasonably argued that such design principles must be followed by any system, whether natural or artificial, that has to adapt to a complex environment (see [Simon, 1969], especially Chapter 4)â€¢1 Logical form, therefore, is proposed as a level of representation distinct from surface-syntactic form, because there is apparently no direct way to semantically interpret natural language sentences in a compositional fashion.",
        "Some linguists and philosophers have challenged this assumption [Montague, 1974a] Plarwise and Cooper, 1981j, but the complexity of their proposed systems and the limited range of syntactic forms they consider leave seriout doubt that the logical-form level can be completely bypassed.2 Beyond being compositional, it is desirable--though perhaps not essential--that the meaning of a logical form also be independent of the context in which the associated utterance occurs.",
        "(The meaning of an expression in natural language, of course, is often context-dependent.)",
        "A language-processing system must eventually produce a context-independent representation of what the speaker means by an utterance because the content of the utterance will normally be subjected to further processing after the original context has been lost.",
        "In the many cases in which the speaker's intended meaning is simply the literal meaning, a context-independent logical form would give us the representation we need.",
        "There is little doubt that some representation of this sort is required.",
        "For example, much of our general knowledge of the world is derived from simple assertions of fact in natural language, but our situation would be hopeless if, for every fact we knew, we had to remember the context in which it was obtained before we could use it appropriately.",
        "Imagine trying to decide what to do with a tax refund by having to recall whether the topic of conversation was rivers or financial institutions the first time one heard that banks were good places in which to keep money.",
        "As this example suggests, context independence is closely related to the resolution of ambiguity.",
        "For any given ambiguity, it is possible to find a case in which the information needed to resolve it is derived from the context of an utterance.",
        "Therefore, if the meanings of logical forms are to be context-independent, the system of logical forms must provide distinct, unambiguous representations for all possible readings of an ambiguous utterance.",
        "The question remains whether logical form should also provide ambiguous representations to handle cases in which the disambiguating information is obtained later or is simply general world knowledge.",
        "The pros and cons of such an approach are far from clear, so we will generally assume only unambiguous logical forms.",
        "Although it is sometimes assumed that a context-independent representation of the literal meaning of a sentence can be derived by using syntactic and semantic knowledge only, some pragmatic factors must also be taken into account.",
        "To take a concrete example, suppose the request \"Please list the Nobel Prize winners in physics,\" is followed by the question \"Who are the Americans?\" The phrase \"the Americans\" in the second utterance should almost certainly be interpreted as",
        "referring to American winners of the Nobel Prize in physics, rather than all inhabitants or citizens of the United States, as it might be understood in isolation.",
        "If the logical form of the utterance is to reflect the intended interpretation, processes that are normally assigned to pragmatics must be used to derive it.",
        "One could attempt to avoid this consequence by representing \"the Americans\" at the level of logical form as literally meaning all Americans, and have later pragmatic processing restrict the interpretation to American winners of the Nobel Prize in physics.",
        "There are other cases, however, for which this sort of move is not available.",
        "Consider more carefully the adjective \"American.\" American people could be either inhabitants or citizens of the United States; American cars could be either manufactured or driven in the United States; American food could be food produced or consumed in or prepared in a style indigenous to the United States.",
        "In short, the meaning of \"American\" seems to be no more than \"bearing some contextually determined relation to the United States.\" Thus, there is no definite context-independent meaning for sentences containing modifiers like \"American.\" The same is true for many uses of \"have,\" \"of,\" possessives, locative prepositions [Herskovits, 19801 and compound nominals.",
        "The only way to hold fast to the position that the construction of logical-form precedes all pragmatic processing seems to be to put in \"dummy\" symbols for the unknown relations.",
        "This may in fact be very useful in building an actual system,3 but it is hard to imagine that such a level of representation would bear much theoretical weight.",
        "We will thus assume that a theoretically interesting level of logical form will have resolved contextually dependent definite references, as well as the other \"local\" pragmatic indeterminacies mentioned.",
        "An important consequence of this view is that sentences Esse do not have logical forms; only sentences in context do.-11 we speak loosely of the logical form of a sentence, this is how it should be interpreted.",
        "If we go this far, why not say that all pragmatic processing takes place before the logical form is constructed?",
        "That is, why make any distinction at all between what the speaker intends the hearer to infer from an utterance and what the utterance literally means?",
        "There are two answers to this.",
        "The first is that, while the pragmatic factors we have introduced into the derivation of logical form so far are rather narrowly circumscribed (e.g., resolving definitely determined noun phrases), the inference of speaker intentions is completely open-ended.",
        "The problem confronting the hearer is to answer the question, \"Why would the speaker say that in this situation?\" Practically any relevant knowledge that the speaker and hearer mutually possess [Clark and Marshall, 1981] [Cohen and Perrault, 19811 may be brought to bear in answering this question.",
        "From a purely methodological standpoint, then, one would hope to define some more restricted notion of meaning as an intermediate step in developing the broader theory.",
        "Even putting aside this methodological concern, it seems doubtful that a theory of intended meaning can be colletructed without a concomitant theory of literal meaning, because the latter notion appears to play an explanatory role in the former theory.",
        "Specifically, the literal meaning of an utterance is one of those things from which hearers infer speakers intentions.",
        "For instance, in the appropriate context, \"I'm getting cold\" could be a request to close a window.",
        "The only way for the hearer to understand this as a request, however, is to recover the literal content of the utterance, i.e., that the speaker is getting cold, and to infer from this that the speaker would like him to do something about it.",
        "In summary, the notion of logical form we wish to capture is essentially that of a representation of the \"literal meaning in context\" of an utterance.",
        "To facilitate further processing, it is virtually essential that the meaning of logical-form expressions be compositional and, at the same time, it is highly desirable that they be context-independent., The latter condition requires that a system of logical form furnish distinct representations for the different readings of ambiguous natural-language expressions.",
        "It also requires that some limited amount of pragmatic processing be involved in producing those representations.",
        "Finally, we note that not all pragmatic factors in the use of language can be reflected in the logical form of an utterance, because some of those factors are dependent on information that the logical form itself provides."

        "Developing a theory of the logical form of English sentences is as much an exercise in knowledge representation as in linguistics, but it differs from most work in artificial intelligence on knowledge representation in one key respect.",
        "Knowledge representation schemes are usually intended by their designers to be as general as possible and to avoid commitment to any particular concepts.",
        "The essential problem for a theory of logical form, however, is to represent specific concepts that natural languages have special features for expressing information about.",
        "Concepts that fall in this category include:",
        "* Events, actions, and processes * Time and space * Collective entities and substances * Propositional attitudes and modalities.",
        "A theory of logical form of natural-language expressions, therefore, is primarily concerned with the content rather than the form of representation.",
        "Logic, semantic networks, frames, scripts, and production systems are all different forms of representation.",
        "But to say merely that one has adopted one of these forms is to say nothing about content, i.e., what is represented.",
        "The representation used in this paper, of course, takes a particular form (higher-order logic with intensional operators) but relatively little will be said about developing or refining that form.",
        "Rather, we will be concerned with the question of what particular predicates, functions, operators, and the like are needed to represent the content of English expressions involving concepts in the areas listed above.",

      "text": [
        "As mentioned previously, the basic framework we will use to represent the logical form of English sentences is higher-order logic (i.e., higher-order predicate calculus), augmented by intensional operators.",
        "At a purely notational level, all well-formed expressions will be in \"Cambridge Polish\" form, as in the programming Language LISP; thus, the logical form of \"John likes Mary\" will be simply (LIKE JOHN MARY).",
        "Despite our firm belief in the principle of semantic compositionality, we will not attempt to give a formal semantics for the logical forms we propose.",
        "Hence, our",
        "adherence to that principle is a good-faith intention rather than a demonstrated fact.",
        "It should be noted, though, that virtually all the kinds of logical constructs used here are drawn from more formal work of logicians and philosophers in which rigorous semantic treatments are provided.",
        "The only place in which our logical language differs significantly from more familiar systems is in the treatment of quantifiers.",
        "Normally the English determiners \"every\" and \"some\" are translated as logical quantifiers that bind a single variable in an arbitrary formula.",
        "This requires using an appropriate logical connective to combine the contents of the noun phrase governed by the determiner with the contents of the rest of the sentence.",
        "Thus \"Every P is Q\" becomes (EVERY X (IMPLIES (P X) (Q X))).",
        "and \"Some P is Q\" becomes",
        "It seems somewhat inelegant to have to use different connectives to join (P X) and (Q X) in the two cases, but semantically it works.",
        "In an extremely interesting paper, Barwise and Cooper [1981] point out (and, in fact, prove) that there are many determiners in English for which this approach does not work.",
        "The transformations employed in standard logic to handle \"every\" and \"some\" depend on the fact that any statement about every P or some P is logically equivalent to a statement about everything or something; for example, \"Some P is Q\" is equivalent to \"Something is P and Q.\" What Itemise and Cooper show is that there is no such transformation for determiners like \"most\" or \"more than half.\" That is, statements about most P's or more than half the P's cannot be rephrased as statements about most things or more than half of all things.",
        "Barwise and Cooper incorporate this insight into a rather elaborate system modeled after Montague's, so that, among other things, they can assign a denotation to arbitrary noun phrases out of context.",
        "Adopting a more conservative modification of standard logical notation, we will simply insist that all quantified formulas have an additional element expressing the restriction of the quantifier.",
        "\"Most P's are Q\" will thus be represented by",

        "In a paper that covers such a wide range of disparate topics, it is hard to reach any sweeping general conclusions, but perhaps a few remarks about the nature and current status of the research program are in order.",
        "First, it should be clear from the issues discussed that at least as many problems remain in the quest for logical form as have already been resolved.",
        "Considering the amount of effort that has been expended upon natural-language semantics, this is somewhat surprising.",
        "The reason may be that relatively few researchers have worked in this area for its own sake.",
        "Davidson's ideas on action sentences, for instance, raised some very interesting points about logical form â€“ but the major debate it provoked in the philosophical literature was about the metaphysics of the concept of action, not about the semantics of action sentences.",
        "Even when semantics is a major concern, as in the work of Montague, the emphasis is often on showing that relatively well-understood subareas of semantics (e.g., quantification) can be done in a particular way, rather than on attempting to take on really new problems.",
        "An additional difficulty is that so much work has been done in a fragmentary fashion.",
        "It is clear that the concept of action is closely related to the concept of time, but it is hard to find any work on either concept that takes the other one seriously.",
        "To build a language-processing system or a theory of language processing, however, requires an integrated theory of logical form, not just a set of incompatible fragmentary theories.",
        "Our conclusion, then, is that if real progress is to be made on understanding the logical form of natural-language utterances, it must be studied in a unified way and treated as an important research problem in its own right."

      "text": [
        "1 Although our immediate aim is to construct a theory of natural-language processing rather than truth-conditional semantics, it is worth noting that a system of logical form with a well-defined semantics constitutes a bridge between the two projects.",
        "If we have a processing theory that associates English sentences with their logical forms, and if those logical forms have a truth-conditional semantics, then we will have specified the semantics of the English sentences as well.",
        "2 In other papers (e.g., (Montague, 1974b1), Montague himself uses an intensional logic in exactly the role we propose for logical form--and for much the same reason: \"We could ... introduce the semantics of our fragment [of English] directly; but it is probably more perspicuous to proceed indirectly by (1) setting up a certain simple artificial language, that of tensed intensional logic, (2) giving the semantics of that language, and (3) interpreting English indirectly by showing in a rigorous way how to translate it into the artificial language.",
        "This is the procedure we shall adopt;...\" [Montague, 1974b, p.256].",
        "3 The DIALOGIC system does build such a representation, or at least components of one, as an intermediate step in deriving the logical form of a sentence.",
        "4 This suggests that our logical forms are representations of what David Kaplan, in his famous unpublished paper on demonstratives [Kaplan, 1977], calls the content of a sentence, as opposed to its character.",
        "Kaplan introduces the content/character distinction to sort out puzzles connected with the use of demonstratives and indexicals.",
        "He notes that there are at least two different notions of \"the meaning of a sentence\" that conflict when indexical expressions are used.",
        "If A says to B, \"I am hungry,\" and B says to A, \"I am hungry,\" they have used the same words, but in one sense they mean different things.",
        "After all, it may be the case that what A said is true and what B said is false.",
        "If A says to B, \"I am hungry,\" and B says to A, \"You are hungry,\" they have used different words, but mean the same thing, that A is hungry.",
        "This notion of \"meaning different things\" or \"meaning the same thing\" is one kind of meaning, which Kaplan calls \"content.\" There is another sense, though, in which A and B both use the words \"I am hungry\" with the same meaning, namely, that the same rules apply to determine, in context, what content is expressed.",
        "For this notion of meaning, Kaplan uses the term \"character.\" Kaplan's notion, therefore, is that the rules of the language determine the character of a sentence--which, in turn, together with the context of utterance, determines the content.",
        "If we broaden the scope of Kaplan's theory to include the local pragmatic indeterminacies we have discussed, it seems that the way they depend on context would also be part of the character of a sentence and that our logical form is thus a representation of the content of the sentence-in-context.",
        "5 It should be obvious from the example that nouns referring to units of measure â€“ e.g., \"feet\"--are an exception to the general rule.",
        "We treat types of quantities, such as distance, weight, volume, time",
        "duration, etc., as basic conceptual categories.",
        "Following Hayes [1979], units such as feet, pounds, gallons, and hours are considered to be functions from numbers,to quantities.",
        "Thus (FEET 3) and (YARDS 1) denote the same distance.",
        "Relations like length, weight, size, and duration hold between an entity and a quantity of an appropriate type.",
        "Where a word like \"weight\" serves in English to refer to both the relation and the quantity, we must be careful to distinguish between them.",
        "To see the distinction, note that length, beam, and draft are all relations between a ship and a quantity of the same type, distance.",
        "We treat comparatives like \"greater than\" as multidomain relations, working with any two quantities of the same type (or with pure numbers, for that matter).",
        "6 Hendrix [1973], Rieger [19751, Hayes [1978], and McDermott [1981] have all dealt with continuous processes to some extent, but none of them has considered specifically how language expresses information about processes.",
        "7 This point was impressed upon me by Pat Hayes."
