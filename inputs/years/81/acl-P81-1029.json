        "While the following description of these levels may not correspond to any one implementation in particular, it will give the flavor of the overall approach.",

        "Other likely schemes for sentences involving the SUPPORT verbs are \"<physobj> SUPPORTS <physobj> AT <locpart>,\" \"<physobj> SUPPORTS <force>,\" \"<physobj> IS SUPPORTED,\" and \"<locpart> IS SUPPORTED.",
        "\"(Novak) Once a particular sentence has matched a schema, it is useful to rephrase the information in a more \"canonical\" form, so that a single of inference rules can apply to a group of schemes.",
        "1.2 Canonical Level This intermediate level of representation usually consists of the verb itself, (or perhaps a more primitive Semantic predicate chosen to represent the verb) and a list of possible roles, e.g. arguments to the predicate.",
        "These roles correspond loosely to a union of the various semantic types indicated in the schemes.",
        "The schemes above could all easily map into: SUPPORTS(<physobj>1,<physobj>2, <locpart>,<force>).",

        "(Charniak), (Wilke) 1.3 Predicate Level However, the implied relationships between the arguments still have to be spelled out, and this is the function of our third and final level of representation.",
        "This level necessarily makes use of predicates that can be found in the data base, and for the purposes of the program is effectively a \"deep\" semantic representation.",
        "A verb such as SUPPORT would require several predicates in an equilibrium domain.",
        "For example, the 'scaffold' sentence above could result in the following list corresponding to the general predicates listed immediately below.",
