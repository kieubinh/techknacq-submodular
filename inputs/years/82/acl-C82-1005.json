        "Although a subdomain of medicine is a current system application, the change or development of the conversation field may be facilitated.",
        "It requires only that a new dictionary will be established and some expert parts of semantical interpreter will be changed.",
        "Our system contains two stages: syntactical analysis and semantical interpretation.",
        "Both stages cooperate with each other in such a way that the second stage checks up on the correctness of syntactical structures which have been built by the first one.",
        "Finally, the parser produces a formula of First Order Predicate Calculus which corresponds to the input sentence.",
        "Other outputs as MINSKY frames or FUZZY formulas are considered.",
        "We used the CATN method (Cascaded ATN) (14) to implement the system.",
        "The CATN possesses all of the advantages which proved true in natural language processing.",
        "A high degree of universality is a very important feature of the system.",
