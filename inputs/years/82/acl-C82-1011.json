        "This paper describes a system which interprets the semantic theme of a text as a mapping of the semantic network of states associated in the text with one or more theme objects onto an established semantic frame.",
        "Theme objects are determined on the basis of the syntactic distinction of thematic and rhematic (topic - comment) components of a sentence.",
        "The concept of \"a frame\" as used here is that of a semantic representation of experiences whose functional roles are related, rather than of a psychological representation, where physical properties of an object which do not bear any functional relevance to the definition of the object and its relationship to other components of the frame are included.",
        "The problem of recognizing ccntinuity and shifts in text analysis is generally defined in terms of identifying the text's themes.",
        "It is apparent from examples like (1 - 2) that a system which tries to discover continuity on the sole basis of searching for antecedent references for a pronoun or synonym is inadequate where a text is developed through the techniques of elaboration, analogy, comparison and other styles involving implied dependency.",

        "(2) Harold notified his lawyer.",
        "A storm was brewing.",
        "In order to identify the implied theme object in text samples such as these, the system described in this paper makes use of the distinction pf the syntactic categories \"theme\" and \"rheme\" developed by the Prague School of Linguistics.",

        "frame which can be reasonably associated with it in the given context and links the frame with those established in the preceding text.",
        "The objects which are the primary referents of a sentential theme are assigned the role of being major nodes through which one frame is linked directly or, where more abstract associations can be inferred, indirectly with others relevant to the continuity of the text.",
        "The concept of \"frame\" is that described in M. Minsky (1977).",
        "In the following sections the concepts of \"theme\" and \"frame\" are defined more explicitly and the manner in which the system relates them to each other is described.",
        "While the system is designed to operate on English text, comparisons will be made to Czech.",
        "THEMES Within the grammatical theory of the Prague School of Linguistics a sentence is composed of a minimum of two major constituents - a \"theme\" (\"topic\") and a \"rheme\" (\"comment\").",
        "(A sentence may also contain components which function as a transition between these two, but such components will not be discussed here.)",
        "The theme - rheme division of a sentence typically conforms, in non-contrastive environments, to the NP subject and VP major constituents of a sentence, with the theme being the first of these to appear in the surface word order of the sentence.",
        "Because of its more restrictive word order, the theme of a sentence in English is normally its subject.",
        "In Czech, however, a sentential subject may more easily appear in the latter part of a sentence.",
        "In its attempt to associate the theme of a sentence with a frame, our system reduces the object of its operation to a \"theme object\", defining this for English as the referent of the highest noun within the theme .constituent: normally, the subject head noun.",
        "Within VPs functioning in English sentences as theme the theme object would be the direct object's head noun, or, given other contrastive stress, the head noun of the phrase containing the highest peak of intonation were the sentence spoken.",
        "It is important to note that the theoretical basis for labelling a sentence constituent as theme does not necessarily mean that the theme object has been previously mentioned in the text.",
        "The immediate introduction of new theme objects in English is obvious from the existence of non-definite themes in examples like (3).",
        "(3) The old hotel burned down last year.",
        "A new restaurant is to take its place.",
        "However, unless some relation can be found between contextually new themes and the existing context, sentences with non-definite themes would be either make a text discontinuous or would maintain their continuity only indirectly through the relation of the theme to another noun in the same sentence which is anaphoric.",
        "In either case there would be little justification for assigning a thematic function to non-definite nouns, and the general definition of theme proposed by the Prague School would have to be greatly altered or dropped.",
        "FRAME BASED RECOGNITION OF THEME CONTINUITY 73 The association of themes with frames provides continuity without the requirement for explicit previous mention.",
        "The claim made in associating themes and frames is that themes are not referentially simple: their meaning involves reference not only to some individual, act, event, etc., but also reference to some structured set of these with which the noun referent is associated.",
        "Continuity lies in the existence of an assumed shared relation holding between a theme and other objects previously mentioned.",
        "FRAMES A frame may be generally defined as a limited complex of objects, acts, events, and/or states, whose association is determined by convention or experience and is assumed and expected by a speaker or author to be known by his or her audience.",
        "Simple frames include: the association of the objects \"the bathroom\" (\"koupelna\"), \"the bedrooms\" (\"lo/nice\"), \"the kitchen\" (\"kuchyng\"), \"the roof\" (\"sttecha\"), etc., with the frame \"h3use\", or the sequence \"the morning\" (\"rgno\" a \"dopoledne\"), \"noon\" (\"poledne\"), etc., as parts of the frame \"day\".",
        "Reference to one member of a frame suffices to make other members of the frame available as possible themes.",
        "For example, mention of \"the kitchen and bathroom\" implies the frame \"house\", and this mention, if themes are assumed to be bound to frames, suffices to allow the occurrence of \"the house\", \"the garden\" or other associated object as a theme in a later sentence.",
        "The primary, characteristics of a frame, as defined in our natural language system, and distinguishing frames from other relational structures, are that each member of the frame must be uniquely identifiable (This uniqueness also specifies the member's role in the frame.)",
        "and that the members share a common relation or property which uniquely characterizes the frame to which they belong.",
        "Recognition that a given object is a unique member of a frame is the attribution of the property of \"definiteness\" to that object.",
        "A non-definite theme is interpreted as a description of a frame object, but the reference itself as definite."

        "Themes and frames are related to each other through the following process.",
        "The main components of the system include: - a parser - a lexicon, providing not only the possible syntactic and semantic representations of each lexical item and conditions on their use, but also an index to the frames normally associated with the entry - a frame dictionary, stating the set types of the possible members for each frame and their relationship to each other within the frame - a set of logical inference and interpretive rules, which can be used to relate frames in the construction of a frame system representing changes in the continuity and development of a text - a list of frames currently activated by theme reference, interpretation or inference 74 1J.T.",
        "CRITZ During the parse of a sentence the head noun of the sentence is selected as the most likely candidate for being its theme and, provided that tests of the sentence and the one preceding it do not indicate a contrastive environment requiring the selection of another noun as theme, declares it to be the theme.",
        "The frames indexed in the lexical entry for the theme noun are then searched and compared for identity with or inclusion within those frames currently active.",
        "Those frames most recently used and those which aye associated with anaphoric noun phrases within the sentence are examined first.",

        "Comparing the processing of English and Czech texts, it is important to note that while most frames can be expected to be the same for both languages, frame membership and relations between frame members which are dependent on cultural, political, linguistic and similar differences will cause frames to differ at least at the lower node levels.",
