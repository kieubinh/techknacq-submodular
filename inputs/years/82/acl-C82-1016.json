        "It is a well-known fact that (computational) models of human language production and understanding have to take the knowledge of the speaker and the listener into consideration.",
        "Thus, one of the main problems is to describe and represent this knowledge and to distinguish relevant subtypes.",
        "A suitable classification which I described in detail in Habel [7] distinguishes three subtypes: - knowledge of facts or assertions, e.g. of states of the world, events, etc., the 'factual knowledge', - knowledge of rules, e.g. of rule-like relations between objects or states of the world (or classes of such entities), the 'inferential knowledge', - knowledge of objects, e.g. of persons in the world, the 'referential knowledge'.",
        "(In this paper I give emphasis to the third type: referential knowledge represented by 'Referential Nets').",
        "The common core for representing all these types of knowledge is the 'semantic representation language' 'SRL.",
        "From the formal point of view SRL is a (propositional) symbolic language as described by Kalish/Montague [8].",
        "Well-formed SRL-expressions are generated by normal (recursive) formation rules.",
        "I distinguish - as usual - two kinds of meaningful expressions in SRL, terms and formulas.",
        "Thus we define: TER - the set of well-formed terms FOR - the set of well-formed formulas SRL = <FOR, TER> For the purpose of knowledge representation SRL contains some specific operators, e.g. on the factual level: tenses, beliefs on the inferential level: entailment relation,... on the referential level: description operators of various types.",
        "Since SRL is a representation language, I now have to treat the central question of 'representation theory': What kinds of entities are represented by the different entities of SRL?",
        "Here I follow - with minor changes, which I will not discuss in this paper - Miller [10):.",
        "The expressions and entities of SRL represent cognitive concepts.",
        "The operators correspond to different types of 'concepts' in the Miller-approach, e.g. predicative , nominal and modifying concepts (this third class are the 'operators' of Miller.).",
        "E.g. by means of description operators it is .possible to construct nominal concepts from",
        "102 CH.",
        "U. HABEL predicative concepts or other nominal concepts.",
        "I shall now illustrate SRL with an example.",
        "In urderstanding and representing the sentence (1) I will meet Barbara in the university tomorrow.",
        "the act of referring to \"I\", \"Barbara\", and \"the university\" is to be processed, i.e. the (object-)orientation to them is the interesting problem from the referential point of view.",
        "The SRL representation of (1) is (2) time (meeting (I,Barbara, ETA(x) :university(x) ),tomorrow) The arguments of \"time\" and \"meeting\" present the most relevant types of referential operators: \"I\" and \"tomorrow\" are deictic substitutes (personal or temporal), Barbara is a proper name and the expression \"ETA(x): university(x)\" is built up from the nominal concept \"university\" (representing a class of institutions for education and science) and the variable-binding description operator \"ETA\".",
        "\"ETA(x): p(x)\" has the meaning \"an element from the class {x/p(x)}\".",
        "ETA is an indefinite analogy to the IOTA-operator of formal logics (Similar operators are introduced by Hilbert as EPSILON or ETA-operator.).",
        "The semantics of the description operators is given by a set of inference and evaluation rules.",
        "E.g. there is an inference rule which relates the ETA-expressions to expressions with existential quantification:",
        "(3) p( ETA(x) : q(x) ) EX x : p(x) & q(x) 1* Some evaluation rules will be described in the following chapters, e.g. 'creation of a referential object'.",
        "(Both types of rules are described in detail in Habel [5], (6].)",
        "Thus, ETA is the formal representative of one of the meanings of indefinite articles.",
        "Further descriptions of the objects mentioned in (1) or in the SRL expression (2) can be generated by (focussing) transformations similar to the solution of algebraic equations: The university mentioned above is also the one described by (4) ETA(x) :time ( meeting(I,Barbara, university(x)),tomorrow ) 2*",
        "or the natural language equivalent \"a (the) university where Barbara and I will meet tomorrow\".",
        "(The uniqueness of the ETA-description depends on the situational/textual context.)",
        "Before we pass on to a detailed description of 'referential nets', I will make a short remark on discourse and communication.",
        "As mentioned above human language production and understanding is based on the speaker-listener's knowledge of the language, the world and particularly the participants in the communication.",
        "Thus, I assume a discourse model 3* which is based on tripartite knowledge (namely factual, inferential, and referential), each of these types is represented by structured sets of SRL-expressions.",
        "2.",
        "THE REFERENTIAL NET Processing, e.g. storing or retrieving, referential relations is executed by a particular component of the discourse processing system, the 'referential procedures' (ReP).",
        "The RePs work on a memory structure which is adequate for the representation of knowledge about objects, the 'referential net' (RefN) 4*.",
        "A RefN consists of entities of three different types: - referential objects (RefOs), which are the internal substitutes for the objects spoken about, - descriptions, i.e. terms of SRL which describe the RefOs, - attributes, i.e. properties of the description-relation between a Ref() and one of its descriptions or properties of the Ref() (see chap.",
        "3).",
        "After detecting a new indefinite description (as ETA(x) : university(x)) ReP creates a new \"referential object\" (RefO).",
        "During the discourse (after the identification process) further descriptions of the same Ref() will be linked to this RefO.",
        "(The relation among the descriptions of the same RefO is the wellknown relation of coreference.)",
        "Thus we have, for example, the following set of descriptions of the Ref0 mentioned above :",
        "(5) d.11-ETA(x) : university(x) d.12--ETA(x): time (meeting(I,Barbara,university(x)),tomorrow) d.13--IOTA(x) : professor-at(Barbara,university(x))"

        "For the description of the referential net I use SRL and in addition a \"finite but extendable\" set, REFO, of 'referential objects'.",
        "The referential objects are seen as a kind of basic term of SRL.",
        "The set REFO is analogous to the set of variables.",
        "The phrase \"finite but extendable\" is used to emphasize the dynamic aspect of the set REFO and the RefN.",
        "REFO consists of exactly those RefOs that are actually needed.",
        "It is necessary to distinguish two types of terms, one type which consists of the mental representatives, i.e. the Ref Os, and the other which contains those terms which function as descriptions.",
        "Naming this set by D-TER we have TER - REFO U D-TER.",
        "Thus, referential nets, RefNs, can be defined as",
        "(6) RefN D-TER x UFO â€¢",
        "For <d-ter, r.i> E RefN I also use \"d-ter descr r.i\" , \"d-ter is a description of r.i\".",
        "In this way a description-relation is defined on the basis of the RefN.",
        "By means of referential nets it is possible, e.g. to arrive at one object (i.e. Ref0) via different aspects, i.e. different descriptions, of this object.",
        "It is only by such aspects (cp.",
        "Schank's (11] way of memory discrimination), that a system is able to choose \"a best description\" of the objects which are the theme of the discourse (see below).",
        "The referential net (5) is simplified in two crucial points, first, that the descriptions of r.1 operate on MSRL expressions and not on RefOs, too.",
        "But this can be treated similarly to the focussing process of (4), which can be formalized now: (7) p(r.i) r.i ETA(x) : p(x) Using (7), the descriptions can be solved with respect to all RefOs, i.e. all arguments are filled by RefOs or open terms.",
        "Thus we can derive (8) from (5):",
        "Secondly, ReP has td explicate the referential links of deictic substitutes, e.g. \"I\" refers to the speaker, etc.. stands for the specific ReP which evaluates deictic expressions, i.e. which instantiates deictic expressions with RefOs, e.g. \"I\" SPEAKER(1) (cp.",
        "fn 6.).",
        "By the same methods new RefOs for \"we\" can be created, e.g. in the processing of \"There we will discuss some papers.\" (We * Barbara + I)",

        "ATTRIBUTES IN REFERENTIAL NETS",
        "I will now extend the basic two-place relation between RefOs and descriptions to the more adequate concept of a many-place referential relation.",
        "The additional places will be called 'attributes'.",
        "In the first step of extention I give emphasis to 'attributes of descriptions'.",
        "They represent properties of the description relation, i.e. of pairs <d, r> E RefN.",
        "Thus, the extention to an attributed RefN (ARefN) uses a set ATT of attributes and changes (6) to",
        "(9) ARefN ATT x D-TER x REFO .",
        "For <att, d, r > E ARefN I also say \"att is an attribute of d with regard to r\".",

        "5* A simple strategy for de-/coding is: \"Use/try the description or Ref0 with highest degrees !\" - names of persons, e.g. participants of earlier discourses.",

        "U. HABEL",
        "Before I explain the concept of 'attributes to lescriptions' by some examples, I will now sketch some aspects of function and status of the attributes.",
        "Firstly, in both processes, analysis as well as generation of referential expressions, it is necessary to take into consideration a set of alternatives.",
        "All of them are possible candidates to be the referent (in analyzing) or to be a good description (in producing) respectively.",
        "The goal of the ReP is to choose exactly one from the alternatives, namely 'the best'.",
        "It is obvious that trying to choose the best can fail.",
        "Then the decision has to be revised afterwards.",
        "(But this is a total different problem.)",
        "In other words, the function of the attributes is to point to the most appropriate (or being more careful: to that which seems to be the most appropriate) of the alternatives.",
        "Secondly, I think that, on one hand, knowing and processing attributes is part of human natural language processing, and therefore, these attributes have to be part of the discourse processing model.",
        "On the other hand, knowledge of attributes is different (cp.",
        "the list of possible attributes, above) from the factual or referential knowledge.",
        "Thus, I propose a strict separation between descriptions and their attributes.",
        "This strict distinction contrasts to Webber's [12] solution: her use of the 'evoke'-predicate mixes the concepts of descriptions and their attributes in a cognitive inadequate manner.",
