        "Much of the work on code-switching is in the sociolinguistic framework and also at the discourse level.",

        "Space does not permit a detailed comparison.)",
        "The discourse level of code-switching is important, however, it is only at the intrasentential level that we are able to observe with some certainty, the interaction between two grammatical systems.",
        "These interactions, to the extent they can be systematically characterized, provide a nice framework for investigating some processing issues both from the generation and parsing points of view.",
        "There are some important characteristics of intrasentential code-switching which give hope for the kind of work described here.",
        "These are as follows.",
        "1.",
        "The situation which we are concerned with involves participants who are about equally fluent in both languages.",
        "2.",
        "Participants have fairly consistent judgements about the \"acceptability\" of mixed sentences.",
        "(In fact it is amazing that participants have such acceptability judgements at all.)",
        "3.",
        "Mixed utterances are spoken without hesitation, pauses, repetitions, corrections, etc., suggesting that intrasentential code-switching is not some random interference of one system with the other.",
        "Rather, the switches seem to be due to systematic interactions between the two systems.",
        "4.",
        "The two language systems seem to be simultaneously active.",
        "5.",
        "Intrasentential code-switching is sharply distinguished from other interferences such as borrowing, learned use of foreign words, filling lexical gaps,,etc.",
        "all of which could be exhibited by monolingual speakers.",
        "6.",
        "Despite extensive intrasentential switching, speakers and hearers usually agree on which language the mixed sentence is \"caning from\".",
        "We call this language the matrix",
        "language and the other language the embedded language.",
        "These interesting characteristics of the mixed sentences suggest that the two language systems are systematirally interacting with each other in the production (and recognition) of the mixed sentences.",
        "Our main objectives in this paper are (1) to formulate a system in terms of the grammars of the two languages and a switching rule, (2) to show that a variety of observable constraints on intrasentential ccde,maitching can be formulated in terms of constraints on the switching rule.",
        "The main result of this paper is that a large number of constraints can be derived from a general constraint on the switchability of the so-called closed class items (determinizers, quantifiers, prepositions, tense morphemes, auxilliaries, helping verbs, complementizers, pronouns, etc.).",
        "This result is of interest because the differential behavior of closed class items (as compared to the open class items) has been noted in various aspects of language processing (in the monolingual case), for example,",
        "classes in intrasentential code-switching and the other behaviors (in monolingual situations) described above.",
        "We believe, however, that investigating this relationship may give some clues concerning the organization of the grammar and the lexicon, and the nature of the interface between the two language systems.",
        "The examples in our paper are all from the language pair, Marathi (m) and English (e), Marathi (n) is the matrix language and English (e) is the embedded language.",

        "It is an Indo-European language (spoken on the west coast of India near Bombay and in parts of central India by about 60 million people).",
        "It is an SOV language.",

        "However,",
        "often we have a choice of a complementizer.",
        "This choice depends both on the matrix verb Vm and the embedded verb Ve (Vm ;,-;Ve) to which Vm has been switched.",

        "Now if Vm is switched to Ve i.e., the verb is lexically realized in the embedded language, then the choice of the complementizer is constrained in the following manner.",
        "Since complementizers are closed classes, they cannot be switched.",
        "Hence, the choice is C1, C2, or C3; h?wever OnlyC1 and C2 are permitted, as the equivalent lexical verb Ve permits C1 and C2 which are the equivalents of C1 and C2 respectively.",
        "Cs is not permitted because its equivalent C3 is not permitted for Ve, and C4 which is the equivalent of C4 is not permitted because it is not allowed by Vm.",
        "Thus the only complementizers that are permitted, if Vm is switched to Ve, are those that are permitted by Vm and the equivalents of which are permitted by Ve (VmZ.Ve).",
        "Thus the choice is constrained not only to the complementizers of Vm (because of non switchability of complementizers) but it is further constrained by the choice of complementizers of Ve as explained above.",
        "'This is a problematic case which is discussed in detail in the longer version of this paper.",
        "The Marathi verb tharaw (decide) takes the complementizer ca(ing) but not the complementizer la(to).",
        "The corresponding English verb decide takes both the complementizers to anding (after on).",
        "We now switch the Marathi verb Vm (tharaw) to Ve (decide) in both (3.22) and 7.23).",
        "Since the tense in the main VP cannot be switched aswe have seen in (3.1) and (3.2) earlier) a helping verb kar (do) has to be introduced so that the tense can be attached to it.",

        "Thus the only complementizer that appears in the mixed sentence is ing.",

        "For example, at what point the decision to switch the main verb is made?",
        "(We could have raised this issue earlier when we discussed (3.1) and (3.2)).",
        "Since a new helping verb has to be introduced when the switch is made, does it mean that some 'local' structural change has to be made along with the switching of the verb?",
        "Another point is that the choice of the complementizer (which carves before the matrix verb) also determines whether the verb can be switched or not.",
        "The machinery we have provided so far may have to be augmented to provide systematic answers to these questions.",
        "Thus for example, we may have to introduce additional constraints on the switching rules."

        "In this paper, we have given an account of the constraints on intrasentential code-switching in a generative framework.",
        "The formal model and the constraints on switching that we have proposed clearly have implications for the kind of parser we may be able to construct.",
        "We will not pursue this aspect in this paper.",
        "However, we would like to point out that by adopting some parsing strategies, we can account for sane of the constraints described earlier.",
        "A preliminary attempt was made in Joshi (1981) by proposing a strategy involving a so-called left corner constraint.",
        "This strategy has some serious drawbacks as was pointed out by Doran (1981).",
        "She has proposed an alternate strategy called 'early determination strategy', according to which the parser tries to determine as early as possible the language of the major constituent it is currently parsing.",
        "Thus upon encountering a Marathi (m) determiner i.e., DETm the parser would predict a Marathi NPm.",
        "The Marathi Nm could be then realized lexically in Marathi or the Nm would be switched to Ne and then lexically realized in English.",
        "NPm is expanded into DETmNomm where Nomm is expanded into AmNm.",
        "Note that Am and Nm could be independently switched to Ae and Ne respectively, thus giving four possible sequences: DETm Am Nm, DETm Ne, DETm Ae Nm, DETm Ae Ne, all of which are permissible.",
        "If the parser encountered an English determiner, i.e. Erre then it would predict NPe, but now Ne or AeNe into which NPe can expand cannot be switched to Nm or Am",
        "because of the asymmetry constraint.",
        "Thus the only permissible sequence is DETe (Ae) Ne, and the following are excluded, i.e., DETe Am Ne, * DETe Am Nm, which checks with the data.",
        "*DETe Nm, * DETe Ae Nm, * Of course, so far we have the same predictions as we had with the constraint on the nonswitchability of closed class items.",
        "However, there is some evidence to the effect that a parsing strategy as described above may be in effect.",
        "The following distribution is correctly predicted by the above strategy: (5.1) * tall petya (5.2) tall boxes (5.3) unca petya (5.4) unca boxes.",
        "(5.1) is disallowed, because upon encountering an English adjective, Ae, the parser predicts Nome, which is expanded into Ae Ne.",
        "However, Ne cannot be realized lexically in Marathi, unless Ne is switched to Nm, which is disallowed.",
        "Note that (5.1) cannot be disallowed by invoking nonswitchability of adjectives, because these are not closed classes.",
        "This early determination strategy does not help however in accounting for the distribution of phrases involving postpositions (see Section 3).",
        "Our conclusion at present is that the framework described in Section 3 along with the constraints on closed class items is the proper way to formulate the code-switching system.",
        "A parsing strategy as discussed above is perhaps also operative (see Examples (5.1) - (5.4)) and when a closed class item is the leftmost constituent of a major category then the two formulations made the same predictions.",
        "5.",
        "CONCLUSION We have presented a formal model for characterizing intra-sentential code-switching.",
        "The main features of this model are that 1) the model treats the two grammars (languages) asymmetrically, 2) there is no third grammar, and 3) the constraints on the switchability of closed class items.",
        "We believe that further investigation of code-switching in the proposed framework will be very productive, as it captures some essential aspects of intrasentential code-switching.",
        "Another interesting result concerns the role of closed class items.",
        "Since several important characteristics of closed class items are well-known in the context of processing of monolingual utterances, we think that further investigation of the role of closed class items in the context of code-switching will give us some insights into the processing of monolingual utterances.",
        "Our investigation of intrasentential code-mixing can also be considered as a small contribution towards the larger problem of determining the nature of the interface between the two language systems of a bilingual speaker or hearer."
