        "Choice is one of the most prominent organizing concepts in systemic linguistics.",
        "Languages are described in terms of the choices available to the speaker and the relationships of those choices to each other and to the language produced.",
        "This paper addresses the problems of characterizing processes of choosing in a systemic framework and creating a corresponding notation.",
        "Focus on notation is necessary at this point since development of notation must to some extent precede development of corresponding content.",
        "Although these developments are part of an investigation of computer text production, their significance is not confined to that enterprise; they are as significant in linguistics as in computer science.",
        "This paper focuses on the perspective of choice as a speaker's action.",
        "We hope that by exploring the nature of systemic choices, several kinds of interests in language will be served: Interest in Grammar as Language Description - Describing choices can yield a richer understanding of the alternatives offered, and how one system of choices differs from another.",
        "Interest in Semantic Descriptions - Choice descriptions can be a direct extension of present systemic frameworks in the direction of more explicit semantics.",
        "- Choice descriptions are helpful as parts of descriptions of how particular intentions to communicate can be satisfied.",
        "They can be a component in a description of how a speaker can use language in order to do things, to use the functionality of language.",
        "Interest in Constructive Models - Choice descriptions can be used as parts of constructive models of the expressive communicative process, models which can perform this process instead of describing it.",

        "We would like to create an account of how one may generate text that is appropriate for satisfying particular intentions to communicate.",
        "In other words, given something particular to say, we would like to be able to bring that intention to an existing description of how to seek to satisfy intentions to communicate, apply the description to the intention, and see at some level of detail that appropriate language is generated.",
        "By introducing a communicative purpose we immediately raise an issue of whether that purpose, or the potential of all purposes, should be regarded as within the grammar or outside of it.",
        "To include purposes as formal objects within systemic grammars would be a major extension of scope beyond the dominant tradition.",
        "In contrast to Fawcett [Fawcett 80] (pp.",
        "75-78), we treat the development of a particular intention to speak as outside of the grammar.",
        "We agree with Fawcett that the intention deserves theoretical treatment in conjunction with its grammatical realization, but we do not propose to derive it systemically.",
        "So the grammar has a definite boundary, with communicative purposes residing outside.",
        "The grammar is composed of systems (hence the name Systemic) which are collections of alternatives.",
        "Each alternative is named; the names are called grammatical features.",

        "These various uses of function symbols are compatible: the way of identifying the hub to be associated with a function does not depend on whether that function will be inserted into the structure.",
        "Several functions are inserted in some instances but not others, and yet they carry the same hub information in each case.",
        "(For example, AGENT would carry the same hub symbol for either \"Someone closed the door\" or \"The door was closed,\" but it would be inserted only in the second case.)",
