      "text": [
        "The data of this study consist of eight medical discharge summaries, each 1-2 pages in length.",
        "These physician reports were dictated and then transcribed by a medical typist into computer readable form.",
        "As a preliminary to machine processing, there was minimal pre-editing of the documents for such necessary formatting changes as",
        "202 E. MARSH and N. SAGER inserting a blank between a word and its following punctuation mark and occasional spelling corrections.",
        "Abbreviations were maintained as used in the text and were treated as dictionary entries linked to their full form in the dictionary.",
        "A computer dictionary of the document words was obtained by lookup in the medical parsing dictionary developed by the LSP, which was augmented for new words appearing in these texts.",
        "The dictionary classifies words according to their major parts of speech (e.g. noun, verb, adjective), as well as certain English subclasses (e.g. plural, past) and special medical subfield classes.",
        "The medical classes are based on cooccurrence properties of the words as seen in a larger survey of the material and are checked for semantic consistency by a physician-consultant.",
        "In total, the medical classes currently number sixty-six.",
        "These are used in selectional constraints applied during parsing to resolve syntactic ambiguities.",
        "A smaller set of eighteen medical classes determine the major semantic sentence types discussed below.",
        "Descriptions of the 18 medical classes are given in Table 1, drawn from [6], where all the medical classes are defined and details of the text processing procedure are described.",
        "The input sentences from the discharge summaries are structured by a three stage system of (1) parsing, (2) syntactic regularization, and (3) mapping into an information format.",
        "The first step is to parse the document sentences with the Linguistic String Project parser [7].",
        "This step begins with a dictionary lookup to associate the stored lexical information with each word occurrence in the sentence.",
        "The parsing utilizes a medically tuned grammar, which includes productions for the compact sentence syntactic types discussed below, and also productions for special sublanguage constructions (e.g. dose expressions,pqnicillamine 250 MG PO g2).",
        "The sentence parse identifies grammatical relations which hold among parts of the sentence, principally subject-verb-object relations and host-modifier relations.",
        "Also built into the grammar is a selectional mechanism which disambiguates multiply classified words based on the type of subject-verb-object or host-modifier relationships permitted in the sublanguage [8].",
        "The second step is syntactic regularization.",
        "Each sentence undergoes a series of paraphrastic English transformations regularizing the syntax within the sentences in order to reduce the variety of syntactic structures to a set of basic syntactic relations [9].",
        "The syntactic regularization does not alter the information content of the sentences.",
        "In addition, reduced word forms, such as abbreviations, are replaced by their full forms.",
        "The final processing step is information formatting, which maps the words of the parsed, transformed sentence into a tabular representation of the information contained in the sentences.",
        "A word is mapped into the format column which corresponds to the information content of the word.",
        "In general, there is a 1-to-1 correspondence between the sublanguage word class and a particular format column.",
        "For example, a word of the medical class DIAG(nosis), e.g. meningitis, would be mapped into the DIAL column of the format.",
        "Formatting is based on cooccurrence patterns found in the text and on the lexical information obtained from the computer dictionary of medical vocabulary.",
        "The sets of filled format columns represent the semantic patterns found within the data.",
        "These semantic patterns will be discussed below.",
        "The data was run on the LSP natural language processing system as implemented in FORTRAN and run on a Control Data 6600, requiring about 75,000 words of memory.",
        "The LSP system also runs on the CDC CYBER, the VAX, and UNIVAC 1100 machines.",
        "The English grammar, regularization component, and information formatting component are written in Restriction Language, a special high level language developed for writing natural language grammars."

      "text": [
        "In a test set of narrative hospital discharge summaries that were computer-parsed, 49% of the sentences were syntactically incomplete sentence forms (\"fragments\").",
        "The fragments were of six types that can be related to full sentence forms on the basis of the elements which were regularly deleted: (i) deleted verb and object (or subject and verb), leaving a noun phrase (4); (ii) deleted tense and verb be (5); (iii) deleted subject, tense, and verb be (6); (iv) deleted subject (7); (v) deleted subject, tense, and verb be (passive predicate) (8); and (vi) deleted subject, tense, and verb be (infinitival complement) (9).",
        "(4) Stiff neck and fever.",
        "(63%) (5) Brain scan negative.",
        "(22%) (6) Positive for heart disease and diabetes.",
        "(8%) (7) Was seen by local doctor.",
        "(5%) (8) Treated for meningitis.",
        "(2%) (9) To be followed in hematology clinic.",
        "(1 instance = .08%)",
        "Viewing these fragments as deletion forms, it is possible to fill them out to full sentences that would be accepted as paraphrastic by \"native speakers\" of medical language.",
        "For example, occurrences (4)-(9) can be related to sentences (10)-(15) respectively.",
        "(10) Patient had stiff neck and fever.",
        "(11) Brain scan was negative.",
        "(12) Patient/test/exam [depending on context] is positive for heart disease.",
        "(13) Patient was seen by local doctor.",
        "(14) Patient was treated for meningitis.",
        "(15) Patient is to be followed in hematology clinic.",
        "In a set of 8 analyzed hospital discharge summaries, we found 41 cooccurrence patterns of the subject-verb-object (SVO) type, stated in terms of 18 participating word classes.",
        "(There were further patterns of the host-modifier type and some larger patterns involving connective between SVO types.)",
        "The SVO patterns could be grouped into six more general types by defining a \"superclass\" (RESULT) consisting of the classes SIGN-SYMPTOM, LAB-RES, QUANT, NORMALCY, DIAGNOSIS, and DESCRIPTION that occurred with one of the subject classes PATIENT, BODY-PART, TEST.",
        "For example, sentence (5) is of the type TEST RESULT, where scan is the name of a test (occurring with BODY-PART word brain as modifier), and negative (in the class NORMALCY in the superclass RESULT) is the finding of the test.",
        "Examples of the sentence patterns are provided in Table 2.",
        "CONCLUSIONS The computer results presented above, considered along with manual analysis of other document sets, lead to several major conclusions about the characteristics of compact text: I.",
        "Repetitive ungrammaticality is grammatical for the text set.",
        "Within a given set of data, there are recurrent ungrammatical constructions.",
        "These forms can be characterized and made a part of the parsing grammar.",
        "The departures from grammaticality are limited and can be related in a regular way to full sentente types in English.",
        "II.",
        "Word choice is quasi-grammatical.",
        "In repetitive single-topic text, word subclasses that are specific to the subject",
        "2) In many cases B-PART word, TEST word are deleted when reconstructable from context, e.g. CSF grew out pneumococcus = CSF culture grew out pneumococcus.",
        "3) Mention of PATIENT is omitted in Patterns IV.",
        "4) Key: ( ) = optional element",
        "{ } = choice of one among elements in braces 206 E. MARSH and N. SAGER matter are found in particular combinations.",
        "These patterns are so marked that deviations can be considered ungrammatical for the discourse.",
        "For example, in medical records, (16) would be possible, while (17) would not.",
        "(16) Patient admitted to hospital on 11/5/81.",
        "(17) *Meningitis admitted to hospital on 11/5/81.",
        "III.",
        "Deletions are reconstructable.",
        "Deletions are reconstructable on the basis of both syntax and regularity of subclass patterning.",
        "It was seen above that deleted (reconstructable) elements are either function words known to be deleted in other English'forms (e.g. be), or distinguished words of the sublanguage (e.g. patient).",
        "IV.",
        "Texts are convergent.",
        "While it would be improper to say \"when you've seen one, you've seen them all,\" compact texts within a given area are remarkably similar.",
        "In the set of eight documents referred to above, six generalized semantic patterns occurred in the first document processed.",
        "No new types were recognized in the remaining seven documents.",
        "On the lexical level, while new vocabulary is found in each new document (so-called \"seepage\"), this tends to taper off.",
        "In a prior study of journal articles, it was found that seevage after the 7th article remained at about 20%.",
        "In the processing of medical records, we found that, when changing from one medical subfield to another, the new vocabulary in a set of documents containing 2200 distinct lexical items was 27%.",
        "The above four properties of compact text: grammaticality despite syntactic deviation, regular patterning of subject-specific vocabulary, recoverable deletions, and convergence as new texts are analyzed, make it possible to process the content of documents with syntactic procedures that operate on the full free text.",
