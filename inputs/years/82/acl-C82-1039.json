        "There have been many researches on syntactic analysis of natural language by computer, but still no reliable grammatical rules are established yet which can be applicable to any utterances of a language.",
        "Universal grammatical rules for a language looks like almost hopeless.",
        "Grammatical rules to be prepared depend heavily on the text to be analyzed.",
        "Hence the concept of subgrammar is introduced.",
        "It does not necessarily cover all the different kinds of sentential structures of a language.",
        "A grammar which covers just the set of expressions to be treated is sufficient from the engineering point of view.",
        "We developed a machine translation system which translates the titles of scientific and engineering papers from English into Japanese.",
        "More than 98% of the titles in scientific and engineering papers are noun phrases, so that the system is designed to translate only the noun phrases.",
        "The'verbs can be used in the forms of to + infinitive , verb-ing, and verb-ed.",
        "The system can not treat the embedded sentences which are introduced by relative pronouns.",
        "Then the essential structures the system can treat are composed of simple noun phrases, verbs of the forms of to-infinitive, verb-ing, and verb-ed, and prepositions.",
        "Here a simple noun phrase means the juxtaposition (endocentric structure) of adjectives, nouns, and some other elements.",
        "The word order of a simple noun phrase can be the same in English and Japanese.",
        "The sentential structures obtained after parsing each simple noun phrase into a noun is called a skeleton pattern.",
        "We can expect that the variety of such skeleton patterns is very few for the restricted area of titles of scientific and engineering papers.",
        "When the variety is very few, we do not need further syntactic analysis for these skeleton patterns.",
        "For each skeleton pattern the corresponding Japanese skeleton pattern (word order change) can be given.",
        "Thus the subgrammar in this system is a very peculiar one which is an accumulation of heuristics of the title structures.",
        "We utilized this specific nature of the titles in our machine translation system.",
        "The correct translation rate for the wide variety of scientific and engineering papers is about 80%, but for the specific areas of physics and mathematics from INSPEC database the score was about 93%.",
        "The system is now used for the conversion",
        "of English databases into Japanese databases.",
        "This system thus opened a way for the Japanese people to make access to English databases in their own language.",

        "SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF TITLE SENTENCES Title sentences of scientific and engineering papers in English have the following properties from the point of view of translation.",
        "(1) Nouns in the titles are usually specific terminological words in a particular field.",
        "The translation of these words into Japanese is almost unique.",
        "This makes avoid a difficult problem of the selection of proper translation words from several candidates, which we encounter in ordinary words.",
        "(2) Many colloquial expressions exist in the titles.",
        "These are regarded as idioms, and their internal structures are not analyzed.",
        "The whole expressions are stored in a dictionary with their Japanese translations.",
        "(3) A simple noun phrase in English can be translated into Japanese by replacing each word into Japanese without any word order change.",
        "(4) Many of the special terminological words in science and engineering are compound words.",
        "They are treated as such in a dictionary.",
        "When the translation of a simple noun phrase according to (3) is not acceptable, the phrase is stored in a dictionary as a compound word with its translation.",
        "Therefore the dictionary lookup is done by the longest match principle.",
        "(5) The word order change in the translation is only possible in the cases where verbs and prepositions are used.",
        "This word order change can be done at the level of skeleton patterns.",
        "3.",
        "DICTIONARY LOOKUP",
        "The block diagram of our title translation system is shown in Fig. 1.",
        "The first step is the dictionary lookup of words and idioms.",
        "We gathered a lot of specific expressions as idioms, such as \"time varying (mechanism)\", \"based on ...\", and so on.",
        "\"verb-ing\" can be a noun, adjective, and present participle, but there are many verb-ing's whose grammatical function is almostunique: accounting, bonding, engineering and so on as nouns, superconducting as adjective, and using, determining as verbs which demand objects or complements.",
        "The dictionary has this information."
