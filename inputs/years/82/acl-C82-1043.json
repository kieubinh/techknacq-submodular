        "The verb pattern plays an important role to identify the syntactic structures of sentences in Japanese like Hornby's verb patterns in English.",
        "From a semantic view point, Japanese predicates are classified to about 20 main categories and case structures are defined based on the verb categories and the verb patterns.",

        "The case labels of dependants are determined by referring to the syntactic and semantic categories of the dependants and the case frame of the governor.",
        "The internal expressions sometimes lack the agent case or the object case corresponding to the original Japanese sentence.",
        "When the internal form has a predicate affecting on some objects and lacks the agent in the active voice, it is expanded into an English sentence in the passive voice.",
        "When the main predicate belongs to category of state such as existence and attribute and lacks the object case, an appropriate pronoun to the context such as \"it\", \"we\" or \"they\" is substituted for the thematized object case as the general environment or the general experiencer.",
        "Japanese noun words are not obliged to have articles which give a measure of definiteness to an object indicated by a noun word.",
