        "Intermediate representation of this model is EFR (English-oriented Formal Representation) and CPS (Conceptual Phrase Structure).",
        "EFR is a logical language based on Cresswell's lambda categorial language (Cresswell (1973)), which can be considered to be a notationally simplified version of Montague Grammar (Montague (1974), Dowty (1981)).",
        "From an engineering point of view, EFR can be regarded as an artificial language in which each expression is unambiguous.",
        "So, there may be the cases in which more than one EFR expression can be associated with a given sentence.",
        "In such cases, ambiguities are resolved using inference, knowledge, or by human assistance.",
        "CPS is an extended phrase structure in that (1) CPS is a more general element including syntactic knowledge on the concept, so (2) CPS is implemented as a frame and (3) CPS is not only a data structure which is an object under operation but also a function which can operate on other CPS's. A CPS formula is a functional notation (lambda formula) of the operation sequence on CPS's. A CPS formula is evaluated to be a CPS or a functional value.",
        "The evaluation process is defined by a (pure) LISP like interpreter."

        "English sentence analysis is done using-two layered rules, pattern directed",
        "278 T. NISHIDA and S. DOSHITA augmented context free rules (AUGCF rules) and production type procedural rules.",
        "AUGCF rule is a descriptive rule.",
        "Context free rule is extended in several points, (1) attached function for checking syntactic details and semantic acceptability, (2) direct notation of gap in relative clauses or interrogative sentences.",
        "An AUGCF rule describes what EFR formula is associated with a given syntactic pattern and in what condition the pattern is acceptable.",
        "Some examples look like: subjvp,+10,*semi(*sem2)), NP.VP R1 pmi,+0,cons-np-rel,Np.uwmar.",
        "(s-Np) R2 NP Although lots of syntactic phenomena can be easily formalized with AUGCF rules, the computer cannot efficiently analyze input sentences only with them.",
        "One reason is that the computer must examine which rules are applicable in a given situation and determine which one is plausible.",
        "Such processings make the computer very much slow and inefficient.",
        "Another reason is that some kind of heuristic knowledge, which is sometimes referred to as knowledge on control (Davis (1980)), cannot be effectively incorporated into the AUGCF rules.",
        "The knowledge on control provides heuristics on when and how to use each rule.",
        "Condition -> action formalism (production rule formalism) is considered to be suitable to write such level of knowledge.",
        "Our second level rule is obtained by attaching control information to each AUGCF rule and transforming the rule format.",
        "The type of procedural rules are: E-rule, U-rule, B-rule, and L-rule.",
        "- E-rule (expansion rule) is invoked when a goal is expected.",
        "E-rule specifies subgoal decomposition of the given goal.",
        "- U-rule (up-ped rule) is invoked when a parse tree node is generated.",
        "This rule further specifies additional goals and if all of them succeed, a new node will be constructed.",
        "This rule is used mainly for left recursive type AUGCF rules.",
        "- B-rule (Bottom-up rule) is referred to by a bottom-up parser incorporated in the rule interpreter.",
        "- L-rule (Lexicon rule) is embedded in a dictionary and invoked when a key word is encountered in the given text.",
        "The rules R1 and R2 are rewritten into procedural type rules as follows: goal'S 4/T 1 expand[(NP VP);subjvp;+10;*semi(*sem2)] 1 ... R1' (E-rule) constructed*NP?lexrWHICH1 -) \"set the next goal an S with ... (U-rule)",
        "if it succeeds, then apply R2.\")",
        "Where R1', for example, says that: given a goal S then expand it into subgoals NP and VP; if both of them succeed then reduce them into an S node; at that time, a function subjvp checks subject-verb agreement; +10 is the score for S; *sem1(*sem2) is a pattern of the EFR expression for the S node, where *semi denotes the EFR expression for its first son (NP), etc.",
        "If some anomaly is detected by those functional attachments, the application of the rule is rejected (functional augmentation of CF rule).",
        "A notion of a frame is employed in order to implement feature semantics.",
        "A frame is an extended property list in which syntactic and semantic features are described.",
        "By passing and checking consistency among such features, (mainly semantic) constraints are implemented."

        "(2) conceptual interpretation of a*(communication)(Ax[ ]) associates a conceptual element \"(a) communication\" with the variable x.",
        "(3) (*ap(for))(x) is interpreted as an adjective concept \"for the sake of x\", which becomes \"for the sake of (a) communication\" from (2).",
        "(4) the adjective concept obtained in (3) is applied as a function to the interpretation of \"facility\" (i.e., a noun concept \"facility\").",
        "Thus we obtain a complex noun concept \"system for the sake of (a) facility\" for ((*ap(for))(x))(facility).",
        "(5) the application of a noun concept p to an individual concept q yields a sentence concept: \"q is a p.\" This interpretation rule is used for the fragment: (((*ap(for))(x))(facility))(y).",
        "The result is a sentence concept: \"something (y) is a facility for the sake of (a) communication.\"",
        "(6) Finally the interpretation of a given EFR expression results in a noun phrase concept: \"something y: such that y is a facility for the sake of (a) communication.\"",
        "This noun phrase concept is a higher order concept which gives a name to an individual: \"a facility for the sake of (a) communication.\"",
        "This higher order concept will be reduced if it is applied to a one place predicate (roughly speaking, a property like \"being constructed\", \"being an x such that the paper is concerned with x\", etc.",
        ").",
        "The above process of interpretation is stepwise and includes no \"gap\" nor \"skip\".",
        "Such property is crucially important in constructing large and complex systems including machine translation systems.",
        "This process can be simulated in the \"linguistic\" domain; our idea of target language generation is this: - each conceptual element is accompanied with a target language phrase structure which gives the name of the concept.",
        "- each semantic interpretation of a complex structure is accompanied with a syntactic operation of creating new phrase structure from those for function part and argument part conceptual elements.",
        "Two types of Japanese phrase structure manipulating rule can be associated with functional application: - embedding one phrase into another phrase as a modification part (generate KAKARI-UKE relation) - transforming one phrase by use of the information from another phrase.",

        "All those information is structured as a frame.",
        "The descendant slot of a CPS is either a terminal value (lexicon frame) or a list of CPS's. Thus CPS can be linked as a tree structure.",
        "A CPS corresponding to a noun phrase: \"the typewriter\" looks like: [NP [DET 'the' with Q=DEFINITE] NOUN 'typewriter' with CLASS=PHYSOBJ ] with NBR=SGL ].",
        "`NOU A CPS works both as a data and as a function; it is sometimes applied to other CPS's to result in another CPS or functional value, or it sometimes is a data structure under some operation.",
        "Thus CPS is a higher order object.",
        "The semantics can be modeled in the notion of a categorial grammar.",
        "A CPS of an adjective concept, for example, maps a CPS of a noun concept into another (compound) CPS of a modified noun.",
        "This principle can be written as: ADJ=NOUN/NOUN.",

        "In practice, our system involves one step called the REFORM step after the CPS evaluation process.",
        "This step is needed mainly because, (1) some direct output is not readable; the content can be understood without ambiguity, but it is much redundant or not commonly used, or much more worse (2) the output is semantically wrong.",
        "Such cases arises where the EFR expression extracted from the source language is not well defined to the language expression in question.",
        "This case occurs when the system designer commits misconception or fails to correctly capture the phenomenon.",
        "In principle, the second case is obviously bad but no theory has ever succeeded in modelling all phenomena in natural language.",
        "So in practice, the second case is unavoidable.",
