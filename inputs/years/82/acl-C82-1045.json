        "Is it true that the recipe to realize a successful machine translation is in precise and rigid language parsing?",
        "So far many studies have been done on rigid and detailed natural language parsing, some of which are so powerful as to detect some ungrammatical sentences [1, 2, 3, 4].",
        "Notwithstanding it seems that the detailed parsing is not always connected with practically satisfying machine translations.",
        "On the other hand actual human, even foreign language learners, can translate fairly difficult English sentences without going into details of parsing.",
        "They only use an elementary grammatical knowledge and dictionaries.",
        "Thin we have paid attention on the heuristic methods of language-learners and have devir.ed a rather non-standard linguistic model named HPM (= Heuristic Parsing Model).",
        "Here, \"non-standard\" implies that sentential constituents in HPM are different from those in widely accepted modern English grammars [5] or in phrase structure grammars [6].",
        "In order to prove the reasonability of HPM, we have developed an English-into-Japanese translation system named ATHENE (= Automatic Translation of Hitachi from English into Nihongo with Editing Support)(cf. Fig.1).",
        "The essential features of heuristic translation are summarized as in following three points.",
        "(1) To segment an input sentence into new elements named Phrasal Elements (PE) and Clausal Elements (CE), (2) To assign syntactic roles to PE's and CE's, and restructure the segmented elements into tree-forms by inclusive relation and into list-forms by modifying relation.",
        "(3) To permute the segmented elements, and to assign appropriate Japanese equiva",

      "text": [
        "In this paper we try to contend that machine translation should be studied from more heuristic side, or from actual language-learner's methodology side rather than from purely rigid liguistical analysis side.",
        "Researchers of very \"high level\" linguistic analysis side, as is pointed out by Boitet [8], \"seem too often to concentrate on interesting high level phenomena as anaphoric reference, discourse",
        "structure, causality and reasoning and to forget at the same time persisting and very frequent lower-level difficulties ... .\" This \"frequent lower-level diffi-culty\" is the very problem to be solved in practical machine translation, and is actually solved easily by naive foreign language learners only with the help of elementary grammatical knowledge.",
        "You had better recall that language-learners must solve the whole even though it is incomplete, on the other hand, pure linguists must solve completely even though it is very limited.",
        "In the light of this contention, we have devised a heuristic parsing model named HPM to accommodate the machine translation to the actual human translation methodologies, and at the same time, on HPM we have constructed a machine translation system named ATHENE.",
        "Experimental translation by ATHNE shows the following advantageous points of our heuristic approach.",
        "(1) Contribution to the flexibility, simplicity and maintenability in grammatical description.",
        "(2) Contribution to the simplicity and transparency in transforming phase and generating phase.",
        "One of further problems is to extend the grammatical data heuristically, so as to intensify our machine translation system from learner's level to expert's level.",
        "Though our system can translate fairly complex sentences, it still commits learner's level errors when encountering difficulties such as ambiguity of prepositional group modification or of word linking scope for conjunction.",
        "Heuristic aspects of semantics are also our current interests of research.",
        "Especially the case-grammatical idea [9] seems to be useful to refine our syntactic-role assignment process so as to improve the quality of generated Japanese sentences.",
        "A kind of semantic code system (or thesaurus) will also be required to be introduced in our lexicons.",
        "Space limitation of this proceeding does not allow us to describe our linguistic model: HPM in detail.",
        "We are planning to present the more detailed version of HPM together with later improvement in some appropriate journals.",
        "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We would like to thank Prof. Nagao of Kyoto University for his kind and stimulative discussion on various aspects of machine translation.",
        "Thanks are also due to Dr. Miura, Dr. Kawasaki, Dr. Mitsumaki and Dr. Mitsumori of SDL Hitachi Ltd. for their constant encouragement to this viork."
