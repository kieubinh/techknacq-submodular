        "For example, the use of both French and English in Canada and the multilingual use of formal documents in the EEC present pressing demands for practical MT systems.",

        "Other systems currently being used include the METED system which translates English weather reports into French in Canada, and the WEIDNER and LOGOS systems produced by private firms in the USA.",
        "Recently, there has been a revival of interest in MT systems in the USA, partly because of significant advances being made in artificial intelligence (AI) research.",
        "The future development of MT systems is ensured by the total integration of high-performance computers, new man-machine interface designs, new software methodologies, and progress in knowledge engineering3/.",
        "The language barrier in Japan in far greater than in the EEC or Canada, because Japanese is an isolated language.",

        "This machine will perform language translation at least 90% of it automatically, such that the cost of a translation job could be reduced by 70%."
