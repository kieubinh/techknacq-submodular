        "For the first problem, obtain the information necessary for the semantic dictionary from ordinary dictionary of Japanese language by analizing the sentences defining headwords.",

        "In the case of the semantic graph of a word 'ICHifik (drawing paper)' in Fig.3, following information are extracted, by means of looking up the upper word 'g(paper)' of 'drawing paper' and the linked relations between 'paper' and the other words.",
        "© drawing paper is a kind of paper, g slightly thick, Swhite,C,used for drawing a picture.",
        "These semantic information can be extracted from the semantic graph of the definitions of a word 'paper' through the views 'a kind of', 'attribute (shape)', 'attribute (color)' and 'purpose of use'.",
        "Here, 'a kind of is a relation between 'drawing paper' and 'paper'.",
        "Furthermore, from, semantic information such that 'drawing paper' is the 'object (place)' for drawing a pic-ture' is obtained.",
        "This information denotes case relationship between 'draw' and 'drawing paper'.",
        "The above can be understood, from a different point of view, that the meaning of a word 'drawing paper' is defined (described) from the views such as 'a kind of (relation), 'case'(relation), attribute (e.g. shape, color) and 'purpose of use' (basic view point).",
        "We are aiming at constructing the frame of a word definition (called the frame of a word or the frame of definition) by means of these views.",
        "What sorts of views should be prepared for the frame of a word?",
        "Concerning the frame we cleared that: (i) Words (to be exact, concepts) are classified into four types, that is, concrete object, event, attribute (state) and abstract thing which are roughly correspond to concrete noun, verb, adjective/adverb and abstract word.",
        "Each word has the frame corresponding to its type.",
        "(ii) The frame is made up of which consist of the semantic relations (such as, a kind of relationships, case relationships, cause-effect relationships and whole-parts relationships) and basic views.",
        "As basic views for 'product' thing (a kind of concrete object), we prepared ones shown in table 3.",
        "(iii) The frame for 'event' word is mainly made up of case relationships, cause-effect relationships, a kind of relationships and views of 'modes(e.g. tense, possibility, in progress).",
        "These relationships are shown in tables 1 and 2."

        "In Fig.6, some words (e.g. 'stationary', 'instrument', 'product') are skipped between 'paper' and 'thing'.",
        "Therefore, if these words are looked up and related with 'paper', the semantic information extracted from these words should be added to the definition.",
        "There may be some shortage which can not be supplied only by these unification procedures, so that it should be given man-assistedly fine meanings to the comparatively upper words.",
        "For example, in Fig. 7, the agent of 'Remove' is 'Person' and result of 'remove' is 'vanish', therefore, also the agent of 'extinguish', 'fire extinguishing' and so on can automatically be given if we have given the information in the fine definition."
