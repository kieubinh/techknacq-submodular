        "Istituto di Paicologia, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche Via del Monti Tiburtini, 509, 00157-Roma Most of the work on natural language understanding (NLU) has been done on English.",
        "English is a language with relatively rigid word order, a characteristics that has influenced all NLU systems proposed so far.",
        "These systems have dedicated only minor attention to problems that are of major importance in languages with a freer ordering like Italian.",
        "Work on parsing partially ungrammatical sentences in rigid languages (Hayes and Mouradian, 1980; Charniak, 1981) bears some similarity to work on parsing of \"free\" order language.",
        "In both oases an exclusively top-down model seems inappropriate.",
        "For instance, when considering an incomplete sentence it may still be advises able to proceed in building some representation.",
        "The resulting structure will then be inserted within a larger cognitive structure.",
        "The same bottom-up way of proceeding must necessarily be part of an 'GU system for \"free\" order languages.",
        "An ATN (Woods, 1970) type system, like the one developed for Italian (Cappelli et al., 1978), shows definite limitations even when it is furnished with heuristics for strategy selection (Ferrari and Stock, 1980) based on adaptation to a coherent text.",
        "Other ideas such as passing information in the case of failure (Weischedel and Black, 1980) or relaxing conditions on arcs in certain circumstances (Kwasny and Sondheimer, 1979) do not seem to be satisfying solutions for our problem.",
        "-65-In other hand, we do not agree that syntax be given a subordinate role, as Sohank's theoretical approach implies (though in Schenk and Riesbeck's parser, ELI (2iesbeck and Schank, 1978), syntax has a more important role than would be expected).",
        "In any event, without enough syntax it becomes hard to analyze complex sentences and to explain a number of psycholinguistic phenomena.",
        "2.",
        "WEDNESDAY, the system proposed here, is the core of an extended mechanism we are developing and implementing in LISP (fig.1) (see Parisi and Castelfranohi, in press).",
        "It is an analyzer with semantic output based on word interpretation.",
        "The semantic information brought in by each word is progressively connected to get at the sentence's meaning according to syntactic constraints and expectations.",
        "Syntax is a set of instructions directly concerned with assembling semantic units.",
        "What is characteristic of WEDNESDAY is that syntax is not a separate component, but is distributed throughout the lexicon.",
        "Lexical entries are composed of a declarative part and a procedural part.",
        "The procedural part is made up of syntactic instructions designed to assemble the declarative (semantic) part of the entry with the declarative parts of the other words in the sentence.",
        "The syntactic assembling process - 66 - allows the construction of the sentence's semantic network to be carried out progressively and so it can also operate on incomplete sentences.",
        "Furthermore, the system's output has a format which is homogenous to that of the knowledge base (encyclopedia).",
        "This means that as the sentence analysis proceeds, it is natural to have the knowledge base controlling the assembly process top-down, in cooperation with the lexical-syntactic analysis.",
        "Clauses in multi-clause sentences are conceived as restricted search spaces for the assembly instructions carried by the words, and the same is true for noun spaces (noun phrases).",
        "Part-of-speech word categories are interpreted as procedures for opening and closing spaces as a function of context.",
        "Therefore, part of the process is dependent on a recursive (push-down storage) mechanism.",
        "On the other hand there is a semantic sentence memory that is transparent to the closed-level system.",
        "Being lexically based, WEDNESDAY can deal in a natural way with idiosyncrasies typical of many words.",
        "It can also deal with flexible idioms, i.e. idioms that can vary in morphology, word order, syntactic construction, semantic additions, and synonyms.",
        "Their recognition is governed by the individual lexical entries and takes place at *he assembling level.",
        "Word disambiguation is treated in a non-deterministic way.",
        "Syntactically based disambiguation (e.g. the word that) attempts each reading of an ambiguous word in turn and cancels inappropriate readings by testing them against syntactic well formedness criteria.",
        "Encyclopaedia based disambiguation (e.g. the word lank) works through the activation of encyclopaedic nodes by the words in the sentence.",
        "It selects that reading of an ambiguous word which activates the node \"better\" connected to the other activated nodes.",
        "It should be noted that, our approach, in comparison to Smalls work on Word Expert Parsing (Small, 1980), is characterized by (a) non-determinism, (b) a more systematic recourse to syntax, (c) a separation of syntactically based word disambiguation from encyclopaedia based word disambiguation.",
