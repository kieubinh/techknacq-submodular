        "LESK (Language for Exactly Stating Knowledge) is intended to bridge the considerable gap between natural language (NL), computer language (CL) and logic.",
        "It is desirable to do-so for the following reason.",
        "To implement any non-trivial computer system for some problem domain, one must first have a very clear understanding of the domain concepts.",
        "Usually the implementors do not have this knowledge, and must struggle to obtain it from the domain experts, who are usually not computer experts.",
        "Hence a means of precise and efficient knowledge expression would be very useful.",
        "No such tool exists today and we therefore seek to develop one.",
        "LESK is a first approximation to such a medium for knowledge capture.",
        "Anyone who has participated in the design of any system where knowledge transfer from experts was involved will appreciate the need for such a tool.",
        "The existing tools are the following: NL, mathematical concepts and notation, computer concepts and notation, plus assorted devices like diagrams, pictures, models, etc.",
        "By far the major tool is 111, however, which is unfortunately very poorly used by most people, particularly recent university graduates.",
        "The most frequent errors inolude the use of undefined terminology, synonyms or homonyms (whose status as such must be guessed), unclear syntax, logical - 262 - errors (such as outright contradictions), undefined relations between concepts, and simple lack of good organization.",
        "LESK forces the user to express him/herself in ways designed to minimize such errors.",
        "A LESK system (an interactive program which \"understands\" LESK) would further reduce such errors.",
        "Criteria for LESK LESK should a) be readable by most university graduates in science, medicine, law or business, for example;",
        "b) be writable by most people with a basic knowledge of set theory, logic and computers.",
        "; (3) have a simple semantics expressible in first-order logic; d) be implementable using artificial intelligence techniques; e) be sufficiently general to be usable in the subjects of interest to those listed in a).",
        "The present design of LESK has been shown to meet all of these criteria.",
        "Design of LESK LESK should be viewed as a language for making assertions about sets, tuples, sequences, functions, relations, procedures and other simple mathematical concepts using an English-like syntax (many other Nis could be used; translation of LESK-based knowledge should be easier than translation of NL).",
        "The user declares words or phrases either explicitly or implicitly to be nouns (or noun-like), adjectives, prepositions, or verbs (other categories have not been necessary).",
        "Nouns and noun phrases denote sets, stative verbs denote relations, action verbs denote procedures, and prepositions denote case relations.",
        "The syntax is a compromise between NL, CL, and logic.",
        "All constructs have a simple first-order logic interpretation.",
        "An example (whose spirit should warm the heart of those who despair of ever understanding the regulations of their - 263 - institution) follows.",
        "LESK primitives are in lower case.",
        "We first illustrate noun declarations.",
        "(N.B.",
        "In the final paper, this example will be greatly expanded and explained.)",
        "kinds: UNDERGRADUATE -, GRADUATE--; - is a PERSON; - is ENROLLED IN 1 DEGREE PROGRAM; - is a STUDENT IN 1 FACULTY, SCHOOL or DEPARTMENT; - has 1 ACADEMIC RECORD end.",
        "every ACADEMIC RECORD of a STUDENT X: - has 1 FACULTY, SCHOOL or DEPARTMENT; - has 0 or more COURSE CREDITS; - has 0 or more COURSE SECTIONS called the COURSES-BEING-TAKEN BY X end.",
        "every COURSE CREDIT: - is a pair <X, Y> where X is a COURSE, Y is a LETTER GRADE end.",
        "We illustrate next two stative verb declarations: a STUDENT X is ENROLLED IN a COURSE SECTION Y iff: X is on the ENROJ.LMNT LIST of Y. a STUDENT X is a STUDENT IN a FACULTY, SCHOOL or DEPARTMENT Y iff: - 264 - Y the FACULTY, SCHOOL or DEPARTMENT of the ACADEMIC RECORD of X.",
        "Finally, we illustrate an action verb declaration: To ENROLL a STUDENT X IN a COURSE SECTION Ys preconds for each PREREQUISITE Z of Y there is a COURSE CREDIT <Z,M> on the ACADEMIC RECORD of such that M is a PASSING GRADE; ham PAID the FEE of Y; add: negate: delete: procedure: add to the ENROturENT LIST of Y; add I to the COURSES BEING TAKEN BY end.",
        "Concluding Remarks LESK has been used to describe neurophysiologioal knowledge, electrical circuits, PASCAL, the Canadian census database, and university regulations.",
        "A partial implementation has been developed in DEC 10 PROLOG.",
        "A LESK system should be capable of answering any question (expressed in LESK) which a person could answer from the same LESK.",
        "knowledge base.",
        "This clearly requires both deductive and database komponents.",
        "Systems now exist which combine these two; it remains therefore to add the LESK component, which is our eventual goal.",
