        "The distinction between underlying and surface structure is more or less well established in contemporary grammatical analysis.",
        "The form and depth of the underlying structure and its relationship to observable language reality are, however, permanently in the focus of linguistic disputes.",
        "In the standard generative transformational model (Chomsky, 1965) underlying structure was moderately deep.",
        "It reflected the surface structure of English and catered for semantic distinctions mainly through the inherent semantic features of the lexicon.",
        "The semantic component, to which the derived sentences were being sent for semantic processing, was not well defined.",
        "The generative semantics models deepened the underlying structure and imposed a considerable gap between the latter and the surface structure.",
        "This gap was to be bridged by transformations, which with McCawley included very extensive lexical changes.",
        "The functions of the underlying participants in the action or state came to differ signifficantly from those of the surface nominal constituents.",
        "In Fillmore's model (Fillmore, 1969) the subject of the surface structure correlated not only with the \"underlying subject' or \"actor\" but also with an underlying patient, experiender, locative... To provide for this correlation, Fillmore set up rules for systhematic stab-jectivization of non-agentive \"underlying cases\".",
        "What's more,",
        "he assigned to each verb a specific \"case frame\" which often lead to proposing features of conditional obligatoriness (represented in his notation by embedded and intersecting brackets).",
        "Similar endeavours for correlating underlying functions with divergent surface constituents lead Gruber (1967) to vague characterizations, often in different terms for different classes of verbs.",
        "Anderson (1971), in his turn, opposing the characterization of subjeot/verb relations in terms like \"actor/action\", offered a great variety of case functions to be assigned to his noun phrases, depending on the nature of their participation in the \"process\" or \"state\" represented by the predicate.",
        "More recently, generative linguists have been becoming increasingly aware of the necessity to distinguish meaning, taken as the linguistic counterpart of intensional structure of sense, from cognitive content, i.e. from the language independent patterning° of factual knowledge.",
        "Thus, Fillmore (1977) reexamines his underlying cases, places them outside the language system in a strict sense - in the realm of conceptualization, and assumes that the underlying structure of language proper is set up by \"creating conditions under which a speaker °hoses to draw certain case roles into perspective\".",
        "Sgall (1980), in his turn, claims that his multilevel generative model permits to set up semantic, underlying, tectogrammatioal units, which are set off from the cognitive level \"case-roles\" but relate to them through PanevovCs regular system of shifting (Panevovd, 1980).",
        "This shifting can, of course, be accommodated in the realm of conceptualization without the system of levels of functional generative grammar.",
        "Recent transfers of selection of \"case-roles\" into conceptualization has not made linguistic description perspicuously simpler.",
        "The analyst has the choice of (a) introducing a set of rules that would \"shift\" the conceptual case roles so that they may naturally take their appropriate places in underlying structure or else (b) making provisions for adjustment rules between the levels - 292 - of underlying and surface structure.",
        "In the belief that the constituents of the underlying structure of a model-for automatic generation of the sentences of a natural language should be defined in terms that associate them closely to respective surface structure constituents, our initial efforts for the construction of a grammar for automatic generation of Serbo-Croatian have lead us to a predicate-centered underlying structure whose nominals fall within two general types: nuclear and extranuclear or adverbial.",
        "While the latter are optional, the former are obligatory for a given predicate; they can be abstent from the surface structure but are always recoverable.",
        "The number and type of nuclear nominals that relate to each given predicate can be.",
        "stated in a predicate dictionary.",
        "When the underlying structure of individual sentences are being generated, these dictionaries can serve as guides for the selection of the nuclear nominal, for each predicate, which can be defined as the first, second, third ... nominal of a given predicate (the exact number should be determined with tests for obligatori-nese).",
        "The first nominal (or nominal one) is the nominal from Which the action or state denoted by the predicate originates, the second nominal (or nominal two) is the nominal towards which the action or state of the predicate is directed, whereas the third nominal (or nominal three) is the nominal functioning as an intermediary between nominal 1 and nominal 2.",
        "The linear ordering of the surface structure constituents does not always correspond to the ordering of the underlying nominals; however, in the communicatively unmarked sentences the correspondence between the type of surface structure function and type of underlying structure nominal is stable.",
        "In these sentences, nominal one is realized as subject, nominal two as direct object or any other type of direct complement (i.e. complement which relates to the verb directly), while nominal three is realized as indirect oblect or any other complement that is contingent on the presence of another complement.",
        "- 293 - In the inflective languages (and Serbo-Croatian is one of them) the surface structure constituents are marked by specific suffixes.",
        "The morphonological changes incurred by suffixation are usually being attributed to the operations of sane morphonological component or stratum.",
        "We, however, maintain that the assignment of the suffix and the morphonologioal changes accompanying it can be done by the rules that transform (or translate) the underlying structure into surface structure.",
        "Vitae (1980) has constructed a program for automatic generation of the nominal paradigm.",
        "We are now devising signals which, when attached to the arguments and adverbial nominals of the underlying structure, would trigger the generation of inflected nominal surface structure constituents along with their respective prepositions, if any.",
        "At the same time, work on the automatic generation of the predicate phrase constituents is under way.",
        "In the first generative (English language based) models morphology was assigned an ansoillary role.",
        "Work with inflected languages has shown that it should be dealt with independent of, though in coordination with, syntax.",
        "By developing programs for automatic generation of the morphonologioal forms, while working on the syntactic and semantic oamponent(s) of the grammar, we hope to be able to build a model which is formally simple and in which the underlying structure will not be excessively remote from the surface one."
