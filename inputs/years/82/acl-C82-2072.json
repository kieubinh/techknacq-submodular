        "In this paper, I describe some of the theoretical underpinnings of the model, and then describe two programs, PBRAN and PHEW, that are based on these ideas.",
        "We have conducted a number of experiments with these systems that have some bearing on the utility of the model's presumptions, including testing these systems on other languages (Spanish and Chinese), and implementing one of them.in a relational data base system.",

        "Language user knows a great number of fact about what utterances of their language mean.",
        "That is, in addition to knowing the meanings of a large number of words, they know the significance of a set of meaningful linguistic units that are not necessarily understood in terms of their components.",
        "Our conjecture is that suoh units constitute a very considerable fraction of the language knowledge needed by an intelligent language processor.",
        "2.2.",
        "Sharable Knowledge Base In'our model, it is assumed that the knowledge used for analysis and for production is by and large the same.",
        "That is, there is only one data base of knowledge about the meanings of a language's forms.",
        "By having the knowledge of the two components be a shared data base, only one form of representation is needed.",
        "Moreover, the addition of new knowledge to this data base extends the capabilities of both systems simultaneously.",
        "As this requirement forces knowledge to be represented_ declaratively, the other benefits of such representations are enjoyed as well.",
        "For example, in this format, knowledge about the language is kept separate from the processing strategies that apply this knowledge to the understanding and production tasks.",
        "Thus adding new knowledge requires only adding new assertions to the data base, not writing and debugging new code.",
        "In addition, other knowledge besides the meaning of a phrase can be easily associated with such declarative representations.",
        "3.0.",
        "PHRAN and PHRED We have been developing this model of language use in two related programs, PHRAN (PHRasal ANa/yzer) and PHRED (PHRasal English Diction).",
        "PHRAN is a language understanding program written by Yigal Arens.",
        "It reads English sentences â€¢ and produces representations from them that encode their meaning.",
        "PHRED is a natural language production mechanism developed by Steven Upstill.",
        "PHRED takes meaning representat-' ions as input and expresses them in.Inglishsentences.",
        "Both PHRAN and PHRED share a common data base of language knowledge.",
        "This data base contains declarative representations about what the phrase of the English language mean.",
        "This knowledge is stored in the form of pattern-concept pairs.",
        "A pattern is a phrasal construct of varying degrees of specificity.",
        "The concept part of a pattern-concept pair is a con 297 - oeptual template that represents the meaning of the associated phrase.",
        "Together, these pairs associate different forms of utterances with their meanings.",
        "PBRAN understands by reading the input text and trying to find the phrasal patterns that apply to it.",
        "Eventually, the conceptual template associated with the desired pattern is used to generate the structure denoting the meaning of the utterance.",
        "PHRED produces sentences that encode an idea by examining the same knowledge base.",
        "4.0 Spanish and Chinese MAN We have build both a Spanish and a Chinese version of PHRAN simply by changing the pattern-concept data base.",
        "These programs lend support to some of the claims we make for our model.",
        "We found that it was possible to rewrite most of the patterns into phrases of another language without havingethe knowledge encoder learn anything about the inner workings of the program.",
        "This suggests that a system like PHRAN could be designed to allow fairly easy construction of a language processor for a new language, or to allow for the addition of special purpose phrases or jargon by some user who was not an expert AI programmer.",
        "5.0 AI and Relation Data Bases We implemented aversion of PHRAN in a conventional data base system.",
        "PHRAN was rewritten in.WEL, a query language for the INGRES relational data base system developed at Berkeley.",
        "Tests were run to compare the relative performance of the systems on various size data bases.",
        "The results can be summarized as follows: The LISP version is considerably faster when the data base of pattern-concept pairs is small.",
        "However, when the data base is large (2000 words and 500 patterns), the EQUEL version is about 3 times faster than the LISP version.",
        "Thus performance problems in natural languagt may pe solved by importing developments in data base technology as the size of our knowledge bases grow.",
