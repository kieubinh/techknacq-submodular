        "The panel on concept extraction from natural language text defined a variety of different views on the problem at issue.",
        "First, we considered what would be the properties of a very powerful natural language understanding system which would serve as an ultimate model for our deliberations, but was clearly not achievable within the five-year time frame specified as the primary area of interest to the Navy for the purposes of this workshop.",
        "However, it could serve as a goal toward which progress could be made in a series of approximations, beginning within the next five years and extending beyond.",
        "The \"ultimate\" system we envisioned was a model for understanding the text of scientific and technical literature in order to discover technological innovations, discern evolution of technological trends, and predict where science and technology will evolve in the future.",
        "Such a system would consist of two major components:",
        "1.",
        "Natural language understanding expert(s), whose task would be to read and assimilate the narrative text of scientific and technical literature.",
        "2.",
        "Science and technology analysis expert(s), whose",
        "function would be to evaluate the content of individual articles as well as the cumulative contents of the collection of scientific and technical materials, and to identify trends and innovations, using models of current developments in science and technology that define what would constitute an innovation, a trend, etc., and that specify a variety of other rather inexplicit types of knowledge used by human experts to evaluate and predict.",
        "With this lofty goal somewhat vaguely identified as a Holy Grail for the future, we concentrated our efforts on defining approximations to that goal, selecting as our focus the military message analysis and routing problem presented by NRL personnel as representative of a particular set of problems the Navy is currently attempting to solve.",
        "Within this context, the panel addressed two types of development issues:",
        "1.",
        "How to manage the evolution of a type of system based on existing message routing technology to a more capable, knowledge-based system within the next five years.",
        "2.",
        "How to manage the evolution of the next generation knowledge based system for message routing from the last development stage reached in (1).",

        "In planning the evolutionary development of existing military message routing systems into more capable, knowledge-based systems within the next five years, the panel considered a variety of techniques and approaches that might be added to existing systems to augment the current level of capability and \"grow\" the system in the direction of a more powerful natural language processing model.",
        "There are two experimental development methods which could be used to achieve this goal.",
        "The first would be to begin with an actual operational message routing system, install some version of this system at NRL as an experimental vehicle2 and use it as a basis to build on, adding the components which provide the incremental capabilities discussed below, and systematically evaluating the effect of the additional capabilities.",
        "An alternate approach would be to construct a first stage experimental message routing system without using any existing system as a foundation and proceeding as indicated above."

      "text": [
        "The initial stage of improved capability can be achieved by incorporating into the basic message routing system described above several state-of-the art computational linguistic components which are almost characterizable as \"off-the-shelf\".",
        "Specifically, these include a spelling corrector, a morphological analyzer, and a synonym generator.",
        "The spelling corrector would be of a type similar to the capability currently available under the UNIX operating system, tailored for the Navy message routing application (that is, including a variety of Naval acronyms, relevant proper nouns such as place names and ship names, and other special jargon terms).",
        "Intelligent morphological analyzers have been built for a number of natural language processing systems; these can be supplemented by current non-numeric processing techniques for partial match of character strings.",
        "A synonym generator, on the other hand, while well within the state of the art, still requires development of the knowledge base of synonyms in some manner.",
        "To illustrate, suppose that the system must automatically produce for a user all the natural language synonyms for the terms in a routing profile or retrieval query of a user who wants all messages about \"military aircraft in the vicinity of the Red Sea\".",
        "In order to generate the synonyms for each of those terms (which users should then be allowed to prune or supplement as they prefer), the system must either have been primed beforehand by an extensive development of a thesaurus-type knowledge base, or the system must have an ability to acquire such knowledge from users in an incremental manner (where the burden of developing the knowledge base of synonyms is mainly on the user), or a combination of both (for an illustration of the latter, see Katter and Montgomery 1972).2"

      "heading": "3.2.2 Second Stage: Augment Key Word Based Concept Extraction",
      "text": [
        "The second stage of improved capability in the basic message routing system would be achieved by augmenting the current key word base content analysis component in several steps.",
        "It should be noted that these steps are based on the in-depth analysis of messages and the routing environment described in Section 3.3, which should thus be conducted in parallel with the development of the first stage improvements discussed in the preceding section.",
        "2 The operational message routing systems described in footnote 1 allow users to develop synonym tables and utilize those produced by others; however, these are not automatically triggered when a routing profile is entered, but must be specifically requested by the user.",
        "Content analysis of messages based on key words involves a rudimentary identification of concepts, with no attempt to identify relations between concepts.",
        "Thus a message reporting on shipments of cotter pins from Cuba to Albania would not be distinguishable from a similar one reporting on shipments of cotter pins from Albania to Cuba.",
        "Consequently, the initial step in augmenting the ability of a message routing system to analyze the content of messages and extract concepts from text would be the introduction of grammar rules and a syntactic analysis component.",
        "A semantic grammar approach in which the categories of the grammar map fairly directly into user information requirements ments would constitute a productive initial capability.",
        "Such a grammar could be built along the lines of the LIFER parser which was incorporated into LADDER (Burton 1976) specifically to answer questions about ships at sea.",
        "A second development step in managing the evolution of a key word based concept extraction system to a natural language understanding system involves the construction of taxonomic hierachies which provide the system with the knowledge to attempt rudimentary inference, allow property inheritance, and exercise some very simple analogic reasoning based on the taxonomies.",
        "The work of Woods on constructing and exploiting taxonomic hierarchies is illustrative of this type of capability.",
        "The methodology used by SRI's NANOKLAUS system for organizing knowledge has a similar basis (Haas and Hendrix 1980).",
        "A further enhacement would involve the utilization of more general inference about the content of the message (for example, rule based inference, where the concept of rule includes frames and scripts as well as production rules).",
        "Many messages relate information about some particular type of event that has occured many times before and will continue to occur, e.g., a missile or space launch.",
        "Knowledge about the entities and relations involved in such an event can therefore be codified in terms of rules or scripts which explicate the expected contents of a message.",
        "This provides the basis on which the system can derive information which is not explicity stated in the message and can identify elements of information which are unexpected or lacking.",
        "The experimental message understanding system described in Silva et al.",
        "1979 is an example of this type of capability, as is the work of Simmons and Chester (to apppear, 1982).",
        "The final developmental level deemed to be achievable within the next five years differs from the levels previously discussed in that it incorporates one type of meta-knowledge, that is, knowledge that is not concerned with the content of the messages, but with the goals of the recipient of the message.",
        "For example, the recipient may have gotten the message simply for information; on the other hand, the recipient may be American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 8, Number 2, April-June 1982 71 Christine Montgomery Concept Extraction required to take some action on receiving the message rather than merely filing it away, and the actions he may take could be quite different depending on the content of the message (e.g., information that an activity has begun, or that an activity which has been going on for some time is continuing, or has ceased).",
        "Thus the consequences of the natural language understanding failing to identify the type of content and causing the message to be misrouted can be quite serious in an operational environment."

      "text": [
        "Before the augmented message routing system could be used even experimentally by persons other than its designers, it must have the means for dealing with its own inadequancies.",
        "Suppose the lexical lookup encounters a word which is not in the dictionary, or the parser cannot analyze an input construction, even though all the words are known.",
        "Approaches to solving the problem of unexpected inputs fall into two categories, and a robust system will incorporate some partial solutions of both types.",
        "The first type of approach involves what heuristics and other reasoning strategies the system can attempt without appeal to the user; the second involves user interaction.",
        "What the system can do without appealing to the user in the case of an unknown word ranges from:",
        "1. very simple heuristics which assume a misspelling and attempt to identify the word by partial match strategies, to 2. the complex strategy of utilizing a protype knowledge structure to deduce that the unknown word must be an entity of type x because it fits an otherwise unsatisfied slot in such a structure that requires an entity of type x.",
        "Some productive approaches to handling structures that are ungrammatical from the system's perspective involve systematically relaxing some of the grammatical constraints built in to the parser (e.g., subject/verb agreement), as discussed in Weischedel and Black 1980.",
        "In appealing to the user for assistance, a critical factor is supplying not only the right information about the particular failure, but the right amount of information presented in words that the user can understand, and with suggested remedial actions that are general from the system perspective, not confusing to the user, and unlikely to elicit erroneous inputs.",
