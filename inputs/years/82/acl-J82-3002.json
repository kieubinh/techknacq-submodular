        "This paper describes the results of a three-year research project carried out by the two of us.",
        "The project was directed towards the goal of providing practical computer systems that will answer questions expressed in precisely defined subsets of natural language.",
        "The results of our work are incorporated in a running prototype system, called \"Chat-80\".",
        "Two issues have particularly influenced the approach we have taken, namely efficiency and portability.",
        "Given the practical objective, we wanted to achieve rapid, interactive question answering, and we wanted the techniques to be easily adaptable to a variety of applications, with as much of the implementation code as possible being application independent (cf. Konolige 1979).",
        "There has been no intention to try to handle unrestricted natural language.",
        "Given the current state of the art, we accept that users of a practical natural language question answering system will have to learn how to use a restricted natural language subset rele",

        "The important issue is whether they will find this more convenient than a more formal query language.",
        "We believe that, for many purposes, a suitable natural language subset will be much preferred, on grounds of conciseness and ease of typing alone (see the examples in Appendix III, for instance).",
        "It is fair to say that our objective is to so constrain natural language that it becomes a formal, but user-friendly, query language.",
        "The starting point for our work was a question answering system for a small subset of Spanish implemented by Veronica Dahl 1981,1979, following the approach advocated by Colmerauer 1978.",
        "We were particularly attracted to Colmerauer's approach for the clear insight it gives into some of the essential problems involved in constructing a practical natural language answering system, especially the problem of correctly interpreting determiners.",
        "In addition, it proved very easy to adapt Dahl's program to English (and to a different domain).",
        "This was due in large part to the fact that the system is implemented in Prolog (Roussel 1975; Warren, Pereira, and Pereira 1977), a programming language based on first-order logic.",
        "To be more specific, the system is largely made Copyright 1982 by the Association for Computational Linguistics.",

        "MGs are an extension of a simpler formalism to which we have given the name definite clause grammars (DCGs) (Pereira and Warren 1980).",
        "We called the adapted program \"Chat\".",
        "When running compiled under DEC-10 Prolog (Warren 1979; Pereira, Pereira, and Warren 1978), Chat's speed at analysing English sentences proved very satisfactory (under a tenth of a second of CPU time per sentence).",
        "Therefore this seemed a promising approach from the point of view of both efficiency and portability.",
        "However, we found that Chat has a number of shortcomings, the most serious of which is that the process of answering a question, once it has been analysed, is much too inefficient for any significant application.",
        "We have therefore written an entirely new program, Chat-80, which, like the original Chat, is implemented entirely in Prolog.",
        "The main ways in which Chat-80 differs from its forerunner are:",
        "► the semantics given to determiners, and the rules for determining their scopes, ► the process of planning and executing a query, ► the rather wider coverage of English, ► the use of extraposition grammars (XGs) in place of MGs to handle certain \"transformational\" aspects of English,",
        "► the way the natural language analysis is performed in three separate phases rather than one.",
        "In order to test the approach on a nontrivial domain, Chat-80 includes a database of facts about world geography, and a small vocabulary of English words sufficient for querying the database.",
        "This domain has the advantage, for demonstration purposes, that the facts in the database are generally common knowledge, so it is easier to appreciate what is entailed in answering different queries.",
        "The database contains basic facts about the world's countries (over 150 of them), oceans, major seas, major rivers, and major cities.",
        "The largest relation, 'borders', represents all pairs of countries, oceans, or major seas that are adjacent, and contains therefore over 850 tuples.",
        "It should be emphasised that the database is itself implemented as ordinary Prolog; it therefore resides within the normal DEC-10 virtual memory.",

        "To answer a question, one first has to understand what it means.",
        "If question answering is to be done by computer, there needs to be some precise representation for the result of this first process, what one might call the \"meaning\" of the question, and also some precise way of relating the question to its meaning.",
        "It is further necessary that the meaning representation can in some way be given a precise interpretation (or \"semantics\") so that, in the case of questions for instance, one then knows precisely what is or is not a correct answer to the questions.",
        "It is surprising that, even for such basic features of English as the common determiners, and even within the different language camps represented by linguistics, philosophy, and artificial intelligence, there is as yet no established solution to this problem.",
        "One way to try to articulate the meaning of a sentence is to paraphrase it into some standard, unambiguous form of English.",
        "Since these standard forms are likely to be stilted and long-winded, it will probably be convenient to represent them in a more concise notation.",
        "This is essentially the logician's approach, and we will call such meaning representations \"logical forms\".",
        "Chat-80 represents the meaning of a question by a logical form.",
        "The approach is a development of that proposed by Colmerauer 1978 and implemented by Dahl 1981,1979.",
        "Words approximating to the status of \"proper nouns\" are represented by logical constants, for example: France france",
        "complex phrases or sentences can be represented by conjunctions of predications, for example: Paris is a European city.",
        "The second of these conjunctions, for example, can be read more literally as a shorthand for \"France is a country and France borders Spain\", which is just a paraphrase of the original sentence.",
        "The most important class of words not covered so far are the determiners – words such as \"a\", \"the\", \"every\".",
        "Determiners play a particularly important role in questions, since they enable relatively complex requests for information to be expressed very concisely.",
        "In Colmerauer's approach, each determiner is represented by what he called a \"three-branched quantifier\" (3BQ).",
        "For example, the logical form that would be ascribed to the sentence \"The boy sleeps\" would be: the(X,boy(X),sleeps(X)) where the determiner \"the\" is represented by the 3BQ `the( „ )'.",
        "3BQs are very close to the meaning representation for determiners used by Woods in the LUNAR system (1977).",
        "Colmerauer gave 3BQs a precise semantics in terms of certain operations over sets.",
        "However, we have found that this way of interpreting 3BQs fails to give a correct model of natural language in certain cases, and, worse still, it does not appear to lend itself to efficient implementation.",
        "Certainly this is the case with Dahl's program which, while being very efficient at understanding questions, is hopelessly inefficient at answering questions where the domain is of any significant size.",
        "In Chat-80, we have addressed these problems by instead translating 3BQs directly into standard first-order logic, or rather into something as close to first-order logic as is practical.",
        "To be more exact, we translate into the Prolog subset of logic, which we have augmented with certain \"meta-logical\" extensions.",
        "(A similar approach has been taken by McCord 1982, who has independently been developing a system influenced by the Colmerauer/Dahl approach.)",
        "The subset of first-order logic we have chosen has the great advantage as a meaning representation that it already has a well understood semantics which is amenable to very efficient implementation.",
        "Thus the meaning representation can in principle be directly executed as a Prolog program (whereas 3BQs require a special-purpose interpreter).",
        "Furthermore, the first-order logic formulation lends itself to transformations which can greatly improve the efficiency of execution.",
        "This corresponds to what is known as \"query optimisation\" in relational database circles, and will be discussed in more detail later.",
        "Our translation into logic completely ignores the presuppositions which can be implicit in a natural language question, and which Colmerauer's 3BQ semantics took pains to reflect.",
        "In most situations that we are concerned with, this simplification seems relatively harmless or even beneficial.",
        "For example, Chat-80 ignores the presupposition that there is only one answer to the question \"Which ocean borders the United States?\", and simply gives all three answers without further comment.",
        "The way we translate determiners into logic is shown in Figure 1.",
        "Each determiner is translated into a quantification, which introduces some logic variable (X, N, etc.",
        "), and which links two predications involving that variable, called the range and scope, indicated by R and S. The determiners \"a\", \"the\" (in a singular context), and \"some\" (whether in a singular or plural context) are all translated in exactly the same way, by a standard first-order logic existential quantification.",
        "Read `exists(X,P)' as \"there is some X such that P\".",
        "The same translation is also normally used for the \"empty plural\" determiner, for example: Zambia exports minerals.",
        "exists (X,mineral(X) & exports(zambia,X)).",
        "The determiner \"no\" is translated with the aid of a kind of negation.",
        "Read ' \\ -FP' as \"it cannot be shown that P\".",
        "Note that this is not the standard negation of first-order logic, which is outside the Prolog subset.",
        "Standard negation is problematic to implement and seems inappropriate for many purposes.",
        "Instead Prolog systems provide (or can easily be extended with) a partial implementation of nonprovability.",
        "The predication ' \\ A-P' is considered true if P is not deducible from the facts and rules which define a particular application domain.",
        "Note that nonprovability is also used in the translation of the determiners \"every\" and \"all\".",
        "The determiner \"the\" in a plural context presents a number of problems, for which we do not yet feel we have a completely adequate solution.",
        "In general, we consider a plural definite noun phrase to denote a set.",
        "To cater for this, we have proposed and implemented a \"meta-logical\" extension to Prolog, which has been described in detail elsewhere (Warren, 1982; Byrd, Pereira, and Warren 1980).",

        "This \"slot filling\" is determined mainly by the grammatical structure of the sentence, but the correct attachment of prepositional phrases often cannot be determined on purely syntactic grounds.",
        "Second, what determines the scope of the different quantifications?",
        "For example, why is the existential quantification corresponding to the empty determiner governing \"countries in Africa\" nested inside the quantification corresponding to \"no\"?",
        "This \"scoping\" is only weakly influenced by grammatical structure.",
        "Indeed, it is possible to give an alternative but much less likely reading to our example sentence, which corresponds to the same grammatical structure, but to a different logical form where the nesting of the two inner quantifications is reversed.",
        "The more likely reading is that no arms are exported to any countries in Africa; the less likely reading is that no arms are exported to certain countries in Africa.",

        "The translation from English sentence to logical form can be seen as involving three main functions the slot filling and scope determination mentioned in the last section, and in addition the parsing function, which determines the grammatical structure of a sentence.",
        "In Chat-80, in contrast to Dahl's system, these three functions are separated into distinct program modules, which operate in sequence: English question parsing phrase structure",
        "The parsing module consists of a set of grammar rules of the XG formalism, which the Prolog system preprocesses into Prolog clauses.",
        "The interpretation and scoping modules consist of various translation rules, expressed directly as Prolog clauses.",
        "Executing the grammar rules with Prolog leads to a straightforward top-down, backtrack parsing strategy (Pereira and Warren 1980).",
        "Although the main concern in writing the grammar was to produce a clear description of the language covered, some concessions have had to be made to achieve a reasonably efficient behaviour with the above parsing strategy; in particular, left-recursive rules have been avoided.",
        "It is somewhat contrary to current opinion that such a grammar, not carefully designed for parsing, can also be the basis of an efficient parser.",
        "One of the reasons for the efficiency in this case may be that the grammar itself makes no attempt to give the \"right\" modifier attachments, as discussed below.",
        "There has been some debate on whether the different parts of language analysis, such as the three distinguished above, should be done serially or concurrently (Burton 1976; Woods 1977).",
        "Some of the arguments for concurrent operation are that early semantic interpretation limits search by bringing in relevant information at the earliest possible moment, and that piecewise generation of the interpretation is psychologically more plausible.",
        "Given that we are not proposing a model of language comprehension in people, the latter argument is not directly relevant.",
        "The other argument is a two-edged one: by interweaving several operations, one is multiplying together their nondeterminacies.",
        "There are two main reasons why we have chosen serial operation.",
        "The first is that serial operation is much simpler both conceptually and in programming terms, particularly if one is trying to deal flexibly with global properties of the input, for instance the relative scopes of determiners.",
        "The other reason is that the backtracking traditionally associated with modifier attachment can be avoided by a careful choice of the parse trees produced by the parsing module.",
        "In typical systems where syntactic and semantic functions operate in sequence (Woods, Kaplan, and Nash-Webber 1972), choices are made in the syntactic analysis that may be found to be inadequate on se",
        "mantic grounds, as for example in prepositional phrase attachment.",
        "In the present system, the syntactic component of the grammar contains additional constraints which block all but one of the potential attachments of each postmodifier.",
        "Thus, all analyses produces are in a kind of normal form with respect to postmodifier attachment.",
        "From this normal form, subsequent operations can reconstruct other alternative analyses, if that is needed on semantic grounds.",
        "The use of normal form analyses has the useful consequence of making apparent other, significant, ambiguities in the input, which otherwise would be swamped by a large number of alternative analyses differing only with respect to modifier attachment.",
        "A major limitation of the current system is that pronouns (other than interrogative and relative pronouns) are not covered at all by the translation phase.",
        "This makes the natural language subset strictly less powerful than the underlying logic.",
        "For example, the following sentence has a logical form which cannot be rendered in our natural language subset: Which country contains a city bigger than its capital?",
        "To each of the three modules of the translation process there corresponds a separate dictionary.",
        "The grammar dictionary contains definitions of the usual syntactic categories, both for general-purpose, or \"closed-category\", words, such as determiners, and for application dependent, or \"content\", words, such as the nouns and verbs corresponding to database predicates.",
        "The slot filling module has a dictionary of templates, which define the translation of words to predicates and the argument patterns required for each such translation.",
        "Each application will require a different set of templates.",
        "Finally, the scope determination module has a small dictionary defining the scope relationships for determiners and other \"operator\" words, and their translation as discussed in the last section.",
        "This dictionary is independent of the application domain.",
        "The dictionaries are divided in this manner for conceptual and programming reasons, but it would not be difficult to write a program to create the dictionary entries from a more user-oriented dictionary format.",

        "Quants correspond to noun phrases, Preds to verbs, and Conjs to conjoined restrictive modifiers.",
        "As we have seen, quantifications play a crucial role in the translation of sentences into logics.",
        "The fields of a Quant are: ► the determiner, which can be an English determiner or one of the special determiners described below; ► the head, which is either the predication translating the head noun of a noun phrase, or a term denoting a higher-order operation; ► the predication, a tree describing restrictions on the head whose determiners have narrower scope than the determiner on this Quant; ► the arguments, a list of the trees for the arguments of the noun, together with the trees of those restrictions whose determiners may have wider scope than the present one; ► the bound variable for this quantification.",
        "The distinction between the predication and the argument list of a Quant corresponds to one of the main scoping heuristics in the system: full relative clauses are the only subordinated phrases whose determiners cannot \"move up\" to dominate determiners in higher tree nodes.",
        "Thus, when a Quant is mapped into a logic quantification, the head, predication, and some of the arguments will translate into the range of the quantification, whereas the scope will be made from the rest of the arguments and some quantifications which are higher in the tree but whose determiners have a narrower scope than the present one.",
        "The determiner of a Quant may not be the original English determiner of the corresponding noun phrase.",
        "In nested plural definite noun phrases, only the highest determiner gets translated into a set expression following the translation table of Figure 1; lower determiners are understood to index that set, and are represented in Quants by an index token.",
        "For example, the noun phrase: the children of the employees translates into a set of sets of children, indexed by employees: setof(E-S, employee(E) & setof(C,child(E,C),S), S1)."

        "big difference between principle and practice.",

        "Naive question-answering strategies typically take a time that is exponential in the size of the query.",
        "Even for relatively small databases, such as that in Chat-80, exponential behaviour will be disastrous for non-trivial queries (and non-trivial queries are what a natural language interface encourages).",
        "A query over a small database that can be answered almost instantaneously with the right question-answering strategy may easily take hours with a poor algorithm.",
        "We had actual experience of this phenomenon when we experimented with mounting the Chat database on the relational database system Ingres (Stonebraker, Wong, Kreps, and Held 1976).",
        "Simple queries Ingres handled easily, but on queries involving more than two relations, which were no problem for Chat, Ingres usually bogged down completely.",
        "We therefore think that the question-answering part of natural language question-answering is at least as worthy of attention as the natural language part, and the two should be studied hand in hand.",
        "A complete description of the way Chat-80 processes logic queries, together with a fuller discussion of the efficiency issues, is given in a separate paper (Warren 1981), which we urge the interested reader to consult.",
        "Here we just give a brief summary, illustrated by one example.",
        "Basically, Chat-80 augments the logical form of a query with extra control information, to make it into an efficient piece of Prolog program, which can then be directly executed to produce the answer.",
        "The control information is computed by a general planning algorithm, applicable to any query in the logic subset, not just to those derivable from the present natural language subset.",
        "The planning process makes use of certain statistics about the size, etc., of the domain relations, and is analogous to \"query optimisation\" in a relational database system.",
        "The control information that is generated takes two forms: ► the ordering of predications within a query, which will determine the order in which Prolog will attempt to satisfy them; ► the marking of \"independent subproblems\" by enclosing them in braces, to limit (or \"cut\") the amount of backtracking performed by Prolog.",
        "For example, here is an English question with the logical form produced by the natural language analysis phase of Chat-80: \"Which countries bordering the Mediterranean border Asian countries?\"",
        "When executed by Prolog, this produces a behaviour equivalent to the following procedural interpretation: To generate an answer C: generate a C bordering the mediterranean, and then check that C is a country, and then check that it is possible to: generate a C 1 bordered by C, and then check that C 1 is asian, and then check that C 1 is a country.",
        "Thus Prolog is led to answer the query in an obviously sensible way; it iterates through the countries bordering the Mediterranean, and for each one, it iterates through the things bordering that country until it finds something that is an Asian country.",
        "In fact the DEC-10 Prolog compiler can in principle compile the transformed query into code which is comparable in efficiency with iterative loops in a conventional language (Warren 1977).",
        "However, in Chat-80 the transformed query is actually just interpreted."

        "It will be seen that the subset includes nouns, verbs, adjectives, prepositions, and determiners, with a fairly full coverage of interrogative and relative constructions.",
        "We have concentrated on features of English that seemed essential for simple question answering; there are many directions in which the subset could usefully be extended and which do not appear to pose any particular difficulties.",
        "At present, the system accepts a small vocabulary of about 100 domain dependent works (not counting proper nouns, but including alternative word forms such as plurals).",
        "This vocabulary can very easily be extended (as indicated below).",

        "Note that the domain dependent vocabulary could be much extended without having any significant impact on these times (because of the way the dictionary is indexed).",
        "It is also worth noting that, for all but the simplest queries, natural language analysis represents only a small proportion of the total time.",
        "This suggests that, as far as the efficiency of natural language question answering systems is concerned, it is the answering process rather than the natural language analysis to which most effort needs to be directed.",
        "Certainly this has been our approach, although it appears to be somewhat contrary to the prevailing view in artificial intelligence.",
        "In particular, parsing does not seem to pose any major efficiency problem, provided one does not expect the grammar to do too much.",
        "As regards portability, we think Chat-80 should be relatively easy to adapt to different applications – for the same reasons that we found it easy to adapt Dahl's program to English and to a different domain.",
        "Partly this is due to the fact that (in both systems) the domain dependent parts are clearly separated from the rest of the system, and are broken down into small units which can be added incrementally as \"data\" (see Appendix II).",
        "Thus our natural language analysis modules deal exclusively with general features of English, in contrast to the \"semantic grammar\" approach (Burton 1976).",
        "Now there are other practical systems which have not taken the \"semantic grammar\" approach but are, we feel, less easy to modify than Chat-80; LUNAR (Woods, Kaplan, and Nash-Webber 1972) is a good example.",
        "The reason lies in the way \"meanings\" are attached to words.",
        "In LUNAR, a meaning is simply a procedure.",
        "For nouns it is a procedure to generate objects in a certain class; for most other words it is a procedure to test whether some property is true of given objects.",
        "This entails that \"meanings\" can be executed in only one way, and precludes the kind of query planning done in Chat-80.",
        "But such a simple-minded approach to query execution is not viable in most practical situations, as Woods 1977 recognises with his \"smart quantifiers\".",
        "The only alternative, given the procedural approach to meaning, is to represent the meaning of a word by a set of alternative procedures to be used in different circumstances.",
        "But this makes life very difficult for someone wanting to introduce a new word or concept into the system.",
        "In Chat-80, the meaning of a new word is in principle just a set of facts and general rules that define the predicate corresponding to that word.",
        "The procedural aspect is on the whole taken care of by the planning algorithm, and by Prolog's flexible handling of predications in which only certain arguments are instantiated.",
        "However, with the present system, the definer of a new word must be responsible for ensuring that the predicate definition he supplies is not only correct, but is also reasonably efficient when executed by Prolog."

        "Parts of the mapping overlap with Montague's 1974 formalisation of aspects of English, but many of the basics were not covered in his work (for instance, the treatment of questions, plurals, and determiner precedence), and of course he was not concerned to produce a practical implementation.",
        "Among practical implementations, the closest work is that of Woods 1977 and that of Colmerauer 1982 as implemented by Dahl 1981.",
        "Both these efforts are similar in that they map English into a nonstandard (and more elaborate) logic, where the quantifiers are more directly modelled on the determiners of natural language.",
        "These nonstandard quantifiers are called \"FOR expressions\" by Woods and \"three-branched quantifiers\" by Colmerauer.",
        "We have kept much closer to standard predicate logic, for the very down-to-earth reason that the traditional formalism seems to make \"query optimisation\" much easier (see the companion paper, Warren 1981).",
        "Our mapping from English to logic, as well as the processes of query planning and answering, have all been implemented entirely in Prolog.",
        "The result is a prototype natural language question answering system, Chat-80, which we think probably has the best combination of efficiency and portability of any comparable system at the present time, due principally to the use of Prolog as the implementation language."
