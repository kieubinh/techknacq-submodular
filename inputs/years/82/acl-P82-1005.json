        "If a machine could listen, how would we talk to it?",
        "This question will be hard to answer definitively until a good mechanical listener is developed.",
        "As a next best approximation, this paper presents results of an exploration of how people talk to one another in a domain for which keyboard-based natural language dialogue systems would be desirable, and have already been built (Robinson et al., 1980; Winograd, 1972).",
        "Our observations are based on transcripts of person-to-person telephone-mediated and teletype-mediated dialogues.",
        "In these transcripts, one specific kind of communicative act dominates spoken task-related discourse, but is nearly absent from keyboard discourse.",
        "Importantly, when this act is performed vocally it is never performed directly.",
        "Since most of the utterances in these simple dialogues do not signal the speaker's intent, techniques for inferring intent will be crucial for engaging in spoken task-related discourse.",
        "The paper suggests how a plan-based theory of communication (Cohen and Perrault, 1979; Perrault and Allen, 1980) can uncover the intentions underlying the use of various forms.",

        "Motivated by Rubin's (1980) taxonomy of language experiences and influenced by Chapanis et al.'s (1972, 1977) and Grosz' (1977) communication mode and task-oriented dialogue studies, we conducted an exploratory study to investigate how the structure of instruction-giving discourse depends on the communication situation in which it takes place.",

        "In all modes, the apprentices were videotaped as they followed the experts' instructions.",
        "Telephone and Teletype dialogues were analyzed first since results would have implications for the design of speech understanding and production systems.",
        "Each expert participated in the experiment on two consecutive days, the first for training and the second for instructing an apprentice.",
        "Subjects playing the expert role were trained by: following a set of assembly directions consisting entirely of imperatives, assembling the pump as often as desired, and then instructing a research assistant.",
        "This practice session took place face-to-face.",
        "Experts knew the research assistant already knew how to assemble the pump.",
        "Experts were given an initial statement of the purpose of the experiment, which indicated that communication would take place in one of.a number of different modes, but were not informed of which modality they would communicate in until the next day.",
        "In both modes, experts and apprentices were located in different rooms.",
        "Experts had a set of pump parts that, they were told, were not to be assembled but could be manipulated.",
        "In Telephone mode, experts communicated via a standard telephone and apprentices communicated through a speaker-phone, which did not need to be held and which allowed simultaneous two-way communication.",

        "J: OK S: You got that on the hole?",

N: ok B: put the pink valve on the two pegs in that blue cap... N: ok\" Communication in Telephone mode has a distinct pattern of \"find the x\" \"put it into/onto/over the y\", in which reference and predication are addressed in different steps.",
        "To relate these steps, more reliance is placed on strategies for signalling dialogue coherence, such as the use of pronouns.",
        "Teletype communication involves primarily the use of imperatives such as \"put the x into/onto/around.the y\".",
        "Typically, the first time each object (X) is mentioned in a TTY discourse is within a request for a physical action.",
        "B.",
        "A Methodology for Discourse Analysis This research aims to develop an adequate method for conducting discourse analysis that will be useful to the computational linguist.",
        "The method used here integrates psychological, linguistic, and formal approaches in order to characterize language use.",
        "Psychological methods are needed in setting up protocols that do not bias the interesting variables.",
        "Linguistic methods are needed for developing a scheme for describing the progress of a discourse.",
        "Finally, formal methods are essential for stating theories of utterance interpretation in context.",
        "TO be more specific, we are ultimately interested in similarities and differences in utterance processing across modes, Utterance processing clearly depends on utterance form and the speaker's intent.",
        "The utterances in the transcripts are therefore categorized by the intentions they are used to achieve.",
        "Both utterances and categorizations become data for cross-modal measures as well as for formal methods.",
        "Once intentions differing across modes are isolated, our strategy is to then examine the utterance forms used to achieve those intentions.",
        "Thus, utterance forms are not compared directly across modes; only utterances used to achieve the same goals are compared, and it is those goals that are expected to vary across modes.",
        "With form and function identified, one can then proceed to discuss how utterance processing may differ from one mode to another.",
        "Our plan-based theory of speech acts will be used to explain how an utterance's intent coding can be derived from the utterance's form and the prior interaction.",
        "A computational model of intent recognition in dialogue (Allen, 1979; Cohen, 1979; Sidner et al., 1981) can then be used to mimic the theory's assignment of intent.",
        "Thus, the theory of speech act interpretation will describe language use in a fashion analogous to the way that a generative grammar describes how a particular deep structure can underlie a given surface structure.",
        "C. Coding the Transcripts The first stage of discourse analysis involved the coding of the communicator's intent in making various utterances.",
        "Since attributions of intent are hard to make reliably, care was taken to avoid biasing the results.",
        "Following the experiences of Sinclair and Coulthard (1975), Dore et al.",
        "(1978) and Mann et al.",
        "(1975), a coding",
        "scheme was developed and two people trained in its use.",
        "The coders relied both on written transcripts and on videotapes of the apprentices' assembly.",
        "The scheme, which was tested and revised on pilot data until reliability was attained, Included a set of approximately 20 \"speech act\" categories that were used to label intent, and a set of \"operators\" and propositions that were used to describe the assembly task, as in (Sacerdoti, 1975).",
        "The operators and propositions often served as the propositional content of the communicative acts.",
        "In addition to the domain actions, pilot data led us to include an action of \"physically identifying the referent of a description\" as part of the scheme (Cohen, 1981).",
        "This action will be seen to be requested explicitly by Telephone experts, but not by experts in Teletype mode.",
        "Of course, a coding scheme must not only capture the domain of discourse, it must be tailored to the nature of discourse per se.",
        "Many theorists have observed that a speaker can use a number of utterances to achieve a goal, and can use one utterance to achieve a number of goals.",
        "Correspondingly, the coders could consider utterances as jointly achieving one intention (by \"bracketing\" them), could place an utterance in multiple categories, and could attribute more than one intention to the same utterance or utterance part.",
        "It was discovered that the physical layout of a transcript, particularly the location of line breaks, affected which utterances were coded.",
        "TO ensure uniformity, each coder first divided each transcript into utterances that he or she would code.",
        "These joint \"bracketings\" were compared by a third party to yield a base set of codable (sic) utterance parts.",
        "The coders could later bracket utterances differently if necessary.",
        "The first attempt to code the transcripts was overly ambitious -- coders could not keep 20 categories and their definitions in mind, even with a written coding manual for reference.",
        "Our scheme was then scaled back -- only utterances fitting the following categories were considered: Requests-for-assembly-actions (RAACT) (e.g., \"put that on the hole\".)"

        "Even with 5 subjects per mode, the differences across modes are significant (p = 0.023), indicating that Telephone conversation per se differs from Teletype conversation in the ways in which a speaker will make first reference to an object.",
        "F. Analysis 3: Utterance forms Thus far, explicit identification requests have been shown to be pervasive in Telephone mode and to constitute a frequently used strategy.",
        "One might expect that, in analogous circumstances, a machine might be confronted with many of these acts.",

        "The result of the action might be labelled by (IDENTIFIED-REF AGT DESCRIPTION).",
        "Finally, the means for performing the act will be some procedural combination of sensory actions (e.g., looking) and counting.",
        "The exact combination will depend on the description used.",
        "The utterances in Group A can then be analyzed as requests for IDENTIFY-REFERENT using Perrault and Allen's (1980) method of applying plan recognition to the definition of communicative acts.",
        "A. Action-based Utterances Case 1 (\"There is a NP\") can be interpreted as a request that the hearer IDENTIFY-REFERENT of NP by reasoning that a speaker's informing a hearer that a precondition to an action is true can cause the hearer to believe the speaker wants that action to be performed.",
        "All utterances that communicate the speaker's desire that the hearer do some action are labelled as requests.",
        "Using only rules about action, Perrault and Allen's method can also explain why Cases 2, 3, and 4 all convey requests for referent identification.",
        "Case 2 is handled by an inference saying that if a speaker communicates that an act will yield some desired effect, then one can infer the speaker wants that act performed to achieve that effect.",
        "Case 3 is an example of questioning a desired effect of an act (e.g., \"Is the garbage out?\")",
        "to convey that the act itself is desired.",
        "Case 4 is similar to Case 2, except the relationship between the desired effect and some action yielding that effect is presumed.",
        "In all these cases, ACT = LOOK-AT, and EFFECT = \"HEARER SEE X\".",
        "Since LOOK-AT is part of the \"body\" (Allen, 1979) of IDENTIFY-REFERENT, Allen's \"body-action\" inference will make the necessary connection, by inferring that the speaker wanted the hearer to LOOK-AT something as part of his IDENTIFY-REFERENT act.",

        "Such knowledge will be needed to differentiate the intentions behind a traveller's saying \"the 3:15 train to Montreal?\"",
        "to an information booth clerk (who is not intended to turn around and find the train), from those behind the uttering of \"the smallest of the red pieces?",
        "\", where the hearer is expected to physically identify the piece.",
        "According to the theory, the speaker's intentions conveyed by the elliptical question include 1) the speaker's wanting to know whether some relevant property holds of the referent of the description, and 2) the speaker's perhaps wanting that property to hold.",
        "Allen and Perrault (1980) suggest that properties needed to \"fill in\" such fragments come from shared expectations (not just from prior syntactic forms, as is current practice in computational linguistics).",
        "The property in question in our domain is IDENTIFIED-REFERENT(HEARER, NP), which is (somehow) derived from the nature of the task as one of manual assembly.",
        "Thus, expectations have suggested a starting point for an inference chain -- it is shared knowledge that the speaker wants to know whether IDENTIFIED-REFERENT (HEARER, NP).",
        "In the same way that questioning the completion of an action can convey a request for action, questioning IDENTIFIED-REFERENT conveys a request for IDENTIFY-REFERENT (see Case 3, Group A, above).",
        "Thus, our positing an IDENTIFY-REFERENT act, and by assuming such an act is expected of the user, the inferential machinery can derive the appropriate intention behind the use of a noun phrase fragment.",

Indirect Requests for Confirmation Group C utterances (as well as Group A, cases 1, 2, and 4) can be interpreted as requests for identification by a rule stipulated by Labov and Fanshel (1977) -- if a speaker ostensibly informs a hearer about a state-of-affairs for which it is Shared knowledge that the hearer has better evidence, then the speaker is actually requesting confirmation of that state-of-affairs.",

        "Thompson's (1980) extensive tabulation of utterance forms in a multiple modality comparison overlaps our analysis at the level of syntax.",
        "Both Thompson's and the present study are primarily concerned with extending the",
        "habitability of current systems by identifying phenomena that people use but which would be problematic for machines.",
        "However, our two studies proceeded along different lines.",
        "Thompson's was more concerned with utterance forms and less with pragmatic function, whereas for this study, the concerns are reversed in priority.",
        "Our priority stems from the observation that differences in utterance function will influence the processing of the same utterance form.",
        "However, the present findings cannot be said to contradict Thompson's (nor vice-versa).",
        "Each corpus could perhaps be used to verify the findings in the other.",
        "V. CCNCLUSIONS Spoken and teletype discourse, even used for the same ends, differ in structure and in form.",
        "Telephone conversation about object assembly is dominated by explicit requests to find objects satisfying descriptions.",
        "However, these requests are never performed directly.",
        "Techniques for interpreting \"indirect speech acts\" thus may become crucial for speech understanding systems.",
        "These findings must be interpreted with two cautionary notes.",
        "First, the request-for-identification category is specific to discourse situations in which the topics of conversation include objects Physically present to the hearer.",
        "Though the same surface forms might be used, if the conversation is not about manipulating concrete objects, different pragmatic inferences could be made.",
        "Secondly, the indirection results may occur only in conversations between humans.",
        "It is possible that people do not wish to verbally instruct others with fine-grained imperatives for fear of sounding condescending.",
        "Print may remove such inhibitions, as may talking to a machine.",
        "This is a question that cannot be settled until good speech understanding systems have been developed.",
        "We conjecture that the better the system, the more likely it will be to receive fine-grained indirect requests.",
        "It appears to us preferable to err on the side of accepting people's natural forms of speech than to force the user to think about the phrasing of utterances, at the expense of concentrating on the problem."
