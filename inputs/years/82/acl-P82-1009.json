        "If time and space permitted, I would have chosen the subject of extensibility of natural language systems to new applications.",
        "In light of existing restrictions, however, I have chosen a more tractable problem to which I have given some attention and in whose treatment I am interested; this is the translation of quantified relational calculus expressions to a formal query language such as SQL."

        "Questions such as \"How many employees are in the sales department?\" must be mapped into three radically different database query language expressions depending on how the database is set up.",
        "It may be appropriate to retrieve a pre-stored total number of employees from a NUMBER-OF-EMPLOYEES field of a DEPARTMENT file, or to count the number of records in an EMPLOYEE file that have the value SALES in the DEPARTMENT field, or, if departments are broken down into offices with which are associated the total numbers of employees employed therein, to total the values of the NUMBER-OF-EMPLOYEES field in all the records for offices in the sales department.",
        "In the TQA System there are a number of different levels of representation of a given query.",
        "The grammar which assigns structure to a query has some core components which are essentially application-independent (e.g., the cyclic and post-cyclic transformations) and has other components that are application-dependent (e.g., portions of the lexicon and precyclic transformations).",
        "Surface structures are mapped by the application-independent post cyclic and cyclic transformations into a relatively deep structural level which is referred to as the underlying structure level.",
        "In this representation, sentence nodes are expanded into a verb followed by a sequence of noun phrases, and the representation of reference is facilitated by the use of logical variables Xl, X2, .",

        "Now, depending on feature information associated with the lexical items in the two NP's, application-specific precyclic transformations can be formulated to map this underlying structure into any of three query structures that directly reflect the three data structures and corresponding formal queries previously discussed.",
        "Rather than sketching query structures that could be produced for this example, let me be more specific by substituting the actual treatment of two similar sentences currently treated by the TQA System land-use application.",
        "These are the sentences:",
        "(1) \"How many parking lots are there in ward 1 block 2?\" (2) \"How many parking spaces are there in ward 1 block 2?\"",
        "In the current data base, individual lots are identified as being parking lots by a land use code relation LUCF, which has attributes that include JACCN (parcel account number) and LUC (land use code).",
        "Parking lots have an LUC value of 460.",
        "Another relation, PARCFL, has attributes which include JACCN and JPRK (the number of parking spaces on a given parcel).",
        "The underlying structures assigned to both these sentences are nearly identical, differing only in the lexical distinctions between \"parking lot\" and \"parking space\".",
        "The common structure is very much like that of the previously given tree structure except that PARKING LOT or PARKING_SPACE (together with their associated features) replaces EMPLOYEE, and the second NP dominates the string \"WARD 1 BLOCK 2\".",

        "This, of course, is no easy task, but it is one which is central to the transformational grammar-based approach, and its successful treatment does provide a principled basis for eliminating a number of potential difficulties such as this multi-file query problem.",
        "To see why this is so, let us consider how, for a given query, relations are identified and joined in TQA.",
        "As we have already indicated, TQA underlying structures and query structures consist of sentence nodes which dominate a verb followed by a sequence of noun phrases.",
        "These simple structures are joined together to form a complete sentence structure through the use of additional phrase structure rules which indicate conjunction, relative clause-main clause connection, etc.",
        "Query structure verbs correspond, for the most part, to database relations, and the noun phrase arguments of those verbs correspond to attributes of their associated relations.",
        "Furthermore, query structures contain logical variables which serve the function of establishing reference, including identity of reference.",
        "Thus if the query structure assigned to a query identifies two (or more) relations which have attributes whose values are the same logical variable, we have an indication that it is those attributes over which the relations should be joined.",

        "The structure is mapped in straightforward fashion by a Knuth attribute grammar translation procedure into the set domain relational calculus expression:",
        "Each deep (query structure) verb such as ZONE has associated with it (by means of a translation table entry) a relation, which is usually the projection of an existing data base relation.",
        "Thus instead of translating a portion of the above tree to (ZONE X4 X8), an expression which is true if X4 is the zone of the parcel whose account number is X8, the translation table is used to produce",
        "which is true if the projection of the ZONEF relation over attributes ZONE and JACCN (account number) contains a tuple (X4 X8).",
        "The conjunction of three relations with a common JACCN attribute value of X8 indicates that the three relations are to be joined over the attribute JACC\" There is, however, one complication in translating the relatior-i calculus expression above into a formal query language such as SQL.",

        "In simple examples such as this, where only existential quantification of logical forms is involved, there is no problem in translating to a formal query language such as SQL.",

        "Hence, the approach used in translating TQA logical forms to corresponding SQL expressions will be discussed, in the expectation of eliciting explanations of how the translation of quantification is handled in other systems.",

        "The latter type of expressions are called set domain relational calculus expressions.",
        "Fortunately, SQL provides operators EXISTS and NOT EXISTS which take as their argument an SQL SELECT expression, the type of expression into which logical forms of the type (setx 'Xl ) are translated.",
        "A recursive call to the basic logical form-to-SQL translation facility then suffices to supply the SQL argument of EXISTS or NOT EXISTS.",
        "It is worth noting that, under certain circumstances which we will not explore here, the \"(setx X2\" portion of an embedded expression (setx 'X2 (f X2)) can be pulled forward, creating a prefix-normal-form-like expression of the type (setx 'Xl (setx 'X2 )), and the logical variables that can be pulled all the way forward correspond to information implicitly requested in English queries.",
        "The values which satisfy these variables should also be printed to satisfy users' implicit requests for information.",
        "For example, in our previously considered query \"What are the zones of the vacant parcels in subplanning area 410?\" one probably wants the parcels identified in addition to their zones.",
