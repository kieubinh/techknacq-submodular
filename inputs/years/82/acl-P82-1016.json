        "While the approach illustrated in Section 3.1 is useful in a data base query environment where elliptical input typically is a modification of the previous query, it does not account for elliptical statements following questions, elliptical questions following statements, etc.",
        "Our approach to the problem is to write a set of transformations which map the parse path of a question (e.g., Table 1) into an expected parse path for a declarative response, and the parse .path for a declarative into a path for an expected question, etc.",
        "The left-hand side of a transformation is a pattern which is matched against the ATN path of the previous utterance.",
        "Pattern elements include literals referring to arcs, variables which match a single arc or embedded path, variables which match zero or more arcs, and sets of alternatives.",
        "It is straightforward to construct a discrimination net corresponding to all left-hand sides for efficiently finding what patterns match the ATN path of the previous sentence.",
        "The right-hand side of a transformation is a pattern which constructs an expected path.",
        "The form of the pattern on the right-hand side is a list of references to states, arcs, and lexical entries.",

        "The ideal model of contextual ellipsis would correctly predict what are appropriate elliptical forms in context, what their interpretation is, and what forms are not meaningful in context.",
        "We believe this requires structural restrictions, semantic constraints, and a model of the goals of the speaker.",
        "Our heuristic does not meet these criteria in a number of cases.",
        "Only two classes of structural constraints are captured.",
        "One relates the ellipsis to the previous form as a combination of repetition, replacement, and expansion.",
        "The other constraint is that the input must be consumed as a contiguous string.",
        "This constraint is violated, for instance, in \"I was (angry) yesterday\" as a response to \"Were you angry?\".",
        "Nevertheless, the constraint is computationally useful, since allowing arbitrary gaps in consuming the elliptical input produces a very large space of correct interpretations.",
        "A ludicrous example is the following question and elliptical response: Has the boss given our mutual friend a raise?",
        "A fat raise.",
        "Allowing arbitrary gaps between the sub-strings of the ellipsis allows an interpretation such as \"A (boss has given our) fat (friend a) raise.\"",
        "While it may be possible to view all contextual ellipsis as combinations of the operations repetition, replacement, and expansion applied to something, our model makes the strong assumption that these operations may be viewed as applying to an ATN path rather straightforwardly related to the previous utterance.",
        "Not all expansions can be viewed that way, as example f in Section 1 illustrates.",
        "Also, answers of \"No\" require special processing; that response in answer to \"Were you angry\" should not be interpreted as \"No, I was angry.\"",
        "One should be able to account for such examples within the heuristic described in this paper, perhaps by allowing the transformation system described in section 3.2 to be completely general rather than strongly restricted to one and only one transformation application.",
        "However, we propose handling such cases by special purpose rules we are developing.",
        "These rules for the special cases, plus the mechanism described in section 3 together will be formally equivalent in predictive power to a grammar for elliptical forms.",
        "Though the heuristic is independent of the individual grammar, designating expansion paths and transformations obviously is not.",
        "The grammar may make this an easy or difficult task.",
        "For instance in the grammar we are using, a subnetwork that collects all tense, aspect, and modality elements would simplify Some of the transformations and expansion paths.",
        "Naturally, semantics must play an important part in ellipsis processing.",
        "Consider the utterance pair below:",
        "Did the boss have a martini at lunch?",
        "Some wine.",
        "Though syntactically this could be interpreted either as \"Some wine (did have a martini at lunch)\", \"(The boss did have) some wine (at lunch)\", or \"(The boss did have a martini at) some wine\".",
        "Semantics should prefer the second reading.",
        "We are testing our heuristic using the RUS grammar (Bobrow, 1978) which has frequent calls from the grammar requesting that the semantic component decide whether to build a semantic interpretation for the partial parse found or to veto that partial parse.",

        "Replacement ellipsis is processed by substituting the elliptical input for contiguous constituents on a transformed previous path.",
        "Expansion ellipsis may be processed by taking specially marked paths that detour from a given state in that 'path.",
