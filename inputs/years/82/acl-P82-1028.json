        "Several possibilities for further development of the research described here include 1) the use of the same strategies for responding to questions about attributes, events, and relations as well as to questions about entities, 2) investigation of strategies needed for responding to questions about the system processes (e.g. How is manufacturer's cost determined?)",
        "or system capabilities (e.g. Can you handle ellipsis?",
        "), 3) responding to presuppositional failure as well as to direct questions, and 4) the incorporation of a user model in the generation process (currently TEXT assumes a static casual, naive user and gears its responses to this characterization).",

      "text": [
        "The TEXT system successfully incorporates principles of relevancy criteria, discourse structure, and focus constraints into a method for generating English text of paragraph length.",
        "Previous work on focus of attention has been extended for the task of generation to provide constraints on what to say next.",
        "Knowledge about discourse structure has been encoded into schemes that are used to guide the generation process.",
        "The use of these two interacting mechanisms constitutes a departure from earlier generation systems.",
        "The approach taken in this research is that the generation process should not simply trace the knowledge representation to produce text.",
        "Instead, communicative strategies people are familiar with are used to effectively convey information.",
        "This means that the same information may be described in different ways on different occasions.",
        "The result is a system which constructs and orders a message in response to a given question.",
        "Although the system was designed to generate answers to questions about database structure (a feature lacking in most natural language database systems), the same techniques and principles could be used in other application areas (for example, computer assisted instruction systems, expert systems, etc.)",
        "where generation of language is needed."
