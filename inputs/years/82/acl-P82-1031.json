        "This paper describes the results of a preliminary study of a Knowledge Engineering (KE) approach to Natural Language Understanding (NLU).",
        "The KE approach to an Artificial Intelligence task involves a close association with an expert in the task domain.",
        "This requires making it easy for the expert to add new knowledge to the computer system, to understand what knowledge is in the system, and to understand how the system is accomplishing the task so that needed changes and corrections are easy to recognize and to make.",
        "It should be noted that our task domain is NLU.",
        "That is, the knowledge in the system is knowledge about NLU and the intended expert is an expert in NLU.",
        "The KE system we are using is the SNePS semantic network processing system [11].",
        "This system ii.",
        "es a semantic network system in which ** This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Grants MCS80-06314 and SPI-8019895.",
        "all knowledge, including rules, is represented as nodes in a semantic network, an inference system that performs reasoning according to the rules stored in the network, and a tracing package that allows the user to follow the system's reasoning.",
        "A major portion of this study involves the design and implementation of a SNePS-based system, called the NL-system, to enable the NLU expert to enter linguistic knowledge into the network in natural language, to have this knowledge available to query and reason about, and to use this knowledge for processing text including additional NLU knowledge.",
        "These features distinguish our system from other rule-based natural language processing systems such as that of Pereira and Warren [9] and Robinson [10].",
        "One of the major concerns of our study is the acquisition of knowledge, both factual assertions and rules of inference.",
        "Since both types of knowledge are stored in similar form in the semantic network, our NL-system is being developed with the ability to handle the input of both types of knowledge, with this new knowledge immediately available for use.",
        "Our concern with the acquisition of both types of knowledge differs from the approach of Haas and Hendrix [1], who aLe pursuing only the acquisition of large aggregations of individual facts.",
        "The benefit of our KE approach may be seen by considering the work of Lehnert [5].",
        "She compiled an extensive list of rules concerning how questions should be answered.",
        "For example, when asked, \"Do you know what time it is?\", one should instead answer the question \"What time is it?\".",
        "Lehnert only implemented and tested some of her rules, and those required a programming effort.",
        "If a system like the one being proposed here had been available to her, Lehnert could have tested all her rules with relative ease.",
        "Our ultimate goal is a KE system with all its linguistic knowledge as available to the language expert as domain knowledge is in other expert systems.",
        "In this preliminary study we explore the feasibility of our approach as implemented in our representations and NL-system."

      "text": [
        "A major goal of this study is the design and .implementation of a user-friendly system for experimentation in KE applied to Natural Language Understanding.",
        "The NL-system consists of two logical components: a) A facility for the input of linguistic knowledge into the semantic network in natural language..",
        "This linguistic knowledge primarily consists of rules about NLU and a lexicon.",
        "The NL-system contains a core of network rules which parse a user's natural language rule and build the corresponding structure in the form of a network rule.",
        "This NL-system facility.",
        "enables the user to manipulate both the syntactic and semantic aspects of surface strings.",
        "b) A facility for phrase/sentence generation and question answering via rules in the network.",
        "The user can pose a limited number of types of queries to the system in natural language, and the system utilizes rules to parse the query and generate a reply.",
        "An inference tracing facility is also being developed which uses this phrase/sentence generation capability.",
        "This will enable the user to trace the inference processes, which result from the activation of his rules, in natural language.",
        "When a person uses this NL-system for experimentation, there are two task domains co-resident in the semantic network.",
        "These domains are: (1) The NLU-domain which consists of the collection of propositions and rules concerning Natural Language Understanding, including both the NL-system core rules and assertions and the user-specified rules and assertions; and (2) the domain of knowledge which the user enters and interacts with via the NLU domain.",
        "For this study, a limited \"Bottle Domain\" is used as the domain of type (2).",
        "This domain was chosen to let us experiment with the use of semantic knowledge to clarify, during parsing, the way one noun madifies another in a noun-noun construction, viz. \"milk bottle\" vs. \"glass bottle\".",
        "In a sense, the task domain (2) is a sub-domain of the NLU-domain since task domain (2) is built and used via the NLU-domain.",
        "However, the two domains interact when, for example, knowledge from both domains is used in understanding a sentence being \"read\" by the system.",
        "The system is dynamic and new knowledge, relevant to either or both domains, can be added at any time."

        "Examples of L-RELs might be MOD NOUN and HEAD NOUN (of a NOUN NOUN PHRASE).",
        "S-REL represents the category of relations between a string and its sub-string constituents, such as FIRST NP and SECOND NP (to distinguish between two NPs within one sentence).",
        "VARIABLE is a term which represents the class of identifiers which the user will use as variables in his natural language rules.",
        "Before entering his rules into the system, the user must inform the system of all members of the L-CAT and VARIABLE categories which he will use.",
        "Words in the S-CAT, L-REL and S-REL categories are introduced by the context of their use in user-specified rules.",

        "We plan to make use of these surface strings in future work, but for this study, we have employed a second \"expresses\" relation, which we call EXPRESS-2, and rules of the core to",
