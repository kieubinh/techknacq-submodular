        "Most large text-understanding systems have been designed under the assumption that the input text will be in reasonably \"neat\" form, e.g., newspaper stories and other edited texts.",
        "However, a great deal of natural language text, e.g., memos, rough dratts, conversation transcripts, etc., have features that differ significantly from \"neat\" texts, posing special problems for readers, such as misspelled words, missing words, poor syntactic construction, missing periods, etc.",
        "Our solution to these problems is to make use of expectations, based both on knowledge of surface English and on world knowledge of the situation being described.",
        "These syntactic and semantic expectations can be used to figure out unknown words from context, constrain the possible word-senses of words with multiple meanings (ambiguity), fill in missing words (ellipsis), and resolve referents (anaphora).",
        "This method of using expectations to aid the understanding of \"scruffy\" texts has been incorporated into a working computer program called NOMAD, which understands scruffy texts in the domain of Navy messages.",
        "1.0 Introduction Consider the following (scribbled) message, left by a computer science professor on a colleague's desk: [1] Met w/chrmn agreed on changes to prposl nxt mtg 3 Feb. A good deal of informal text such as everyday messages like the one above are very ill-formed grammatically and contain misspellings, ad hoc abbreviations and lack of important punctuation such as periods between sentences.",
        "Yet people seem to easily understand such messages, and in fact most people would probably understand the above message just as readily as they would a more \"well-formed\" version: \"I met with the chairman, and we agreed on what changes had to be made to the proposal.",
        "Our next meeting will be on Feb. 3.\" This research was supported in part by the Naval Ocean Systems Center under contract N-00123-81-C-1078.",
        "No extra information seems to be conveyed by this longer version, and message-writers appear to take advantage of this fact by writing extremely terse messages such as [1], apparently counting on read-ers' ability to analyze them in spite of their messiness.",
        "If \"scruffy\" messages such as this one were only intended for a readership of one, there wouldn't be a real problem.",
        "However, this informal type of 'memo' message is commonly used for information transfer in many businesses, universities, government offices, etc.",
        "An extreme case of such an organization is the Navy, which every hour receives many thousands of short messages, each of which must be encoded into computer-readable form for entry into a database.",
        "Currently, these messages come in in very scruffy form, and a growing number of man-hours is spent on the encoding-by-hand process.",
        "Hence there is an obvious benefit to partially automating this encoding process.",
        "The problem is that most existing text-understanding systems (e.g. ELI [Riesbeck and Schank 76], SAM [Cullingford 77], FRUMP [DeJong 79], IPP [Lebowitz 80]) would fait to successfully analyze ill-formed texts like [1], because they have been designed under the assumption that they will receive 'neater' input, e.g., edited input such as is found in newspapers or books.",
        "This paper briefly outlines some of the properties of texts like [11, that allow readers to understand it in spite of its scruffiness; and some of the knowledge and mechanisms that seem to underlie readers' ability to understand such texts.",
        "A text-processing system called NOMAD is discussed which makes use of the theories described here to process scruffy text in the domain of everyday Navy messages.",
        "NOMAD's operation is based on the use of expectations during understanding, based both on knowledge of surface English and on world knowledge of the situation being described.",
        "These syntactic and semantic expectations can be used to aid naturally in the solution of a wide range of problems that arise in understanding both \"scruffy\" texts and pre-edited texts, such as figuring out unknown words from context, constraining the possible word-senses of words with multiple meanings (ambiguity), filling in missing words (ellipsis), and resolving unknown referents (anaphora).",
        "The FOUL-UP program (Figuring Out Unknown Lexemes in the Understanding Process) [Granger 19771 was the first program that could figure out meanings of unknown words encountered during text understanding.",
        "FOUL-UP was an attempt to model the corresponding human ability commonly known as \"figuring out a word from context\".",
        "FOUL-UP worked with the SAM system [Cul].ingford 1977], using the expectations generated by scripts [Schank and Abelson 19771 to restrict the possible meanings of a word, based on what object or action would have occurred in that position according to the script for the story.",
        "For instance, consider the following excerpt from a newspaper report of a car accident: [2] Friday, a car swerved off Route 69.",
        "The vehicle struck an embankment'.",
        "The word \"embankment\" was unknown to the SAM system, but it had encoded predictions about certain attributes of the expected conceptual object of the PROPEL action (the object that the vehicle struck); namely, that it would be a physical object, and would function as an \"obstruction\" in the vehicle-accident script.",
        "(In addition, the conceptual analyzer (ELI - (Riesbeck and Schenk 19761) had the expectation that the word in that sentence position would be a noun.)",
        "Hence, when the unknown word was encountered, FOUL-UP would make use of those expected attributes to construct a memory entry for the word \"embankment\", indicating that it was a noun, a physical object, and an \"obstruction\" in vehicle-accident situations.",
        "It would then create a dictionary definition that the system would use from then on whenever the word was encountered in this context."

        "While human readers would have little difficulty understanding this text, no existing computer programs could do so.",
        "The scope of this problem is wide; examples of texts that present \"scruffy\" difficulties to readers are completely unedited texts, such as messages composed in a hurry, with little or no re-writing, rough drafts, memos, transcripts of conversations, etc.",
        "Such texts may contain missing words, ad hoc abbreviations of words, poor syntax, confusing order of presentation of ideas, misspellings, lack of punctuation, etc.",
        "Even edited texts such as newspaper stories often contain misspellings, words unknown to the reader, and ambiguities; and even apparently very simple texts may contain alternative possible interpretations, which can cause a reader to construct erroneous initial inferences that must later be corrected (see [Granger 1980,1981]).",
