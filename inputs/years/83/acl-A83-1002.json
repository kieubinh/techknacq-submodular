        "From 1976 to 1981 SDC was involved in the development of the End-User Friendly Interface to Data management (EUFID) system, a natural-language interface (NLI) that is designed to be independent of both the application and the underlying database management system (DBMS).",
        "[TEMP79, TEMP80, BURG80, BURG82].",
        "The EUFID system permits users to communicate with database management systems in natural English rather than formal query languages.",
        "It is assumed that the application domain is well defined and bounded, that users share a common language to address the application, and that users may have little experience with computers or DBMSs but are competent in the application area.",
        "At least three broad categories of issues had to be addressed during EUFID development, and it is apparent that they are common co any general natural-language interface to database management systems.",
        "The first category involves the application: how to characterize the requirements of the human-machine dialogue and interaction, capture that information efficiently, formalize the information and incorporate that knowledge into a framework that can be used by the system.",
        "The major problems in this area are knowledge acquisition and representation.",
        "For many NLI systems, bringing up a new application requires extensive effort by system designers with cooperation from a representative set of end-users.",
        "Tools that could assist in automating this process are badly needed.",
        "The second set of issues involves language processing techniques: how to assign constituent structure and interpretation to queries using robust and general methods that allow extension to additional lexical items, sentence types and semantic relationships.",
        "Some NLI systems distinguish the assignment of syntactic structure, or parsing, from the interpretation.",
        "Other systems, including EUFID, combine information about constituent and semantic structure into an integrated semantic grammar.",
        "The third class involves database issues: how to actually perform the intent of the natural-language question by formulating the correct structured query and efficiently navigating through the database to retrieve the right answer.",
        "This involves a thorough understanding of the DBMS structure underlying the application, the operations and functions the query language supports, and the nature and volatility of the database.",
        "Obviously issues in these three areas are related, and the knowledge needed to deal with them may be distributed throughout a natural-language interface system.",
        "The purpose of this paper is to show how such issues might be addressed in NLI development, with illustrations from EUFID.",
        "The next section includes a brief review of related work, and an overview of the EUFID system.",
        "The third section describes the goals that EUFID achieved, and section four discusses in detail some of the major application, language, and database problems that arose.",
        "Section five suggests guidelines for determining whether an application is an appropriate target for a natural-language interface."

        "Currently, updating through any high level view of the database should be avoided, especially when the view contains joins or derived data, because of the risk of inadvertently entering incorrectly-interpreted data.",
        "V SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS For many years, researchers have been attempting to build robust systems for natural-language access to databases.",
        "It is not clear that such a system exists for general use [OS/79].",
        "There are problems that need to be solved on both the front end, the parsing of the English question, and the back end, the translation of the question into a data management system query.",
        "It is important to understand the types of requests, types of functions, and types of databases that can be supported by a specific NLI.",
        "Some general guidelines that can be applied to the selection of applications for current NLI front ends are suggested below:",
        "5. there should be few fields that have values that change rapidly, cannot be recognized by a pattern, and that must be used in qualification, 6. the users of the NLI should have a common use for the data and a common view of the data, and 7. there must be some user who understands the questions that will be asked and is available to work with the developers of the NLI.",
        "We believe that current system development is limited by the need for good semantic modelling techniques and the length of time needed to build the knowledge base required to interface with a new application.",
        "When the knowledge base for the NLI is developed, the database as well as sample input must be considered in the design.",
        "Parsing of questions to a database cannot be divorced from the database contents since semantic interpretation can only be determined in the context of that database.",
        "On the other hand, a robust system cannot be developed by considering only database structure and content, because the range of the questions allowed would not accurately reflect the user view of the application and also would not account for all the information that is inferred at some level."
