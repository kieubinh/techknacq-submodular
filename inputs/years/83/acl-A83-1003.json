        "The user interface is a limited dialect of English.",
        "In contrast to expert systems, in which experts build the knowledge base and users make use of this expert knowledge, ASK is aimed at the user who wishes to create, test, modify, extend and make use of his own knowledge base.",
        "It is a system for a research team, a management or military staff, or a business office.",
        "This paper is designed to give you a feel for the general performance of the ASK System and overview of its operational capabilities.",
        "To this end, the movie you see will continue throughout the talk.",
        "Indeed, the talk itself is a commentary on this background movie.",
        "The movie is bona fide and in real time, it is of the ASK System in action.",

        "Such a knowledgeable system, as it goes about a task for the user, may need additional information from the user.",
        "What information it needs at a particular point may depend on earlier user inputs and the current state of the database.",
        "The user must provide the system with knowledge of a particular task; more precisely s/he must program this knowledge into the system.",
        "The result of this programming will be a system guided dialogue which the user can subsequently initiate and which will then elicit the necessary inputs.",
        "Using these inputs in conjunction with the knowledge already available, particularly the data base, the system completes the task.",
        "It is this system-guided dialogue that the user needs to be able to design.",

        "Using DDD, the user becomes a computer-aided designer.",
        "Since DDD, in conducting its dialogue with the user, only requires simple responses or responses phrased in ASK English, the user need have little programming skill or experience.",
        "Using DDD, the user alone can replace a tedious, repetitive task with an efficient system guided dialogue, all in a natural language environment.",
