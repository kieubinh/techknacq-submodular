        "A large amount of natural language input, whether to text processing or question-answering systems, consists of shortened sentence forms, sentence \"fragments\".",
        "Sentence fragments are found in informal technical communications, messages, headlines, and In telegraphic communications.",
        "Occurrences are characterized by their brevity and Informational nature.",
        "In all of these, If people are not restricted to using complete, grammatical sentences, as they are in formal writing situations, they tend to leave out the parts of the sentence which they believe the reader will be able to reconstruct.",
        "This is especially true if the writer deals with a specialized subject matter where the facts are to be used by others in the same field.",
        "Several approaches to such \"ill-formed\" natural language Input have been followed.",
        "The LIFER system [Hendrix, 1977; Hendrix, et al., 1978] and the PLANES system [Waltz, 1978] both account for fragments In procedural terms; they do not require the user to enumerate the types of fragments which will be accepted.",
        "The Linguistic String Project has characterized the regularly occurring ungrammatical constructions and made them part of the parsing grammar [Anderson, et al., 1975; Hirschman and Sager, 1982].",
        "Kwasny and Sondheimer (1081) have used error-handling procedures to relate the ill-formed input of sentence fragments to well-formed structures.",
        "While these approaches differ in the way they determine the structure of the fragments and the deleted material, for the most part they rely heavily, at some point, on the recognition of semantic word-classes.",
        "The purpose of this paper Is to describe the syntactic characteristics of sentence fragments and to illustrate how the domain-specific information embodied in the cooccurrence patterns of the semantic word-classes of a domain can be utilized as a powerful tool for processing a body of compact text, i.e. text that contains a large percentage of sentence fragments."

        "The New York University Linguistic String Project has developed a computer program to analyze compact text In specialized subject areas using a general parsing program and an English grammar augmented by procedures specific to the subject areas.",
        "In recent years the system has been tailored for computer analysis of free-text medical records, which are characterized by numerous sentence fragments.",
        "In the computer-analysis and processing of the medical records, relatively few types of sentence fragments sufficed to describe the shortened forms, although such fragments comprised fully 49% of the natural language input [Marsh and Sager, 1982].",
        "Fragment types can be related to full forms on the basis of the elements which are regularly deleted.",
        "Elements deleted from the fragments are from one or more of the syntactic positions: subject, tense, verb, object.",
        "The six fragment types identified in the set of medical records are shown In Table 1 as types 1-Y1.",
        "A feature of fragment types that is not immediately obvious is the fact that they are already known in the full grammar as parts of fuller constructions.",
        "The fragment types reflect deletions found in syntactically distinguished positions within full sentences, as illustrated in Table 2.",
        "For example, in normal English, a sentence that contains tense and the verb le can occur as the object of verbs like find (e.g. am found that the sentence was amhiguous,).",
        "In the same environment, as object of find, a reduced sentence can occur in which the tense and verb to have been omitted, as in fragment type I (e.g. Ilia found the sentencn ambiguous.).",
        "In the same manner, other reduced forms reflected in fragment types also represent constructions generally found as parts of regular English sentences.",
        "The fact that the fragment types can be related to full English forms makes it possible to view them as instances of reduced SUBJECT-VERB-OBJECT patterns from which particular components have been deleted.",
        "Fragments of type I can be represented as having a deleted tense and verb 122, of type II as having a deleted subject, tense, and verb two etc.",
        "This makes it relatively straightforward to add them to the parsing grammar,",
        "and, at the same time, provides a framework for identifying their semantic content by relating them to the corresponding full forms.",
        "The number of fragment types that occur in compact text of different technical domains appears to be relatively limited.",
        "When the fragment types found in medical records were compared with those seen in a small sample of Navy equipment status messages, five of the six types found in the medical records were also found in the Navy messages.",
        "Only one additional fragment type was they contain.",
        "For example, the different sections of the medical records that were analyzed (e.g. HISTORY, EXAM, LAB – DATA, IMPRESSION, COURSE IN HOSPITAL) were distinguished by differences in the distribution of the fragment types.",
        "The EXAM paragraph of the medical texts, In which the physician describes the results of the patient's physical examination, contained a relatively large number of fragments of type especially adjective phrases.",
        "The COURSE IN HOSPITAL paragraph contained a larger number of complete sentences than the other paragraphs.",
        "required to cover the Navy messages.",
        "This type appears in Table 1 as type VII, in which two subjects have been deleted (Request advte 'YEE TABLE 3.",
        "DISTRIBUTION OF FRAGMENT TYPES 110_11.11 NAVY arrangements inL Aids un).",
        "While the number of fragment types is relatively constant, the distribution of fragment types varies according to the domain of the text.",

        "The deletions which relate fragment types to their full sentence forms fall into two main classes: (t) those found virtually in all texts and (ii) those specific to the domain of the text.",
        "Just as the fragment types can be viewed as incomplete realizations of syntactic S-V-O structures, the semantic patterns in sentence fragments can be considered incomplete realizations of the semantic S-V-O patterns.",
        "In general terms, the structure of information in technical domains can be specified by a set of semantic classes, the words and phrases which belong to these classes, and by a specification of the patterns these classes enter into, i.e. the syntactic relationships among the members of the classes [Grishman, et al., 1982; Sager, 1978].",
        "In the case of the medical sublanguage processed by the Linguistic String Project, the medical subclasses were derived through techniques of distributional analysis [Hirschman and Sager, 1982].",
        "Semantic S-V-O patterns were then derived fran the combinatory properties of the medical classes in the text [Marsh and Sager, 1982]; the semantic patterns identified in a text are specific to the domain of the text.",
        "While they serve to formulate sublanguage constraints which rule out incorrect syntactic analyses caused by structural or lexical ambiguity, these relationships among classes can also provide a means by which deleted elements In compact text can be reconstructed.",
        "When a fragment Is recognized as an instance of a given semantic pattern, It is then possible to specify a set of the semantic classes fran which the medical sublanguage class of the deleted element can be selected.",
        "On a superficial level, the deletions of le in fragment types Ic-f and Illa-b, for example, can be reconstructed on purely syntactic grounds by filling in the lexical item hg.",
        "However, It Is also possible to provide further information and specify the semantic class of the lexical item gg by reference to the semantic S-V-O pattern manifested by the occurring subject and object.",
        "For example, in type If fragment shin ng eruntImm, Skin has the medical subclass BODYPART, and eruptions has the medical subclass SIGN/SYMPTOM.",
        "The semantic S-V-O pattern In which these classes play a part is: BODYPART-SHOWVERB-SIGN/SYMPTOM (as in skin showed ng eruntions).",
        "ag can then be assigned the semantic class SHOWVERB.",
        "Proteir, 21, type le, enters into the semantic pattern: TEST-TESTVERB-TESTRESULT and gg can be assigned the class TESTVERB, which relates a TEST subject with a TESTRESULT object.",
        "Assigning a semantic class to the reconstructed Ile maximizes its informational content.",
        "In addition to reconstructing a distinguished lexical Item, like the verb hg, along with its semantic classes, it is also possible to specify the set of semantic classes for a deleted element, even though a lexical item Is not immediately reconstructable.",
        "For example, the fragment IQ rwceive folic AQ1‘, of Type VI, contains a verb of the PTVERB class and a MEDICATION object, but the subject has been deleted.",
        "The only semantic pattern which permits a verb and object with these medical subclasses is the S-V-O pattern: PATIENT-PTVERB-MEDICATION Through recognition of the semantic pattern in which the occurring elements of the fragment play a role, the semantic class PATIENT can be specified for the deleted subject.",
        "Pntient Is one of the distinguished words in the domain of narrative medical records which are often not explicitly mentioned In the text, although they play a role In the semantic patterns.",
        "The S-V-O relations, of which the fragment types are incomplete realizations, form the basis of a procedure which specifies the semantic classes of deleted elements In fragments.",
        "Under the best conditions, the set of semantic classes for the deleted form contains only one element.",
        "It Is also possible, however, for the set to contain more than one semantic class.",

        "The fragment notod pain In hands Ann km= would select a DOCTOR subject If written in the IMPRESSION or EXAM paragraph of the text, but, in the HISTORY paragraph, a PATIENT or FAMILY subject could not be excluded.",
        "A second factor is the presence of an antecedent having one of the semantic classes specified for the deleted element.",
        "If a possible antecedent having the same semantic class can be found, subject to restrictions on change of topic and discourse structure, then the deleted element can be filled in by its antecedent, restricting the semantic class of the deleted element to that of the antecedent.",

        "The antecedent may be one of a class of distinguished words in the sublanguage, such as pmttent and doctor, which may not be previously mentioned In the body of the text.",
