        "This is an actual naval message containing sentence boundary problems, missing subjects and objects, an incorrect verb conjugation, and an abbreviation for \"dead in water.\" The NAVY receives many thousands of short messages like the one above in very 'scruffy' form, and these messages have to be put into a more readable form before they can be passed through many hands.",
        "Hence there is an obvious benefit to partially automating this encoding process.",
        "Most large text-understanding systems today would not be able to automate the encoding process mentioned above because they were designed under the assumption that the input text consists of well-formed and logical sentences such as newspaper stories and other edited texts.",

        "and the the surface structures that appear in the language, i.e., the relations between the surface order of appearance of words and phrases, and their corresponding meaning structures.",
        "The process of text understanding is the combined application of these knowledge sources as a reader proceeds through a text.",
        "This fact becomes clearest when we investigate the understanding of texts that present particular problems to a reader.",
        "Human understanding is inherently tolerant; people are naturally able to ignore many types of errors, omissions, poor constructions, etc., and get straight to the meaning of the text.",
        "Our theories have tried to take this ability into account by including knowledge and mechanisms of error noticing and correcting as implicit parts of our process models of language understanding.",
        "The NOMAD system is the latest in a line of 'tolerant' language understanders, beginning with FOUL-UP, all based on the use of knowledge of syntax, semantics and pragmatics at all stages of the understanding process to cope with errors.",
