        "A large amount of such information is currently available in natural language text, and some of that text is of a highly stylized nature, with a restricted semantic domain.",
        "It is the task of specialized information extraction (SIE) systems to obtain information automatically from such texts and place it in the database.",
        "As with any system, it is desirable to minimize errors and human intervention, but a total absence of either is not necessary for the system to he economically viable.",

        "In this paper, we will first discuss some general characteristics of SIE systems, then describe the development of an experimental system to assist in the construction of a database of chemical reaction information.",
        "Many journals, such as the Journal of Organic Chemistry, have separate experimental sections, in which the procedures for preparing chemical compounds are described.",
        "It is desired to extract certain information about these reactions and place it in the database.",
        "A reaction information form (RIF) was developed in another project to contain the desired information.",
        "The purpose of the system is to eliminate the necessity in a majority of cases, for a trained reader to read the text and enter the RIF information into the machine.",

        "Some Terminology In the discussion below, we shall use the term grammar to mean a system consisting of a lexicon, a syntax, a meaning representation language, and a semantic mapping.",
        "The lexicon consists of the list of words in the language and one or more grammatical categories for each word.",
        "The syntax specifies the structure of sentences in the language in terms of the grammatical categories.",
        "Morphological procedures may specify a \"syntax\" within classes of words and ther,by reduce the size of the lexicon.",
        "A discourse structure, or extrasentential syntax, may also be included.",
        "The semantic mapping provides for each syntactically correct sentence a meaning representation in the meaning representation language, and it is the crux of the whole system.",
        "If the semantic mapping is fundamentally straightforward, then the syntactic processing can often be reduced, as well.",
        "This is one of the virtues of SIE systems: Because of the specialized subject matter, one can simplify syntactic processing through the use of ad hoc procedures (either algorithmic or heuristic).",
        "In many cases, the knowledge that allows this is nonlinguistic knowledge, which may be encoded in frames.",
        "Although this is not always the sense in which \"frame\" is used, this is the sense in which we shall use the term in our discussion below: Frames encode nonlinguistic \"expectations\" brought to bear on the task.",
        "In this light, it is interesting to explore the subject of case-slot identity, as raised by Charniak (1981).",
        "If the slots",
        "are components of frames, and cases are names for arguments of a predicate, then the slots in any practical language understanding system may not correspond exactly to the cases in a language.",
        "In fact, the predicates may not correspond to the frames.",
        "On the other hand, if the language is capable of expressing all of the distinctions that can be understood in terms of the frames, one would expect them to grow closer and closer as the system became less specialized.",
        "The decision as to whether to maintain the distinction between predicate/case and frame/slot has a \"Whorfian\" flavor to it.",
        "We have chosen to maintain that distinction.",
        "Despite the general decision with regards to predicates and slots, some of the grammatical categories in our work do not correspond precisely to conventional grammatical categories, but are specialized for the reaction information project.",
        "An example is \"chemical name\", This illustrates another reason that SIE systems are more practical than more general language understanding systems: One can use certain ad hoc categories based upon the characteristics of the problem (and of the underlying meanings represented).",
        "This idea was advocated several years ago by Thompson (1966) and used in the design of a specialized database query system (DEACON).",
        "Its problem in more general language processing applications - that the categories may not extend readily from one domain to another and may actually complicate the general grammar - does not cause as much difficulty in the SIE case.",
        "The danger of using ad hoc categories is.",
        "of course, that one can lose extensibility, and must make careful decisions in advance as to how specialized the SIE system is going to be."

        "This is even true in comparison to other tasks with a restricted subject matter, such as natural language computer programming or database query.",
        "Furthermore, these latter tasks require a very low error rate in order to be useful, because users will not tolerate either incorrect results or constant queries and requests for rewording from the program, while SIE programs would be successful if they produced results in, say, 80% of cases and required that the information extraction be done by humans in the others.",
        "Even small rates of undetected errors would be tolerable in many situations, though one would wish to minimize them The lessened syntactic variety in SIE casks means that the amount of syntactic analysis needed is lessened, and also the complexity of the machinery for the semantic mapping.",

        "Since the days of the early mechanical translation efforts, the amount of study of natural language phenomena, both from the point of view of pure theory and of determining specific facts about languages, has been substantial.",
        "Similarly, techniques for dealing with languages and other sorts of complex information by computer have been considerably extended and the work has been facilitated by the provision of higher-level programming languages and by the availability of faster machines and increased storage.",
        "Nevertheless, the state of scientific knowledge of language and of processes for utilizing that knowledge is still such that it is necessary to take an \"engineering approach\" to the design of computational linguistics systems.",
        "In using the term \"engineering\", we mean to indicate that compromises have to be made in the design of the system between what is theoretically desirable, and what is feasible at the state of the art.",
        "Failing to have a complete grammar of the language over which one wishes to have SIE, one uses heuristics to determine features that one wants.",
        "At the same time, one uses the scientific knowledge available, insofar as that is feasible.",
        "One builds and tests model or pilot systems to explore problems and techniques and tries to extrapolate the experience to production systems, which themselves are likely to have to be \"incrementally developed\".",
        "In any engineering context, evaluation measures are important.",
        "These measures allow one to set criteria for acceptability of designs which are likely always to be imperfect, and to compare alternative systems.",
        "The ultimate evaluation measure on which management decisions rest is usually cost/benefit ratio.",
        "This can be determined only after examining the human alternatives and their effectiveness.",
        "It is important to be able to quantify these alternatives, and this is often not done.",
        "For instance, it is common to assume that an automatic system should not produce errors, whereas humans always do; so the percentage of errors should be determined experimentally in each case and compared.",
        "For the evaluation of SIE systems, we would like to propose three measures;",
        "(1) Robustness - the percentage of inputs handled.",
        "Most real SIE systems will reject certain inputs, so the robustness will be one minus the percentage rejected.",
        "(2) Accuracy - the percentage of those inputs handled which are correctly handled.",
        "(3) Error rate - the percentage of",
        "erroneous entries within incorrectly an handled input.",
        "Probably the most difficult aspect of SIE engineering is the provision of a safety factor - an ability of the system to recognize inputs that it cannot handle.",
        "It is clear that one can create a system that is robust and acceptably accurate which has unacceptable error rates for certain inputs.",
        "If the system is to be useful, it must be possible automatically to determine which documents contain unacceptable error rates.",
        "It does no good to determine this manually, since that mild mean essentially redoing all of the infor-:•ation extraction manually, and the space of 'documents is not sufficiently uniform or continuous that sampling methods would do any good.",
        "it appears, then, that the only way that one is going to be able to provide a safety factor is to have a system that understands enough about the linguistic and nonlinguistic aspects of the texts to know when it is not understanding (at least most of the time).",
        "We shall have more to say about the safety factor when we discuss our system below.",
        "One suggestion often made for \"intelligent\" systems is that they be given some provision for improving their performance by \"learning\".",

        "It nevertheless seems feasible for SIE systems to learn by interaction with people who are doing information extraction tasks.",
        "The simplest case of this would be •ug-menting the lexicon, but others should be possible.",
        "The first step in this process would be to",
        "build in a sufficient safety factor that most incorrectly handled documents can be explicitly rejected.",
        "The second would be to localize the factors that caused the rejection sufficiently to be able to ask for help from the person doing the manual extraction process.",
