        "This paper describes a system that attempts to interpret descriptive texts without the use of complex grammars.",
        "The purpose of the system is to transform the descriptions to a standard form which may be used as the basis of a database system knowledgeable in the subject matter of the text.",
        "The texts currently used are wild plant descriptions taken directly from a popular book on the subject.",
        "Properties such as size, shape and colour are abstracted from the descriptions and related to parts of the plant in which we are interested.",
        "The resulting output is a standardised hierarchical structure holding only significant features of the description.",
        "The system, implemented in the PROLOG programming language, uses keywords to identify the way segments of the text relate to the object described.",
        "Information on words is held in a keyword list of nouns relating to parts of the object described.",
        "A dictionary contains the attributes of ordinary words used by the system to analyse the text.",
        "The text is divided into segments using information provided by conjunctions and punctuation.",
        "About half the texts processed are correctly analysed at present.",
        "Proposals are made for future work to improve this figure.",
        "There seems to be no inherent reason why the technique cannot be generalised so that any text of semi-standard descriptions can be automatically converted co a canonical form."

        "A lot of useful information, covering many subject areas, is presently available in printed form in catalogues, directories and guides.",

        "Because this information is represented in a stylised form, it is amenable to machine processing to abstract salient details concerning the entity being described.",
        "The research described here is part of a long term project to develop a system which can 'read' descriptive text and so become an expert on the material which has been read.",
        "The first stage of this research is to establish that it is indeed possible to abstract useful information from descriptive text and we have chosen as a typical example a text consisting of descriptions of wild plants.",
        "Our system reads this text and generates a formal canonical plant description.",
        "Ultimately this will be input to a knowledge-based system which will then be able to answer questions on wild plants.",
        "The paper gives a limited overview of the recent work in text analysis in order to establish a context for the approach we adopt.",
        "An outline of the operation of the system is then made.",
        "The analysis of our text proceeds in four separate stages and these are considered in conjunction with a sample text.",
        "The first stage attaches to each word in the text attributes which are held in either a keyword list or the system dictionary.",
        "This expanded text is then split up using conjunctions, punctuation marks and the keywords in the text to assign each segment of the text to a particular part of the plant.",
        "The third stage gathers up the descriptions for a particular part and abstracts properties from them.",
        "The final operation formats the output as required.",
        "We then look at the more detailed operation of the system in terms of specific parts of interest.",
        "This covers the dictionary, skeleton structures, text splitting, text analysis and the limited word guessing attempted by the system.",
        "Future developments are then considered.",
        "In particular the possibility of generalising the system to handle other topics.",
        "The actual implementation of the system and the use of PROLOG are examined and we conclude with some notes on the current utility of our system."

        "emphasis of this work depends on the use of sophisticated grammars to map to the internal representation.",

        "The more a system has been designed with a practical end in view, the more limited the domain.",
        "Schank is operating at the level of general language understanding.",

        "The first contains it's part of speech, a flag indicating the word carries no semantic information and some additional attributes to control processing.",
        "For example the attribute \"take-next\" indicates that if a property rule is already satisfied when this word is reached in the text then the next word should be attached to the property phrase already found.",
        "Thus the word \"-\" carries this property and pulls in a successive word.",
        "The second list contains attributes whose meaning would appear to be expressible as a physical measure of some kind:- \"touch-roughness\", \"vision-intensity\".",
        "Many of the words used in descriptions can be adequately categorised by a single attribute of this type.",
        "Thus the word red is an \"adjective\" with a physical property \"vision-colour\".",
        "The third contains those which require physical measures to be mapped and compared to internal representations or which deal with the manipulation of internal representations alone:-\"form-shape\", \"context-location\".",
        "Words using these attributes generally tend to be more complex and may have multiple attributes.",
        "Thus the word field has as attributes \"context-location\"",
        "and \"relationship-multiple-example\" whereas the word Scotland also carries \"context-location\" but is qualified by \"relationship-single-example\".",
        "We realize this division is delimited by an extremely fuzzy border, but when the search for a basis for word definition was made this helped the intuitive allocation of attributes.",
