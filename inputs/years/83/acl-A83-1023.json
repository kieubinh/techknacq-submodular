        "Printed subject indexes (SI), such as back-of-the-book indexes and indexes to periodicals and abstracts journals remain important as the most common tools for information retrieval.",
        "Traditionally SI are compiled from subject descriptions produced for this purpose by human indexers.",
        "Such subject descriptions are usually nominalized sentences in which the word order is chosen to emphasize as theme one of the objects participating in the description; the corresponding word or word phrase is placed at the beginning of the nominative construction.",
        "Furthermore, the nominalized sentence is rendered in a specially transformed ('articulated') way involving the separated by commas display of component word phrases together with the dominating prepositions; e.g. the sentence 'In lemon juice lead (is) determined by atomic absorption spectrometry' becomes 'LEMON JUICE, lead determination in, by atomic absorption spectroscopy.' Such rendering enhances the speedy understanding of the descriptions when browsing the index.",
        "At the same time it creates for the subject description a lineary ordered sequence of focuses which can be used for the hierarchical multilevel grouping of related sets of descriptions.",
        "The main focus (rheme) serves for the grouping of descriptions under a corresponding subject heading, the secondary focuses make possible the further subdivision of such group by subheadings.",

        "Figure 3 shows a KWOC sample generated from title-like subject descriptions at the Institute for Scientific Information.",
        "The appearance of KWOC indexes is more acceptabe but their browsing is much hindered by the lack of articulation of the lengthy subject descriptions (titles).",
        "Without proper articulation, the recognition of the context immediately relevant to the index word becomes too slow.",
        "In 1966 the Institute for Scientific Information (131) introduced a different type of automatically compiled subject index called PERMUTERM Subject Index (PSI) OGarfield, 1976o, which at present is the main type of SI to the Science Citation Index and other similar ISI publications.",
        "Two different negative dictionaries are used for producing this SI: a so called \"full stop list\" of words excluded from becoming headings as well as from being used as subordinate index entries, and a \"semi- stop list\" of words of little informative value, which are not allowed as headings but are used as index entries along with words found neither in the full-stop nor in the semi-stop lists.",

        "Fragment of a KWOC index compiled from relatively long subject descriptions.",
        "The words printed in lowercase letters are \"stop words,\" not used as index headings.",

        "The format of the PSI is illustrated in figure 4.",
        "Fragment of a PERMUTERM subject index to the Science Citation Index (Institute for Scientific Information), automatically compiled from titles.",
        "The index lines are words co-occuring in titles wit the heading word.",
        "The arrows indicate the first occurrence under the given heading of a pointer to a given article.",
        "PSI has the unique ability to make possible the easy retrieval of all titles containing any given pair of informative words.",
        "This ability is similar to the ability of computerized online search systems to retrieve titles by any boolean combination of search terms.",
        "The corresponding PSI ability is available to PSI users who have been instructed about the principles used for compiling it.",
        "The naive user is more likely to utilize it as a browsing tool.",
        "When doing so, he may be inclined to perceive the subordinate word entries as being the immediate context of the headings.",
        "Used as a browsing tool, PSI may deliver relatively high percentage of false drops because of the lack of contextual information.",
        "Another shortcoming of the PSI is its relatively high cost due to its significant size which is proportional to the square of the average length of titles.",
        "The large number of entries subordinated to headings which are words of relatively high frequency makes the exhaustive scanning of entries under such headings a time consuming procedure.",
        "An important advantage of all the above computer generated indexes over their manually compiled counterparts is the speed and essentially lower cost at which they are made available.",
        "All the above compilation procedures are based exclusively on the most trivial facts concerning the syntaxis and semantics of natural languages.",
        "They make use of the fact that texts are built of words, of the existance of words having purely syntactic functions and of the existence of lexical units of very little informative value.",
        "A common disadvantage versus the SI of traditional type is that the above procedures fail to provide articulated contexts which would be short enough and structurally simple enough to be easily grasped in the course of browsing.",
        "Certainly this problem can be solved by any systen which can perform the full syntactic analysis of titles or similar kinds of subject descriptions.",
        "From the syntactic tree of the title a brief articulated context can be produced for any given word of a title by detecting a subtree of suitable size which includes the given word.",
        "However, in the majority of cases the practical conditions of application of index compilation procedures are excluding the usage of full scale syntactic analysis, based on dictionaries containing the required morphological, syntactic and semantic information for all the lexical units of the processed input.",
        "For instance, ISI is processing annually for its mutli-disciplinary publications around 700,000 titles ranging in their subject orientation from science and technology to arts and humanities.",
        "The effort needed for the creation and maintenance of dictionaries covering several hundred thousands entries with a high ratio of appearance of new words would be excessive.",
        "Therefore, the automatic compilation of SI is practially feasible only on the basis of quite simplistic procedures based on \"negative\" dictionaries involving approximative methods of analysis which yield good results in the majority of cases, but are robust enough not to break down even in difficult cases.",
        "At one end of the range of problems involving natural language processsing are such as question answering which require a high degree of analytic sophistication and are based on a significant amount of domain dependent information formated in bulky lexicons.",
        "Such procedures appear to be applicable to texts dealing with rather narrow fields of knowledge in the same way as the high levels of iu-deptn human expertise are usually limited to specific domains.",
        "On the other end of the spectrum are simple problems requiring much less domain dependent information aria relatively low levels of \"intelligence\" (defined as the ability to discuss comprehensive texts from gibberish); the corresponding procedures are usually applicable to wide categories of texts.",
        "For reasons explained above, we consider the problems of automatic compilation of subject indexes as belonging to this low end of the spectrum.",
        "2.",
        "The automatic compilation of Key-Word-Phrase Sub ect Indexes In this framework we developed an automatic procedure for the compilation of a SI based on the detection and usage of word phrases.",
        "The earlier stages of development of this Key-Word-Phrase subject index (KWPSI) have been reported elsewhere (Vladutz 1979).",
        "The procedure starts by detecting certain types of syntactically self-contained segments of the input text; such segments are expected to be semantically self-contained in view of the assumed well-formedness of the input.",
        "The segment detection procedure is based on a relatively short list of acceptable syntactic patterns, formulated in terms of markers attributable by a simple dictionary lookup.",
        "The markers are essentially Che same as used in (Klein 1963) in the early days of machine translation for automatic grammatical coding of English words.",
        "All the words not found in an exlusion dictionary of 1,500 words are assigned the two markers ADJ and NOUN.",
        "All the acceptable syntactic patterns are characterized in the frameworks of a generative grammar constructed for title-type texts.",
        "Sucn texts are described as sequences of segments of acceptable syntactic patterns separated by arbitrary filler segments whose syntactic pattern is different from the acceptable ones.",
        "The analysis procedure leading to the detection of acceptable segments was formulated as a reversal of the generative grammer and is performed by a right to left scanning.",
        ".,ew acceptable syntactic patterns can easily be incorporated into the generative grammar.",
        "It is envisaged to use in the future existing programs for automatically generating analysis programs from any specific variant of the grammar.",
        "The present list of acceptable syntactic patterns includes such patterns where noun phrases are concatenated by the preposition 'OF' anu the conjunctions 'AND', 'OR', 'AND/OR', as well as constructions of the type 'NP1, NP2, ... AND t'Pi'.",
        "Since no prepositions other than 'OF' and no conjunctions other than 'AND', 'OR', 'AND/OR' can occur in the acceptable segments the occurrences of other prepositions and conjunctions are used for initial delimitation of acceptable segments, but the detection procedure is not limited to such usage.",
        "In particular, a past participle or a group containing adverbs followed by a past participle are excluded from the acceptable segment when precening",
        "an initial delimiter.",

        "The detection of acceptable segments is shown for 3 titles.",
        "The words with all lowercase letters are prepositions and conjunctions used as initial delimiters.",
        "The words with only initial capital letters are \"semi-stop\" words, excluded from being used as index headings; the underscored by dotted lines \"semi-stops\" are past participles which become deliminters only when followed by initial delimiters.",

        "This part is completely domain independent.",
        "A second part of the dictionary consists of nouns, adjectives, verbs, present and past participles, all of them of little informative value and, therefore, called \"semi-stop\" words.",
        "Such words will not be allowed later to become SI headings.",
        "The semi-stop part of the dictionary is somewhat domain-dependent and has to be atuned for different broad fields of knowledge such as science and technology, social sciences or arts and humanities.",
        "The second logical step in the SI compilation involves the transformation of acceptable segments into index records consisting of an informative word (not found in the system's dictionary) displayed as heading line and of an index line providing some relevant context for the heading word.",
        "Each multi-word segment generates as many index records as many informative words it contains.",
        "The right-hand side of the segment following the heading word is• placed at the beginning of the index line to serve as its immediate context and is followed through a semicolon by the segment's left-hand side.",
        "When both sides are non-empty, an articulation of the index line is so achieved.",
        "In the case of a single word segment an \"expension\" procedure is performed during index record generation.",
        "It starts by placing at the beginning of the index line a fragment of the title consisting of the filler portion following the heading word and of the next acceptable segment, if any; this initial portion of the index line is followed by a semicolon after which follows the preceding acceptable segment, followed finally by the filler portion separating in the title this preceding segment from the heading word.",
        "The index record generation is illustrated in figure 6.",
        "The final \"enrichment\" phase of the index record generation involves the additional display (in parenthesis) of the unused segments of the processed title.",
        "The transformation of Key-Word-Phrases into subject headings and subject entries is illustrated for the first two segments of the title A, Figure 6.",
        "The last two examples snow how single word segments (from Title C) are expanded to inclune the preceding and following them segements.",
        "As a result of this stage the informational value of the finally generated index record is almost equivalent to the information content of the initial full title.",
        "The entire process ultimately boils down to the the reshuffling of some component segments of the initial title.",
        "The enrichment stage of index record generation is illustrated on figure 7.",
        "The index records are alphabetized firstly by heading words and secondly by index lines with the exclusion from alphabetization of prepositions and conjunctions if they occur at the beginning of index lines.",
        "During the photocomposition different parts of the index line are sat using different fonts.",
        "If in the original title the initial part of the index line follows the head word immediately this part is set in bold face italics, i.e. in the same font as the heading.",
        "The \"inverted\" part following the semicolon is set in light face roman letters.",
        "Finally the enrichment part of the index line, included in parens is always displayed in light-face italics.",

        "size of KWOC indexes and compares favorably with the size of the PSI index.",
        "The analysis of the rates and nature of failures of the segment detection algorithm shows that in 96% of cases the generated segments are fully acceptable as valuable index entries.",
        "In 2% of cases some important information is lost as a result of the elimination of prepositions, as in case of expressions of 'wood to wood' type.",
        "The rest of failures results in somehow awkward segments which are not completely semantically self-contained.",
        "Even in such cases the index entries retain some informative value.",
        "Around half of the failures can be eliminated by additions to the system's dictionary, especially by the inclusion of more verbs and past participles.",
        "Not counted as failures are the 5% of cases when the length of the detected segments is excessive; such segments can include the whole title.",
