        "This paper describes preliminary research in the design of Bede, a limited-syntax controlled-vocabulary machine Translation system to run on a microprncessor, translating between English, French, German and Dutch.",
        "Our experimental corpus is a car-radio manual.",
        "Bede (named after the 7th Century English linguist) is essentially a research project: we are not immediately concerned ...rith commercial applications, though such are clearly possible if the research proves fruitful.",
        "-:ork on Bede at this stage though is primarily experimental.",
        "The aim at the moment is to investigate the extent to which a microprocessor-hased 'IT system of advanced design is possible, mod the limitations that have to be imposed in order to achieve A wor:cine system.",
        "This paper escrihes the overall syetem design specification c) we are currently working.",
        "In the basic design of the system we attempt to incorporate as much as possihle Features of large-scale Tf systems that have proved to be desirable or effective.",
        "Thus Bede is multilingual by design.",
        "algorithms and linguistic data are strictly separated, and the system is designed in -,ore o less independent modules.",
        "Ttie micronrncessor environment means that 1 -' size are imnortanc: 'iota structures both dynamic (created by and manipulated during the translation process) and static (dictionaries and linguistic rule packages) are constrained co be as economical in terms of storage space and access procedures as possible.",
        "Limitations on in-core and peripheral storage are important considerations in the system design.",
        "In large general purpose MT systems, it is necessary to assume that failure to translate the given input correctly is generally not due to incorrectly formed input, but to insufficiently elaborated translation algorithms.",
        "This is particularly due to two problems: the lexical problem of choice of appropriate translation equivalents, and the strategic problem of effective analysis of the wide range of syntactic patterns found in natural language.",
        "The reduction of these problems via the notions of controlled vocabulary and restricted syntax seems particularly appropriate in the microprocessor environment, since the alternative of making a system infinitely extendable is probably nor feasible.",
        "Given these constraints, it seems feasible to achieve translation via an Interlingua, in which the canonical structures from the source language are mapped directly onto those of the target language(s), avoiding any language-pair oriented 'transfer' stage.",
        "Translation thus takes place ,wu unaSeS: analysis or source text and synthesis of target text.",
        "A. Incorporation of recent design arincinles Modern MT system design can be characterised by three principles that have proved to be desirable and effective (Lehmann ec al, 1980:1-3): each of these is adhered to in the design of Bede.",
        "Bede is multilingual by design: early '!\"7 systems were designed with specific language-pairs in mind, and translation algorithms were elaborated on this basis.",
        "The main conseouence of this was that source language analysis was effected within the perspective of the given target language, and was therefore often of Little or no use on the addition into the system of a further language (cf. King, 1981:12; 1:ine Perschke, 1982:2S).",
        "In Bede, there is a strict separation of algorithms and linguistic data: early \"T =ystems were quite simnly 'translation nreerams'.",
        "/n6",
        "underlying linguistic theory which might have been present was inextricably bound up with the program itself.",
        "This clearly entailed the disadvantage that any modification of the system had to be done by a skilled programmer (cf. Johnson, 1980:140).",
        "Furthermore, the side-effects of apparently quite innocent modifications were often quite far-reaching and difficult to trace (see for example Bostad, 1982:130).",
        "Although this has only recently become an issue in MT (e.g. Vauquois, 1979:1.3; 1981:10), it has of course for a long time been standard practice in other areas of knowledge-based programming (Newell, 1973; Davis & King, 1977).",
        "The third principle now current in MT and to be incorporated in Bede is that the translation process should be modular.",
        "This approach was a feature of the earliest 'second generation' systems (cf. Vauquois, 1975:33), and is characterised by the general notion that any complicated computational task is best tackled by dividing it up into smaller more or less independent subtasks which communicate only by means of a strictly defined interface protocol (Aho et al., 1974).",
        "This is typically achieved in the MT environment by a gross division of the translation process into analysis of source language and synthesis of target language, possibly with an intermediate transfer stage (see 1.0 below), with these phases in turn sub-divided, for example into morphological, lexical and syntactico-semantic modules.",
        "This modularity may be reflected both in the linguistic organisation of the translation process and in the provision of software devices specifically tailored to the relevant subtask (Vauquois, 1975:33).",
        "This is the case in Bede, where for each subtask a grammar interpreter is provided which has the property of being no more powerful than necessary for the task in question.",
        "This contrasts with the approach taken in TAUM-Miteo (TAUM, 1973), where a single general-purpose device (Colmerauer's (1970) '0-Systems') is provided, with the associated disadvantage that for some 'simple' tasks the superfluous power of the device means that processes are seriously uneconomical.",
        "Bede incorporates five such 'grammar types' with associated individual formalisms and processors: these are described in detail in the second half of this paper.",
        "B.",
        "The microprocessor environment It is in the microprocessor basis that the principle interest in this system lies, and, as mentioned above, the main concern is the effects of the restrictions that the environment imposes.",
        "Development of the Bede prototype is presently taking place on 7.80-based machines which provide 64k bytes of in-core memory and 720k bytes of peripheral score on two 5-1/4\" double-sided double-density floppy disks.",
        "The intention is that any commercial version of Bede would run on more powerful processors with larger address space, since we feel that such machines will soon rival the nopularity of the less powerful 280's as the standard desk-ton hardware.",
        "Programming so far has been in Pascal-\" (Sorcim, 1979), a Pascal dialect closely resembling UCSD Pascal, but we are conscious of the fact that both C (Kernighan & Ritchie, 1978) and BCPL (Richards & Whitny-Strevens, 1979) may be more suitable for some of the software elements, and do not rule out completing the prototype in a number of languages.",
        "This adds the burden of designing compatible data-structures and interfaces, and we are currently investigating the relative merits of these languages.",
        "Portability and efficiency seem to be in conflict here.",
        "Microprocessor-based MT contrasts sharply with the mainframe-based activity, where the significance of problems of economy of storage and efficiency of programs has decreased in recent years.",
        "The possibility of introducing an element of human interaction with the system (cf. Kay, 1980; Melby, 1981) is also highlighted in this environment.",
        "Contrast systems like SYSTRAN (Tome, 1977) and GETA (Vauquois, 1975, 1979; Boitet & Nedobejkine, 1980) which work on the principle of large-scale processing in batch mode.",
        "Our experience so far is that the economy and efficiency in data-structure design and in the elaboration of interactions between programs and data and between different modules is of paramount importance.",
        "While it is relatively evident that large-scale MT can be simulated in the microprocessor environment, the cost in real time is tremendous: entirely .new design and implementation strategies seem to be called for.",
        "The ancient skills of the programmer that have become eroded by the generosity afforded by modern mainframe configurations become highly valued in this microprocessor application.",
        "C. Controlled vocabulary and restricted syntax The state of the art of language processing is such that the analysis of a significant range of syntactic patterns has been shown to be possible, and by means of a number of different approaches.",
        "Research in this area nowadays is concentrated on the treatment of more problematic constructions (e.g. Marcus, 1980).",
        "This observation has led us to believe that a degree of success in a small scale MT project can be achieved via the notion of restricting the complexity of acceptable input, so that only constructions that are sure tone correctly analysed are permitted.",
        "This notion of restricted syntax MT has been tried with some success in larger systems (cf. F.11iston, 107c1; Lawson, 1979:81f; Somers & McNaught, 1980:40), resulting both in more accurate translation, and in increased legibility from the human point of view.",
        "As F.11iston points out, the development of strict guidelines for writers leads not only the use of simpler constructions, but also to the avoidance of potentially ambiguous text.",
        "In either case, the benefits for MT are obvious.",
        "Less obvious however is the acceptability of such constraints; yet 'restricted syntax' need not imply 'baby talk', and a reasonably extensive range of constructions can he included.",
        "Just as problems of syntactic analysis car no alleviated by imposing some degree of control over",
        "the syntactic complexity of the input, so the corresponding problem of lexical disambiguation that large-scale MT systems are faced with can be eased by the notion of controlled vocabulary.",
        "A major problem for MT is the choice of appropriate translation equivalents at the lexical level, a choice often determined by a variety of factors at all linguistic levels (syntax, semantics, pragmatics).",
        "In the field of multilingual terminology, this problem has been tackled via the concept of terminological equivalence (WUster, 1971): for a given concept in one language, a translation in another language is established, these being considered by definition to be in one-to-one correspondence.",
        "In the case of Bede, where the subject-matter of the texts to be translated is fixed, such an approach for the 'technical terms' in the corpus is clearly feasible; the notion is extended as far as possible to general vocabulary as well.",
        "For each concept a single term only is permitted, and although the resulting style may appear less mature (since the use of near synonyms for the sake of variety is not permitted), the problems described above are somewhat alleviated.",
        "Polysemy is not entirely avoidable, but if reduced to a bare minimum, and permitted only in specific and acknowledged circumstances, the problem becomes more easily manageable.",
        "D. Interlingua A significant dichotomy in MT is between the 'transfer' and 'interlingua' approaches.",
        "The former can be characterised by the use of bilingual transfer modules which convert the results of the analysis of the source language into a representation appropriate for a specific target language.",
        "This contrasts with the interlingua approach in which the result of analysis is passed directly to the appropriate synthesis module.",
        "It is beyond the scope of the present paper to discuss in detail the relative merits of the two approaches (see Vauquois, 1975:142ff; Hutchins, 1978).",
        "We should however consider some of the major obstacles inherent in the interlingua approach.",
        "The development of an Interlingua for various purposes (not only translation) has been the subject of philosophical debate for some years, and proposals for MT have included the use of formalized natural language (e.g. Mel'Cuk, 1974; Andreev, 1967), artificial languages (like Fsoeranto), or various symbolic representations, whether linear (e.g. Wilting, 1961) or otherwise (e.g. %lilks, 1071).",
        "Most of these approaches are problematic however (for a thorough discussion of the interlingua approach co MT.",
        "see Otten & Pacak (1971) and Barnes (1983)).",
        "Nevertheless, some interlingua-based MT systems have been developed co a considerable degree: for example, the (lrenoble team's first attempts at 4T took this approach (Veillon, 1968), while the TITUS system still in use at the Institut Textile de France (Ducrot.",
        "1972; Zingel, 19781 is claimed to be interlingua-based.",
        "It seems that it can be assumed a priori that an entirely language-independent theoretical representation of a given text is for all practical purposes impossible.",
        "A more realistic target seems to be a representation in which significant syntactic differences between the languages in question are neutralized so that the best one can aim for is a languages-specific (sic) representation.",
        "This approach implies the definition of an Interlingua which takes advantage of anything the Languages in the system have in common, while accomodating their idiosyncrasies.",
        "This means that for a system which involves several fairly closely related languages the interlingua approach is at least feasible, on the understanding that the introduction of a significantly different type of language may involve the complete redefinition of the Interlingua (Barnes, 1983).",
        "From the point of view of Bede, then, the common base of the languages involved can be used to great advantage.",
        "The notion of restricted syntax described above can be employed to filter out constructions chat cause particular problems for the chosen Interlingua representation.",
        "There remains however the problem of the representation of lexical items in the Interlingua.",
        "Theoretical approaches to this problem (e.g. Andreev, 1967) seem quite unsatisfactory.",
        "But the notion of controlled vocabulary seems to offer a solution.",
        "If a one-to-one equivalence of 'technical' terms can be achieved, this leaves only a relatively small area of vocabulary for which an interlingual representation must be devised.",
        "It seems reasonable, on a small scale, to treat general vocaauiary to an analagous way to technical vocabulary, to particular treating lexical items in one language that are ambiguous with respect to any of the other languages as 'homographs'.",
        "Their 'disambiguation' must take place in Analysis as there is no biligual 'Transfer' phase, and Synthesis is purely deterministic.",
        "While this approach would be quite unsuitable for a Large-scale general purpose MT system, in the present context - where the problem can be minimised - it seems to be a reasonable approach.",
        "Our own model for the Bede Interlingua has not yet been finalised.",
        "We believe this to be an area for research and experimentation once the system software has been more fully developed.",
        "our current hypothesis is chat the Interlingua will take the form of a canonical representation of the text in which valency-houndness and (deep) will play a significant role.",
        "Sentential features such as tense and aspect will be captured by 'universal' system of values for the languages involved.",
        "This conception of an Interlingua clearly falls short of the language-independent pivot representation typically envisaged (cf. Boitet & Nedobejkine, 1980:2), but we hope :o demonstrate that it is sufficient for the languages in our system, and that it could Se adapted without significant difficulties co cater for the introduction of other (related) western European languages.",
        "we feel that research in t'lis area will, when the time comes, be a significant",

        "In the first stage it is compared word by word with a 'stop-list' of frequently occurring words (mostly function words); words not found in the stop-list undergo string-segmentation analysis, again on a word by word basis.",
        "String-segmentation rules form a finite-state grammar of affix-stripping rules ('A-rules') which handle mostly inflectional morphology.",
        "The output is a Chart with labelled arcs indicating lexical unit (LU) and possible interpretation of the stripped affixes, this 'hypothesis' to be confirmed by dictionary lookup.",
        "By way of example, consider (1), a possible French rule, which takes any word ending in -issons (e.g. finissons or hirissons) and constructs an arc on the Chart recording the hypothesis that the word is an inflected form of an '-ir' verb (i.e. finir or *herir).",
        "At the end of dictionary look-up, a temporary 'sentence dictionary' is created, consisting of copies of the dictionary entries for (only) those LUs found in the current TU.",
        "This is purely an efficiency measure.",

        "Arcs are labelled with appropriate syntactic class and syncactico-semantic feature information and a trace of the lower arcs which have been subsumed from which the parse tree can be simply extracted.",
        "The trivial P-rule (2) is provided as an examnle.",
        "In the second stage of structural analysis, the tree structure implied by the labels and traces on these arcs is disjoined from the Chart and undergoes general tree-to-tree-transductions as described by 'T-rules', resulting in a single tree structure representing the canonical form of the TU.",
        "The formalism for the T-rules is similar to that for the P-rules, except in the geometry part, where tree structures rather than arc sequences are defined.",
        "Consider the necessarily more complex (though still simplified) example (3), which regularises a simple English passive.",
        "Notice the necessity to:disambiguate' the two NPs via curly-hracketted disambiquators; the possibility of defining a partial geometry via :he 'dummy' symbol (S); and how the AIX and PREP arc eliminated in the resulting tree structure.",
        "Labellings for nodes are copied over by default unless specifically suppressed.",
        "With source-language LUs replaced by unicue multilingual-dictionary addresses, this canonical representation is the Interlingua which is passed for synthesis into the target language(s).",
        "C. Synthesis Assuming the analysis has been correctly performed, synthesis is a relatively straightforward deterministic process.",
        "Synthesis commences with the application of further T-rules which assign new order and structure to the Interlingua as appropriate.",
        "The synthesis 7-rules for a given language can be viewed as analogues 7..f the T-rules that are used for analysis of that language, though it is unlikely that for synthesis",
        "the analysis rules could be simply reversed.",
        "Once the desired structure has been arrived at, the trees undergo a series of context – sensitive rules used to assign mainly syntactic features to the leaves ('L – rules'), for example for the purpose of assigning number and gender concord (etc.).",
        "The formalism for the L – rules is again similar to that for the P – rules and T – rules, the geometry part this time definthg a single tree structure with no structural modification implied.",
        "A simple example for German is provided here (4).",
        "The list of labelled leaves resulting from the application of L – rules is passed to morphological synthesis (the superior branches are no longer needed), where a finite – state grammar of morphographemic and affixation rules ('M – rules') is applied to produce the target string.",
        "The formalism for M – rules is much less complex than the A – rule formalism, the grammar being again straightforwardly deterministic.",
        "The only taxing requirement of the M – rule formalism (which, at the time of writing, has not been finalised) is that it must permit a wide variety of string manipulations to be described, and that it must define a transaparent interface with the dictionary.",

        "Alphabetical or other structured language – specific listings can be produced, while of course dictionary updating and editing packages are also provided.",
        "The system as a whole can be viewed as a collection of Production Systems (PSs) (Newell, 1973; Davis & King, 1977; see also Ashman (1982) on the use of PSs in MT) in the way that the rule packages (which, incidentally, as an efficiency , undergo separate syntax verification and 'compilation' into interpretable 'code') operate on the data structure.",
        "The system differs from the classical PS setup in distributing its static data over two databases: the rule packages and the dictionary.",
        "The combination of the rule packages and the dictionary, the software interfacing these, and the rule interpreter can however be considered as analgous to the rule interpreter of • a classical PS.",
