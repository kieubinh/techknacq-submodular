      "text": [
        "The LRC MT system is one of very few large – scale applications of modern computational linguistics techniques (Lehmann, 1981].",
        "Although the LRC MT system is nearing the status of a production system (a version should be delivered to the project sponsor about the time this conference takes place), it is not at all static; rather, it is an evolving collection of techniques which are continually tested through application to moderately large technical manuals ranging from 50 to 200 pages in length.",
        "Thus, our \"applied\" system remains a research vehicle that serves as an excellent teethed for proposed new procedures.",
        "In general, the criteria for our choice of linguistic and computational techniques are three: effectiveness, convenience of use, and efficiency.",
        "These criteria are applied in a context where the production of an MT system to be operational in the near – term future is of critical concern.",
        "Candidate techniques which do not admit near – term, large – scale application thus suffer an overwhelming disadvantage.",
        "The questions confronting us are, then, twofold: (1) which techniques admit such application; and (2) which of these best satisfy our three general criteria?",
        "The first question is usually answered through an evaluation of the likely difficulties and requirements for implementation; the second, through empirical results in the course of experiments.",
        "Our evaluation of the LRC MT system's current status will be based on three points: (a) the system's provision of all the tools necessary for users to effect the complete translation process (including text processing, editing, terminology",
        "syntax ppropriate models of languag according to this",
        "notion, be treated [almost] entirely on the basis of semantics, guided by a strong underlying model of the current situational context, and the expectations that may be derived therefrom.",
        "We cannot argue against the claim that semantics is of critical concern in Natural Language Processing.",
        "However, as yet no strong case has been advanced for the abandonment of syntax.",
        "Moreover, no system has been deleloped by any of the adherents of the \"semantics only\" school of thought that has more-or-less successfully dealt with ALL of a vide range -- or at least large volume -- of material.",
        "A more damaging argument against this school is that every NLP system to date that HAS been applied to large volumes of text (in the attempt to process ALL of it some significant sense) has been based on a strong syntactic model of language (see, e.g., [Boitet et al., 1980b1, [Damerau, 1981], [Hendrix et al., 19781, (Lehmann et al., 1981], (Martin et al., 19811, [Robinson, 19821, and (Sager, 19811).",
        "There are other schools of thought that hold phrase-structure (PS) rules in disrespect, while admitting the utility (necessity) of syntax.",
        "It is claimed that the phrase-structure formalism is inadequate, and that other forms of grammar are necessary.",
        "(This has been a long-standing position in the linguistic community, being upheld there before most computational linguists jumped on the bandwagon; ironically, this position is now being challenged by some within the linguistic community itself, who are once again supporting PS rules as a model of natural language use [Gasdar, 19811.)",
        "The anti-PS positions in the NLP community are all, of necessity, based on practical considerations, since the models advanced to replace PS rules are formally equivalent in generative power (assuming the PS rules to be augmented, which is always the case in modern NLP systems employing them).",
        "But cascaded ATNs [Woods, 19E0], for example, are only marginally different from PS rule systems.",
        "It is curious to note that only one of the remaining contenders (a transformational grammar [Damerau, 1981]) has been demonstrated in large-scale application -- and even this system employs PS rules in the initial stages of parsing.",
        "Other formal systems (e.g., procedural grammars [Winograd, 1972]) have been applied to semantically deep (but linguistically impoverished) domains -- or to excessively limited domains (e.g., Small's [19801 \"word expert\" parser seems to have encompassed a vocabulary of less than 20 items).",
        "For practical application, it is necessary that a system be able to accumulate grammar rules, and especially lexical items, at a prodigious rate by current NLP standards.",
        "The formalisms competing with PS rules and dictionary entries of modest size seem to be universally characterizable as requiring enormous human resources for their implementation in even a moderately large environment.",
        "This should not be surprising: it is precisely the claim of these competing methodologies (those that are other than alight variations on PS rules) that language is an exceedingly complex phenomenon, requiring correspondingly complex techniques to model.",
        "For \"deep understanding\" applications, we do not contest this claim.",
        "But ve do maintain that there are some applications that do not seem to require this level of effort for adequate results in a practical setting.",
        "Our particular application automated translation of technical texts -- seems to fall in this category.",
        "The LRC MT system is currently equipped with something aver 400 PS rules describing the Source Language (German), and nearly 10,000 lexical entries in each of two languages (German and the Target Language -- English).",
        "The current state of our coverage of the SL is that the system is able to parse and acceptably translate the majority of sentences in previously-unseen texts, within the subject areas bounded by our dictionary (specific figures will be related below).",
        "By the time this conference convenes, we will have begun the process of adding to the system an analysis grammar of the current IL (English), so that the direction of translation may be reversed; we anticipate bringing the English grammar up to the level of the German grammar in about a year's time.",
        "Our expectations for eventual coverage are that around 1,000 PS rules will be adequate to account for almost all sentence forms actually encountered in technical texts, whatever the language.",
        "We do not feel constrained to account for every possible sentence form in such texts nor for sentence forms not found in such texts (as in the case of poetry) -- since the required effort would not be cost-effective whether measured in financial or human terms, even if it were possible using current techniques (which we doubt)."

      "heading": "B. Syntactic Features",
      "text": [
        "Our use of syntactic features is relatively noncontroversial, given our choice of the PS rule formalism.",
        "We employ syntactic features for two purposes.",
        "One is the usual practice of using such features to restrict the application of PS rules (e.g., by enforcing subject-verb number agreement).",
        "The other use is perhaps peculiar to our type of application: once an analysis is achieved, certain syntactic features are employed to control the course (and outcome) of translation -- i.e., generation of the TL sentence.",
        "The \"augmentations\" to our PS rules include procedures written in a formal language (so that our linguists do not have to learn LISP) that manipulate features by restricting their presence.",
        "their values if present.",
        "etc., and by moving them from node to node in the \"parse tree\" during the course of the analysis.",
        "As is the case with other researchers employing such techniques, we have found this to be an extremely powerful (and of course necessary) means of restricting the activities of the parser.",
        "C. Semantic Features We employ simple semantic features, as opposed to complex models of the domain.",
        "Our",
        "reasons are primarily practical.",
        "First, they seem sufficient for at least the initial stage of our application.",
        "Second, the thought of writing complex models of even one complete technical domain is staggering: the operation and maintenance manuals we are currently working with (describing a digital telephone switching system) are part of a document collection that is expected to comprise some 100,000 pages of text when complete.",
        "A research group the size of ours would not even be able to read that volume of material, much less write the \"necessary\" semantic models subsumed by it, in any reasonable amount of time.",
        "(The group would also have to become electronics engineers, in all likelihood.)",
        "If such models are indeed required for our application, we will never succeed.",
        "As it turns out, we are doing surprisingly well without such models.",
        "In fact, our semantic feature system is not yet being employed to restrict the analysis effort at all; instead, it is used at \"transfer time\" (described later) to improve the quality of the translations, primarily of prepositions.",
        "We look forward to extending the use of semantic features to other parts of speech, and to substantive activity during analysis; but even we were pleased at the results we achieved using only syntactic features."

    {
      "heading": "D. Scored Interpretations",
      "text": [
        "It is a veil-known fact that NLP systems tend to produce many readings of their input sentences (unless, of course, constrained to produce the first reading only -- which can result in the \"right\" interpretation being overlooked).",
        "The LAC MT system produces all interpretations of the input \"sentence\" and assigns each of them a score, or plausibility factor [Robinson, 1982].",
        "This technique can be used, in theory, to select a \"best\" interpretation from the possible readings of an ambiguous sentence.",
        "We base our scores on both lexical and grammatical phenomena -- plus the types of any spelling/typographical errors, which can sometimes be \"corrected\" in more than one way.",
        "Our experiences relating to the reliability and stability of heuristics based on this technique are decidedly positive: we employ only the (or a) highest-scoring reading for translation (the others being discarded), and our informal experiments indicate that it is very rarely true that a better translation results from a lower-scoring analysis.",
        "(Surprisingly often, a number of the higher-scoring interpretations will be translated identically.",
        "But poorer translations are frequently seen from the lower-scoring interpretations, demonstrating that the technique is indeed effective.)",
        "E. Indexed Transformations We employ a transformational component, during both the analysis phase and the translation phase.",
        "The transformations, however, are indexed to specific syntax rules rather than loosely keyed to syntactic constructs.",
        "(Actually, both styles are available, but our linguists have never seen the need or practicality of employing the open-ended variety).",
        "It is clearly more efficient to index transformations to specific rules when possible; the import of our findings is that it seems to be unnecessary to have open-ended transformations -- even during analysis, when one might intuitively expect them to be useful.",
        "F. Transfer Component It is frequently argued that translation should be a process of analyzing the Source Language (SL) into a \"deep representation\" of some sort, then directly synthesizing the Target Language (TL) (e.g., [Carbonnel, 19781).",
        "We and others (King, 19811 contest this claim especially with regard to \"similar languages\" (e.g., those in the Indo-European family).",
        "One objection is based on large-scale, long-term trials of the \"deep representation\" (in MT.",
        "called the \"pivot language\") technique by the MT group at Grenoble (Boitet, 1980a].",
        "After an enormous investment in time and energy, including experiments with massive amounts of text, it was decided that the development of a suitable pivot language (for use in Russian-French translation) was probably impossible.",
        "Another objection is based on practical considerations: since it is not likely that any NLP system will in the foreseeable future become capable of handling unrestricted input -- even in the technical area(s) for which it might be designed -- it is clear that a \"fail-soft\" technique is necessary.",
        "It is not obvious that such is possible in a system based solely on a pivot language; a hybrid system capable of dealing with shallower levels of understanding is necessary in a practical setting.",
        "This being the case, it seems better in near-term applications to start off with a system employing a \"shallow\" but usable level of analysis, and deepen the level of analysis as experience dictates, and resources permit.",
        "Our alternative is to have a 'transfer' component which maps \"shallow analyses of sentences\" in the SL into \"shallow analyses of equivalent sentences\" in the TL, from which synthesis then takes place.",
        "While we and the rest of the NLP community continue to debate the nature of an adequate pivot language (i.e., the nature of deep semantic models and the processing they entail), we can hopefully proceed to construct a usable system capable of progressive enhancement as linguistic theory becomes able to support deeper models.",
        "G. Attached Translation Procedures Our Transfer procedures (which effect the actual translation of SL into TL) are tightly bound to nodes in the analysis (parse tree) structure [Paxton, 1977].",
        "They are, in effect, suspended procedures -- the same procedures that constructed the corresponding parse tree nodes to begin with.",
        "This is to be preferred over a more",
        "general, loose association based on syntactic constructs because, aside from its advantage in sheer computational efficiency, it eliminates the possibility that the \"wrong\" procedure can be applied to a construct.",
        "The only real argument against this technique.",
        "as we see it, is based on space considerations: to the extent that different constructs share the same transfer operations, replication of the procedures that implement said operations (and editing effort to modify them) is possible.",
        "We have not noticed this to be a problem.",
        "For a while, our system load – up procedure searched for duplicates of this nature and eliminated them; however, the gains turned out to be minimal -- different constructs typically do require different operations."

        "Again, our separation of \"linguistic\" from \"computational\" techniques is somewhat artificial, but nevertheless useful.",
        "In this section we present the reasons for our use of the following computational techniques: (a) an all – paths, bottom – up parser; (b) associated rule – body procedures; (c) spelling correction; (d) another fail – soft analysis technique; and (e) recursive parsing of parenthetical expressions.",
        "A. All – paths, Bottom – up Parser Among all our choices of computational techniques, the use of an all – paths, bottom – up parser is probably the most controversial.",
        "It also received our greatest experimental scrutiny.",
        "We have collected a substantial body of empirical evidence relating to parsing techniques.",
        "Since the evidence and conclusions require lengthy discussion, and are presented elsewhere [Slocum, 1981], we will only briefly summarize the results.",
        "The evidence indicates that our use of an all – paths bottom – up parser is justified, given the current state of the art in Computational Linguistics.",
        "Our reasons are the following: first, the dreaded \"exponential explosion\" of processing time has not appeared (and our grammar and test texts are among the largest in the world), but instead, processing time appears to be linear with sentence length -- even though our system produces all possible interpretations; second, top – down parsing methods suffer inherent disadvantages in efficiency, and bottom – up parsers can be and have been augmented with \"top – down filtering\" to restrict the syntax rules applied to those that an all – paths top – down parser would apply; third, it is difficult to persuade a top – down parser to continue the analysis effort to the end of the sentence, when it blocks somewhere in the middle -- which makes the implementation of \"fail – soft\" techniques that much more difficult; and lastly, the lack of any strong notion of how to construct a \"best – path\" parser, coupled with the raw speed of well – implemented parsers, implies that an all – paths parser which scores interpretations and can continue the analysis to the end of the sentence is best in a practical application such as ours."

        "This practice is equivalent to what is done in ATN systems.",
        "From the linguist's point of view, the contents of our rule – body procedures appear to constitute a formal language dealing with syntactic and semantic features/values of nodes in the tree -- i.e., no knowledge of LISP is necessary to code effective procedures.",
        "Since these procedures are compiled into LISP, all the power of LISP is available as necessary.",
        "The chief linguist on our project, who has a vague knowledge of LISP, has employed OR and AND operators to a significant extent (we didn't bother to include them in the specifications of the formal language, though we obviously could have), and on rare occasions has resorted to using COND.",
        "No other calls to true LISP functions (as opposed to our formal operators, which are few and typically quite primitive) have seemed necessary.",
        "nor has this capability been requested, to date.",
        "The power of our rule – body procedures seems to lie in the choice of features/values that decorate the nodes, rather than the processing capabilities of the procedures themselves."

      "heading": "C. Spelling Correction",
      "text": [
        "There are limitations and dangers to spelling correction in general, but we have found it to be an indispensable component of an applied system.",
        "People do make spelling and typographical errors, as is well known; even in \"polished\" documents they appear with surprising frequency (about every other page, in our experience).",
        "Arguments by LISP programmers (re: ENTERLISP's DWIM) aside, users of applied NLP systems distinctly dislike being confronted with requests for clarification -- or, worse, unnecessary failure -- in lieu of automated spelling correction.",
        "Spelling correction, therefore, is necessary.",
        "Luckily, almost all such errors are treatable with simple techniques: single – letter additions, omissions, and mistakes, plus two – or three – letter transpositions account for almost all mistakes.",
        "Unfortunately, it is not infrequently the case that there is more than one way to \"correct\" a mistake (i.e., resulting in different corrected versions).",
        "Even a human cannot always determine the correct form in isolation, and for NLP systems it is even more difficult.",
        "There is yet another problem with automatic spelling correction: how much to correct.",
        "Given unlimited rein, any word can be \"corrected\" to any other.",
        "Clearly there must be limits, but what are they?",
        "Our informal findings concerning how much one may safely \"correct\" in an application such as ours are these: the few errors that simple techniques have not handled are almost always bizarre (e.g., repeated syllables or larger portions of words) or highly unusual (e.g., blanks inserted within words); correction of more than a",
        "one error in a word is dangerous (it is better to treat the word as unknown, hence a noun); and \"correction\" of errors which have converted one word into another (valid in isolation) should not be tried.",
        "D. Fail-soft Grammatical Analysis In the event of failure to achieve a comprehensive analysis of the sentence, a system such as ours -- which is to be applied to hundreds of thousands of pages of text -- cannot indulge in the luxury of simply replying with an error message stating that the sentence cannot be interpreted.",
        "Such behavior is a significant problem, one which the NIP community has failed to come to grips with in any coherent fashion.",
        "There have, at least, been some forays.",
        "Weishedel and Black (1980] discuss techniques for interacting with the linguist/developer to identify insufficiencies in the grammar.",
        "This is fine for development purposes.",
        "But, of course, in an applied system the user will be neither the developer nor a linguist, so this approach has no value in the field.",
        "Hayes and Mouradian (1981] discuss ways of allowing the parser to cope with ungrammatical utterances; this work is in its infancy, but it is stimulating nonetheless.",
        "We look forward to experimenting with similar techniques in our system.",
        "What we require now, however, is a means of dealing with \"ungrammatical\" input (whether through the human's error or the shortcomings of our own rules) that is highly efficient, sufficiently general to account for a large, unknown range of such errors on its first outing, and which can be implemented in a short period of time.",
        "We found just such a technique three years ago: a special procedure (invoked when the analysis effort has been carried through to the end of the sentence) searches through the parser's chart to find the shortest path from one end to the other; this path represents the fewest, longest-spanning phrases which were constructed during the analysis.",
        "Ties are broken by use of the standard scoring mechanism that provides each phrase in the analysis with a score, or plausibility measure (discussed earlier).",
        "We call this procedure 'phrasal analysis'.",
        "Our phrasal analysis technique has proven to be useful for both the developers and the end-user, in our application: the system translates each phrase individually, when a comprehensive sentence analysis is not available.",
        "The linguists use the results to pinpoint missing (or faulty) rules.",
        "The users (who are professional translators, editing the MT system's output) have available the best translation possible under the circumstances, rather than no usable output of any kind.",
        "To our knowledge, no other NLP system relies on a such a general technique for searching the parser's chart when an analysis effort has failed.",
        "We think that phrasal analysis -- which is simple and independent of both language and grammar -- could be useful in other applications of NLP technology, such as natural language interfaces to databases.",
        "E. Recursive Parsing of Parenthetical Expressions Few NLP systems have dealt with parenthetical expressions; but MT researchers know well that these constructs appear in abundance in technical texts.",
        "We deal with this phenomenon in the following way: rather than treating parentheses as lexical items, we make use of LISP's natural treatment of them as list delimiters, and treat the resulting sublists as individual \"words\" in the sentence; these \"words\" are \"lexically analyzed\" via recursive calls to the parser.",
        "Aside from the elegance of the treatment, this has the advantage that \"ungrammatical\" parenthetical expressions may undergo phrasal analysis and thus become single-phrase entities as far as the analysis of the encompassing sentence is concerned; thus, ungrammatical parenthetical expressions need not result in ungrammatical (hence poorly handled) sentences."

        "Since no two translators are likely to agree on what constitutes a \"correct\" translation -- to say nothing of establishing a rigorous, objective standard -- the notion of 'correctness' will naturally vary depending on who determines it.",
        "It will also vary depending on the amount of time available to perform the measurement: it is widely recognized that an editor will change more in a given translation, the more time he has to work on it.",
        "Finally, 'correctness' will vary depending on the use to which the translation is intended to be put, the classical first division being information acquisition vs. dissemination.",
        "There are a few subsidiary qualifications that must be applied to statements of measured quality: what kinds of text were involved?",
        "who chose them?",
        "did the vendor have access to them before the test?",
        "if so, in what form?",
        "and for how long?",
        "These are critically important questions relating to the interpretation of the results.",
        "It stands to reason that, to get the most trustworthy figures: the system should be applied to such varieties of text as it is intended to handle (in the near term.",
        "at least); the texts should be chosen by the user, and not divulged to the vendor beforehand except perhaps in the form of a list of words or technical terms (in root form) which appear therein -- and that.",
        "for not too long a period of time before the test.",
        "With the reader bearing all of the above in mind, we report the following quality measurements: during the last two years, LRC personnel have measured the quality of translations produced by the LRC MT system in terms of the percentage of sentences (actually, 'translation units', since isolated words and phrases appear frequently) which were translated from German into acceptable English; if any change to the translated unit was necessary, however slight, the translation was considered incorrect; the test runs were made once or twice for each text -- once, before the text was ever seen by the LRC staff (a 'blind' run), and once more, after a few months of system enhancement based in part on the previous results (a 'follow-up' run); the project sponsor always provided the LRC with a",
        "list of the words and technical terms said to be employed in the text (the list was sometimes incomplete, as one would expect of human compilations of the vocabulary in a large document).",
        "The first run, on a 50-page text, was performed only after the text had been studied for some time; the second and third runs, on an 80-page text, were performed both ways ('blind' and 'follow-up'); the fourth test was a blind run on a 200-page text.",
        "The figures so measured varied from 55% to 85% depending on the text, and on whether the test was a blind or follow-up run.",
        "A fifth test -- a follow-up run on the text used in the fourth test -- has already been performed, but the qualitative results are not available at this writing.",
        "The results of this run and two more blind runs on two very different texts totalling 160 pages should be available when the conference convenes; these qualitative results are all to be measured by professional technical translators employed by the project sponsor.",
        "D. Interpretation of the Results Any positive conclusions we might draw based on such data will be subject to certain objections.",
        "It has been argued that, unless an MT system constitutes an almost perfect translator, it will be useless in any practical setting May.",
        "1980].",
        "As we interpret it, the argument proceeds something like this: (1) there are classical problems in Computational Linguistics that remain unsolved to this day (e.g., anaphora, quantifiers, conjunctions); (2) these problems will, in any practical setting, compound on one another so as to result in a very low probability that any given sentence will be correctly translated;",
        "(3) it is not in principle possible for a system suffering from malady (1) above to reliably identify and mark its probable errors; (4) if the human post-editor has to check every sentence to determine if it has been correctly translated, then the translation is useless.",
        "We accept claims (1) and (3) without question.",
        "We consider claim (2) to be a matter for empirical validation -- surely not a very controversial contention.",
        "As it happens, the substantial body of empirical evidence gathered by the LRC to date argues against this claim.",
        "By the time the conference convenes, we will have more definitive data to present, derived by the project sponsor.",
        "Regarding (4), we embrace the assumption that a human post-editor will have to check the entire translation, sentence-by-sentence; but we argue that Kay's conclusion (\"then the translation is useless\") is again properly a matter for empirical validation.",
        "Meanwhile, we are operating under the assumption that this conclusion is patently false -- after all, where translation is taken seriously, human translations are routinely edited via exhaustive review, but no one claims that they are useless!",
        "E. Overall Performance In this section we advance a meaningful.",
        "more-or-less objective metric by which any MT system can and should be judged: overall (man/machine) translation performance.",
        "The idea is simple.",
        "The MT system must achieve two simultaneous goals: first, the system's output must be acceptable to the translator/editor for the purpose of revision; second, the cost of the total effort (including amortization and maintenance of the hardware and software) must be less than the current alternative for like material -- human translation followed by post-editing.",
        "There may be a significant problem with the reliability of human revisers' judgements (which are nevertheless the best available): the writer has been told by professional technical editors/ translators (potential users of the LRC MT system) that they look forward to editing our machine translations \"because the machine doesn't care\" (private communication].",
        "(That is, they would change more in a machine translation than in a supposedly equivalent human translation because they would not have to worry about insulting the original translator with what s/he might consider \"petty\" changes.)",
        "Thus, the \"correctness\" standards to be applied to MT will very likely differ from those applied to human translation, simply due to the translation source.",
        "Since the errors committed by an MT system seldom resemble errors made by human translators, the possibility of a \"Turing test\" for an MT system does not exist at the current time.",
        "When the conference convenes, we will present such data as we have, bearing on the issue of overall performance using our system.",
        "Preliminary data from at least one outside assessment should be available.",
        "This information will tend to indicate the readiness of our system for use in a production translation environment.",
        "V DISCUSSION We have commented on the relative merits in large-scale application of several linguistic techniques: (a) a phrase-structure grammar; (b) syntactic features; (c) semantic features; (d) scored interpretations; (e) transformations indexed to specific tules; (f) a transfer component; and (g) attached procedures to effect translation.",
        "We also have presented our findings concerning the practical merits of several computational techniques: (a) a bottom-up, all-paths parser; (b) associated rule-body procedures; (c) spelling correction; (d) chart searching in case of analysis failures; and (e) recursive parsing of parenthetical expressions.",
        "We believe these findings constitute useful information about the state of the art in Computational Linguistics.",
        "We will not have any firm empirical evidence concerning overall performance until later in 1983, when the LRC MT system will have been used in-house by our sponsor, for very-large-scale translation experiments.",
        "However, we will have some preliminary data from our sponsor source that can be adduced as a basis for extrapolation.",
        "(Our sponsor will indeed be using the data for just such a purpose.)",
        "This should constitute useful information about the state of the arc in Machine Translation at the University of Texas.",
        "To the extent that such findings are positive, they will lend credence to our claims regarding the practical utility of the methods we employed."
