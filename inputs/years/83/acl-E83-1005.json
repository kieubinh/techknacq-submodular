        "The former are represented by three levels of structure, that is S, MF, PW and are governed by phonological rules which are meant to render the movements of the vocal tract and the coarticulatory effects which occur regularly at word level and at word boundaries.",
        "The latter are represented by one level of structure, the IG, and are governed by rules which account for long range phenomena like pitch contour formation, intonation centre assignment, pauses.",
        "In brief, the rules that the FP shall have to apply are the following: i. transcription from grapheme to \"phoneme\", including the most regular coarticulatory and allophonic phenomena of the Italian language; ii.",
        "automatic word stress assignment, including all the most frequent exceptions to the rules as well as individuation of homographs, which are very common in Italian; iii.",

        "external sandhi rules, operating at word boundaries and resulting in stress retraction, destressing, stress hierarchy modification, elision by assimilation and other phenomena; v. destressing of functional words listed in a table lookup; vi.",

        "There are a number of exceptions and counterexceptions to the rules which have to be specified, but no dictionary lookup seems to be needed.",
        "What creates the main difficulties are digraphs and trigraphs which are ambiguous in that they can render both stops and palatals; some of the decisions concerning trigraphs must be taken after stress has been assigned by word stress rules.",
        "The following graphemes have been transcribed into symbols denoting \"phonetic elements\":",
        "And here are some exceptions: GLICINE, ANGLIA, GEROGLIFICO where GL = /gl/not/AV FARMACIA, LUCIAwhere CI = hp/ not AI/ BUGIA, AEROFAGIA, NOSTALGIAwhere GI/dip not/d3/ SCIAwhere SCI4ri/not4r/ Here below we include the flowchart of the phonological rules for the transcription of graphemes S and Z which, as we said, have both voiced/unvoiced phonemes.",
        "As it can be easily seen, the two graphemes have been treated together by the same set of rule operating conjunctively: thus a remarkable economy and simplicity has resulted; as to the theoretical import of using one and the same algorithm, it has been shown that voiced S/Z decisions obey to similar underlying phonological rules."
