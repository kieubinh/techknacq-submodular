        "A great deal of interest is actually being shown in providing computer interfaces through dialog processing systems using speech input and output (Levinson and Shipley, 1979).",
        "In the same time, the amelioration of the microprocessor technology has allowed the implantation of word recognition and text-to-speech synthesis systems on single boards (Lignard and Mariani, 1982 ; Gauvain, 1983 ; Asta and Lignard, 1979) ; in our laboratory, such modules have been integrated into a compact unit that forms an autonomous vocal processor which has applications in a number of varied domains : vocal command of cars, of planes, office automation and computer-aided learning (Mel et al., 1982).",
        "Whereas most of the present language understanding systems require large computational resources, our goal has been to implement a dialoghandling board in the LIMSI's Vocal Terminal.",
        "The use of micro-systems introduces memory size and real-time constraints which have incited us to limit ourselves in the use of presently available computational linguistic techniques.",
        "Therefore, we have taken inspiration from a simple model of semantic network ; for the same reasons, the initial parser based on an Augmented Transition Network (Woods, 1970) and implemented on an IBM 370 (Memmi and Mariani, 1982) was replaced by another less time and memory-consuming one.",
        "The work presented herein extends possible application fields by allowing an interactive vocal relation between the machine and its user for the execution of a specific task : the application that we have chosen is a man-machine communication with a robot manipulating blocks and using a Plan Generating System."

        "To limit the degradation of performance, syntactic information is used : words that can possibly follow a given word may be predicted at each step of the recognition process with the intention of reducing vocabulary."
