        "An ATM grammar is a set of networks formed by labelled states and directed arcs connecting them.",
        "The arcs can ricognize terminal (words) and non – terminal (lexical categories) symbols or recursively call for a network identified by the label of an initial state.",
        "When such a call occurs, the parsing algorithm suspends the current computation and starts a new level of computation.",
        "Usually, each network recognizes some linguistic unit such as Noun Phrase (NP), Prepositional Phrase (PP), and Sentence (S) and any recursively embedded call to one of them corresponds to a level of computation.",
        "The parsed parts of the input string are stored (SETRed) into registers as they are recognized.",
        "At the end of the network these registers are combined (BUILDQed) into a parse node and returned (POPed) to the calling net.",

        "As no subject NP is met after 'che', an interpretation is yielded with 'Giovanni' in subject position.",

        "Instead, in the sentence (3) Giovanni disse che i suoi colleghi avevano John said that his colleagues had mentito lied as the UP suoi colleghi' is analysed, it replaces the SENDRed 'Giovanni' in the suaJ register and the correct interpretation is popped.",
        "A more complex treatment is required for the sentence (4) Giovanni pensava che i suoi colleghi avrebbero John thought that his colleagues would raccontato a tutti che aveva fatto have told to everybody that (he) had done una scoperta a discovery where 'Giovanni' must get through the first complement and reappear in the second (embedded) one.",
        "If SENDR is used, a transit register R1 with the same content as the initialized SUBJ register is to be passed down together with it.",
        "When the subject of the first complement ('i suoi colleghi') is found, it replaces 'Giovanni' in SUBJ but not in Rl.",
        "The new SUGJ suoi colleghi' and R1 'Giovanni' are again SENDRed to the embedded complement where the agreement with the verb correctly selects, as subject, the content of Rl.",
        "Now, as the number of levels which to 'jump over' is in principle illimited and each one may have its own subject to be SENDRed, a transit register for each new subject is needed.",

        "when processing the last complement three registers containing., the three possible subjects will be available and shall be visited in order to find the right one(3).",
        "A storage overload may also be caused by the need for raising lexical features.",
        "Morphological features are necessary at the least in the test of subject – verb agreement.",
        "This is done by LIFTRing in ad hoc registers gender and number from the NP level to the S level.",
        "If the NP is popped in a possible subject position the test for agreement may take place by comparing the content of those registers with the corresponding features of the verb.",
        "However, there are cases such as ex.",
        "(1) in which such information must be used again in the course of the analysis for another (agreement) test.",
        "Those features must be, therefore, copied in appropriately labelled registers in order to i) flag their relation to the subject and ii) prevent them from being erased when the same features are LIFTRed from the following NP.",
        "The same need for ad hoc storing may be shown for the object and few PP complements.",
        "For example, in the sentence",
        "(6) Il capitano disse ai soldati che",
        "The captain said to the soldiers that marciavano pietosamente (they) were marching peatifully as the DP soldati' embedded in the 'a – PP' is the subject of the complement, its gender and number must travel up through PP and S and down to the complement, in order the subject – verb agreement to be satisfied.",
        "This implies that at a given moment other registers containing morphological features coexist at the S level with those of the subject.",
        "An obvious remedy to this proliferation of registers consists in adding these features to the NP or PP structure, POPing them, and extracting them from those structures when needed.",
        "But classical ATN does not provide a suitable function, a form that should return only a part of a stored tree after having searched through it.",
        "Now, although such functions are not particularly complex to design [5, 7], they are not perfectly consistent with the ATP general formalism which does not take into consideration the extraction of pieces of already processed information from the structure they have been inserted in.",
        "C. A functional perspective 1.",
        "A generalized retrieving action",
        "If we look at the discussed examples from an entirely functional viewpoint we can describe them as having in common the need for retrieving",

        "Oe give here, for clarity, the parenthesized form of this example: (Giovanni era sicuro (che i suoi nemici avrebbero rivelato alla stampa (che sum moglie aveva detto un giorno (che l'aveva picchiata))).",
        "Notice that in this example the subject – verb agreement is sufficient to select the right antecedent, but this is not always the case.",

        "information somewhere back in the already built structures; the tricky solutions presented above are, in fact, a way of accessing parts of the left context.",
        "These sometimes correspond to the entire content of a register and sometimes to a fragment of it.",
        "We will assume, then, that the left context is stored in a space of memory, equally accessible from any level and that retrieving always concerns fragments of it.",
        "At any point of the process this structure contains the current hypothesis about the analysis of the parsed segment of the input from the beginning; hence we will refer to it as Current Global Hypothesis (CGIL).",
        "The retrieving action will have two participants, a symbol that triggers the action (trigger) and the information to he retrieved (the target of the action).",
        "In this frame all the different procedures discussed above may be reduced to a single general algorithm of three steps, i) identification of a trigger (a gap to be filled, a verb which demands for the subject-verb agreement test) ii) extraction of constraints which must guide the search for the target, and iii) retrieving of the required information.",
        "On this functional ground, the same description fits to the binding of an anaphoric pronoun to its antecedent [7] as in (7) a) Giovanni disse a baria che voleva John said to Mary that (he) wanted sposarl-la marry her as opposed to b) Giovanni disse a !",
        "!aria che voleva John said to :.lary that (he) wanted sposarsi to marry The function that searches back may be constrained by several types of restrictions, including i) morphological features, i.e. the gender and number of the pronoun or those required for agreement by the syntactic environment (e.g. the verb), ii) syntactic idiosyncrasies of some lexical item such as the STRAPS verbs that determine which of their arr;uoents is to be the subject of the complement, iii) semantic features that may be introduced in the process, and iv) syntactic deteriAnation of the scope of the search.",
        "2. ianipulations of the left context Retrieving of the antecedent may actually correspond to two different operations depending upon whether the antecedent to be bound linearly preceeds or follows the symbol it is to be bound to.",
        "In the cases discussed above the gap or the pronoun always follow there antecedent and it is therefore possible to immediately insert the binding pointer.",
        "[ioreover, in many coaon sentences the antecedent linearly follows its dependent, as in",
        "(3) Quando si arrabbia, Giovanni diventa rosso When (he) gets angry, John becomes red (9) Se lo vedi, salute Giovanni",
        "If (you) see him, say hallo to John da parte mia on my behalf In this case, the binding should take place in two steps, the flagging of the need for a forward binding and the moving of the pointer from the antecedent, once detected, to the flag.",
        "Notice that this class of sentences entirely lies beyond the abilities of the classical ATb framework.",
        "Relative pronouns also need to be bound to an antecedent and, besides, are the surface signal of an embedding.",
        "No special processing difficulty is proposed by sentences like (10) Il ragazzo che corre The boy who runs where the relative pronoun occurs exactly where the embedding begins.",
        "In this case a scope restriction can limit the search for an antecedent to the immediately preceeding NP.",
