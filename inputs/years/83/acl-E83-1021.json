        "This article deals with the interpretation of conceptual operations underlying the communicative use of natural language (NL) within the Structured Inheritance Network (SI – Nets) paradigm.",

        "In this sense, operations on SI – Nets are not merely isomorphic to single epistemological objects, but can be viewed as a simulation of processes on a different level, that pertaining to the conceptual system of NL.",
        "For this purpose, we have designed a version of KL – ONE which represents the epistemological level, while the ' new experimental language, KL – Conc, represents the conceptual level.",

        "I GOALS The goal of our work is to interpret conceptual operations underlying the communicative use of natural language within the Structured Inheritance Networks (SI – Nets) paradigm.",
        "In other words, this means using epistemological primitives such as Concepts, Roles and Structural Descriptions (Brachman, 1979), to represent these conceptual operations.",
        "On the one hand, epistemological formalism, which is explicit and clear, can clarify the behaviour of conceptual operations of NL.",
        "By the use of SI – Nets formalism as a means of description, a new perspective can be brought out, since this formalism makes it possible to represent objects as data types structured in a complex way instead of considering them as met= atomic elements.",
        "This feature is likely to change the nature of the operations to be carried out on objects thus leading us to deal with the complexity of many phenomena in a more adequate way.",
        "On the other hand, this can lead to an investigation of the relationships between the conceptual aspects of NL and the epistemological primitives, in order to discover how the latter are used by the previously mentioned operations.",
        "In fact, we attempt to find out whether an isomorphism exists between objects and operations of NL and those used by epistemology.",
        "According to Erachman (1979), five different approaches to the representational problem can be established: implementational, • logical, epistemological, conceptual and linguistic.",
        "Each of them uses its own primitives so that the five levels can be interpreted as a hierarchy where each level involves different degrees of abstraction.",
        "By virtue of this interpretation, we have tried to extend epistemology in a conceptual perspective.",
        "Our current approach considers epistemology as a starting point, thus looking at the conceptual level as one of the possible target points.",
        "This goal can be achieved by changing the level of abstraction of the operations to be performed on SI – Nets.",
        "Consequently, operations on SI – Nets could assume a different aspect, that is to say they could be viewed not as merely isomorphic to single epistemological objects but as a simulation of operations lying on a different level, for instance, that pertaining to the conceptual system of NL.",
        "This hypothesis can reduce SI – Nets to the level of an internal mechanism covering only abstract data representation, whose structure is not transparent to the user.",
        "In this case the user interacts with the internal system by means of a separate external framework.",
        "In order to achieve this goal we have designed and implemented a language, KL – hagma which represents our epistemological level.",
        "We are now designing and implementing an experimental language, KL – Conc, which should cover the conceptual level and which uses KL – itagma as one of its internal components.",
        "The rest of the article will be devoted to a description of these two languages introducing considerations concerning their relevance to linguistic analysis and knowledge representation.",
        "We are confident that our approach can have interesting implications for both these fields,",
        "since KL – Conc .functions can be used to describe linguistic entities in terns of conceptual operations and may be viewed as a more natural way of interacting with SI – Nets."

        "every lexical item of the MP has its own intensional representation.",
