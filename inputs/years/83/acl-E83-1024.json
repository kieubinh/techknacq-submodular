        "This paper presents a syntactical method of interpreting pronouns in Polish.",
        "Using the surface structure of the sentence as well as grammatical and inflexional information accessible during syntactic analysis, an area of reference is marked out for each personal and possessive pronoun.",
        "This area consists of a few internal areas inside the current sentence and an external area i.e. the part of the text preceding it.",
        "In order to determine that area of reference several syntactic sentence-level restrictions on anaphora interpretation are formulated.",
        "Next, when looking at the area of pronoun's reference, all NPs which number-gender agree with the pronoun can be selected and this way the set of surface referents of each pronoun can be created.",
        "It can be used as data for further semantic analysis.",
        "I INTRODUCTION Reference is one of the central concepts of any linguistic theory.",
        "In recent research into anaphora the term \"reference\" has been used in three different senses (Szwedek, 1981):",
        "(a) as a relation between the name and the thing named (Hall Partee, 1978) (b) as an association between noun phrases and mental entities in the language user's (Nash-VV ebber, 1978) (c) as an association between the occurrence of phrases in the text (Reinhart, 1981)",
        "However the reference is understood, in order to interpret correctly anaphora on the semantic level ( (a) and (b)), first a stage (c) is necessary.",
        "In this paper I he.ve taken the point of view presented under (c).",
        "I shall discuss the problem of anaphora in Polish sentences.",
        "My attention is focused on personal and possessive pronouns explicitely occurring in the text and moreover on zero pronouns, i.e. ellipsis of NP in the subject position, specific for Slavonic languages.",
        "My purpose in the description of regularities of the reference in the Polish language.",
        "I shall express them by defining the area of pronoun's references, i.e. those regions of the text where its antecedents should be found.",
        "These surface referents will be selected from among NPs occurring in the sentence.",
        "The research on anaphora made for English has led to the formulation of some structural rules using such relations as command, c-command and precede-and-command (Reinhart, 1981).",
        "I have been searching for analogous rules for Polish.",
        "But two essential differences have to be considered:",
        "(i) grammatical and morphological properties of Polish and English; (ii) different grammatical traditions.",
        "For English the rules concernig the coreference of entities were formulated on the basis of generative-transformational grammar.",
        "For Polish the first precise description of Polish syntax was formulated only recently by Szpakowicz, who based his work on the framework created by Saloni (Saloni, 1976; Saloni and Swidzinski, 1981).",
        "It is a kind of immediate-constituent grammar; the grammatical categories (case, gender, etc) are applied not only to single words, but also to compound phrases.",
        "In my present work I have limited my attention to the subset of Polish described by Szpakowicz (Szpakowicz, 1983).",
        "Polish is a highly inflexional language and this fact has many and varied consequences.",
        "Surface referents of the pronoun will be selected from among those NPs which number-gender agree with the pronoun.",
        "Strictly speaking, the grammatical categories of the pronoun should be compatible with the categories of the NP, but in cases of neutralization they cannot be fully determined.",
        "My method of determining the areas of pronoun's reference is a syntactic one, because it is based on morphological and syntactical properties of the Polish language.",
        "I assume",
        "the availability of the surface structure of the sentence as well as grammatical and inflexional information accessible during a syntactic analysis.",
        "I deliberately do not make use of any semantic information, trying to get the most out of grammar.",
        "The feature I intend to provide is a complete definition of the area of pronoun's reference."

        "Internal and external areas of reference In the process of determining the surface referents of the pronoun, first the area of its reference should be marked out.",
        "This area, i.e. those regions of the text, where its antecedents should be found, is usually made up of several internal reference areas, i.e. the appropriate bits of the current sentence, and an external area, the part of the text preceding the current sentence.",
        "The list of internal areas depends on the syntactic position of the pronoun in the sentence.",
        "To determine these areas it is necessary to formulate sentence-level anaphora restrictions for Polish; These rules will determine the conditions of both obligatory coreference and obligatory non-coreference of entities.",
        "Thus we have two situations to consider: (i) in the case of obligatory coreference one internal area of reference containing the appropriate referent should be marked out; (ii) in the case of obligatory non-coreference the elements which are forbidden as surface referents of the pronoun should be excluded from the internal area.",
        "The coreference of entities which is qualified on the basis of some other premises will be called admissible coreference.",
        "At our disposal we have a multileveled, hierarchic surface structure of the sentence, Generally, it seems that internal areas can be identified with the constituents on the highest level: subject, objects, modifiers, regardless of their syntactic realization.",
        "Strictly speaking, noun as well as NP or any sentential structures can be instances of internal areas of reference.",
        "The partitioning of sentence (1) illustrates it:",

        "The basic criterion of excluding coreference",
        "The following rules of excluding the coreference of entities concern a level deeper than that on the surface, because they refer to syntactical functions of phrases in the sentence.",
        "The first rule presents the problem of coreference of the subject and other nominal groups, i.e. objects and nominal modifiers, in short called objects.",
        "It concerns reflexive pronouns, so it should be noted first that they differ from those in English, eg.",
        ": - possessive pronoun \"sw6j\" may have one of the following meanings: his, her, its.",
        "- reflexive pronoun \"siebie\" can mean: himself, herself, itself, myself, ourself, yourself, themselves.",
        "The basic criterion of excluding corference I have formulated from the analytical point of view: (R 1) If the object is expressed by means of a reflexive pronoun, then it is coreferential with the subject; in other cases the referential identity of the subject and object ist excluded.",
        "This criterion is applied both to look for coreferents of objects - blocking the subject, and in testing the possible antecedents of the subject - blocking the objects.",
        "Let us consider some examples: Meaning of symbols: obligatory coreference obligatory non-coreference admissible coreference reference to external area zero pronoun \"Ewa zapytala 1 o to\" \"Eva asked her about it\" \"CI zapytata j o to\" \"Asked her about it\" \"Asked zapytala j o to\" \"She asked her about it\" \"On zapytal Jana o Piotra\" \"He asked John about Peter\"",

        "•",
        "\"Eva adores her friend\" Now let us have a look at the case of the preposed PPs so difficult to interpret in English.",

        "(9) \"Nagle, obok niego, zobaczyl weia\" \"Suddenly, near him, saw a snake\" masc (10) \"Nagle, obok siebie, zobaczyt weZa\"",
        "\"Suddenly, near himself, saw a snake\" masc (ii) \"Nagle, obok siebie, on zobaczyt weZa\" \"Suddenly, near himself, he saw a snake\" In examples (10) and (11) the reflexive pronoun has appeared.",
        "These are the only two cases in which the coreference with the subject of the main sentence is permitted and even obligatory.",
        "Such an interpretation is correct irrespective of the position of PP in the sentence, i.e. it does not depend on whether this phrase precedes or follows the subject.",
        "The basic criterion of excluding coreference works as follows:",
        "(1) it is valid only for a simple clause, without blocking coreference between the elements of the main sentence and the constituents of embedded clauses; (ii) it is obligatory on every level of the sentence, i.e. it concerns all the sentence constructions irrespective of their position in the structure of the whole sentence.",
        "Examples (12) to (14) illustrate this: (12) \"Piotr nie wiedziat, czy.-93 pOjdzie do kina\" \"Peter did not know, whether would go to the movies\" (13) \"Jan zapomniat, o co Piokr go pytat\" \"John forgot, what Peter asked him about\" (14) \"Jan spotka4 chlopca, ktory dawno .",

        "nie odwiedz-1/ – \"John met a boy, who didn't visit him for long\" The interpretation of reflexive pronouns is not so easy as the criterion R 1 suggests.",

        "Especially infinitive phrases are hard to interpret.",
        "In order to do this correctly, an implicit agent which will be called further the deep subject, should be obtained.",
        "It often needs a few hypotheses to be formulated.",
        "Let us consider an example.",
        "The sentence: (15) \"Jan kazat stula,cemu umyé sie\" can be translated in two ways which exactly give the sense of possible Polish interpretations:",
        "(15.1) \"John told (the sevant) (to wash him)\" (15.2) \"John told (the servant) (to wash himself )\"",
        "In the infinitive phrase \"umy6 sie\" (\"to wash him\" or \"to wash himself\") which is standing in the object position, the reflexive pronoun \"sie\" is coreferential with the deep subject of this phrase.",

        "Here we have two possibilities: (i) the previoux object - \"servant\" interpretation (15.1) (ii) the subject of the main sentence - \"John\" - interpretation (15.2) One of them is the referent of the deep subject.",
        "And so we come to the next rule: (R 2) In order to interpret the infinitive phrase, the deep subject of the phrase has to be selected from among the previous object (if any) and the subject of the main sentence."
