        "This last features-passing mechanism is absent in the original PSG; from our experience, we found it usefull in all the cases in which a choice in a syntactic level is determined by the syperior level or by a more larger context.",
        "Thus, for instance, the set of features characterizing a prepositional phrase is determined at the corresponding syntactic level by the preposition and the features of the nominal phrase; but further and not less important selection criteria can be imposed by the verb which is found in the upper level.",

        "The choice of PSG is mainly motivated by the possibility of parallel computation.",
        "A control structure allowing the parallel computation is: cobegin coend; It is a single input-output structure, very usefull to handle alternative choices for the same computational level.",

        "In the case of not mutually exclusive alternatives, it is still possible to use the cobegin control structure , but it is necessary to define a strategy for the selection of the most suitable alternative when the coend occurs.",

        "The syntactic analyzer, working top-down, yelds a representation of the input sentence in which information about gender, number, person and tense are recorded and for each function such as subj, obj, time, etc... the ccrresponding filler is identified, or a list of fillers is given in case of ambiguity.",
        "These two kinds of information are exactly what is usefull for semantic interpretation and are picked up in various steps of the interaction by the semantic analyzer in order to build the main conceptualization and to fill its role.",
        "Also MARGIE(Schank,'75) makes some use of syntactic knowledge distributed among lexical definitions of words.",
        "This solution gives the entire control to the semantic interpreter and no syntactic functional representation is used.",
        "It seems,however, that an intermediate step, keeping the syntactic output separate from the semantic one, has the advantage of avoiding the multiplication of single pieces of syntactic knowledge.",
        "It also provides a simpler way of dealing with syntactic variants of the same sentence and a help in identifying coreferences.",
        "The semantic interpreter works fundamentally bottom-up and, although much is still to be attempted, it seems that it can usefully cooperate with a top-down parser to find the correct interpretation.",
        "These practical advantages will be taken into account also in the future development of the system.",
        "In fact it seems that, although no definite solution has been given to many linguistic problems, the interaction between two fully developped mechanisms controlling each other can provide an indication and a frame into which a more compact system can be built.",
        "In the present version of the system the interaction between the two modules is strictly sequential.",
        "In a more compact analyzer, syntactic specialists, i.e. simplified pieces of grammar specialized in particular syntactic phenomena, will be called by semantic interpreter according to opportunity.",
