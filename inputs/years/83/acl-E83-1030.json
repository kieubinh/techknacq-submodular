        "In recent NLU-systems a major importance is laid on processing nonstandard input.!)",
        "The present paper reports on the experiences we have made in the project \"Procedural Dialogue Models\" reconstructing task-oriented dialogues, which were uttered in a rather colloquial German.2) To this aim we have developed an incremental multilevel parsing formalism (Christaller/Metzing 82, Gehrke 82, Gehrke 83), based on an extension of the concept of cascaded ATNs (Woods 80).",
        "This formalism (see fig.",
        "A) organizes the interaction of several independent processing components, in our case 5.",
        "The processing components need not be ATNs; it is up to the user of the formalism to choose the tool for the specific task that suits her/him best.",
        "* The project is funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. 1) See e.g. session VIII in ACL 82, Car-bonell 83, Kwasny 80, 'Sondheimer/Weischedel 80; for handling of ellipsis see Weischedel/ Sondheimer 82, Wahlster et al.",
        "83.",
        "2) The dialogues that we are working with were recorded in the City of Frankfurt/ Main (Klein 79).",
        "The first level, an ATN, is responsible for the syntactic analysis.",
        "Its main pur-, pose is to detect phrases as well as 14114 and imperative structures and to determine the syntactic status a phrase may have in the utterance.",
        "On this level the analysis of an utterance can reach a permissible final state even if there is no complete sentence structure derived.",
        "The decision, if permissible or not, is made on the pragmatic level.",
        "The semantic interpretation is carried out by a case-oriented production rule 'system.",
        "According to the incremental manner of processing there are two definitions of case slots:",
        "1. a general one for a tentative categorization of phrases before the main verb is detected, and 2. a specific one, connected with the respective verb frame.",
        "This double definition of case slots enables the parsing formalism to make a minimal interpretation of parts of the utterance in the case of a missing verb and thus gives suggestions for filling this gap.",
        "The QUESTION-ANSWER-INTERACTION-compo=nent is an ATN.",
        "It has to categorize an utterance as a question, a part of an answer or as communication maintaining categories_ such as assurance, confirmation etc.",
        "This component is also responsible for recognizing a dialogue within in a dialogue when e.g. some clarification on that dialogue takes place.",
        "Finally the TASK-COMMUNICATION-component is itself a two-level cascade.",
        "One stage, the TASK-INTERACTION-component, provides the formalism with a dialogue scheme that presumably is applicable to most types of information-giving dialogues.",
        "The other stage, the TASK-SPECIFICATION-component, is responsible for the",
        "task-specific categorization, in this case direction giving with categories such as route description or place description.",
        "We divided this component into two stages which are both realized as ATNs,",
        "1. in order to have a greater modularizetion between different components (processing other types of task-oriented dialogues may require only to change the TASK-SPECIFICATION-component on the pragmatic level.",
        "), and 2. because each level contributes one category to the utterance or a part of it, which avoids double categorizations at one level.",
        "The pragmatic components are supported by knowledge sources (KS) that hold for each participant about his knowledge of the world, the partner and the course of the dialogue dependent of the task.",
        "The processing components exchange their results via a common KS (a kind of a blackboard).",
        "Only control information is transmitted by the cascade.",
        "The parsing formalism is written in MacLISP and in FLAVORS (diPrimio/Christaller 83) - an object-oriented language embedded in MacLISP.",
        "II The Dialogue Corpus The dialogues that we are dealing with are real task-oriented dialogues.",
        "The majority of utterances in these dialogues contain non-standard constructions or are in some sense incomplete.",
        "There are dialect words, word duplications, self-corrections and interjections.",
        "On the other hand they do not contain complicated sentence structures such as subordinations, complex noun-phrases, etc.",
        "The translation of one of our dialogues (see fig.",
        "B) may give a little impression of these non-standard features.",
        "An extreme approach to the solution of the problem of non-standard utterances would be, in our case, to take the dialog gues in the corpus as they are as standard.",
        "But this would only be an ad hoc solution, lacking generality.",
        "Thus we burden the pragmatic components with the decision whether an utterance is acceptable or not."
