        "Frequently a questioner expects more than a direct, literal response although he must assume that the answerer is not informed about what particular information he is seeking.",
        "The questioner imputes to a cooperative dialogue partner the communicative competence to reply to a simple yes-no question like (1) with an extended response (cf. (127, (11]) like (1a) rather than with a simple Yes.",
        "(1) Are you going to travel this summer?",
        "(la) Yes, to Sicily.",
        "In the absence of special information about the previous course of the dialog or the intentions of the questioner (the unmarked case) an answer like (la) seems more appropriate than (1b) or (lc).",
        "(lb) Yes, with an old school friend.",
        "(lc) Yes, by plane.",
        "OF course, there are numerous dialog situations in which (lb) or (1c) could be generated as a communicatively adequate response on the basis of a par.",
        "ticular partner model.",
        "But it still must h' asked why in dialogs of the type 'information .upply' the unmarked response takes the form (la) And not (1b) or (1c).",
        "In this paper we will present the results of a computational study of this problem for the domain Research on HAM-ANS is currently being supported by the German Ministry of Research and Te(hnology (11MFT) under contract 081715038",
        "'locomotion verbs' in dialogs based on a visually present world of discourse.",
        "This question is particularly important for the construction of cooperative dialog systems, since, in many applications, no explicit knowledge about the dialog goals of the questioner is available at the outset.",
        "If a system is nevertheless expected to 'over-answer', i.e. to volunteer information that has not specifically been requested, it must command a set of heuristic criteria for selecting the additional information that is to be verbalized [111.",
        "It is noteworthy that the three additional points of information in (la), (1b), (1c) correspond to filled deep case slots of the verb used in the question (GOAL, CO-AGENT and INSTRUMENT, respectively).",
        "This suggests that the unfilled optional case slots in the question are candidates for additional information.",
        "For a question like (2), in which all the deep case slots of 'break' are filled, only a direct response like (2a) is to be expected as a positive answer, while in 131, where only the obligatory deep case slots are filled, an extended response like (3a) can be expected.",

        "(2a) Yes.",
        "(3) Did you break the window?",
        "(3a) Yes, with my slingshot.",
        "Since not every optional deep case of a given verb unspecified in the question is suitable for an unmarked extended response (e.g. (1a)-(1c1) we may define the problem more precisely by asking which of the deep case slots unspecified in the question are to be chosen as the unmarked values.",
        "For our domain of investigation 'locomotion verbs' let us consider questions (4) and (5), which refer to a visually present world of discourse.",

        "The choice is dependent upon the verb contained in the question.",
        "Moreover, (5a) shows that combinations of deep cases are possible in unmarked extended responses.",
        "In the area under investigation here, the following heuristic can be employed to determine the",
        "selection of the deep case slots for an unmarked extended response: Select the deep case slots which contain the concepts necessary for the perceptual verification of the motion described by the verb.",
        "In order to verify a stop-event it is necessary to determine the end point of the motion (cf. (4a)) but not the cause (cf. (4b)).",
        "For a turn-off event a change of direction between source and goal must be established (cf. (5a)).",
        "It is not essential to determine whether other objects make this change of direction at the same time (cf. (5b)).",
        "Hence case role filling for the construction of an extended response can be regarded as a side effect of the visual.",
        "search necessary to answer the question.",
        "This also appears plausible when seen in the light of the beliefs that the questioner imputes to the answerer.",
        "The questioner believes that the answerer will fill in the case slots necessary for answering the question and that it is therefore unnecessary to explicitly mention these in the question.",
        "Additionally the questioner believes that the answerer believes that the questioner expects an extended reply and fur this reason did not explicitly request the additional information.",
        "A cooperative dialog system fulfills this user expectation by applying the heuristic formulated above.",
        "A prerequisite for the application of this heuristic is that the system have knowledge about which deep case slots are relevant for the verification of a movement.",
        "This prerequisite is not met by most natural language (NL) systems since they simply represent events in the domain of discourse in fully instantiated form using case frames, e.g. as part of a semantic net or frame hierarchy.",
        "In contrast, the German language dialog system HAM-ANS (Hamburg application-oriented natural language system) [6], which we have developed, can apply this heuristic because in addition to the case frame of each verb the system includes a representation of the referential semantics of predications associated with that verb which makes it possible to evaluate the visual input data for the movement in question.",
        "The goal of this article is to elucidate the representation constructions for case frames and referential semantics of verbs of motion used in HAM-ANS and to illustrate their use in generating unmarked extended responses."

        "The caller is assumed to have the overall goal of determining whether the room offered meets his requirements.",

        "In this case the NP-generator decides not to generate a definite description since neither the system nor the user has already referred to TRUCK2 in the previous dialog and the existence of TRUCK2 as a moving object is not implied by the existential assumptions supplied by the a priori user model (cf. [7]).",
        "Instead, the indefinite NP a light-colored truck' is generated, using the property 'light-colored' as an initial characterization.",
