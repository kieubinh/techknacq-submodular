        "Its aim is an automatic, conversational extraction of facts from a given text.",
        "Actually it is real medical text on gastroenterology, which was prepared by a team of specialists.",
        "The system has a modular structure.",
        "The first, and in fact very important module is the language analysis module.",
        "Its task is to ensure the transition of a medical text from its natural form, i.e. sentences formed by physicians, into a formal logical notation.",
        "This logical notation, i.e. logical formulae, is rather universal and can be easy adapted to various deductive and knowledge representation methods.",
        "The program of the analyser was written with the use of the CATN /Cascaded ATN/ technique, where the syntactic and semantic components constitute separate cascades.",
        "In the deduction and knowledge representation module the weak second order language was used.",
        "The works by E.Konrad /Konrad 76/ and N.Klein /Klein 78/ from the Technical University in Berlin were",
        "the starting point in the elaboration of this module.",

        "Similarly as in many other information systems of this type, e.g. LUNAR /Woods 72/, PLANES /Waltz 76/, SOPHIE /Burton 76/, RENDEZVOUS /Codd 78/, PLIDIS /Berry-Rogghe 78/, DIALOGIC /Grosz et al.",
        "82/, the purpose of the module is to transform a text in the natural language into a chosen formal representation.",
        "Suet Such a representationmust meet a number of requirements.",
        "Firstly, it must be \"intelligible\" to the internal parts of the system, i.e. the deductive component and/or managing the data base.",
        "Secondly, it must carry in a formal and clear man-er the sense and meaning of utterances in natural language.",
        "Finally, the representation should allow for a reproduction of the original input sentence with the aim of generating intermediate paraphrases and/or answers for the user.",
        "In the parser of the DIALOG system, we attempted on the gratest, in our opinion, achievements in the field of natural language processing.",
        "The following works had the greatest influence on the final form of the module: /Berry--Rogghe 78/, /Bates 78/, /Carbonell 81/, /Cercone 80/, /Chomsky 65/, /Ferrari 80/, /Fillmore 68/, /Gershman 79/, /Grosz 82/, /Landsbergen 81/, /Marcus 80/, /Martin 81/, /Moore 81/, /Robinson 82/, /Rosenschein 82/, /Schenk 78/, /Steinacker 82/, /Waltz 78/, /Wilensky 80/, /Woods 72/ and /Woods 80/.",

        "mainly to the English language processing, into'our system, using them in the treatment of the Polish language.",
        "We attempted thus, to preserve a certain distance with regard to the language itself, as well as the subject of conversation with the computer, so that the adapted solutions were of a broader character and through that became comparable with the state of research in that field in other countries.",

        "For the syntactic analyser produces a structure of the sentence grammatical analysis, which in turn undergoes a semantical verification.",
