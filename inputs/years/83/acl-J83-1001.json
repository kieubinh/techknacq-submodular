        "A major point made is the role of given and new information in formulating a paraphrase that differs in a meaningful way from the user's question.",

        "Such a paraphraser has been developed as part of the COOP system (Kaplan 1979).",
        "In CO-OP, an internal representation of the user's question is passed to the paraphraser, which then generates a new version of the question for the user.",
        "Upon seeing the paraphrase, the user has the option of rephrasing her/his question before the system attempts to answer it.",
        "Thus, if the question was not interpreted correctly, the error can be caught before a possibly lengthy search of the data base is initiated.",
        "Furthermore, the user is assured that the answer she/he receives is an answer to the question asked and not to a deviant version of it.",
        "The idea of using a paraphraser in the above way is not new.",
        "To date, other systems have used canned templates to form paraphrases, filling in empty slots in the pattern with information from the user's question (Waltz 1978, Codd 1978).",
        "In CO-OP, a transformational grammar is used to generate the paraphrase from an internal representation of the question.",
        "Moreover, the COOP paraphraser generates a question that differs in a meaningful way from the original question.",

        "The COOP system is aimed at infrequent users of data base query systems.",

        "Being able to converse naturally in English enables such persons to tap the information available in a data base.",
        "In order to allow the question-answering process to proceed naturally, COOP follows some of the \"cooperative principles\" of conversation (Grice 1975).",
        "In particular, the system attempts to find meaningful answers to failed questions by addressing any incorrect assumptions the questioner may have made in her/his question.",
        "When the direct response to a question would be simply \"no\" or \"none\", COOP gives a more informative response by correcting the questioner's mistaken assumptions.",
        "The false assumptions that COOP corrects are the existential presuppositions of the questions.2 Since these presuppositions can be computed from the surface structure of the question, a large store of semantic knowledge for inferencing purposes is not needed.",

        "It is for this reason that the paraphraser was designed to respond in English.",
        "The use of English to paraphrase queries creates several problems.",

        "A paraphrase must clarify the system's interpretation of possible ambiguous phrases in the user's question without introducing additional ambiguity.",

        "If a grammar were developed to simply generate English from an underlying representation of the question, this possibility could be realized.",
        "Instead, a method must be devised that can determine how the phrasing should differ from the original.",
        "The COOP paraphraser addresses both the problem of ambiguity and the rephrasing of the question.",
        "It makes the system's interpretation of the question explicit by breaking down the clauses of the question and reordering them depending upon their function in the sentence.",

        "The major effort in designing this kind of system is in the formation, by hand, of templates suitable for the particular data base and for the types of questions that can be asked.",
        "An example of an English question and the PLANES paraphrase for it are shown below in (M):",
        "(M) Q: How many flights did plane 3 make in Jan 73?",
        "P: PLANES searches the MONTHLY FLIGHT and MAINTENANCE SUMMARIES and returns: The value of TOTAL FLIGHTS for plane SERIAL #3 during January 1973.",
        "The RENDEZVOUS system also generates the paraphrase from the formal query using templates, although it is slightly more sophisticated than Waltz's. There are three parts to generation, and two types of templates are used.",
        "A header template corresponding to the type of query is chosen first.",
        "There are three types of queries in the system (FIND, EXIST, COUNT), of which FIND occurs most frequently.",
        "The header for FIND is PRINT THE ... EVERY ..., where the dots must be filled in.",
        "The second part to the paraphrase is the target list.",
        "It specifies the attributes requested by the user and is supplied by doing a table lookup on the attribute.",
        "The third part of the paraphrase is called the body.",
        "It is formed by extracting templates from tables, associated with particular items in the query, that specify restrictions on the requested values.",
        "An example of a query and the paraphrase generated by RENDEZVOUS is shown in (N) below.",
        "(N) Q: I want to find certain projects.",
        "Pipes were sent to them in Feb. 1975.",
        "P: Print the name of every project to which a shipment of a part named pipe was sent during February 1975.",
        "The goals of the RENDEZVOUS generation component are important ones.",
        "The generated English must be unambiguous, easy to understand, discriminating, and not misleading (Codd 1978).",
        "Instead of developing a general solution to achieve these goals, however, the research seems to be concentrated on particular examples which don't meet these criteria.",
        "This results in part from the use of templates.",
        "The templates must be constructed beforehand for a particular data base, and great care must be taken to choose phrases that can be easily patched together with a variety of other phrases.",
        "Unforeseen interaction between juxtaposed phrases is a problem that frequently arises.",
        "Such an approach necessitates looking at particular examples, instead of the general framework.",
        "In both of these systems, the use of templates means that the major effort in developing the system must be done by hand in formatting the English phrases.",
        "All questions that will be asked must be anticipated ahead of time, and although the systems can be extended by adding new templates, undesirable interactions between new and old templates must be specifically avoided, and each new required addition does not ease the addition of subsequent templates.",
        "Note that this means coverage in a template system is also difficult to specify.",
        "The use of a grammar in the COOP paraphraser makes it more flexible than these earlier paraphrasers: ► less work must be done by hand in formulating the system, ► interactions between templates are not a problem since the grammar determines how to combine words and phrases in an acceptable way, and ► the system is capable of handling new questions for which it has not been explicitly prepared, as long as they fall within the syntactic range of the system.",
        "The paraphraser's ability to perform the generation task described in the previous section nicely illustrates its flexibility.",
        "Note furthermore that the COOP paraphraser specifically addresses the problems of disambiguating relative clause modification in a general way and of generating a paraphrase that differs from the original question on a theoretical basis, issues not addressed by either the PLANES or the RENDEZVOUS paraphraser."

        "The paraphraser described here is a syntactic one.",
        "While this work has examined the reasons for different forms of expression, additions must be made in the area of semantics.",
        "The substitution of synonyms, phrases, or idioms for portions or all of the question requires an examination of the effect of context on word meaning and of the intentions of the speaker on word or phrase choice.",
        "The lack of a rich semantic base and contextual information dictated the syntactic approach used here, but the paraphraser can be extended once a wider range of information becomes available.",
        "When testing the implementation of the COOP system and extending its linguistic coverage, the paraphraser proved particularly helpful in debugging incorrect parses.",
        "It provided fast, easy-to-recognize notification when an incorrect interpretation had been made.",
        "This leads us to believe that the paraphrase would also prove helpful to actual users of the system were COOP to interpret a question differently than it was intended.",
        "Testing of this facility with a large number of actual users remains a topic for future work.",
        "The COOP paraphraser has been designed to be domain-independent, and thus a change of the data base requires no change in the paraphraser.",
        "Paraphra-American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 9, Number 1, January-March 1983 9 Kathleen R. McKeown Paraphrasing Questions Using Given and New Information sers that use the template form, however, will require such changes.",
        "This is because the templates or patterns, which constitute the type of question that can be asked, are necessarily dependent on the domain.",
        "Different sets of templates must be used for different data bases.",
        "The COOP paraphraser also differs from other systems in that it generates the question using a transformation grammar of questions.",
        "It addresses two specific problems involved in generating paraphrases:",
        "1. ambiguity in determining which noun phrases a relative clause modifies; 2. the production of a question that differs from the user's.",
        "These goals have been achieved for questions using relative clauses through the application of a theory of given and new information to the generation process."
