        "In its current form, the EPISTLE system addresses the problems of grammar and style checking of texts written in ordinary English (letters, reports, and manuals, as opposed to novels, plays, and poems).",
        "It is this goal that involves us so intimately with the processing of ill-formed language.",
        "Grammar checking deals with such errors as disagreement in number between subject and verb; style checking calls attention to such infelicities as sentences that are too wordy or too complex.",
        "A standard spelling checker is also included.",
        "Our grammar is written in NLP (Heidorn 1972), an augmented phrase structure language which is currently implemented in LISP/370.",
        "At this time the EPISTLE grammar uses syntactic, but not semantic, information.",
        "Access to an on-line standard dictionary with about 130,000 entries, including part-of-speech and some other syntactic information (such as transitivity of",
        "verbs), makes the system's vocabulary essentially unlimited.",
        "We test and improve the grammar by regularly running it on a data base of 2254 sentences from 411 actual business letters.",
        "Most of these sentences are rather complicated; the longest contains 63 words, and the average length is 19.2 words.",
        "Since the subset of English represented in business documents is very large, we need a very comprehensive grammar and a robust parser.",
        "We take a heuristic approach and consider that a natural language parser can be divided into three parts: (a) a set of rules, called the core grammar, that precisely defines the central, agreed-upon grammatical structures of a language;",
        "(b) peripheral procedures that handle parsing ambiguity: when the core grammar produces more than one parse, these procedures decide which of the multiple parses is to be preferred; (c) peripheral procedures that handle parsing failure: when the core grammar cannot define an acceptable parse, these procedures assign some reasonable structure to the input.",
        "In EPISTLE,",
        "(a) the core grammar consists at present of a set of about 300 syntax rules; (b) ambiguity is resolved by using a metric that ranks alternative parses (Heidorn 1982); and (c) parse failure is handled by the fitting procedure described here.",
        "In using the terms core grammar and periphery, we are consciously echoing recent work in generative grammar, but we are applying the terms in a somewhat different way.",
        "Core grammar, in current linguistic theory, suggests the notion of a set of very general rules that define universal properties of human language and effectively set limits on the types of grammars any particular language may have; periphery phenomena are those constructions that are peculiar to particular languages and that require rules beyond what the core grammar will provide (Lasnik and Freid-in 1981).",
        "Our current work is not concerned with the meta-rules of a Universal Grammar.",
        "But we have found that a distinction between core and periphery is useful even within a grammar of a particular language â€“ in this case, English."

        "(Recall that we currently have access only to syntactic and morphological information about constituents.)",
        "In the cases where semantic or pragmatic information is needed before a proper attachment can be made, rather than produce a confusion of multiple parses we force the grammar to try to assign a single parse.",
        "This is usually done by forcing some attachments to be made to the closest, or rightmost, available constituent.",
        "This strategy only rarely impedes the type of grammar-checking and style-checking that we are working on.",
        "And we feel that a single parse with a consistent attachment scheme will yield much more easily to later semantic processing than would a large number of different structures.",
        "The rules of the core grammar (CG) produce a single approximate parse for almost 70% percent of input text, and a small number of multiple parses for another 16%.",

        "If the head constituent does not cover the entire string, remaining constituents are added on either side, with the following order of preference:",
        "(a) segments other than VP; (b) untensed VPs; (c) tensed VPs.",
        "As with the choice of head, the widest candidate is preferred at each step.",
        "The fit moves outward from",
        "the head, both leftward to the beginning of the string, and rightward to the end, until the entire input string has been fitted into a best approximate parse tree.",
        "The overall effect of the fitting process is to select the largest chunk of sentence-like material within a text string and consider it to be central, with leftover chunks of text attached in some reasonable manner.",
        "As a simple example, consider this text string: \"Example: Your percentage of $250.00 is $187.50.\" Because this string has a capitalized first word and a period at its end, it is submitted to the core grammar for consideration as a sentence.",
        "But it is not a sentence, and so the CG will fail to arrive at a completed parse.",
        "However, during processing, the CG will have assigned many structures to its substrings.",

        "The parse in Figure 15 would be appropriate for a sentence such as \"Who(ever) exactly does that job prevails.\" However, it is thoroughly unhelpful for the sentence at hand.",
        "It diagnoses two errors, neither of which really exists.",
        "Figure 16 is close to acceptable for the input string.",
        "If the time adverbial NP (AVPNP in the parse tree) were replaced by a subject NP, the syntactic structure would be correct for the intended meaning.",
        "As things stand, this parse is only 50% helpful: it correctly diagnoses the missing question mark, but it incorrectly insists that \"month\" should be singular in number.",
        "The third parse (Figure 17) gives the desired single error correction, but it does so on the basis of a totally inappropriate parse.",
        "The structure in this figure would fit a question like \"Who exactly suffers (in order) that many people might live?\" The current version of the CG blocks the three parses in Figures 15 through 17 on a principled basis.",
        "Figure 15 can be blocked by tightening some constraints on the diagnosis of subject-verb number disagreement in fitted parses.",
        "Figure 16 is blocked because of the presence of an adverbial NP where the subject NP ought to be.",
        "Figure 17 is blocked by stipulating that all subordinate clauses beginning with a \"that\" conjunction should have modal or subjunctive predicates.",
        "An acceptable parse (Figure 18) is provided when the number agreement restriction is removed from phrases like \"that 15 months.\" This is accomplished by telling the proper rule to ignore number agreement in particular cases that involve a small subset of quantified English time words.",
        "Admittedly, the fix would be more pleasing if it were part of a larger scheme for understanding meaning and context.",
        "But the correction moves in the right direction, and certainly does not prevent future processing with a more intelligent semantic component.",
        "This situation clearly illustrates how error detection results in the addition of finer constraints on the core grammar."

        "The parsing approach closest in spirit to our fitting procedure is that described in Slocum (1983, p. 170): the LRC Machine Translation System uses a \"shortest path\" technique to construct a \"phrasal analysis\" of ungrammatical input.",
        "With this analysis, phrases can be translated separately, even in the absence of a total sentence parse.",
        "Aside from Slocum's work, most of the reports in this field suggest that unparsable or",
        "ill-formed input should be handled by relaxation techniques, that is, by relaxing restrictions in the grammar rules in some principled way.",
        "This is undoubtedly a useful strategy â€“ one which EPISTLE makes use of, in fact, in its rules for detecting grammatical errors (Heidorn et al.",
        "1982).",
        "However, it is questionable whether such a strategy can ultimately succeed in the face of the overwhelming (for all practical purposes, infinite) variety of ill-formedness with which we are faced when we set out to parse truly unrestricted natural language input.",
        "If all ill-formedness is rule-based (Weischedel and Sondheimer 1981, p. 3), it can only be by some very loose definition of the term rule, such as that which might apply to the fitting algorithm described here.",
        "Thus Weischedel and Black (1980) suggest three techniques for responding intelligently to unparsable inputs: (a) using presuppositions to determine user assumptions; this course is not available to a syntactic grammar like EPISTLE's;",
        "(b) using relaxation techniques; (c) supplying the user with information about the",
        "point where the parse is blocked; this would require an interactive environment, which would not be possible for every type of natural language processing application.",
        "Kwasny and Sondheimer (1981) are strong proponents of relaxation techniques, which they use to handle both cases of clearly ungrammatical structures, such as co-occurrence violations like subject/verb disagreement, and cases of perfectly acceptable but difficult constructions (ellipsis and conjunction).",
        "Weischedel and Sondheimer (1982) describe an improved ellipsis processor.",
        "No longer is ellipsis handled with relaxation techniques, but by predicting transformations of previous parsing paths that would allow for the matching of fragments with plausible contexts.",
        "This plan would be appropriate as a next step after the fitted parse, but it does not guarantee a parse for all elided inputs.",
        "Hayes and Mouradian (1981) also use the relaxation method.",
        "They achieve flexibility in their parser by relaxing consistency constraints (grammatical restrictions, like Kwasny and Sondheimer's co-occurrence violations) and also by relaxing ordering constraints.",
        "However, they are working with a restricted-domain semantic system and their approach, as they admit, \"does not embody a solution for flexible parsing of natural language in general\" (p. 236).",
        "The work of Wilks is heavily semantic and therefore quite different from EPISTLE, but his general philosophy meshes nicely with the philosophy of the fitted parse: \"It is proper to prefer the normal ... but it would be absurd ... not to accept the abnormal if it is described\" (Wilks 1975, p. 267)."
