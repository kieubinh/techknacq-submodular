        "We use the term \"Preference Semantics\" (PS) to indicate not programs that have parsed English into a semantic representation, nor the details of that semantic representation (all of which could have been different), but rather the underlying principles.",
        "The main principles or claims are as follows (and underlie the sequence of papers Wilks 1968, 1973, 1975, 1978).",
        "The last two will be of most concern to us here: a) It is possible to pass from English to a semantic representation without a module devoted explicitly to syntactic analysis, and without traditional syntactic classification of words or sentence components (for example, N, NP, VP).",
        "The necessary generalisations for parsing can all be expressed in the terms needed for the semantic representation.",
        "Moreover, these need not result in any kind of text \"skimming\" that misses essential features of the text and its content.",
        "b) The representation need not be of the model theoretic type, and the classic problems of quantification, etc., can be dealt with by special procedures.",
        "C) The description of the representation and the procedures that generate it should all be procedural and, most important, the representation should be the product of a few, general, and autonomous (not content-dependent) procedures.",
        "Moreover, the procedures should be consistent with a Least Effort principle of language understanding (Wilks 1975).",
        "d) The representation is based on a set of semantic primitives, of differing types (actions, substantives, qualities, etc.",
        "), but no claims are made that the set is universal: there could be many alternative sets for special tasks, domains, or cultures.",
        "All that is required is there be some privileged set to generate a representation.",
        "e) The representation emphasises the linear, rather than the recursive, properties of language: its structure therefore emphasizes linear boundaries of clauses and phrases (but with no special role for sentences) as a basis for a surface representation from which progressively deeper representations can be obtained by inference.",

        "sentational item corresponding to the piece of language between two such boundaries (whether a word or a sentence) we call a template, which is a complex structure (see below) having no associations with the term as used to denote a string of surface items, as in vision analysis.",
        "f) The representation is formed upon a principle of preference for the \"best fit\": thus, there is no single correct representation (except in special circumstances) for a text string, but the best, most internally coherent representation, chosen from among competing representations.",
        "Representational structures can be seen as \"preferring\" other associated representations, and an overall representation for a text is produced by allowing maximal satisfaction of such preferences, which will mean (as in the political analogy on which the notion is based) that some constituent representations do not have their local preferences satisfied.",
        "g) The last representational principle has a correlate at the level of text relationships: ill-formedness (and, we shall claim below, metaphor) is not a binary, yes-no, matter but a function of representational satisfaction, which includes being a function of the state of the dictionary for the words and higher level items constituting the text.",
        "To put it crudely, ill-formedness is a matter of what the analysis system believes the dictionary and state of the world to be, and how far it can be extended by rule with the aid of the knowledge structures available.",
        "To use an example from Wilks (1978) (1) The car drank gasoline will be ill-formed or not, depending on what you believe about drinking and about cars (thus crossing what would be, for many, a semantic-pragmatic boundary), and similarly for (2) John ran a mile depending on beliefs about running and distance (and so similarly for the so-called syntax-semantics distinction and the class of \"intransitive verbs\").",
        "It is part of principle (a) above that preference is a syntactic notion as well as a semantic notion in that one general rule can deal with both sorts of conventionally distinguished phenomena.",
        "Thus (2) is ill-formed just because [run] prefers no object, just as [believe] prefers a propositional object (a full template in the terms set out below) but will accept a human object nevertheless.",
        "However, in this short paper we arbitrarily restrict ourselves to phenomena that would conventionally be considered matters of word-sense semantics.",
        "On this view, much of what has often been thought of as ill-formed – particularly violations of Katzian selection restrictions (Katz and Postal 1964) – is not only not ill-formed but is typical of normal usage, and must not be rejected if it can be accommodated by the procedures of PS.",
        "The emphasis here is rather different from the standard one: on the PS view, the violation of preferences (such as those of drink for an animate agent or a liquid object) is the norm, and must not be treated as an exceptional matter, outside the core of English.",
        "Such locutions are statistically so normal and understood even when wholly novel, that their representation and processing must be performed as part of the central processes of a language under-stander.",
        "Some of the above points can be found incorporated in other language understanding systems, for example Schank and his associates (Schank 1975) for (a) except for their predilection for NPs – (b), (d) – except for their insistence on a universal set of primitives – and more recently (e).",
        "For (b) almost any classical example semantic net system (Simmons 1973, Hendrix 1975).",
        "What we shall do here is develop the last two principles towards a general theory of the understanding of ill-formed and metaphorical language.",
        "The concrete setting of our current research is the construction of a semantics/knowledge-based spelling corrector, but we shall not emphasise that here."

        "This approach uses the wider context of frame-like representations, called pseudo-texts, in addition to semantic American Journal of Computational Linguistics, Volume 9, Numbers 3-4, July-December 1983 183 Dan Fass and Yorick Wilks Preference Semantics, Ill-Formedness, and Metaphor formulas.",

        "This is a top-down, knowledge-driven approach, but cannot be termed CTE or CTD since no formula of drink is modified but a new one slotted into the templates for that particular ill-formed locution.",

      "text": [
        "The strategies are compared in two ways.",
        "First, the degree to which the semantic representations containing metaphors produced by the different strategies correspond to human understanding of those metaphors.",
        "Given the shallowness of a PS representation, that correspondence can be no more than superficial.",
        "Secondly, whether or not the semantic representations of the different strategies would assist in concrete computational tasks, such as producing correct translations.",
        "Most, if not all, individual metaphors can be read or understood in two ways.",
        "For example, the metaphor in (1) can be understood either by viewing the predicate drink as the car-like consuming of petrol, or by seeing the non-predicate car as having some human properties.",
        "Within PS, the CTE strategy and the active strategy reflect the first, predicate reading by altering semantic information in the predicate; the CTD strategy reflects the second, non-predicate reading by changing inherent information in the non-predicate.",
        "No single strategy reflects both readings.",
        "By leaving the preference violation in the semantic representation, the passive strategy does not reflect either reading and does not reflect human understanding of metaphor at all.",
        "In extended metaphors (those beyond a single clause), the initial metaphorical reading can be carried over in either the non-predicate or the predicate.",
        "Consider the following extended metaphors that are also cases of gapping (Hankamer 1973): (7) The car drank gasoline and (the car) purred to itself (8) The car drank gasoline and the taxi (drank) diesel In (7), the metaphorical usage of the non-predicate car is continued; in (8), it is the predicate drink.",
        "We now examine how closely the strategies of 6.1. reflect our understanding of extended metaphors like (7) and (8).",
        "To do this, we shall assume a simplified form of rules for filling dummy template nodes (Wilks 1975).",
        "Those more familiar with Chomsky (1977) can think of this in terms of a form of trace mechanism in which the trace node in the template representing the second clause inherits information from the controlling node in the first clause.",
        "Hence in (7) the formula of car will be inherited by the empty agent node in the template containing [purr].",
        "Let us consider (7) first.",
        "What happens when each strategy encounters [car] and [drink] in the first clause of the sentence, and then encounters [car] inherited from the first template and [purr] in the second clause?",
        "When the CTD strategy encounters [car] and [drink], it removes the preference violation between them by reassigning VEHICLE as ANIMATE in the non-predicate [car].",
        "This modified formula of [car] is inherited from the first template; [purr] expects an animate SUBJ and [car] is now ANIMATE, so there is no preference violation between them.",
        "The CTE strategy removes the preference violation between [car] and [drink] by changing the SUBJ preference of the predicate [drink] from ANIMATE to VEHICLE.",
        "[car] is unchanged and is inherited unchanged.",
        "Because [car] is still marked as inanimate, there is a preference violation with purr, which causes the CTE strategy to alter the SUBJ preference of [purr] to VEHICLE.",
        "The passive strategy does not change either [car] or [drink], leaving the preference violation between them.",
        "A second preference violation is left in the second clause as well.",
        "With the active strategy, a car-frame (or pseudo-text) is used, and [drink] would have a new consume sense and there would be no effect on [car].",
        "Hence, the frame would be accessed again for the second clause, but would either find no new sense for purr in the limited context of to itself (which would become just a passively accepted, though preference-violating, template) or it could hope to reapply the active strategy and find from the car frame that the only noise cars were noted as making (other than in conditions of trouble where they would backfire, etc.)",
        "was hum, which could be imposed in place of [purr], and would be confirmed by a causal inference from the beneficial effect of [consume gasoline].",
        "However, this might be difficult to embody in a serious knowledge representation since there is no non-metaphorical description in English of the noise of cars.",
        "So for (7) the active and passive strategies both leave preference violations in the second clause.",
        "The CTE and CTD strategies do not, but of these two, the CTD strategy more closely reflects human understanding.",
        "Now let us examine (8), The car drank gasoline and the taxi diesel.",
        "When processing (8), the CTD strategy changes semantic information in the non-predicate [car].",
        "[drink] is unchanged and is inherited unaltered by the second template.",
        "[taxi] is inanimate, but [drink] expects an animate subject, so there is a preference violation, which will cause the semantic information in [taxi] to be changed in its turn.",
        "The CTE strategy will change the SUBJ preference of the predicate [drink] to VEHICLE.",
        "This modified version of drink is then inherited by the second template.",
        "As [taxi] is a VEHICLE, there is no preference violation between [drink] and [taxi].",
        "The passive strategy changes neither set of information, which leads to preference violations in both clauses.",
        "The active strategy would construct a new consume sense for [drink] that would be inherited by the action node of the second template.",
        "As [taxi] is a VEHICLE, there would be no preference violation between [taxi] and the new sense of drink.",
        "In (8), where the metaphorical usage continued in the predicate, the CTE and active strategies most closely reflect human understanding because both have the effect of changing the predicate's expectations of its subject.",
        "However, in (7), where the metaphorical usage continued in the non-predicate, the CTD strategy was best because it changed the inherent data in the non-predicate.",
        "If we take the production of correct translation as a minimum constraint on interpretation strategy, then the changes the four strategies make to semantic representations are important because the effect of one strategy can be to produce a correct translation while another can cause a mistranslation.",
        "Consider (9) The car drinks gasoline and (the car) does not work well where the metaphor in the first clause does not extend to the gapped second clause.",
        "Assuming a node inheritance mechanism once again, [car] will be inherited in the second clause.",
        "If the non-predicate [car] is inherited unaltered, then that sentence is translated correctly as La voiture boil de l'essence et ne march pas bien because marcher, the appropriate translation of work, expects an inanimate subject.",
        "It is because they leave [car] unchanged that the passive, CTE, and active strategies all produce the correct translation of (9).",
        "However, the CTD strategy reassigns [car] as ANIMATE, and this modified formula of car is inherited into the second template.",
        "The effect of this is to translate the sentence wrongly as La voiture boit de l'essence et ne travail pas bien because travailler, another translation of work, expects an animate subject.",
        "(9) is not meant to be taken as decisive evidence in favour of the CTE strategy or the frame-based active strategy.",
        "We are sure that sentences can be found where altering the predicate's semantic information would cause mistranslations, where only the CTD or passive strategy would produce correct translations (there are probably sentences for which the passive strategy would produce mistranslations too): a strategy that produces a correct translation for one sentence may well mistranslate another.",
        "It is not possible to pursue these possibilities in detail here because it would involve too much detail of the mechanisms by which a translation equivalent in the target language is located – for example, by a full semantic matching as in the MARGIE system (Schank et al.",
        "1973), or from a prior guidance to possible target equivalents, as in Wilks (1973).",
        "That degree of detail would change the emphasis of this paper, in which translation is no more than a minimum condition that semantic strategies dealing with ill-formedness must meet.",
        "Because individual metaphors are ambiguous, that is, can be read or understood in two directions, no one strategy is adequate.",
        "The passive strategy is totally unsatisfactory.",
        "Strategies that alter the semantic information of non-predicates (CTD strategy) are inappropriate for predicate readings of individual metaphors and for extended metaphors that continue a predicate reading such as the one in sentence (8).",
        "Equally, we cannot have only strategies that alter the semantic information of predicates (CTE or active strategy) because of both non-predicate readings of individual metaphors and extended metaphors continuing a non-predicate reading like (7).",
        "As a result of the preceding comparison of strategies in terms of correspondence to human understanding and production of correct translations, it is clear that both strategies that change expectations and strategies that change data are needed.",
        "Since both these major types of strategy are fallible, how will the proper strategy be selected?",
        "In the next section we propose a control mechanism using both types of strategy that makes the correct selections (in terms of human understanding and accurate translations above), that is, it allows individual metaphors like the one in (9) to be represented by both types of strategy, selects the CTE strategy for examples such as (8), the CTD strategy for those such as (7), and no strategy at all for sentences like (10) The cat drank milk and the dog (drank) water that do not contain metaphor."

        "If, as in (7), (8), and (9), a metaphor is encountered in the first clause, then both major types of strategy are applied, producing two competing templates for the clause representing metaphorical ambiguity, that is, the two possible readings of the metaphor (data and expectations important to the metaphor are included below):",
        "Any semantic formula whose semantic information has been altered is marked by the control mechanism (indicated above by an *).",
        "The template (11a) produced by the CTE strategy has an altered predicate [drink]; the template (11b) produced by the CTD strategy has an altered non-predicate [car].",
        "If the second clause is a case of gapping, then the dummy node in the second template is analysed.",
        "If there is a single (unmarked) template representing the first clause, then the first clause did not contain a metaphor and the dummy node in the second template inherits the semantic formula from the controlling node in the first template in the way described earlier (section 6.2.).",
        "Hence, for (10), [drink] is inherited.",
        "If there are two (marked) templates representing the first clause, as with (11a) and (11b), then a metaphor is present.",
        "Though the mechanism also operates if the dummy node in the second template is a predicate (as in (8)), let us suppose that the missing node is a non-predicate, as in (9) The car drinks gasoline and does not work well or (7).",
        "To allow for individual metaphors like (9), the control mechanism assumes that the metaphor in the first clause has not been continued in the second: an unaltered version of the non-predicate is placed in the dummy node of the second template, taken from the template with an altered predicate because it contains the unaltered non-predicate.",
        "So, for sentence (9), the unaltered [car (VEHICLE)] is taken from the template with the altered predicate (11a), and a new template for the second clause (shown below in much simplified form) is produced: (12) [car (VEHICLE)] -* [works (SUBJ VEHICLE)] If there is no preference violation between that unaltered non-predicate and the other nodes of the second template, then, provided no other reading has more satisfied preferences, it is that reading of the template that is accepted.",
        "If, though, we have a case of extended metaphor as in (7) The car drank gasoline and purred to itself, then there is a preference violation between the unaltered non-predicate [car (VEHICLE)] and the predicate in the template for the second clause.",
        "So, for (7), the following template (much simplified) is produced:",
        "(13) [car (VEHICLE)] [purred (SUBJ ANIMATE)] (13) must have more satisfied preferences than any other competing template but – and here the control mechanism departs from the standard preference-as-procedure – even if (13) has more satisfied preferences than any other template, it is not accepted as it is, because it contains a preference violation between [car] and [purr].",
        "Instead, a new template for the second clause is created: its empty node is filled with the altered version of the same formula [car (ANIMATE)], inherited from the other template representing the first clause (11b), the one containing the amended non-predicate: (14) [car (ANIMATE)] [purred (SUBJ ANIMATE)]",
        "This template is accepted if it has more satisfied preferences than any other.",
        "Because the second case of inheritance was from the template containing the amended non-predicate, the control mechanism knows that the CTD strategy was appropriate for the first clause: the template containing the amended non-predicate, appears in the semantic representation for the sentence as a whole.",
        "Hence the control mechanism handles cases of extended metaphor like (7) and (8).",
        "However, for sentences containing a single metaphor such as (9) and (1), the ambiguity of the metaphor remains unresolved as two possible templates, (11a) and (11b).",
        "In terms of the means of comparison used in 6.2.",
        "(correspondence to human understanding and production of correct translations), there is no need to keep both templates, so the template with the altered predicate is retained (the product of the CTE or active strategy), somewhat arbitrarily, because we believe this reading to be the more common of the two."
