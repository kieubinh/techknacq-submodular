        "The computational-linguistics community has recently shown interest in a variety of metagrammatical formalisms for encoding grammars of natural language.",
        "A common technique found in these formalisms involves the notion of a metaruk, which, in its most common conception, is a device used to generate grammar rules from other given grammar rules.'",
        "A metarule is essentially a statement declaring that, it a grammar contains rules that match one specified pattern, it also contains rules that match some other specified pattern.",
        "For example, the following metarule",
        "[+auxi states that, if there is a rule that expands a finite VP into a finite auxiliary and a nonfinite VP, there will also be a rule that expands the VP as before except for an additional adverb between the auxiliary and the nonfinite VP.2 The patterns may contain variables, in which case they characterize \"families\" of related rules rather than individual pairs.",

        "The views and conclusions expressed in this document are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as representative of the views of the National Science Foundation or the United States government.",
        "We are indebted to Fernando Pereira, Stanley Peters, and Stanley Roscnschein for many helpful discussions leading to the writing of this paper.",
        "IMetarules were first utilized for natural-language research and are most extensively developed within the theory of Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG) (Gazdar and Pullum, 1982; Gawron et 41, 1982; Thompson.",
        "19821.",
        "2A metarule similar to our example was proposed by Gazdar, Pullum, and Sag (1982, P. 8071.",
        "The metarule notion is a seductive one, intuitively allowing generalizations about the grammar of a language to be stated concisely.",
        "However, unconstrained metarule formalisms may possess more expressive power than is apparently needed, and, moreover, they are not always computationally Safe.\" For example, they may generate infinite sets of rules and describe arbitrary languages.",
        "In this paper we examine both the formal and linguistic implications of various constraints on metagrammatical formalisms consisting of a combination of context-free phrase structure rules and metarules, which we will call metarule phrase-structure (MPS) grammars.",
        "The term '`MPS grammar\" is used in two ways in this paper.",
        "An MPS grammar can be viewed as a grammar in its own right that characterizes a language directly.",
        "Alternatively, it can be viewed as a meiagrammar, that is, as a generator of a phrase structure object grammar, the characterized language being defined as the language of the object grammar.",
        "Uszkoreit and Peters 119821 have developed a formal definition of MPS grammars and have shown that an unconstrained MPS grammar can encode any recursively enumerable language.",
        "As long as the framework for grammatical description is not seen as part of a theory of natural language, this fact may not affect the usefulness of MPS grammars as tools for purely descriptive linguistics research; however, it has direct and obvious impact on those doing research in a computational or theoretical linguistic paradigm.",
        "Clearly, some way of constraining the power of MPS grammars is necessary to enable their use for encoding grammars in a computationally feasible way.",
        "In the sections that follow, we consider several formal proposals for constraining their power and discus, some of their computational and linguistic ramifications.",
        "In our discussion of the computational ramifications of the proposed constraints, we will use the notion of weak-generative capacity as a barometer of the expressive power of a formalism.",
        "Other notions of expressivity are possible, although some of the traditional ones may not.",
        "be applicable to MPS grammars.",
        "Strong-generative capacity, for instance, though well-defined, seems to be an inadequate notion for comparison of MPS grammars, since it would have to be extended to include information about rule derivations as well as tree derivations.",
        "Similarly, we do not mean to imply by our arguments that the class of natural languages corresponds to some class that ranks low in the Chomsky hierarchy merely because the higher classes are less constrained in weak-generative power.",
        "The appropriate characterization of possible natural languages may not coincide at all",
        "with the divisions in the Chomsky hierarchy.",
        "Nevertheless weak-generative capacity – the weakest useful metric of capacity – will be the primary concern of this paper as a well-defined and relevant standard for measuring constraints."

        "Peters and Ritchie [19731 have pointed out that context-sensitive grammars have no more than context-free power when their rules are viewed as node-admissibility conditions.",
        "This suggests that MPS grammars might be analogously constrained by regarding the metarules as something other than phrase-structure grammar generators.",
        "A brief examination of three alternative approaches indicates, however, that none of them clearly yields any useful constraints on weak-generative capacity.",
        "Two of the alternatives discussed below consider metarule3 to be part of the grammar itself, rather than as part of the metagram-mar.",
        "The third views them as a set of redundant generalizations about the grammar.",
        "Stucky Iforthcomind investigates the possibility of defining metarules as complex node-admissibility conditions, which she calls meta-node-admissibility conditions.",
        "Two computationally desirable results could ensue, were this reinterpretation possible.",
        "Because the metarules do not generate rules under the meta-node-admissibility interpretation, it follows that there will be neither a combinatorial explosion of rules nor any derivation resulting in an infinite set of rules (both of which are potential problems that could arise under the original generative interpretation).",
        "For this reinterpretation to have a computationally tractable implementation, however, two preconditions must be met.",
        "First, an independent mechanism must be provided that assigns to any string a finite set of trees, including those admitted by the metarules together with the base rules.",
        "Second, a procedure must be defined that checks node admissibilities according to the base rules and metarules of the grammar – and that terminates.",
        "It is this latter condition that we suspect will not be possible without constraining the weak-generative capacity of MPS grammars.",
        "Thus, this perspective does not seem to change the basic expressivity problems of the formalism by itself.",
        "A second alternative, proposed by Kay 119821, is one in which metarule3 are viewed as chart-manipulating operators on a chart parser.",
        "Here too, the metarules are not part of a metagrammar that generates a context-free grammar; rather, they constitute a second kind of rule in the grammar.",
        "Just like the meta-node-admissibility interpretation, Kay's explication seems to retain the basic problem of expressive power, though Nay hints at a gain in efficiency if the metarules are compiled into a finite-state transducer.",
        "Finally, an alternative that does not integrate metarules into the object grammar but, on the other hand, does not assign them a role in generating an object grammar either, is to view them as redundancy statements describing the relationships that hold among rules in the full grammar.",
        "This interpretation eliminates the problem of generating infinite rule sets that gave rise to the Uszkoreit and Peters results.",
        "However, it is difficult to see how the solution supports a computationally useful notion of metarules, since it requires that all rules of the grammar be stated explicitly.",
        "Confining the role of metarules to that of stating redundancies prevents their productive application, so that the metarules serve no clear computational purpose for grammar implementation.3 We thus conclude that, in contrast to context-sensitive grammars, in which an alternative interpretation of the phrase structure rules makes a difference in weak-generative capacity, NIPS grammars do not seem to benefit from the reinterpretations we have investigated."

        "at e it appears unlikely that a reinterpretation of MPS grammars can be found that solves their complexity problem, formal constraints on the MPS formalism itself have to be explored if we want to salvage the basic concept of metarulea In the following examination of currently proposed constraints, the two criteria for evaluation are their effects on computational tractability and on the explanatory adequacy of the formalism.",
        "As an example of constraints that satisfy the criterion of computational tractability but not that of explanatory adequacy, we examine the issue of essential variables.",
        "These are variables in the metarule pattern that can match an arbitrary string of items in a phrase structure rule.",
        "Uszkoreit and Peters have shown that, contrary to an initial conjecture by Joshi (see Pazdar, 1982, fn.",
        "281), allowing even one such variable per metarule extends the power of the formalism to recursive enumerability.",
        "Gazdar has recommended 11982, p.16131 that the power of metarules be controlled by eliminating essential variables, exchanging them for abbreviatory variables that can stand only for strings in a finite and extrinsically determined range.",
        "This constraint yields a computationally tractable system with only context-free power.",
        "Exchanging essential for abbreviatory variables is not, however, as attractive a prospect as it appears at first blush.",
        "Uszkoreit and Peters 119821 show that by restricting MPS grammars to using abbreviatory variables only, some significant generalizations are lost.",
        "Consider the following metarule that is proposed and motivated in Pazdar 19821 for endowing VSO languages with the category VP.",
        "The metarule generates flat VSO sentence rules from VP rules.",
        "(2) VP--..VU=S – •VNPU",
        "Since U is an abbreviatory variable, its range needs to be stated explicitly.",
        "Let us imagine *hat the VSO language in question has the folloAl, -; small set of V P rules:",
        "(3) VI.",
        "Therefore, the range of U has to be (c, NP, 3', VP, NP 7P).",
        "3A3 statements about the object grammar, however, metarules might play a role in language acquisition or in diachronic processes.",
        "If these VP rules are the only rules that satisfy the left-hand side of (2), then (2) generates exactly the same rules as it would if we declared U to be an essential variable – i.e., let its range be (VT tJ VN)..",
        "But now imagine that the language adopts a new subcategorization frame for verbs,4 e.g., a verb that takes an NP and an 3 as complements.",
        "VP rule (4) is added:",
        "(4) VP V NP",
        "Metarule (2) predicts that VPs headed by this verb do not have a corresponding flat VSO sentence rule.",
        "We will have to change the metarule by extending the range of U in order to retain the generalization originally intended by the metarule.",
        "Obviously, our metarule did not encode the right generalization (a simple intension-extension problem).",
        "This shortcoming can also surface in cases where the input to a metarule is the output of another metarule.",
        "It might be that metaruie (2) not only applies to basic verb rules but also includes the output of, say, a passive rule.",
        "The range of the variable U would have to be extended to cover these cases too, and, moreover, might have to be altered if its feeding metarules change.",
        "Thus, if the restriction to abbreviator), variables is to have no effect on the weak-generative capacity of a grammar, the range assigned to each variable must include the range that would have actually instantiated the variable on an expansion of the MPS grammar in which the variable AM treated as essential.",
        "The assignment of a range to the variable can only be done post factum.",
        "This would be a satisfactory result, were it not for the fact that finding the necessary range of a variable in this way is an undecidable problem in general.",
        "Thus, to exchange essential for abbreviatory variables is to risk affecting the generative capacity of the grammar – with quite unintuitive and unpredictable results.",
        "In short, the choice is among three options: to affect the language of the grammar in ways that are linguistically unmotivated and arbitrary, to solve an undecidable problem, or to discard the notion of exchanging essential for abbreviatory variables – in effect, a Hobson'a choice.",
        "An example of a constraint that satisfies the second criterion, that of explanatory adequacy, but not the first, computational tractability, is the lexical-head constraint of GPSG [Gazdar and Pullum, 19821.",
        "This constraint allows metarule3 to operate only on rules whose stipulated head is a lexical (preterminal) category.",
        "Since the Uszkoreit and Peters results are achieved even under this restriction to the formalism, the constraint does not provide a solution to the problem of expressive power.",
        "Of course, this is no criticism of the proposal, since it was never intended as a formal restriction on the class of languages, but rather as a restriction on linguistically motivated grammars.",
        "Unfortunately, the motivation behind even this use of the lexical-head constraint may be lacking.",
        "One of the few analyses that relies on the lexical-head constraint is a recent GPSG analysis of coordination and extraction in English [Gazdar, 19811.",
        "In this case – indeed, in general – one could achieve the desired effect",
        "simply by specifying that the coefficient of the bar feature be lexical.",
        "It remains to be seen whether the constraint must be imposed for enough metarules so as to justify its incorporation as a general principle.",
        "Even with such motivation one might raise a question about the advisability of the lexical-head constraint on a meta-theoretical level.",
        "The linguistic intuition behind the constraint is that the role of metarule3 is to \"express generalizations about possibilities of subcategorizationn exclusively [Gazdar, Klein, Pullum, and Sag, 1982, p.39], e.g., to express the passive-active relation.",
        "This result is said to follow from principles of syntax Packendoff, 18771, in which just those categories that are sub-categorized for are siblings of a lexical head.",
        "However, in a language with freer word order than English, categories other than those subcategorized for will be siblings of lexical heads; they would, thus, be affected by metarules even under the lexical-head constraint.",
        "This result will certainly follow from the liberation rule approach to free word order [Pullum, 19821.",
        "The original linguistic generalization intended by the lexical-head constraint, therefore, will not hold cross-linguistically.",
        "Finally, there is the current proposal of the GPSG community for constraining the formal powers of metarules by allowing each metarule to apply only once in a derivation of a rule.",
        "Originally dubbed the once-through hypothesis, this constraint is now incorporated into GPSG under the name finite closure [Gazdar and Pullum, 19821.",
        "Although linguistic evidence for the constraint has never been provided, the formal motivation is quite strong because, under this constraint, the metarule formalism would have only context-free power.",
        "Several linguistic constructions present problems with respect to the adequacy of the finite-closure hypothesis.",
        "For instance, the liberation rule technique for handling free-word-order languages [Pullum, 19821 would require a noun-phrase liberation rule to be applied twice in a derivation of a rule with sibling noun phrases that permute their subconstituents freely among one another.",
        "As a hypothetical example of this phenomenon, let us suppose that English allowed relative clauses to be extraposed in general from noun phrases, instead of allowing just one ex-traposition.",
        "For instance, in this quasi-English, the sentence",
        "(5) Two children are chasing the dog who are small that is here.",
        "would be a grammatical paraphrase of (6) Two children who are small are chasing the dog that is here.",
        "Let us suppose further that the analysis of this phenomenon involved liberation of the NP S substructure of the noun phrases for incorporation into the main sentence.",
        "Then the noun-phrase liberation rule would apply once to liberate the subject noun phrase, once again to liberate the object noun phrase.",
        "That these are not idle concerns is demonstrated by the following sentence in the free-word-order Australian aboriginal language Warlpiri.5 sThis example is taken from Ivan Riemsdijk, 19811.",
        "The Warlpiri example is analogous to the quasi-English example in that both sentences have two discontinuous NPs in the same distribution.",
        "Furthermore, the liberation rule approach has been proposed as a method of modeling the free word order of Warlpiri.",
        "Thus, it appears that finite closure is not.",
        "consistent with the liberation rule approach to free word order.",
        "Adverb distribution presents another problem for the hypothesis.",

        "These two rules can be viewed as schematizing a set of three context-free rules, namely, A--.BCD, andA – .DB C. Without a causativization metarule that can operate more than once, we might attempt to use the regular expression notation that solved the adverb problem.",
        "For example, we might postulate the ID rule VP NP* , V , ease* with the LP relation NP < V < ease, but no matching of NPs with eases is achieved.",
