        "But this isn't saying a whole lot; for they deploy very different set theories.",
        "Montague, for a variety of technical reasons, was very fond of MKM, a very powerful theory, countenancing huge collections.",
        "MKM allows for both sets and (proper) classes, the latter being collections too big to be elements of other collections, and too big to be sets, say, of ZF.",
        "It also provides an unnervingly powerful comprehension axiom.",
        "S&P, on the other hand, have at least provisionally adopted !CPU, a surprisingly weak set theory.",
        "Indeed, the vanilla version of KPU comes without an axiom of infinity and (more or less hence) has a model in the hereditarily finite sets.",
        "In that setting, even little infinite collections, like the universe of hereditarily finite sets, are proper classes, and beyond the pale.",
        "Enough for the moment of set theory, although we shall have to return to this strange land for one more brief visit.",
        "More important, and perhaps more disheartenigt mi silarities are immediately to hand.",
        "Montague and B&P - thus tar - restrict themselves to the declarative fragment of English; Montague, for the obvious reason that he was a model theorist and a student of Tarski.",
        "For such types, the crucial notion to be explicated is that of \"truth",
        "of a sentence on an interpretation\".",
        "Moreover, Montague showed no interest in the use(s) of language.",
        "Of course people working within his tradition are not debarred from doing so; but any such interest is an extra added attraction.",
        "The same point about model theory, broadly construed, holds for Barwise-Perry as well; they certainly aren't syntacticians.",
        "But in their case it is reinforced by philosophical considerations which point toward the use of language to convey information as the central use of language - hence, to asserting as the central kind of utterance or speech act.",
        "Thus, even when they narrow their sights to this one use, the notion that language is something to be put to various uses by humans to further certain of their purposes is not foreign to Situation Semantics.",
        "* Second, B&P (again: so far) stop short at the awesome boundary of the period.",
        "Here again, this was only to be expected; and here again, the crucial question is whether their overall philosophical perspective so informs their account of natural language as to enable a more fruitful accommodation of work on various aspects of extended discourse.",

        "After all, these new techniques - in the development of which Montague played a role - had precisely to do with the treatment of formal languages containing modal and other intensional constructions.",
        "What made a fragment of English of interest to Montague, then, was that it contained loads of such contexts.",

        "For the frying of said fish, a treatment of cognitive attitudes is essential.",
        "Moreover, and not independently, for any attempt to apply their overall philosophical picture to the semantics of natural language, the propositional attitude contexts pose a crucial and seemingly insuperable obstacle.",

        "The source of meaning and intentionality is to be found, rather, in the existence of lawlike regularities - constraints - among kinds of events.",
        "For Barwise-Perry, the analysis of meaning begins with such facts as that: smoke means fire or those moots memm measles.",
        "The ground of such facts lies in the ways of the world; in the regularities between event types in virtue of which events of one type can carry information about events of other types.",
        "If semantics is the theory of meaning, then there is no pun intended in the application of semantic notions to situations in which there is no use of language and, indeed, in which there are no minds.",
        "Meaning's natural home is the world, for meaning arises out of the regular relations that hold among situations, among bits of reality.",
        "We believe linguistic meaning should be seen within this general picture of a world teeming with meaning, a world full of information for organisms appropriately attuned to that meaning.",

        "Indeed, I assume many of you will simply want to wait until you can look at least at some treatment of some fragment of English.",
        "Others would like as well to get some idea of how the project of Situation Semantics might be realized computationally.",
        "For instance, it is clear even from what little I've said that the semantic values of various kinds of expression types are going to be quite different from the norm and much thought will be needed to specify a formalism for representing and manipulating these representations adequately.",
        "Again, wouldn't it be nice to be told something at least about the metaphysics of Situation Semantics, about situations, abstract, actual, factual and real - all four types figure in some way in the account; about events, event-types, courses-of-events, schema, etc?",
        "Yes it would be nice.",
        "Some, no doubt, were positively lusting after the scoop on how BAP handle the classic puzzles of intensionality with respect to singular terms.",
        "And so on.",
        "All in good time.",
        "What I want to do, instead, is to end with a claim, Barbara Grosz's claim in fact, that *On this point, compare, e.g., [221.",
        "I do not mean to imply that there aren't good reasons for denying the hyperintensionality of the propositional attitudes.",
        "There are.",
        "See [21] Still, no one doubts that such a position is counter-intuitive.",
        "**Actually, there is another big issue looming here, the one that hangs on BAP's opting for a treatment which takes properties and relations, intensionally conceived as primitive - instead, that is, of pretending that properties are functions from \"possible worlds\" into sets.",
        "Sets, of course, there are; but so too are there properties.",
        "attention should be paid.",
        "At the moment, the bottom line with respect to Situation Semantics is not, I think, to be arrived at by toting up technical details, as bedazzling as these will doubtless be.",
        "Rather, it is to be gotten at by attention precisely to THE BIG PICTURE.",
        "The relational theory of meaning, and more broadly, the centrality in Situation Semantics of the \"flow of information\" - the view that that part of this flow that is mediated by the uses of language should be seen as \"part and parcel of the general flow of information that uses natural meaning\" - allows reasoned hope for a theoretical framework within which work in pragmatics and the theory of speech acts, as well research in the theory of discourse, can find a proper place.",
        "In many of these areas, there is an abundance of insight, harvested from close descriptive analyses of a wide range of phenomena - a range hitherto hidden from both orthodox linguists and philosophers.",
        "There are now even glimmerings of regularities.",
        "But there has been no overarching theoretical structure within which to systematize these insights and those scattered regularities, and through which to relate them to the results of syntactic and formal semantic analyses.",
        "Situation Semantics may help us in developing such a framework.",
        "This last is a good point at which to stop; so I shall."
