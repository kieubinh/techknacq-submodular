        "Consider the sentence In most democratic countries most politicians can fool most of the people on almost every issue most of the time.",
        "In the currently standard ways of representing quantification in logical form, this sentence has 120 different readings, or quantifier scopings.",
        "Moreover, they are truly distinct, in the sense that for any two readings, there is a model that satisfies one and not the other.",
        "With the standard logical forms produced by the syntactic and semantic translation components of current theoretical frameworks and implemented systems, it would seem that an inferencing component must process each of these 120 readings in turn in order to produce a best reading.",
        "Yet it is obvious that people do not entertain all 120 possibilities, and people really do understand the sentence.",
        "The problem is not just that inferencing is required for disambiguation.",
        "It is that people never do disambiguate completely.",
        "A single quantifier scoping is never chosen.",
        "(Van Lehn [1978] and Bobrow and Webber [1980] have also made this point.)",
        "In the currently standard logical notations, it is not clear how this vagueness can be represented.1 What is needed is a logical form for such sentences that is neutral with respect to the various scoping possibilities.",
        "It should be a notation that can be used easily by an inferencing component.",
        "That is, it should be easy to define deductive operations on it, and the logical forms of typical sentences should not be unwieldy.",
        "Moreover, when the inferencing component discovers further information about dependencies among sets of entities, it should entail only a minor modification in the logical form, such as conjoining a new proposition, rather than a major restructuring.",
        "Finally, since the notion of \"scope\" is a powerful tool in semantic analysis, there should be a fairly transparent relationship between dependency information in the notation and standard representations of scope.",
        "Three possible approaches are ruled out by these criteria.",
        "1.",
        "Representing the sentence as a disjunction of the various readings.",
        "This is impossibly unwieldy.",
        "Many people feel that most sentences exhibit too few quantifier scope ambiguities for much effort to be devoted to this problem, but a casual inspection of several sentences from any text should convince almost everyone otherwise.",
        "2.",
        "Using as the logical notation a triple consisting of an expression of the propositional content of the sentence, a store of quantifier structures (e.g., as in Cooper [1975], Woods [1978]), and a set of constraints on how the quantifier structures could be unstored.",
        "This would adequately capture the vagueness, but it is difficult to imagine defining inference procedures that would work on such an object.",
        "Indeed, Cooper did no inferencing; Woods did little and chose a default reading heuristically before doing so.",
        "3.",
        "Using a set – theoretic notation like that of (1) below, pushing all the universal quantifiers to the outside and the existential quantifiers to the inside, and replacing the existentially quantified variables by Skolem",
        "functions of all the universally quantified variables.",
        "Then when inferencing discovers a nondependency, one of the arguments is dropped from one of the Skolem functions.",
        "One difficulty with this is that it yields representations that are too general, being satisfied by models that correspond to none of the possible intended interpretations.",
        "Moreover, in sentences in which one quantified noun phrase syntactically embeds another (what Woods [1978] calls \"functional nesting\"), as in Every representative of a company arrived.",
        "no representation that is neutral between the two is immediately apparent.",
        "With wide scope, \"a company\" is existential, with narrow scope it is universal, and a shift in commitment from one to the other would involve significant restructuring of the logical form.",
        "The approach taken here uses the notion of the \"typical element\" of a set, to produce a flat logical form of conjoined atomic predications.",
        "A treatment has been worked out only for monotone increasing determiners; this is described in Section 2.",
        "In Section 3 some ideas about other determiners are discussed.",
        "An inferencing component, such as that explored in Hobbs [1976, 1980], capable of resolving coreference, doing coercions, and refining predicates, will be assumed (but not discussed).",
        "Thus, translating the quantifier scoping problem into one of those three processes will count as a solution for the purposes of this paper.",
        "This problem has received little attention in linguistics and computational linguistics.",
        "Those who have investigated the processes by which a rich knowledge base is used in interpreting texts have largely ignored quantifier ambiguities.",
        "Those who have studied quantifiers have generally noted that inferencing is required for",
        "disambiguation, without attempting to provide a notation that would accommodate this inferencing.",
        "There are some exceptions.",
        "Bobrow and Webber [1980] discuss many of the issues involved, but it is not entirely clear what their proposals are.",
        "The work of Webber (1978] and Mellish (1980] are discussed below."

        "Then \"of(A,f(A))\" and \"of(B,f(B))\" are both true, so that \"of(r(R),f(r(R)))\" is also true.",
        "Thus we have the following identifications: c f(r(R)) .1t({X,Y}), rs R, r .r(R) In Figure 2(b) \"of(B,y)\" and \"of(C,Y)\" are both true, so \"of(2-(R1),Yris also.",
        "Thus we may let c be Y and rs be R1, giving us the wide reading for \"a company\".",
        "In the case where no one represents any company and no one arrived, we can let c be anything and rs be the empty set.",
        "Since, by the definition of dr , any predicate indexed by the empty set will be true of the typical element of the empty set, \"arrive 9, (2-(#))- will be true, and the sentence will be satisfied.",
        "It is worth pointing out that this approach solves the problem of the classic \"donkey sentences\".",
        "If in sentence (14) we had had the verb phrase \"hates it\", then \"it\" would be resolved to c, and thus to whatever c was resolved to.",
        "So Ear the notation of typical elements and dependency functions has been introduced; it has been shown how scope information can be represented by these means; and an example of inferential processing acquiring that scope information has been given.",
        "Now the precise relation of this notation to standard notation must be specified.",
        "This can be done by means of an algorithm that takes the inferential notation, together with an indication of which proposition is asserted by the sentence, and produces in the conventional form all of the readings consistent with the known dependency information.",
        "First we must put the sentence into what will be called a \"bracketed notation\".",
        "We associate with each variable v an indication of the corresponding quantifier; this is determined from such pieces of the inferential logical form as those involving the predicates \"set\" and \"most\"; This may be read \"An r such that r is a representative and r is of a c such that c is a company sees an s such that s is a sample.",
        "The nondeterministic algorithm below generates all the scopings from the bracketed notation.",
        "The function TOPBVS returns a list of all the top – level bracketed variables in Form, that is, all the bracketed variables except those within the brackets of some other variable -- in (18) r and s but not c. BRANCH nondeterministically generates a separate process for each element in a list it is given as argument.",
