        "Planning provides the basis for a theory of language generation that considers the communicative goals of the speaker when producing utterances.",
        "One central problem in designing a system based on such a theory is specifying the requisite linguistic knowledge in a form that interfaces well with a planning system and allows for the encoding of discourse information.",
        "The TELEGRAM (TELEological GRAmmar) system described in this paper solves this problem by annotating a unification grammar with assertions about how grammatical choices are used to achieve various goals, and by enabling the planner to augment the functional description of an utterance as it is being unified.",
        "The control structures of the planner and the grammar unifier are then merged in a manner that makes it possible for general planning to be guided by unification of a particular functional description."

        "By viewing language generation as a planning process, one can not only account for the way people use language to satisfy different goals they have in mind, but also model the broad interaction between a speaker's physical and linguistic actions.",
        "Formal models of planing can provide the basis for a theory of language generation in which communicative goals play a central role.",
        "Recent research in natural-language generation (11121 has established the feasibility of regarding planning as the basis for the generation of utterances.",
        "This paper examines some of the problems involved in devising a grammar formalism for such a generation system that produces utterances and describes a particular implementation of a unification grammar, referred to as TELEGRAM, that solves some of these problems.",
        "The KAN1P system [1] was designed with the problems of multiple-goal satisfaction and the integration of physical and linguistic actions in mind.",
        "KAMP is a multiagent planning system that can be given a high-level description This research was supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant NICS-8115105, The author is grateful to Barbara Grosz for helpful comments on earlier drafts of this paper.",
        "of an agent's goals, and then produce a plan that includes the performance of both physical and linguistic actions by several agents that will achieve the agent's goals.",
        "In the development of KAMP it was recognized that syntactic, semantic and pragmatic knowledge sources are necessary for the planning of utterances.",
        "These sources of knowledge were stored independently inside the system: a grammar was provided in addition to the axioms that constitute the agent's knowledge of the pragmatics of communication.",
        "However, rather than have one process that decides what to say, drawing on knowledge about the world and about communication, plus another independant process that.",
        "decides how to encode that knowledge into English, kAmP employs a single process that uses both sources of knowledge to produce plans.",
        "The primary focus of the research on KAMP was the representation and integration of the knowledge needed to make plans involving utterances.",
        "One area that was neglected was the representation of grammatical knowledge.",
        "KAMP relies on a very simple grammar composed of context-free rules that enable it to generate simple sentences.",
        "Such phenomena as gapping are totally outside of its cap5bility.",
        "Because of the ad hoc nature of the representation, modifications and extensions of its linguistic coverage are very difficult.",
        "Another criticism of KAMP'S approach was that there was no obvious way to control the planning process.",
        "Instead of formulating a plan quickly.",
        "KAMP would search a large space of linguistic alternatives until it found an \"optimal\" solution.",
        "As some critics have pointed out, (e.g., [5() such exhaustive planning is often not needed in practical situations – and is certainly not how people produce utterances in real time.",
        "KAMP would never produce an ungrammatical sentence, because it could always do unlimited backtracking after making an incorrect decision.",
        "The remainder of this paper describes how to use a unification grammar to address these two problems of representation and control."

        "A unification grammar characterizes linguistic entities • Unification grammar has often been referred to as functional grammar in the literature, e.g., 171, 1111.",
        "It is related to and shares many ideas with h systemic grammar 161.",
        "by collections of features called a functional description (FDs).",
        "Each of the features in an FD has a value that can be either atomic or another functional description.",
        "A unification grammar is a large FD that characterizes the features of every possible sentence in the language.",
        "In this paper, the FD that characterizes the intended utterance is called the text FD and the FD that constitutes the grammar is called the grammar FD.",
        "The most salient feature of unification grammar that distinguishes it from other grammatical formalisms is its emphasis on linguistic function.",
        "All of the features used by the grammar have equal status, with functional and discourse-related features like topic and focus sharing equal status with grammatical roles like subject and predicate, and with syntactic categories like NP and VP.",
        "Unification grammars are particularly well suited for language generation because they allow the encoding of discourse features in the grammar.",
        "A functional description can be constructed incorporating these features, and the syntactic details of the final utterance can then be specified through unification with the grammar FD.",
        "The process that constructs the text FD can treat it as a high-level blueprint fleshed out by unification, thereby relieving the high-level process of the need to consider low-level grammatical details.",
        "This strategy was used by McKeown (ill. Two functional descriptions can be unified by an algorithm that is similar to set union.",

        "If vl and v2 are functional descriptions, then va = V1 e If any one of the above conditions fails, then the unification itself fails and the value of F1 09 F2 is undefined.",
        "Functional descriptions can optionally contain a distinguished feature called PATTERN that is used to specify the surface order of constituents in the FD.",
        "The unification of two patterns is different in that it is based on deciding whether or not the orderings represented by the two patterns are consistent.",
        "In spite of its advantages, there are some serious problems with unification grammar if it is employed straightforwardly in a language planning system.",
        "One of the most serious problems is the inefficiency of the unificati,,^ ^Igo-rithm as described above.",
        "A straightforward application of that algorithm is very expensive, consuming an order-of-magnitude more time in the unification process than in the entire planning process leading up to the construction of the text FD [111.",
        "The problem is not simply one of efficiency.",
        "of implementation.",
        "It is inherent in any algorithm that searches alternatives blindly and thereby does work that is exponentially related to the number of alternatives in the grammar.",
        "Any solution to the problem must be a conceptual one that minimizes the number of alternatives that ever have to be considered.",
        "Another problem is that the text FD is not as high-level a blueprint as is really needed because every feature related to the speaker's intention to communicate must be part of the text FD when unification takes place.",
        "This implies, for example, that every descriptor that is part of a referring expression must be specified in advance.",
        "This may be unnecessary because for certain grammatical choices, the referring expression may be eliminated entirely.",
        "For example, in the by-phrase in a passive sentence, reference may be made pronominally (or not at all), in which case descriptors are unnecessary.",
        "Since the planner must know the linguistic context when planning descriptors, a noun-phrase FD is best.",
        "constructed initially with a REFERENT feature, and later expanded by adding features that correspond to the descriptors.",

        "Therefore, if a planner were to decide whether or not to perform action subsumption, it would have to know in advance how a referent was going to be realized.",
        "If this were to be performed before unification, the planner would have to have the detailed linguistic knowledge to know that it was possible.",
