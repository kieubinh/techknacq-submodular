        "It is common practice in speech research to distinguish acoustic/phonetic properties that vary a great deal with context (e.g., release and aspiration) from those that are relatively invariant to context (e.g., place, manner and voicing).2 In the past, the emphasis has been on invariants; allophonic variation is traditionally seen as problematic for recognition.",
