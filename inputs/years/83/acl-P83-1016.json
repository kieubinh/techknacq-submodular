        "As we know, such a grammar is bound to exhibit a high degree of redundancy and, consequently, is not the right formalism for encoding many of the linguistic generalizations a framework for natural language is expected to express.",
        "However, the presumption is that it, is possible to give a condensed inductive definition of the CF-PS grammar, which contains various components for encoding the linguistic regularities and which can be interpreted as a metagrammar, i.e.. a grammar for generating the actual CF-PS grammar.",
        "A GPSG can be defined as a two-level grammar containing a met agrammar and an object grammar.",
        "The object grammar combines (CF-PS) syntax and model-theoretic semantics.",
        "Its rules are ordered triples (n. r. t) where n is an integer (the rule number), r is a CF-PS rule, and I is the translation of the rule, its denotation represented in some version of intensional logic.",
        "The translation I is actually an operation that.",
        "maps the translation of the children nodes into the translation of the parent.",
        "The nonterminals of r are complex symbols, subsets of a finite set of syntactic features or - as in the latest version of the theory (Gazd:o. and Pullum, 1982) - feature trees of finite size.",
        "The rules of the object grammar are interpreted as tree-admissability condit ions.",

Another component maps IDR doubles to 1DR triples, which are ordered triples (n,i,t) of a rule number n, an [DR 1, and a translation t. The symbols of the resulting IDRs are fully instantiated feature sets (or structures) and therefore identical to object grammar symbols.",
        "Thus, this component adds semantic translations and instantiates syntactic features.",
        "The mapping is controlled by a third set of rule extension principles including feature co-occurrence restrictions, feature debult principles, and an algorithm that assigns the right kind of translation to each rule on the basis of its syntactic information.",
        "The last component of the metagrammar maps the IDR triples to the rules of the object grammar.",
        "For each [DR triple all the object grammar triples are generated whose CF-PS rules conform with the linear precedence(LP) rules, the fourth rule set of the metagrammar.",
        "LP rules are members of the LP relation, a partial ordering on VT U VN.",

        "For this purpose, metarules, which are the second kind of rules are applied to basic rules and then to the output of metarule applications to generate more 1DR doubles.",

        "The metarule can be read as: If there is an [DR double of kind A, then there is also an [DR double of kind B.",
        "In each case the rule number is copied from A to B.' Several metarules can apply in the derivation of a single IDR double; however, the principle of Finite Closure, defined by Thompson (1982), allows every metarule to apply only once in the derivational history of each IDR double.",
        "The invocation of this principle avoids the derivation of infinite rule sets, in-number might be a misleading term for n because this copying assigns the same integer to the whole class of rules that were derived from the Fame basic rules.",
