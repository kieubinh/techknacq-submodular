        "Bell Laboratories Murray Hill, New Jersey 07974 Linguists, including computational linguists, have always been fond of talking about trees.",
        "In this paper, we outline a theory of linguistic structure which talks about talking about trees; we call this theory Description theory (D-theory).",
        "While important issues must be resolved before a complete picture of D-theory emerges (and also before we can build programs which utilize it), we believe that this theory will ultimately provide a framework for explaining the syntax and semantics of natural language in a manner which is intrinsically computational.",
        "This paper will focus primarily on one set of motivations for this theory, those engendered by attempts to handle certain syntactic phenomena within the framework of deterministic parsing.",
        "1.",
        "D-Theory: An Introduction",
        "The key idea of D-theory is that a syntactic analysis of a sentence of English (or other natural language) consists of a description of its syntactic structure.",
        "Such a description contains information which differs from that contained in a standard tree structure in two crucial ways: 1) The primitive predicate for indicating hierarchical structure in a D-theory description is \"dominates\" rather than \"directly dominates\".",
        "(A node A is said to dominate a node B if A is some ancestor of B; A is said to directly dominate B if A is the immediate parent of B.)",
        "A D-theory analysis thus expresses directly only what structures are contained (somewhere) within larger structures, but does indicate per se what the immediate constituents of any particular constituent are.",
        "A tree structure, on the other hand, encodes which nodes are directly dominated by other nodes in the analysis; it indicates directly the immediate constituents of each node.",
        "In a standard parse tree, the topmost S node might directly dominate exactly a Noun Phrase node, an Aux node and a Verb Phrase node; it is thus made up of three subparts: that NP, that Aux, and that VP.",
        "2) A D-theory description uses names to make statements about entities, and does not contain the entities themselves.",
        "Furthermore, there is no distinguished set of names which are taken to be standard names or rigid designators; i.e. given only a name, one cannot tell what particular syntactic entity it refers to.",
        "(This is the primary reason that we view D-theory representations as descriptions and not merely as directed acyclic graphs.)",
        "Because there are no standard names, if one is presented with two descriptions, each in terms of a different name, one can tell with certainty only if the two names refer to different entities, but never (for sure) if they refer to the same entity.",
        "In the latter case, there is always potential ambiguity.",
        "To take a commonplace example, given that \"John has red hair\" and \"Mr. Jones has black hair\", one can be sure that John is not Mr. Jones.",
        "But if one is told \"John has red hair\" and \"Mr. Jones wears glasses\" and nothing more about either John or Mr. Jones, then it is impossible to tell whether John is or is not Mr. Jones.",
        "In the domain of syntax, if a D-theory description says that X is an NP; Z is an NP Y is an Adjective Phrase W is a noun"

        "and nothing else is stated about W, X, Y or Z, then it cannot be determined whether X and Z are aliases for the same NP node or are names for two distinct nodes.",
        "If an additional statement is added to the description that 'Y dominates Z\", then it must be the case that X and Z name distinct entities.",
        "We will show in what follows that the use of names has important ramifications for linguistic theory and the theory of parsing.",
        "The structure of the rest of this paper is roughly as follows: We will first sketch the computational framework we build on, in essence that of [Marcus 80], and explore briefly what a parser for this kind of grammar might look like; in appearance, its data structures and grammar will be little different from that developed in [Berwick 82].",
        "A series of syntactic phenomena will then be explored which resist elegant account within the earlier framework.",
        "For each phenomenon, we will present a simple D-theoretic solution together with exposition of the relevant aspects of D-theory.",
        "One final introductory comment: That D-theory expresses syntactic structure in terms of dominance rather than direct dominance may be reminiscent of [Lasnik & Kupin 19771 (henceforth L-K), but our use of the dominance predicate differs fundamentally from the L-K formulation both in the primacy of the predicate to the theory, and in the theory of syntax implied.",
        "Lasnik and Kupin's formalization of the Extended Standard Theory derives domination relations from their primary representation of linguistic structure, namely a set of strings of terminals and nonterminals with specified properties.",
        "D-theory Structures are expressed directly in terms of dominance relations; the linear order of constituents is only directly expressed for items in the lexical string.",
        "Despite appearances, D-theory and the Lasnik-Kupin formalization are not inter-definable.",
        "We discuss the properties of the Lasnik-Kupin formalization at length in a forthcoming paper."

      "text": [
        "0-theory grows out of earlier work on deterministic parsing as deterministic tree building (as in e.g. (Marcus 19801, (Church 801 and (Berwick 821).",
        "The essence of that work is the hypothesis that natural language can be analyzed by some process which builds a syntactic analysis indelibly (borrowing a term from (McDonald 831); i.e. that any structure built by the parser is part of the correct analysis of the input.",
        "Again, in the context of this earlier theory, the form of the indelible syntactic analysis was that of a tree.",
        "One key idea of this earlier tree-building theory that we retain is the notion that a natural language parser can buffer and examine some small number (e.g. up to three) unattached constituents before being forced to add to its existing structures.",
        "(In 0-theory, the node named X is attached to Y if the parser's description of the existing structure includes a predication of the form \"Y dominates X\", or, as we will henceforth write, \"D(Y,X).\" X is unattached if the parser's description of the existing structure includes no predication of the form \"D(Y, X)\", for any name Y.)",
        "We thus assume that such a parser will have the two principle data structures of these earlier deterministic parsers, a stack and a buffer.",
        "However, the stack and the buffer in a D-theory parser will contain names rather than constituents, and these data structures will be augmented by a data base where the description of the syntactic structure itself is built up by the parser.",
        "(While this might sound novel, a moment's reflection on LISP implementation techniques should assure the reader that this structure is far less different from that of older parsers like Parsifal and Fidditch (Hindle 831 than it might sound.)",
        "As we shall see below, however, a parser which embodies ID-theory can recover (in some sense) from some of the constructions which would terminally confuse (or \"garden path\") a parser based on the deterministic tree-building theory.",
        "For D-theory to be psychologically valid, of course, it must be the case that just those constructions which do garden path a D-theory parser garden path people as well.",
        "(We might note in passing that recent experimental paradigms which explore online syntactic processing using eye-tracking technology promise to provide delicate tests of these hypotheses, e.g. (Rayner & Frazier 831.)",
        "Another goal of this earlier work was to find some way of procedurally representing grammars of natural languages which is brief and perspicuous, and which allows (and perhaps even forces) grammatical generalizations to be stated in a natural way.",
        "As is often argued, such a representation must be embodied by our language understanding faculty, given that the grammar of a language is learned incrementally and quickly by children given only limited evidence.",
        "(To recast this point from an engineering point of view, this property is also a prerequisite to writing a â€¢ grammar for a subset of some given natural language which remains extensible, so that new constructions can be added to the grammar without global changes, and so that these new constructions will interact robustly with the old grammar.)",
        "Following [Shipman 781, as refined in (Berwick 821. we assume that the grammar is organized into a set of context free rules, which we will call base templates, and a set of pattern-action rules.",
        "As in Parsifal, each pattern consists of up to four elements, each of which is a partial description of an element in the buffer, or the accessible node in the stack (the \"current active node\").",
        "Loosely following [Berwick 821, we assume that the action of each rule consists of exactly one of some small set of limited actions which might include the following:",
        "â€¢ Attach a node in the buffer to the current active node.",
        "â€¢ Switch the nodes in the first two buffer positions.",
        "â€¢ Insert a specified lexical item into a specified buffer slot.",
        "â€¢ Create a new current active node.",
        "â€¢ Insert an empty NP into the first buffer slot.",
        "(Where \"attachment\" is as defined above, and \"create\" means something like coin a new node name, and push it onto the active node stack.)",
        "Each rule is associated with some position in one of the base templates.",
        "So, for example, in figure I below, one base template is given, a highly simplified template for a sentence.",
        "Associated with the NP in the subject position of the sentence are several rules.",
        "The first rule says that if the first buffer position holds a name which is asserted to be an NP (informally: if there is an NP in the first buffer slot), then (informally) it is dominated by the S. The second says that if there is an auxiliary verb in the first slot followed by an NP, then switch them.",
        "And so on.",
        "Note that while a D-theory parser itself has no predicate with which to express direct dominance, the base templates explicitly encode just such information.",
        "Insofar as the parser makes its assertions of dominance on the basis of the phrase structure rules, the parser will behave very similarly to deterministic tree",
        "building parsers.",

        "Some of these phenomena are particular problems for the deterministic tree-building framework.",
        "Others, for example coordination and gapping phenomena, have defied adequate explication within any existing theory of grammar.",
        "In the remainder of this paper we will explore a range of such phenomena, and argue that D-theory provides a consistent approach which yields simple accounts for the range of phenomena we have considered to date.",
        "We will first argue for taking \"dominates\", not \"directly dominates\" as primitive, and then later argue why the use of names is justified.",
        "(Our view that this representation should be viewed as a description hangs on the use of names.",
        "In this section and in section 5 we argue only for a representation which is a particular kind of directed acyclic graph.",
        "Only with the arguments of section 7 is the position that this is a kind of description at all defensible.)",
        "One particularly interesting class of sentences which seems to defy deterministic accounts is exemplified by (2).",
        "(2) I drove my aunt from Peoria's car.",
        "Sentences like (2) contain a constituent which has a misleading leading edge\", an initial right-embedded subconstituent which could itself be the next constituent of whatever structure is being built at the next level up.",
        "For example, while analyzing (2), a parser which deterministically builds old-fashioned trees might just take \"my aunt\" to be the object of \"drove\", attaching it as the object of the VP, only to discover (too late) that this phrase functions instead as genitive determiner of the full NP \"my aunt from Peoria's car\".",
        "In fact, the existing grammar for Parsifal causes exactly this behavior, and for good reason: This parser constructs NPs only up to the head noun .before deciding on their role within the larger context: only after attaching an NP will Parsifal construct the post-modifiers of the NP and attach them, (This involves a mechanism called node reactivation; it is described in [Shipman & Marcus 791.)",
        "One reason for this within the earlier framework is that, given a PP which immediately follows the head of an NP, it cannot be determined whether that PP should be attached to the preceding NP or to some constituent which dominates the NP until the role of that NP itself has been determined.",
        "In the specific case of (2), the parser will attach \"my aunt\" as the object of the verb \"drove\" so that it can decide where to attach the PP beginning with \"from\".",
        "Only after it is too late will the parser see the genitive marker on \"Peoria's\" and boggle.",
        "While one could attempt to overcome this particular motivation for the two-stage parsing of NPs with some variant of the notion of pseudo-attachment (first used in [Church 801), this and related approaches have their problems too, as Church notes.",
        "Potential pseudo-attachment solutions aside, the upshot is that sentences like (2) will cause deterministic tree building parsers to garden path.",
        "However, it is our strong intuition that such cases are not \"garden paths\"; we believe that such cases should be analyzed correctly by a deterministic parser rather than by the (putative) mechanism which recovers from garden paths.",
        "The D-theoretic solution to the problem of misleading leading edges\" hinges on one formal property of this problem: The initial analysis of this class of examples is incorrect only in that some constituent is attached in the parse tree at a higher point in the surrounding structure than is correct.",
        "Crucially, the parser neither creates structures of the wrong kind nor does it attach the structure that it builds to some structure which does not dominate it.",
        "In the misanalysis of (2), the parser initially errs only in attaching the NP \"my aunt\", which is indeed dominated by the VP whose head is \"drove\", too high in the structure.",
        "This class of examples is handled by D-theory without difficulty exactly because syntactic analyses are expressed in terms of domination rather than direct domination.",
        "The developing description of the structure of (2) in a D-theory parser at the point at which the parser had analyzed \"my aunt\", but no further, might include the following predications:",
        "(3.1) D(vpl, npl) (3.2) D(vpl, v1)",
        "where the verb node named v1 dominates \"drove\", and the NP node named npl dominates the lexical material \"my aunt\".",
        "Let us assume for the sake of simplicity that while building the PP \"from Peoria's\", the parser detects a genitive marker on the proper noun \"Peoria's\" and knows (magically, for now) that \"Peoria's car\" is not the correct analysis.",
        "Given this, the genitive must mark the entire NP \"my aunt from Peoria\" and thus \"my aunt from Peoria\" must serve not as the object of the verb \"drove\" but as the determiner of some larger NP which itself must be the object of \"drove\".",
        "(Unless it is followed by a genitive marker, in which case....) The question we are centrally interested in here is not how the parser comes to the realization that it has erred, but rather what can be done to remedy the situation.",

        "Given the predications in (5), (3.1) is redundant, but it is not false.",
        "The general point is this: D-theory allows nodes to be attached initially by a parser to some point which will turn out to be higher than its lowest point of attachment (for the more general sense of attachment defined above) without such initial states causing the parser to garden path.",

        "We assume that semantic interpretation of a D-theory analysis is done by taking such an analysis as describing the minimal tree possible, i.e. by taking \"D\" to mean directly dominates wherever possible but only for semantic analysis.",
        "For example.",
        "if the analysis of a structure includes the predications that X dominates Y, Y dominates Z and X also dominates Z. then the semantic interpreter will assume that X directly dominates Y and that Y directly dominates Z.",
        "We will call such an interpretation of a D-theoretic analysis the standard referent of the analysis.",
        "(We further assume that the description produced by a D-theory parser will have at each stage of the analysis one and only one standard referent, and the complex situation where two or more chains of domination Must be merged to arrive at a single standard referent will not arise in the operation of a D-theory parser.",
        "Substantiation of these assumptions awaits the construction of a parser and a sizable grammar.)",
        "This notion of \"standard referent\" means that adding predications to the (partial) analysis of a sentence may very well",
        "change the standard referent of that analysis as viewed by the semantic interpreter.",
        "The key idea here is that from the point of view of semantics, the structure built by the parser may appear to change, but from the parser's point of view, the description remains indelible.",
        "The situation we describe is not far from that which occurs as the usual case in the communication of descriptions of objects between individuals.",
        "Suppose Don says to you, standing before you wearing a brown tweed jacket, \"My coat is too warm\".",
        "The phrase \"my coat\" can refer to any coat that Don owns, yet you will undoubtedly take the phrase to refer to the brown tweed jacket.",
        "Given that descriptions are always necessarily partial, there must always be a conventional standard referent for a description.",
        "But now suppose that Don says \"My blue coat is too warm\".",
        "He merely adds \"blue\" to the phrase \"my coat\", but the set of possible referents changes, and in fact shrinks.",
        "More to the point, you will now take the referent of the phrase \"my blue coat\" to mean some blue coat or other which Don owns; i.e. adding to the description changes the standard referent.",
        "The key notion here is that because descriptions are always underspecified, there must be some set of conventions for choosing the intended single referent out of the often large (and sometimes infinite) class of objects that any given description is true of.",
        "Thus, once we claim that the output of syntactic analysis is a description, it is not surprising that there must be some restrictive conventions to determine exactly what such a description refers to.",

        "Instead,.",

        "As viewed from the point of view of the standard referent, we believe that a D-theory parser will appear to operate, by and large, just like a tree building deterministic parser, until it creates some structure whose standard referent must be changed.",
        "From the parser's point of view, it will scan base templates left-to-right for the most part, initiating some in a top-down manner, some in a bottom-up manner, until it finds itself unable to fill the next template slot somehow or other.",

        "When higher cognitive processing of this description requires distinguishing at what level the structures are conjoined, pragmatics can be invoked where needed, but there need be no interaction with syntactic processes themselves.",
        "This is because, once again, it turns out if it is syntactically possible that structures should be conjoined at a lower level than that initially posited, the names of the potentially separate constituents simply can be viewed as aliases of the one node that does exist in the corresponding standard referent; in this case all predications about whatever node is named by the alias remain true, and thus once again no predications need to be revoked.",
        "We now see how it is that D-theory gives an account of the intuition that the fine structure of coordinations in vague, in the sense of VanLehn.",
        "For we have seen that pragmatics does not need to determine whether (e.g.) all the fruits in (11.1) are ripe or not for the syntactic analysis to be completed deterministically, exactly because the D-theory analysis leaves all (and, we also claim, only) the syntactically correct possibilities open.",
        "Thus the description given in (12) is appropriately vague between possible syntactic analyses of sentences like those schematized in (11.3).",
        "Thus, this new representation opens the way for a simple formal expression of the notion that some sentences may be vague in certain well defined ways, even though they are believed to be understood, and that this vagueness may not be resolved until a hearer's attention is called to the unresolved decision."
