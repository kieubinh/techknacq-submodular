      "text": [
        "A knowledge-based report generator is a computer program whose function â€¢ is to generate natural language summaries from computer databases.",
        "For example, knowledge-based report generators can be designed to generate daily stock market reports from a stock quotes database, daily weather reports from a meteorological database, weekly sales reports from corporate databases, or quarterly economic reports from U. S. Commerce Department databases, etc.",
        "A separate generator must be implemented for each domain of discourse because each knowledge-based report generator contains domain-specific knowledge which is used to infer interesting messages from the database and to express those messages in the sublanguage of the domain of discourse.",
        "The technique of knowledge-based report generation is generalizable across domains, however, and the actual text generation component of the report generator, which comprises roughly one-quarter of the code, is directly transportable and readily tailorable.",
        "Knowledge-based report generation is a practical approach to text generation.",
        "It's three fundamental tenets are the following.",
        "First, it assumes that much domain-specific semantic, linguistic, and rhetoric knowledge is required in order for a computer to automatically produce intelligent and fluent text.",
        "Second, it assumes that production system languages, such as those used to build expert systems, are well-suited to the task of representing and integrating semantic, linguistic, and rhetoric knowledge.",
        "Finally, it holds that macro-level knowledge units, such as whole semantic messages, a phrasal lexicon, clausal grammatical categories, and a clause-combining grammar, provide an appropriate level of knowledge representation for generating that type of text which may be categorized as periodic summary reports.",
        "These three tenets guide the design and implementation of a knowledge-based report generation system."

        "Figure 1 depicts a portion of the actual data submitted to Ana for January 12, 1983.",

        "In order to generate accurate and fluent summaries, a knowledge-based report generator performs two main tasks: first, it infers semantic messages from the data in the database; second, it maps those messages into phrases in its phrasal lexicon, stitching them together according to the rules of its clause-combining grammar, and incorporating rhetoric constraints in the process.",
        "As the work of McKeown 1 and Mann and Moore2 demonstrates.",
        "neither the problem of deciding what to say nor the problem of determining how to say it is trivial, and as Appelt3 has pointed out, the distinction between them is not always clear."

      "heading": "A. System Architecture",
      "text": [
        "A knowledge-based report generator consists of the following four independent, sequential components: 1) a fact generator, 2) a message generator, 3) a discourse organizer, and 4) a text generator.",
        "Data from the database serves as input to the first module, which produces a stream of facts as output; facts serve as input to the second module, which produces a set of messages as output; messages form the input to the third module, which organizes them and produces a set of ordered messages as output; ordered messages form the input to the fourth module, which produces final text as output.",
        "The modules function independently and sequentially for the sake of computational manageability at the expense of psychological validity.",
        "With the exception of the first module, which is a straightforward C program, the entire system is coded in the OPS5 production system language.4 At the time that the sample output above was generated, module 2, the message generator, consisted of 120 production rules; module 3, the discourse organizer contained 16 production rules; and module 4, the text generator, included 109 production rules and a phrasal dictionary of 519 entries.",
        "Real time processing requirements for each module on a lightly loaded VAX 11/780 processor were the following: phase 1 - 16 seconds, phase 2 - 34 seconds, phase 3 - 24 seconds, phase 4 - 1 minute, 59 seconds.",
        "B.",
        "Knowledge Constructs The fundamental knowledge constructs of the system are of two types: 1) static knowledge structures, or memory elements, which can be thought of as n-dimensional propositions, and 2) dynamic knowledge structures, or production rules, which perform pattern-recognition operations on n-dimensional propositions.",
        "Static knowledge structures come in five flavors: facts.",
        "messages, lexicon entries, medial text elements, and various control elements.",
        "Dynamic knowledge constructs occur in ten varieties: inference productions, ordering productions, discourse mechanics productions, phrase selection productions, syntax selection productions, anaphora selection productions, verb morphology productions, punctuation selection productions.",
        "writing productions, and various control productions.",
        "C. Functions The function of the first module is to perform the arithmetic computation required to produce facts that contain the relevant information needed to infer interesting messages, and to write those facts in the OPS5 memory element format.",
        "For example, the fact that indicates the closing status of the Dow Jones Average of 30 Industrials for January 12, 1983 is: (make fact \"fname CLSTAT \"iname DJI ^itype COMPOS \"date 01/12 \"hour CLOSE \"openlevel 1084.25 \"high-level 1105.13 \"low-level 1075.88 \"close-level 1083.61 \"cumul-dir DN \"cumul-deg 0.18) The function of the second module is to infer interesting messages from the facts using inferencing productions such as the following:",
        "(p instan-mixedup (goal 'stat act 'op instanmixed) (fact \"fname CLSTAT iname DII \"cumul-dir UP ^repdate <date>) (fact \"fname ADVDEC \"iname NYSE \"advances <x> \"declines {<y> > <x>}) --> (make message \"top GENMKT \"subtop MIX \"mix mixed \"repdate <date> \"subjclass MKT \"tim close) (make goal \"stat pend \"op writemessage) (remove 1) This production infers that if the closing status of the Dow had a direction of 'up', and yet the number of declines exceeded the number of advances for the day, then it can be said that the market was mixed.",
        "The message that is produced looks like this: (make message \"repdate 01/12 \"top GENMKT \"subsubtop nil ^subtop MIX \"subjclass MKT \"dir nil 'deg nil \"vardeg I nil j\"varlev I nil I 'mix mixed \"chg nil \"sco nil \"tim close ^vartim I nil j \"dur nil \"vol nil \"who nil ) The inferencing process in phase 2 is hierarchically controlled.",
        "Module 3 performs the uncomplicated task of grouping messages into paragraphs, ordering messages within paragraphs, and assigning a priority number to each message.",
        "Priorities are assigned as a function of topic and subtopic.",
        "The system \"knows\" a default ordering sequence, and it \"knows\" some exception rules which assign higher priorities to messages of special significance, such as indicators hitting record highs.",
        "As in module 2, processing is hierarchically controlled.",
        "Eventually, modules 2 and 3 should be combined so that their knowledge could be shared.",
        "The most complicated processing is performed by module 4.",
        "This processing is not hierarchically controlled, but instead more closely resembles control in an ATN.",
        "Module 4, the text generator, coordinates and executes the following activities: 1) selection of phrases from the phrasal lexicon that both capture the semantic meaning of the message and satisfy rhetorical constraints; 2) selection of appropriate syntactic forms for predicate phrases, such as sentence, participial clause, prepositional phrase.",
        "etc.",
        "; 3) selection of appropriate anaphora for subject phrases 4) morphological processing of verbs; 5) interjection of appropriate punctuation; and 6) control of discourse mechanics, such as inclusion of more than one clause per sentence and more than one sentence per paragraph.",
        "The module 4 processor is able to coordinate and execute these activities because it incorporates and integrates the semantic, syntactic, and rhetoric knowledge it needs into its static and dynamic knowledge structures.",
        "For example, a phrasal lexicon entry that might match the \"mixed market\" message is the following: (make phraselex 'top GENMKT ^subtop MIX 'mix mixed ^chg nil ^tim close \"subjtype NAME ^subjclass MKT \"predfs turned \"predfpl turned \"predpart turning \"predinf to turn' \"predrem lin a mixed showingj ^len 9 'rand 5 'imp 11) An example of a syntax selection production that would select the syntactic form subordinate-participial-clause as an appropriate form for a phrase (as in \"after rising steadily through most of the morning\") is the following:",
        "Syntax selection productions, such as the example above, comprise a context-dependent, right-branching, clause-combining grammar.",
        "Because of the attribute-value, pattern-recognition nature of these grammar rules and their use of the lexicon, they may be viewed as a high-level variant of a lexical functional grammar.",
        "The efficacy of a low-level functional grammar for text generation has been demonstrated in McKeown's TEXT system.6 For each message.",
        "in sequence, the system first selects a predicate phrase that matches the semantic content of the message.",
        "and next selects a syntactic form, such as sentence or prepositional phrase, into which form the predicate phrase may be hammered.",
        "The system's default goal is to form complex sentences by combining a variable number of messages expressed in a variety of syntactic forms in each sentence.",
        "Every message may be expressed in the syntactic form of a simple sentence.",
        "But under certain grammatical and rhetorical conditions, which are specified in the syntax selection productions, and which sometimes include looking ahead at the next sequential message, the system opts for a different syntactic form.",
        "The right-branching behavior of the system implies that at any point the system has the option to lay down a period and start a new sentence.",
        "It also implies that embedded subject-complement forms, such as relative",
        "clauses modifying subjects, are trickier to implement (and have not been implemented as yet).",
        "That embedded subject complements pose special difficulties should not be considered discouraging.",
        "Developmental linguistics research reveals that \"operations on sentence subjects, including subject complementation and relative clauses modifying subjects\" are among the last to appear in the acquisition of complex sentences,7 and a knowledge-based report generator incorporates the basic mechanism for eventually matching messages to nominal-izations of predicate phrases to create subject complements, as well as the mechanism for embedding relative clauses."

        "How does one determine what knowledge must incorporated into a knowledge-based report generator?",
        "Because the goal of a knowledge-based report generator is to produce reports that are indistinguishable from reports written by people for the same database, it is logical to turn to samples of naturally generated text from the specific domain of discourse in order to gain insights into the semantic, linguistic, and rhetoric knowledge requirements of the report generator.",
        "Research in machine translation8 and text understanding9 has demonstrated that not only does naturally generated text disclose the lexicon and grammar of a sublanguage, but it also reveals the essential semantic classes and attributes of a domain of discourse, as well as the relations between those classes and attributes.",
        "Thus, samples of actual text may be used to build the phrasal dictionary for a report generator and to define the syntactic categories that a generator must have knowledge of.",
        "Similarly, the semantic classes, attributes and relations revealed in the text define the scope and variety of the semantic knowledge the system must incorporate in order to infer relevant and interesting messages from the database.",
        "Ana's phrasal lexicon consists of subjects, such as \"wall street's securities markets\", and predicates, such as \"were swept into a broad and steep decline\", which are extracted from the text of naturally generated stock reports.",
        "The syntactic categories Ana knows about are the clausal level categories that are found in the same text, such as, sentence, coordinate-sentence, subordinate-sentence, subordinate-participial-clause, prepositional-phrase, and others.",
        "Semantic analysis of a sample of natural text stock reports discloses that a hierarchy of approximately forty message classes accounts for nearly all of the semantic information contained in the \"core market sentences\" of stock reports.",
        "The term \"core market sentences\" was introduced by Kittredge to refer to those sentences which can be inferred from the data in the data base without reference to external events such as wars, strikes, and corporate or government policy making.\") Thus, for example, Ana could say \"Eastman Kodak advanced 2 3/4 to 85 3/4;\" but it could not append \"it announced development of the world's fastest color film for delivery in 1983.\".",
        "Ana currently has knowledge of only six message classes.",

        "A.",

        "In English, that production said: IF",
        "1) there is an active goal to select a syntactic form 2) the sentence requirement has not been satisfied 3) the message currently in focus has topic <t>, subject class <sc>, and some non-nil time 4) the next sequential message has the same topic, subject class, and some non-nil time 5) the subordinate-participial-clause parameter is set at value <set> 6) the current random number is less than <set> 7) the last syntactic form used was either a prepositional phrase or a sentence initializer 8) the opening syntactic form of the last sentence was not a subordinate sentence or a subordinate participial clause 9) the time attribute of the message in focus does not have value 'close' THEN 1) remove the goal of selecting a syntactic form 2) make the current syntactic form a subordinate participial clause 3) modify the next sequential message to put it in peripheral focus 4) set a goal to select a subordinating conjunction.",
        "It should be apparent from the explanation that the rule integrates semantic knowledge, such as message topic and time, syntactic knowledge, such as whether the sentence requirement has been satisfied, and rhetoric knowledge, such as the preference to avoid using subordinate clauses as the opening form of two consecutive sentences."

        "A value of 8, for example, would result in an 80 percent chance that the rule in which the parameter occurs would be satisfied if all its other conditions were satisfied.",
        "Consequently, on 20 percent of the occasions when the rule would have been otherwise satisfied, the syntactic form parameter would prevent the rule from firing, and the system would be forced to opt for a choice of some other syntactic form.",

        "And if not even a near match for a message can be found, the speaker must downshift into first gear and either construct a phrase from elementary lexical items, including words, prefixes, and suffixes, or reconstruct the message.",

        "Stock market reports are typical instances of a whole class of summary-type periodic reports for which the scope and variety of semantic and linguistic complexity is great enough to negate a straightforward algorithmic solution, but constrained enough to allow a high-level crosswise slice of the variety of knowledge to be effectively incorporated into a production system.",
        "Even so, it will be some time before the technique is cost effective.",
        "The time required to add knowledge to a system is greater than the time required to add productions to a traditional expert system.",

        "Coding itself goes quickly, but then the system must be tested and calibrated (if the guesses on the semantics were close) or redone entirely (if the guesses were not close).",
        "Still, the initial success of the technique suggests its value both as a basic research tool, for exploring increasingly more detailed semantic and linguistic processes, and as an applied research tool, for designing extensible and tailorable automatic report generators."
