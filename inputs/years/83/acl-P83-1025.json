        "Natural language discourse exhibits several intriguing phenomena that defy definitive linguistic analysis and general computational solutions.",
        "However, some progress has been made in developing tractable computational solutions to simplified version of phenomena such as ellipsis and anaphora resolution [20, 10, 21].",
        "This paper reviews discourse phenomena that arise in task-oriented dialogs with responsive agents (such as expert systems, rather than purely passive data base query systems), outlines the results of an empirical study, and presents our method for handling generalized ellipsis resolution in the XCALIBUR expert system interface.",
        "With the exception of inter-sentential metalanguage, and to a lesser degree extragrammaticality, the significance of the phenomena listed below have long been recognized and documented in the computational linguistics literature.",
        "• Anaphora -- Interactive task-oriented dialogs invite the use of anaphora.",
        "much more so than simpler data base query situations.",
        "• Definite noun phrases As Grosz [6] noted, resolving the referent of definite noun phrases requires an understanding of the Planning structure underlying cooperative discourse.",
        "• Ellipsis Sentential level ellipsis has long been",
        "recognized as ubiquitous in discourse.",
        "However, semantic ellipsis, where ellipsed information is manifest not as syntactically incomplete structures, but as semantically incomplete propositions, is also an important phenomenon.",
        "The ellipsis resolution method presented later in this paper addresses both kinds of ellipsis.",
        "• Extragrammatical utterances -- Interjections, dropped articles, false starts, misspellings, and other forms of grammatical deviance abound in our data (as explained in the following section).",
        "Developing robust parsing techniques that tolerate errors has been the focus of our earlier investigations [2, 9, 7] and remains high among our priorities.",
        "Other investigations on error-tolerant parsing include [13, 22].",
        "• Metalinguistic utterances -- Intra.sentential",
        "metalanguage has been investigated to some degree [15, 12], but its more common inter-sentential counterpart has received little attention [4].",
        "However, utterances about other utterances (e.g., corrections of previous commands, such as \"I meant to type X instead\" or \"I should have said ...\") are not infrequent in our dialogs, and we are making an initial stab at this problem [8].",
        "Note that it is a cognitively less demanding task for a user to correct a previous utterance than to repeat an explicit sequence of commands (or worse yet, to detect and undo explicitly each and every unwanted consequence of a mistaken command).",
        "• Indirect speech acts Occasionally users will resort to indirect speech acts [19.",
        "16.",
        "1], especially in connection with inter-sentential metalanguage or by stating a desired state of affairs and expecting the system to supply the sequence of actions necessary to achieve that state.",
        "In our prior work we have focused on extragrammaticality and inter-sentential metalanguage.",
        "In this paper we report on an empirical study of discourse phenomena to a simulated interface and on our work on generalized ellipsis resolution in the context of the XCALIBUR project."

        "The necessity to handle most of the discourse phenomena listed in the preceding section was underscored by an empirical study we conducted to ascertain the most pressing needs of natural language interfaces in interactive applications.",
        "The initial objective of this study was to circumscribe the natural language interface task by attempting to instruct users of a simulated interface not to employ different discourse devices or difficult linguistic constructs.",
        "In essence, we wanted to determine whether untrained users would be able to interact as instructed (for instance avoiding all anaphoric referents), and, if so, whether they would still find the interface convivial given our artificial constraints.",
        "The basic experimental set-up consisted of two remotely located terminals linked to each other and a transaction log file",
        "that kept a record of all interactions.",
        "The user was,situated at one terminal and was told he or she was communicating with a real natural language interface to an operating system (and an accompanying intelligent help system, not unlike Wilensky's Unix Consultant (231.)",
        "The experimenter at the other terminal simulated the interface and gave appropriate commands to the (real) operating system.",
        "In different sessions, users were instructed not to use pronouns, to type only complete sentences, to avoid complex syntax, to type only direct commands or queries (e.g., no indirect speech acts or discourse-level metalinguistic utterances [4, 8]), and to stick to the topic.",
        "The only instructions that were reliably followed were sticking to the topic (always) and avoiding complex syntax (usually).",
        "All other instructions were repeatedly violated in spite of constant negative feedback that is, the person pretending to be the natural language program replied with a standard error message.",
        "I recorded some verbal responses as well (with users telling a secretary at the terminal what she should type), and, contrary to my expectations, these did not qualitatively differ from the typed utterances.",
        "The significant result here is that users appear incapable or unwilling to generate lengthy commands, queries or statements when they can employ a linguistic device to state the same proposition in a more terse manner.",
        "To restate the principle more succinctly: Terseness principle: users insist on being as terse as possible, independent of communication media or typing ability.1 Given these results, we concluded that it was more appropriate to focus our investigations on handling abbreviatory discourse devices, rather than to address the issue of expanding our syntactic coverage to handle verbose complex structures seldom observed in our experience.",
        "In this manner, the objectives of the XCALIBUR project differ from those of most current investigations."

        "• Generalized ellipsis resolution, as presented below, occurs within the information handler.",
        "As the reader may note, the present raison d'etre of the information manager is to act as a repository of task and dialog knowledge providing information that the user did not feel necessary to convey explicitly.",
        "Additionally, the information handler routes the parsed command or query to the appropriate knowledge source, be it an external static data base, an expert system.",

        "The terseness principle operates at all levels: syntactic, semantic and pragmatic.",
        "The contextual substitution rules exploit the semantic representation of queries and commands discussed in the previous section.",

        "It is true that in order to instantiate correctly a sentential or nominal case frame in the parsing process requires semantic knowledge, some of which can be rather domain specific.",
        "But, once the parse is attained, the resulting canonical representation, encoding appropriate semantic relations, can and should be exploited to provide the system with additional functionality such as the present ellipsis resolution method.",
        "The major problem with semantic grammars is that they convolve syntax with semantics in a manner that requires multiple representations for the same semantic entity.",
        "For instance, the ordering of marked cases in the input does not reflect any difference in meaning (although one could argue that surface ordering may reflect differential emphasis and other pragmatic considerations).",
        "A pure semantic grammar must employ different rules to recognize each and every admissible case sequence.",
        "Hence, the resultant parse trees differ, and the knowledge that surface positioning of unmarked cases is meaningful, but positioning of maked ones is not, must be contained within the ellipsis resolution process, a very unnatural repository for such basic information.",
        "Moreover, in order to attain a measure of the functionality described above for case-frames, ellipsis resolution in semantic grammar parse trees must somehow merge adjectival and post nominal forms (corresponding to different non-terminals and different relative positions in the parse trees) so that ellipsed structures such as \"a disk with 1 port\" can replace the the \"dual-port\" part of the phrase \"...dual-port fixed-media disk ...\" in an earlier utterance.",
        "One way to achieve this effect is to collect together specific nonterminals that can substitute for each other in certain contexts, in essence grouping non-canonical representations into semantic equivalence classes.",
        "However, this process would require hand-crafting large associative tables or similar data structures, a high price to pay for each domain-specific semantic grammar.",
        "Hence, in order to achive robust ellipsis resolution all proverbial roads lead to recursive case constructions encoding domain semantics and canonical structure for multiple surface manifestations.",
        "Finally, consider one more rule that provides additional context in situations where the ellipsis is of a purely semantic nature, such as:",

        "The RP07-aa, the RP07-ab,",
        "We need to answer the question \"largest what?\" before proceeding.",
        "One can call this problem a special case of definite noun phrase resolution, rather than semantic ellipses, but terminology is immaterial.",
        "Such phrases occur with regularity in our corpus of examples and must be resolved by a fairly general process.",
        "The following rule answers the question from context, regardless of the syntactic completeness of the new utterance.",
