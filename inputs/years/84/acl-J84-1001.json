        "Figurative language is not merely an ornament of the poet but abounds in the everyday speech of everyday people and as such is a legitimate area of inquiry for researchers – in any discipline – who are concerned with understanding natural language.",
        "The interest in metaphor in computer understanding of natural languages stems from this same source.",

        "The heading \"figurative language\" comprises the traditional figures of speech know as synechdoche, metonymy, hyperbole, personification, irony, etc., as well as the more common metaphor and simile.",
        "I am going to focus here on these latter two in order to narrow my view in the hope of achieving some depth and also because of a belief that the other figures may operate under similar principles.",
        "Except where noted, I will use the term \"metaphor\" in referring to both similes and metaphors.",
        "Please note that this does not imply that I am taking the position that metaphors and similes are the same; in fact, there is some evidence that they function differently from one another.",
        "At the least, it seems possible that the distinction between these two is more than the traditional one of implicitness versus explicitness since there are instances of metaphors that sound strange when \"transformed\" into similes and vice versa.",
        "I therefore am using the term \"metaphor\" in a very loose way to cover the area metaphors and similes have in common (for example, the similarity in the figurative reads of John is an animal and John is like an animal), without pausing at this time to delve into its exact nature and ignoring for the moment the apparent differences.",
        "To start, I will work only with isolated sentences of the form",
        "In sentences of this form, A is commonly referred to as the \"topic\", the B term as the \"vehicle\".",

        "To copy otherwise, or to republish, requires a fee and/or specific permission.",
        "(2) Billboards are like warts then, the topic is billboards, the vehicle warts and the ground ugliness and (perhaps) prominence.",
        "In restricting this study to sentences of the form (1), my motives here again are to constrain the unwieldiness of the subject.",
        "Of course this rules out a large body of possible metaphorical utterances of other forms.",
        "Many of these, however, if confined to one sentence, could be restated in the form of (1) with no significant loss of meaning.",
        "I will not discuss them here.",
        "I will, however, have something to say later about the larger linguistic context (discourse.)",
        "The typed word, the presumed form of input of natural language to a computer until such time as actual speech understanding systems develop sufficiently, imposes limitations of its own on the scope of any language processing system.",
        "The most obvious is, of course, that variation in intonation of the input is limited to its most \"neutral\" pattern; prosodic features must largely be ignored.",
        "(A certain amount of emphasis or contrastive stress may be obtained by underlining, but the study of this should be considered separately.)",
        "Another, perhaps more relevant consideration, is the use of a space to separate parts of what must be considered a single lexical item, e.g., blind alley.",
        "Historically, this was undoubtedly a metaphor (and a candidate for this study); today it is most probably interpreted as a single unit.",

        "I too prefer the flexibility of \"predicate\" and shall follow Ortony in the use of this term.",
        "The notion of salience makes use of the apparent fact that metaphorical statements are asymmetric:",
        "(2) Billboards are like warts means something different from (3) Warts are like billboards Ortony's explanation is that in isolated sentences of the form (1) A is (like) B",
        "those predicates that have high salience in B and low salience in A are the ones being considered in the metaphor.",
        "The effect is one of raising the salience of these predicates in A.",
        "Thus, sentence (2) is generally understood as meaning that billboards are ugly, whereas in (3), those predicates that have high salience for billboards (but low salience in warts) – for example, prominence – are attributed to warts (that is, the salience is raised).",
        "An additional requirement is that there be high salient predicates of B that cannot apply to A.2 My working definition of salience includes the assumption of a taxonomic structure of concepts with the most general at the top and the most specific at the bottom.",
        "Figure 1 provides an illustration of a simple taxonomy.",
        "I define a salient predicate of a concept as one that implies inherent prominence (for example, saturation of color, largeness of size, etc.)",
        "or else is definitional in that it entails a concept's separation from others in the hierarchy (for example, the dog's domesticity separates it from the wolf).",
        "My notion of salience parallels that of Tversky (1977) in that intensity and diagnosticity are the critical factors, but it makes the addition of hierarchical organization to facilitate diagnosticity.3 Context, both linguistic and extralin-guistic, is of course a major contributing factor too, but it is outside the scope of this study.",

        "concept.\"",

        "(9) John's hands are like ice.",
        "If a range of possible temperatures were built into the representation for human hands, it would be known that John's hands could not possibly be literally as cold as ice (there could not be an actual equivalence of temperature in hands and in ice).4 The figurative interpretation would thus prevail.",

        "From the above discussion it is obvious that some sort of conceptual representation underlies human metaphor understanding; at some level people know the predicates of concepts and presumably something about their organization in terms of a generality hierarchy.",
        "Our \"knowledge\" undoubtedly includes, in addition to what might be labeled general knowledge, the values and beliefs of our speech community.",
        "Although the computational representation of such a base is a formidable task, the purpose of this paper is to delineate its nature and boundaries.",
        "It is assumed that the implementation of a base, in actuality, is a separable task.",
        "KL-ONE is one of a number of extant knowledge representation languages that allow Concepts to be arranged in a generality hierarchy with the characteristic that properties of the more general Concepts are inheritable by the more specific ones.",
        "It furthermore provides for the Concept to be represented as a structured object, allowing one, in effect, to get inside the Concept and to see its relationship to other Concepts.",
        "In this discussion, I will assume that the features of KL-ONE are available for use in metaphor processing.",
        "The KL-ONE entities most relevant to this study are Concepts (diagrammatically represented by ellipses) and Roles (represented by encircled squares).8 The structured Concept is the primary representational entity.",
        "A Role is internal to a Concept; it can be a part (for example, a hand is a Role of the Concept BODY) or what is commonly called an attribute (for example, a PERSON – the Concept – has habits – a Role).",
        "I will use Roles to represent predicates as they have been described above.",
        "The hierarchical classification aspect of KL-ONE allows lower, less general, Concepts to inherit structured description from those in an ancestral relationship to them.",
        "At the topmost level are the most general Concepts, called Generic Concepts (GCs).",
        "As one proceeds downward through the network, one encounters more and more specific GCs.",
        "At the lowest level is knowledge about an individual, called an Individual Concept (IC) (see Figure 2).",
        "ANIMAL (a GC of a higher level) passes down to PERSON (a GC of a lower level) all of its Roles and the interrelationships among them.",
        "So if ANIMALS have noses then so do PEOPLE.",
        "PERSON in turn passes to JOHN (an IC, shaded in Figure 2) those Roles PERSON got from ANIMAL as well as those unique to PERSON.9 The Value and Satisfies links indicate the relationship between a Role of an IC (called an IRole) and its parent role.",
        "Since the kind of knowledge necessary for metaphor processing must include the beliefs and cultural values of the members of the community for which the system is being designed, in the representation of a prototype, some stereotyping is inevitable.",
        "That snakes are frightening and perhaps evil creatures is a commonly held opinion, although of course this is not true of all snakes.",
        "Metaphors seem to tap these kinds of generalizations in their insistence on prototypes, and they do seem necessary for understanding to take place.",
        "(24) The whip lay coiled on the ground like a snake.1° 8 The local internal structure of every Concept is made up of Roles and RoleSet Relations (RSRs).",
        "This discussion will not describe the functioning of RSRs but will focus on Roles since they are adequate to support this theory at its present stage of development.",
        "Furthermore, RSRs are less clearly understood at the current state of KL-ONE's design than are Roles.",
        "(I use the term \"Roles\" instead of \"RoleSets\" for discursive simplicity.)",
        "Those readers who have an interest in a more detailed description of the knowledge representation language KL-ONE should consult Brachman (1978, 1979) and Schmolze and Brachman (1982).",
        "9 A Concept description in KL-ONE represents the intension of the Concept and there is a clear distinction drawn between the",
        "That the more affective (here, negative) aspects of peoples' impressions of snakes are of importance, and not simply shape or the more physical characteristics, seems evident by making a comparison (25) The whip lay coiled on the ground like a strand of spaghetti.",
        "The fact that a snake might strike and inflict harm from a coiled position (even though many types of snakes would not) shows how generalizations seem to operate.",
        "The menacing nature of the whip is highlighted in (24), but in (25) that aspect of whips is much less important.",
        "In fact, it can be considered to be \"negated\" by (25).",
        "It should be noted at this point that one network alone may not suffice in processing metaphors or, for that matter, in processing other language phenomena.",
        "The existence of sublanguages is generally accepted within the field of linguistics: there are technical sublanguages for technical fields, for example.",
        "The representation must parallel and support this phenomenon.",
        "An individual's style of speech also changes according to the social setting; a person surely has more than one style.",
        "At the least, there is careful speech and casual speech.",
        "In lecturing to a class, one would use a more careful variety than in chatting with one's friends.",
        "I propose that there also exist sub-knowledge networks to support different styles of speech.",
        "Again, at the least there would be a careful and a casual variety.",
        "Formal situations would favor the careful; inf or-mal situations the casual.",
        "The other could then be a reasonable second choice.",
        "As an example, a veterinarian would have one representation of the animal kingdom for use on the job and one for home use.",
        "The careful (or more technical) one might look like an expanded and detailed version of Figure 2.",
        "The sentence John is an animal might receive one interpretation (the literal one) at work where, due to the nature of the representation (and of course the context), the metaphorical interpretation is less likely.",
        "At home, the metaphorical one might prevail.",
        "Underlying it could be a representation like Figure 3.",
        "(Notice that in addition to the NAME of the Role (of no computational interest) there is the pointer labeled V/R This stands for Value/Restriction and provides information about the fillers of a Role.",
        "V/Rs must be other Concepts.",
        "NAME and V/R are two facets that Roles can be thought of as having.)",
        "The common person may well consider him or herself to be different from the animals (witness the creationist-evolutionist debates).",
        "Then John is an animal would no longer fall into a generality, specificity situation and, although PEOPLE and ANIMALS are in a sibling relationship to one another, the relationship is between members of categories far more abstract than basic level categories.",
        "Thus, the incongruity would make the metaphorical interpretation more likely.\"",
        "ti 1 am grateful to Robert Dietz and Loretta Hirsch (personal communication) for the example that led me to this refinement.",
        "With metaphors as with other forms of user input, contradictions with the knowledge base may occur.",
        "The idea of a user contradicting the knowledge of the system raises the issue of the relationship between these two.",
        "The core of knowledge originally stored in the base should be thought of as having been created by an expert to be used by a layman.",
        "Consequently, information supplied by the user should have a different status from that of the original designer of the system.",
        "However, for communication with the system to take place, discourse elements must at least temporarily be integrated into the knowledge base.12 The kind of contradictions most common in metaphors will be those involving a change in salience.",
        "For example, the system may know that John is an attractive guy with sloppy eating habits.",
        "Both may be considered of equal salience in this case.",
        "If the user utters (27) John is a pig, then the salience of his eating habits for this user has been elevated beyond that of his otherwise pleasant demeanor.",
        "(This is referred to as predicate promotion in Ortony 1979b.)",
        "On the other hand, 12 Others have provided for discourse phenomena in representing knowledge.",
        "For example, see sections on semantic knowledge and discourse knowledge in Walker (1978) for a discussion of the discourse component of the SRI speech understanding system.",
        "The relationship of context to non-literal language is explored in Ortony, Schallert, Reynolds, and Antos (1978).",
        "(28) John is a doll",
        "would have the opposite effect.",
        "John's being an attractive guy is a more important characteristic of John for this user.",
        "In the somewhat unlikely event that both (27) and (28) were uttered by the same user, the salience of both would be elevated.",
        "How then can a representation system like KL-ONE be used?",
        "It should first be noted that in the interest of prototypicality considerations I will follow Cohen (1982b) in allowing V/Rs on Roles of a Concept to include an exclusive disjunction of possible values, weighted by typicality.",
        "The lower Concepts can then restrict these to the appropriate ones.",
        "These Concepts can in turn also be ordered by typicality.",
        "In Figure 4 then, RED is a more typical color for an APPLE than GREEN and a DELICIOUS apple is a more typical apple than a GRANNY SMITH.",
        "These rankings are indicated by the symbol \">\".",
        "This representation of APPLE, having as it does only one Role, is of course highly simplified.",
        "Here, color is restricted to RED or GREEN, where RED and GREEN are other Concepts in the network.",
        "If the sentence",
        "(29) Jane's cheeks are like apples",
        "is to be understood, it is necessary to have a Concept of the prototypical apple.",
        "Among the members of the community that would understand this, surely the color of prototypical apples is red (see Figure 4 – RED > GREEN and DELICIOUS > GRANNY SMITH).",
        "would certainly have a different interpretation.",
        "In Figure 5, notice that for the concept HAND, temperature is not terribly salient.13 I have also introduced a range of values as a possible value restriction, here 3-6.",
        "So this means that hands prototypicality range from hot to cold.",
        "In considering the Concept ICE (Figure 6), notice that it has a temperature of 7, that is, extremely cold.",
        "Temperature is highly salient for ICE(=1).",
        "Figure 6 also illustrates the relationship between a higher Concept, SOLIDS, and a lower one, ICE.",
        "The Roles of SOLIDS are inherited by ICE.",
        "In some representations they are inherited intact, but here the Restricts link causes a restriction of the fillers of the Role in question.",
        "Thus, TEMPERATURE is restricted to 7; TEXTURE is restricted to HARD/SMOOTH.",
        "13 I have provided for salience to assume values between zero (least salient) and one (most salient).",
        "The algorithm for the computation of these values awaits further empirical results.",
        "At present, they represent an estimate based on my intuitions."

        "Although this approach to natural language and knowledge representation has been from the point of view of metaphors, it seems clear that at least some of the factors operating in metaphor understanding operate in literal language as well.",
        "There is undoubtedly a relationship between salience raising in metaphors and the resultant effect on discourse and focus of attention.",
        "In fact, salience raising undoubtedly contributes to focusing.",
        "I have only dealt lightly with discourse problems and recognize these as crucial to all language understanding, whether the language be literal or figurative.",
        "It should be noted that the approach I have taken ignores the possibility of considering metaphors as analogies.",
        "Since many are not analogies, I will save that for future work.",
        "That they exist is clear: (35) Giraffes are like skyscrapers is somewhat more complicated to understand (computationally speaking) than many of the ones I have used in this discussion because it involves relationships among Roles and not Roles simply.",

        "Also, clearly, some analogies and some metaphors are instructional (Ortony 1975).",
        "(37) The structure of an atom is like the structure of the solar system.",
        "These appear to be used in building the representation of a new concept (here, atoms).",

        "A system could be made more efficient by utilizing a technique such as Carbonell (1981) has described for recognizing the latter whenever they occur and incorporating my proposals elsewhere.",
