        "As natural language interaction with computers becomes more widespread, systems' abilities to engage users in discourse will become increasingly important.",
        "These capabilities will be especially in demand when users can speak naturally to their machines.",
        "Although it is widely suspected that spoken language is different from written language, the question of precisely what the differences are has only recently become a topic of computational linguistic research.",
        "Previous investigations have concentrated on syntactic differences between spoken and written language (Hindle 1983, Kroch and Hindle 1982, Thompson 1980), with the goal of adapting parsing techniques to handle the syntax of spoken language.",
        "However, even if this goal were achieved, a system needs to be prepared to handle any unique properties of the discourse structure of spoken interaction if it is to be successful in conducting a dialogue.",
        "Of course, there has been much work on discourse processing within computational linguistics (e.g., Grosz 1977, Sidner 1979, Webber 1978), and any future systems will undoubtedly incorporate previously successful techniques.",
        "However, one suspects that the coverage This research was supported primarily by the National Institute of Education under contract US-N1E-C-400-76-0116 to the Center for the Study of Reading of the University of Illinois and Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc., and in part by the Oregon State University.",
        "The paper was written at the Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corporation, and revised at SRI International.",
        "The revisions of this paper have been made possible by a gift from the System Development Foundation to SRI as part of a coordinated research effort with the Center for the Study of Language and Information, Stanford University.",

        "of discourse processing algorithms may depend on the corpora from which they were developed, and many of those reflect keyboard-mediated dialogue.",
        "Thus, to determine whether and how current techniques need to be adapted to the way people speak, research is needed to compare the discourse structure of spoken and keyboard interaction.",
        "This paper presents an empirical study and theoretical analysis of utterance form and function as determined by the communication modality.",
        "The two initial objectives are:",
        "1.",
        "To develop an empirical methodology for analyzing discourse pragmatics.",
        "2.",
        "To use that methodology to identify both the goals that speakers attempt to achieve in spoken and keyboard modalities, and the discourse and sentence structures they use in achieving those goals.",
        "These objectives are investigated in a study of instruction-giving discourse, a communication task that intimately ties utterance function to a nonlinguistic task being accomplished by the conversants.",
        "In addition to depending on the communication task, the goals people achieve with language are a function, in part, of the communication situation – i.e., of how the speaker(s), hearer(s), object(s) under discussion, and discourse itself are situated in the world.",
        "For example, the utterance \"On the table is a little yellow piece of rubber,\" would be interpreted quite differently in a narrative than in a set of instructions for assembling an object.",
        "The communication situation helps to determine the pragmatics of reference – what speakers intend hearers to do with referring expressions.",
        "Thus, a third goal of this paper, a subsidiary to objective 2 is to consider",
        "3.",
        "How the speakers' goals for the interpretation of referring expressions are expressed and achieved in different modalities.",
        "Results indicate that speakers attempt to achieve more detailed referential goals in giving instructions than do users of keyboards.",
        "That is, speakers explicitly request hearers to identify the referents of noun phrases (NPs), but users of keyboards do not.",
        "Instead, the referential goals achieved by these requests are subsumed by other requested actions.",
        "Most importantly, these identification requests are only achieved \"indirectly\" – through utterances whose surface forms do not explicitly convey the speakers' intent.",
        "Current theories propose that the speaker's intentions underlying the use of indirect speech acts can be recognized as a by-product of a more general, independently motivated process of inferring a speaker's plans (Bruce 1983, Cohen and Perrault 1979, Cohen and Levesque 1980, Perrault and Allen 1980, Schmidt 1975, Sidner and Israel 1981).",
        "Essentially, illocutionary acts, which communicate the speaker's intentions, are regarded as steps in a speaker's plan, just as physical acts are.",
        "Furthermore, just as observing an agent's behavior may lead one to infer what the agent is trying to do, so too can the observation/understanding of a speaker's utterance lead an observer to infer the speaker's intentions.",
        "This approach has led to formal and computational models of discourse processing (Allen 1979; Allen and Perrault 1980; Brachman et al.",
        "1979; Cohen and Levesque, in preparation; Sidner et al.",
        "1981).",
        "Although these provide a more comprehensive account of indirect speech act interpretation than previous linguistic or philosophical approaches, they have not been tested against a corpus other than the ones that supported their creation (e.g., Horrigan 1977).",
        "Therefore, as an adequacy test, the fourth objective for this paper is:",
        "4.",
        "To evaluate how well a plan-based theory of",
        "communication can uncover the intentions underlying the use of many surface forms in the transcripts.",
        "The theory is shown to account for approximately 70% of the indirect requests for referent identification found in the transcripts, once an action for referent identification has been posited.",
        "An important aspect of the account is the demonstration that speakers and hearers can reason about referent identification much as they reason about other actions and plans.",
        "Hence, the last goal for this paper is to",
        "5.",
        "Contrast the plan-based analysis of referring, and the flexibility it allows, with Searle's account of reference as a speech act.",
        "I show that Searle's analysis cannot account for many of the examples treated here, and that those examples it does cover can also be handled by the present analysis.",
        "The conclusions I draw are specific to the conversational task of giving instructions about objects physically present to the hearer.",
        "This task was chosen for four reasons:",
        "• First, it was expected that speakers would frequently issue requests.",
        "Because requests dominate interactions with many question-answering systems, and with most conceivable interactive applications of natural language processing, they have been extensively studied in computational linguistics.",
        "• Second, because the task is simple and constrained, it provides an excellent adequacy test for proposed theories and computational techniques; any theory of communication that cannot handle the phenomena of this study can hardly be called general.",
        "However, since the domain is functionally similar to those of various keyboard-based systems (Brachman et al.",
        "1979, Robinson et al.",
        "1980, Winograd 1972), the data and results of the study may suggest directions for extending those systems.",
        "• Third, the domain is similar to those analyzed by other researchers (Chapanis et al.",
        "1972, Chapanis et al.",
        "1977, Grosz 1977), and thus the dialogues could serve to confirm or refute their results.",
        "• Finally, instructions play a crucially important role in people's everyday lives – success in industrial, academic, and bureaucratic tasks, for example, requires the following of instructions.",
        "Children are initially instructed face-to-face, but they eventually learn to follow written instructions.",
        "The present study, though not this paper, should ultimately provide a window on how the language of written instructions differs from that of instructional dialogue.",
        "In summary, this paper applies an empirical methodology for analyzing discourse pragmatics to compare spoken and keyboard language for an instruction-giving task.",
        "The primary differentiating phenomenon, the use of explicit identification requests, is used as an adequacy test for a plan-based theory of communication.",
        "Conversely, the theory is used to explicate how such communicative actions might be analyzed.",
        "Finally, the theory gives rise to a pragmatic analysis of referring that subsumes Searle's (1969).",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses previous research in a number of related areas.",
        "Section 3 isolates the phenomena of interest – referent identification.",
        "Section 4 describes the study and the method of discourse analysis, and Section 5 presents and discusses the empirical results.",
        "Section 6 sketches the plan-based theory of communication and applies the theory to key examples.",
        "Section 7 counters possible alternative explanations that would purport to explain the data without recourse to an analysis of speaker intent.",
        "Section 8 compares the analysis with Searle's, and suggests generalizations based on independently motivated principles.",
        "Finally, the appendices contain the materials, transcripts, and codings on which these analyses are based.",

        "Four traditions of research bear on the problems at hand: empirical work on differences between spoken and written language, discourse analysis, psychological studies of referential communication, and computational linguistics studies of discourse that have been based on observation of actual communicative interaction.",
        "The subject of oral/written language comparisons has received much attention from researchers: Anthropologists have traditionally studied characteristics of \"oral\" and \"literate\" cultures; human-factors researchers have investigated the opportunities that particular modalities afford for effective communication; and educational psychologists, using empirical and anthropological methods, have sought answers to children's reading and writing problems in the study of oral/written language differences.",
        "Rubin (1980) discusses methodological weaknesses in many oral/written studies – weaknesses that stem from a simplistic division of language experiences into \"oral\" and \"written\".",
        "Instead, she classifies language experiences in terms of their characteristic values on several dimensions such as: the use of voice or print, the ability of \"speaker\" and \"hearer\" to interact, their spatial and/or temporal commonality, their mutual involvement in the discourse, and the concreteness of the referents.",
        "Face-to-face conversations about physically present objects are seen to lie at one extreme within this \"communication space\" (with \"positive\" values on the above dimensions), whereas written text is at the opposite.",
        "Other language experiences that differ along these dimensions include communication by telephone, keyboard, audiotape, picturephone, writing, etc.2 Rubin reports that many studies comparing language experiences present conclusions about oral/written language differences even though the language experiences differ from one another along multiple dimensions.",
        "In such cases it is not clear if the observed differences result, for example, from the presence of voice, the ability to interact, or both.",
        "There is evidence that at least some quantitative linguistic and efficacy results are primarily determined by the presence of voice in the communication modality.",
        "A series of studies by Chapanis and colleagues (Chapanis et al.",
        "1972, Chapanis et al.",
        "1977) compared problem-solving effectiveness among teams communicating in face-to-face, voice only, written, keyboard, and other communication modalities.",
        "Dependent measures included problem solution time, number of words, sentences, utterances, etc.",
        "Results indicate that problems are solved twice as fast in vocal modalities as they are in written ones, even though communicators use twice as many words when speaking.3 Although motivating the development of speech-understanding systems, these results unfortunately tell us little about how the processing of spoken utterances differs from the processing of written ones.",
        "Other research has compared the syntax of spoken and written discourse.",
        "The primary findings are: Written language is syntactically more integrated than spoken, employing nominalizations, participles, complements, relative clauses, etc.",
        "(Chafe 1982); and spoken language exhibits regular patterns of false starts and hesitations (Hindle 1983, Kroch and Hindle 1982).",
        "The former results can help a system designer to determine which syntactic constructs to emphasize in a grammar for parsing.",
        "The latter results are more useful to computational",
        "linguistics.",
        "Not only are regularities in nongrammatical speech identified, but a class of \"editing\" rules is provided that can make such utterances parsable.",
        "Current work on relaxing grammar rules and on parsing ill-formed input (Hayes and Mouradian 1981, Kwasny and Sondheimer 1981, Weischedel and Black 1980) is in much the same spirit.",
        "The purposes at hand require analyses of the pragmatic and discourse structure of actual dialogues.",
        "Grosz (1977) and Bruce (1981) (among others) have shown how such discourse analyses can have direct implications for algorithm design.",
        "In their work, transcripts of dialogues were collected and analyzed, leading to the development of algorithms for speech-understanding systems (Walker 1978, Woods et al.",
        "1976).4 Grosz' analyses indicate that anaphoric reference in task-oriented dialogues is constrained by the hierarchical structure of the physical task.",
        "A parallel structuring of \"focus spaces\" was proposed as a mechanism to constrain the search for co-referents, and became the mainstay of the discourse component of two systems (Robinson et al.",
        "1980, Walker 1978).",
        "Although this research did not directly address the problem of discovering cross-modal similarities and differences, the major finding of explicitly \"stacked\" topics serving to constrain co-reference was validated independently in a domain of casual, f ace-to-f ace conversation (Reichman 1981).",
        "Bruce's pragmatics component for the HWIM system was based on transcripts of human keyboard-mediated dialogues simulating interactions with a travel budget manager.",
        "Users were seen to be interacting in various \"modes\" (e.g., editing-a-trip mode, creating-a-trip mode, etc.).",
        "The system attempted to track the user's progress through these modes, using an ATN-based representation, and thereby to create expectations of his/her future utterances.",
        "Discourse analysis revealed that users did not follow the strict embedding of subdialogues required by the ATN model.",
        "Consequently, the pragmatics component was reorganized as a \"demand\" model in which the system was seen as responding to one of a set of pending goals.",
        "Although this research did not directly address issues of cross-modal similarities and differences, it did point out the promise of a goal-oriented view of language processing.",
        "Many researchers in the field of discourse analysis have tried to identify goals or intentions in dialogue.",
        "For example, Labov and Fanshel (1977) analyzed transcripts of therapy sessions by employing the vocabulary of linguistics and speech act theory.",
        "Their analyses presented rules for interpreting the intentions behind utterances of various syntactic forms – e.g., rules for when a hearer will interpret utterances as indirect requests for physical action or verbal confirmation.",
        "However, these rules were stipulated as regularities of discourse rather than as derived from underlying processes.",
        "Their findings should serve as data to be explained, rather than as a satisfying account of discourse.",
        "In research more relevant to computational linguistics, Mann et al.",
        "(Mann, Moore, and Levin 1977; Mann, Carlisle, Moore, and Levin 1977) applied traditional empirical methods to the identification of speaker intention and utterance function in dialogue.",
        "Their goal was to build systems to replicate observers' scorings of transcripts.",
        "The observers, and ultimately the systems, were to identify repeated reference, requests, expressions of comprehension, topic structure, etc., in keyboard dialogues between a user and a computer operator, and in radio dialogues between Apollo astronauts and ground control.",
        "Much care was taken to develop a scoring scheme, train dialogue observers, and attain reliability Mann, Carlisle, Moore, and Levin 1977).",
        "A separate computer program was to have been built for processing each transcript.",
        "By merging the common features of these systems, an empirically-based theory and computational model were to have been developed.",
        "This work resulted in a goal-directed, \"dialogue games\" model of conversational interaction (Levin and Moore 1977), though it is not clear whether the model's formulation resulted from the merging of implementations.",
        "Finally, there is a huge literature of psychological studies of referential communication.",
        "I will not survey it here (but see Dickson 1981 for recent papers and Asher 1979 for an extensive review), but mention only two themes of relevance to this study.",
        "First, such work has shown that, in spoken interaction, noun phrase length tends to decrease as subsequent references to an object are made.",
        "However, in non-interactive spoken modalities (Krauss & Weinheimer 1966), the decrease for subsequent references is lessened.",
        "These results indicate that efficiency in referential communication is a function of user feedback.",
        "The development of the component skills involved in referring is a second theme in this literature.",
        "In order to test Piaget's \"egocentrism\" hypotheses, a typical question asked is whether children take their listener's \"perspective\" into account when planning their referring expressions.6 Another question raised is whether children of certain ages can adequately make comparisons of the properties of referents and non-referents in order to formulate an adequate referring expression.",
        "This line of 'However, neither corpus incorporated true spoken interaction.",
        "The SRI dialogues that were analyzed in depth were taken from a mixed communication mode in which one, an \"expert\", typed instructions to a third party, who spoke them to an \"apprentice\", and typed the apprentice's spoken replies to the expert.",
        "The BBN \"incremental simulation\" dialogues involved only keyboard communication.",
        "work is more relevant to the present concerns of characterizing the act of identification, but the subskills examined are still too coarse for our needs.",
        "Previous research has thus provided many lessons, among them: • the need to compare (at least initially) modalities that are minimally different, • the need for repeatable methods for characterizing linguistic behavior at the pragmatics and discourse structure level, • the need to assess the adequacy of our theories, and • the need for couching explanations in computational terms.",
        "The present study addresses each of these needs."

        "One referential goal that is essential to the present communication task is to get the hearer to identify the object the speaker has in mind.",
        "I shall be using the term \"identify\" in a very narrow, though important and basic, sense – one that intimately involves perception.",
        "Thus, the analysis is not intended to be general; it applies only when the referents are perceptually accessible to the hearer, and when the hearer is intended to use perceptual means to pick them out.",
        "For the time being, I shall explicitly not be concerned with a hearer's mentally \"identifying\" some entity satisfying a description, or discovering a co-referring description, although these operations are certainly important aspects of processing many referring expressions.",
        "In the remainder of this section, properties of the referent identification act are examined, in part by contrasting it with other concepts that have previously entered into computational linguistic analyses of reference.",
        "Referent identification requires an agent and a description.",
        "The essence of the act is that the agent pick out the thing or things satisfying the description.",
        "The agent need not be the speaker of the description, and indeed, the description need not be communicated linguistically, or even communicated at all.",
        "A crucial component of referent identification is the act of perceptually searching for something that satisfies the description.",
        "To determine which method(s) should be used in identifying the referent, the agent first requires some representation of the description per se.",
        "The description is decomposed by the hearer into a plan of action for identifying the referent.",
        "The intended and expected physical, sensory, and cognitive actions to be included in that plan may be signalled by the speaker's choice of predicates.",
        "For example, a speaker who utters, \"the magnetic screwdriver, please\", may expect and intend for the hearer to place various screwdrivers against some piece of iron to determine which is magnetic.",
        "Similarly, a speaker uttering the description \"the three two-inch long salted green noodles\" may expect and intend the hearer to count, look at, measure, and perhaps taste various objects.",
        "For their part, hearers decompose the noun phrase/description to discover that \"green\" is determinable by vision, \"inch\" by measuring, \"salted\" primarily by taste, \"noodle\" primarily by vision, and \"three\" by counting.",
        "Speakers know this is what hearers can do, and thus, using a model of the hearer's capabilities and the causal connections among people, their senses, and physical objects, design the referring expression D to suggest the actions needed to identify the referent.",
        "Speakers often not only plan for hearers to identify the referents of descriptions, but also communicate, in the Gricean way (1957), their intention that the hearers do so.",
        "This intention may not be explicitly signalled in the utterance, but rather have to be recognized by the hearer.",
        "To respond appropriately, a hearer decides when identification is the intended act to perform in response to a description, what part this act will play in the speaker's and hearer's plans, and when to perform the act.",
        "If perceptually identifying a referent is represented as an action in the speaker's plan, hearers could reason about it just as they do about any other act, thereby becoming able to infer the speaker's intentions behind, for example, indirect identification requests."

        "The first is a \"perceptual accessibility\" condition to guarantee that the IDENTITY-REFERENT action is applicable.",

        "The condition is satisfied in the experimental task because it rapidly becomes mutual knowledge that the task requires communication about the objects in front of the hearer.",
        "The second condition states that X fulfills the description D. Here, I am ignoring cases in which the description is not literally true of the intended referent, including metonymy, irony, and the like (but see Perrault and Cohen 1981).",
        "Finally, D should be a description that is identifiable to this particular Agt.",
        "It should use descriptors whose extension the agent already knows or can discover by action.",
        "I am assuming that we can know that a combination of descriptors is identifiable without having formed a plan for identifying the referent.",
        "If the antecedent is true, then the agent picks out something (not necessarily the object satisfying the antecedent) as the referent of D. His picking out the \"right\" (i.e., the intended) object is handled by a separate characterization of the speaker's intention with respect to this action (see section 7.5).",
        "Here, I will merely give a name to the state of knowledge the agent is in after having identified the referent of D – (IDENTIFIED-REFERENT Agt D X).",
        "That is, Agt has identified the referent of D to be X.",
        "Of course, what has been notoriously difficult to specify is just what Agt has to know about X to say he has identified it as the referent of D. Clearly, \"knowing who the D is\" (Hintikka 1969, Moore 1980) is no substitute for having identified a referent.",
        "After having picked out the referent of a description, we may still not not know who the D is.",
        "On the other hand, we may know who or what the description denotes, for example, by knowing some \"standard name\" for it, and yet be unable to use that knowledge to pick out the object.",
        "For example, if we ask \"Which is the Seattle train?\" and receive the reply \"It's train number 11689\", we may still not be able to pick out and board the train if its serial number is not plainly in view.",
        "Clearly, the notion of identification needs to be made relative to a purpose, which perhaps could be derived from the bodily actions that Agt is intended to perform upon the intended referent.9 Finally, although not stated in this definition, the means by which the act is performed is some function mapping D to some plan or procedure that, when executed by Agt, enables Agt to discover the X that is the referent of D. Even with this imprecise understanding of referent identification, it is apparent that not all noun phrases used in task-oriented conversations (even with the perceptual access conditions satisfied) are uttered with the intention that their referents be identified.",
        "For example, in dialogues with an information booth clerk in a train station (Allen 1979, Horrigan 1977), patrons uttering \"the 3:15 to Montreal?\" are not intending the clerk to pick out the train.",
        "Instead, as part of their plan for boarding a train, patrons are intending the clerk to supply them with a co-referring noun phrase that will allow them to identify the train.",
        "The attributive use of definite noun phrases (Donnellan 1960) is another case in which the speaker has no intention that the hearer identify a referent.",
        "Other non-anaphoric uses of noun phrases include labeling an object, correcting a referential miscommunication, getting the speaker to wait while the speaker identifies the referent, etc.10"

      "text": [
        "Computational linguistics research has usually been concerned with co-reference – the relationship of words and symbols to other words and symbols.",
        "Typically, referents of descriptions are determined by intersecting the extensions of the predicates in the description, subject to the quantificational constraints imposed by the determiner.",
        "Although perhaps adequate for interfacing with databases, this approach presupposes that the extensions can be computed from information currently in the database.",
        "However, in interpreting and generating discourse about some physical task, the system may have to form a plan that it or its user perform physical actions to determine the extensions of the predicates.",
        "Five approaches are most closely related to ours.",
        "First, Winograd's SHRDLU (1972) attempted to simulate true reference with co-reference.11 SHRDLU had a PLANNER function, THFIND, that could find objects in the database satisfying THGOAL statements as a simulation of finding",
        "blocks in the real world.",
        "THFIND was included in the semantic representation of definite NPs, and in the representation of indefinite NPs when those NPs were embedded in an action verb.",
        "However, THFIND is not attributed as a user goal, nor is it reasoned about (other than to maintain a distinction between definite and indefinite NPs).",
        "Furthermore, it is not treated in the same way as acts such as PICKUP, whose execution is marked specially so that the system can later answer \"why\" questions.",
        "Second, Allen's (1979) system used an IDENTIFY state in the control part of the plan-recognition mechanism.",
        "Again, for this system, identification meant to find something in the database satisfying the requisite predicates.",
        "However, the IDENTIFY action itself was not part of the plan being recognized.",
        "The system did not reason about when IDENTIFY should be done (it always tried to IDENTIFY referents), nor did it attribute IDENTIFY to be part of its user's plan.",
        "The TDUS system (Robinson et al.",
        "1980) engaged in a dialogue about the assembly of an air compressor that, it was understood, was being assembled by an apprentice.",
        "Thus, the referents of the system's noun phrases were perceptually accessible to the hearer.",
        "The system was primarily oriented towards utterance interpretation, but it did generate responses to questions.",
        "In doing so, the system was in the same circumstances as the experts in the present study.",
        "However, because it was assumed that the extensions of all of the system's descriptors were already known to the hearer, the system did not reason that it should choose particular referring expressions so that the hearer could pick out their referents.",
        "Instead, the choice of referring expressions was constrained by uniqueness and focus (Grosz 1977), constraints that are not considered here but are clearly necessary.",
        "Although TDUS employed the concept of locating an object in its representation of successful task performance, this concept did not play a role in choosing referring expressions unless the system was asked a question about an object's location.",
        "Appelt's KAMP system (1981) generalized TDUS to plan referring actions as part of the planning of illocutionary acts.",
        "However, KAMP would only include descriptors in a referring expression for which it was already mutually believed that the hearer knew the referent.",
        "Thus, it could not generate referring expressions to new objects for the hearer to pick out.",
        "Furthermore, as argued earlier, the concept of \"knowing what the referent is\", which was central to KAMP's planning of referring phrases, is too strong to be an accurate representation of referent identification.",
        "Finally, the HAM-ANS question-answering system (Hoeppner, Morik, and Marburger 1984) generates descriptions of objects in a hotel room from visually derived information, assuming the user's visual search processes are identical with its own.",
        "In another application, the system answers questions about traffic flow based on visual data.",
        "In its tying reference to perception, the HAM-ANS system has some of the flexibility that I am advocating.",
        "However, as with the others, it does not reason about identification as an action that the speaker intends it to do.",
        "In this paper, I argue why such reasoning is needed."

        "In summary, I am suggesting that referent identification be an action that the hearer infers to be part of the speaker's plan, and that speakers plan for hearers to perform.",
        "To ensure that hearers can do so, speakers employ their knowledge of the hearer's perceptual abilities, and choose descriptions that will make use of those abilities.",
        "The ability to reason about the referent identification act will allow the hearer to infer the intentions behind many utterances that secure reference separately from predication, and do so indirectly.",

        "Each of these aspects of the discourse is considered below.",
        "First, the typewritten transcript of a verbal interaction provides reasonably accurate data on what was said, provided one's goal is not to study prosody.",
        "Second, contextual factors can be modelled in a setting in which the objects, communication task, and modality have been selected by the experimenter.",

        "That is, the discourse analysts \"code\" the speaker's intentions in making an utterance by assigning illocutionary act labels to utterances (or groups of them).",

        "However, unlike most theories of illocutionary acts, I do not claim that the conversants themselves attempt to determine what illocutionary acts were performed, although they might be able to do so if requested.14 The illocutionary act interpretations are therefore our interpretations, as coders and as theorists.",

        "Even with five subjects per mode, differences in the use of identification requests across modes were significant (p = 0.023), indicating that Telephone conversation per se differs from Keyboard conversation in the ways in which a speaker will first get a hearer to identify an object.",

        "The full listing of identification requests can be found in Appendix C. Table 3 presents a classification of these utterances, along with an example of each class.",
        "The utterance forms are divided into four major groups, based on their similarities in either syntactic or logical form.",

        "The concept of fragment is not solely a syntactic classification – hearers can be requested prosodically to respond to NPs and PPs that are embedded in full sentences.",
        "Other categories of utterance forms for identification requests include what are \"nearly direct\" requests (i.e., imperatives and utterances that explicitly mention searching for an object) and what are termed \"Let's requests\", which explicitly change the focus of attention to an object satisfying the description.",
        "Finally, one class of utterances, accounting for 11% of identification requests and called \"supplemental NP\" (e.g., \"Put that on the opening in the other large tube, with the round top\"), was unreliably coded and not considered for the analyses below.",
        "Category labels followed by \"(?",
        ")\" indicate that the utterances comprising those categories might also have been issued with rising intonation.",

        "The important thing to notice in Table 3 is that in Telephone mode identification requests were almost never performed directly.",
        "No speaker used direct forms, e.g., \"Find the rubber ring shaped like an 0\", which occurred frequently in the Written modality (Tierney et al.",
        "1983).",
        "However, the use of indirection is selective – Telephone experts frequently use direct imperatives to perform assembly requests.",

Think of this entire expression as being a pragmatic \"feature\" of a syntactic constituent, as in current linguistic formalisms.",
        "When this expression is applied to a descriptor (supplied from the semantics of the NP), we have a complete formula that becomes the seed for deriving a request.",
        "Namely, if the hearer believes that the uttering of the determiner was intentional (which, of course, he does), then the hearer believes that the speaker wants him to think there is a unique object that speaker wants him to pick out.",
        "If it is mutually believed, the hearer can do it (i.e., the preconditions to the referent identification act hold, and the hearer knows how to do it by decomposing the description into a plan of action), the hearer believes that the speaker's goal is that he believe of some object that the speaker's goal is that he have picked it out.",
        "Hence, a request can be derived.31 Thus, for the perceptual case, the IAA subsumes the PAA.",
        "Assume that instead of just considering the act of identification in its perceptual sense, we adopt Searle's concept – namely that \".... there should no longer be any doubt what exactly is being talked about.\" Identification in this sense is primarily a process of establishing a co-referential link between the description in question and some other whose referent is in some way known to the hearer.",
        "However, we again regard identification as an act that the hearer performs, not something the speaker does to/for a hearer.",
        "If an analysis of this extended notion can be made similar in form to the analysis of the perceptual identification act, then the IAA completely subsumes the PAA.",
        "Because both accounts are equally vague on what constitutes identification (as are, for that matter, all other accounts of which I am aware), the choice between them must rest on other grounds.",
        "The grounds favoring the identification request analysis include the use of separate utterances and illocutionary acts for its analysis of referring, and the independently motivated satisfaction of Searle's conditions on referring."

I shall first summarize the empirical findings and the theory's adequacy, and then discuss implications for computational linguistics."

        "Spoken and keyboard-based instructional discourse, even used for the same ends, differ in structure and in form.",
        "Telephone conversation about object assembly is dominated by explicit requests to identify objects satisfying descriptions.",
        "This paper makes no attempt to explain why it is that speakers break up the referring and predicating functions, but users of keyboards do not.",
        "Many intuitive explanations come to mind – channel bandwidth, memory limitations on the speaker or on the hearer, etc.",
        "Rather than attempt more detailed investigation of the causes of the phenomena, I concentrate instead on applying a plan-based theory to derive the coders' analyses of the speakers' intentions.",
        "Only rarely are identification requests performed directly.",
        "The plan-based theory was shown to capture many of the indirect requests (69%).",
        "However, it needs to be extended in many ways.",
        "In particular, the theory does not yet account for the inferring of expected goals from analyses of the communication task, the physical setting, and the modality constraints.",
        "It cannot relate perceptual actions to the act of searching for something, and it cannot capture the parallelism evident in speakers'",
        "Philip R. Cohen The Pragmatics of Referring and the Modality of Communication prosodically questioning referent identification in the course of issuing an imperative utterance.",
        "I have argued that the need to process indirect identification requests requires hearers to reason about the speaker's intention that the hearer perceptually identify the referents of various descriptions.",
        "This reasoning process involves determining how (the hearer's performing) an action of referent identification might fit into the speaker's plans.",
        "The treatment of referent identification as an action that speakers request not only accounts for the data, but also predicts each of Searle's conditions for performing the act of singular identifying reference while it allowing for appropriate extension into a planning process.",
        "The promissory note introduced by this approach is to show how the same kind of plan-based reasoning used in analyzing indirect speech acts can take hold when a hearer realizes he cannot, and was not intended to, identify the referent of a description.",
        "That is, plan-based reasoning should explain how a hearer might decide that the speaker's intention cannot be what it appears to be (based on the intent correlated with the use of a definite determiner), leading him, for example, to decide to treat a description attributively (Donnellan 1960).",
        "Moreover, such reasoning should be useful in determining intended referents, as Ortony (1978) has argued.",
        "To cash in this promissory note, one needs to be specific about speaker intentions for other uses of noun phrases.",
        "This will be no easy task.",
        "One difficulty will be to capture the distinction between achieving effects on a hearer, and doing so communicatively (i.e., in the Gricean way).",
        "Thus, for example, a hearer cannot comply with the illocutionary act, \"Quick, don't think of an elephant\", because there seems to be an \"automatic\" process of \"concept activation\" (Appelt 1981).",
        "Achieving effects noncommunicatively, without the recognition of intent, may be central to some kinds of reference.",
        "In such cases, speakers would be able to identify referents for a hearer.",
        "If this held for singular identifying reference, then there could be grounds for a propositional act.",
        "However, we might have to give up the Gricean Condition 5, which I suspect Searle would not want to do.",
        "Although it has been demonstrated that the action of perceptual identification differs from other treatments of reference in computational linguistics, perceptual identification has not yet been formalized in a precise way.",
        "A formalism should indicate when identification is necessary, how it relates to the performance of physical action, and how the perceptual actions that comprise it are related to the structure of the descriptions.",
        "Nonetheless, I hope to have demonstrated the importance of formalizing this action.",
        "The methodology of attempting to explain the discourse analyses of two observers is clearly good theoretical hygiene, but is difficult to implement in practice.",
        "Care must be taken to assure that coders are not asked to make too many judgments at once (they get confused), or to make subtle judgments.",
        "For example, coders were not able to differentiate questions from requests for confirmation reliably, even though they were provided with formal definitions for the communicative actions and the intuitive distinctions were clear.",
        "In fact, my providing the coders with formal definitions may have been counterproductive because the definitions did not necessarily mirror people's commonsense distinctions.",
        "One lesson to be learned from the difficult experience of getting others to \"code\" the illocutionary acts in a dialogue is that because it is so difficult, perhaps it is not done by the participants.",
        "It is certainly possible that conversants engage in dialogue without being able to specify precisely, using illocutionary verbs, just which illocutionary acts were performed.",
        "Because elsewhere (Cohen and Levesque 1980, in preparation) we have developed formalisms for communication that do not require the identification of illocutionary acts, it may be unnecessary to require the hearer to do so.",

        "The simple communication task analyzed here involved primarily the performing of requests.",
        "As such, it should fall within the scope of computational linguistic techniques.",
        "However, no natural language system that I know can handle the discourse structure of the Telephone data.",
        "Of course, one might be able to develop a system that could handle just the data found here.",
        "But, we would value more a system (or theory, for that matter) that handles such data because of general principles it embodies.",
        "It is for this reason that I have applied a general purpose plan-based theory.",
        "An extrapolation of the empirical results results suggests that if robots are to be instructed with spoken natural language, they are likely to encounter indirect identification requests.",
        "If their language processing is based on inferring and responding to the speaker's intent, then intent recognition will have to be applied to the act of identifying a referent.",
        "However, given sufficient restrictions on the domain of discourse and the robot's capabilities, an implementation of the plan-recognition process might simplify the general case.",
        "I have suggested that derived inference rules coupled with expectations can serve adequately.",
        "A formal foundation for such derived rules for intent interpretation can be found in Cohen and Levesque (1980, in preparation), and a prototype implementation that uses both general and derived rules for interpreting speaker intent is described in Brachman et al.",
        "(1979).",
        "Additional problem areas suggested by this research include developing formal and computational models of",
        "the generation of useful descriptions, and getting machines to plan reference and predication separately.32 However, if given more resources, systems should be able to \"optimize\" referring and predicating plans into single utterances.",
        "Conversely, systems ought to be able to reason about the speakers' uses of descriptions – for identification, correcting previous misidentifications, attribution, etc.",
        "The empirical findings of this study must be interpreted with three cautionary notes.",
        "First, the category of identification requests is specific to discourse situations in which the topics of conversation include objects physically present to the hearer.",
        "If the conversation is not about manipulating concrete objects, different pragmatic inferences could be made, even though the same surface forms might be used.",
        "Second, not all natural language communication between person and machine are accurately captured by the Telephone and Keyboard conditions.",
        "For example, conversations about the contents of the system's display scope (Brachman et al.",
        "1979, Winograd 1972) might share some aspects of the Face-to-Face condition (especially the experts' use of sentence fragments to correct the apprentices' mistakes).",
        "Thus, the generality of these findings will only be established when conversations in other discourse situations are analyzed.",
        "Third, it should be realized that the indirection results may occur only in conversations between humans.",
        "It is possible that people do not wish to verbally instruct others with fine-grained imperatives for fear of sounding condescending.",
        "Print may remove such inhibitions, as may talking to a machine.",
        "The question of how people will speak to machines probably cannot be settled until good speech-understanding systems have been developed.",
        "Nevertheless, in building future speech-understanding systems, it may be unwise to underestimate the frequency of indirect speech acts in spoken discourse.",
        "Finally, I observe again that when computational linguistic techniques have been developed based on a corpus of dialogues, most often those dialogues have been conducted through keyboard interaction.",
        "However, it is clear from the results of this study that keyboard communication is distinctly different from other modalities.",
        "In addition to differences from telephone communication, a cursory examination of the handwritten transcripts reveals that keyboard communication is markedly different in structure from written communication.",
        "Whereas experts in keyboard mode rarely use identification requests, writers use them frequently, in both direct and indirect forms.",
        "Furthermore, writers often performed all identification requests first, and labeled each of the objects for future reference (much as authors of published assembly instructions do).",
        "Keyboard interaction, in its emphasis on optimal packing of information into the smallest linguistic \"space\", appears to be a mode See Appelt (1981) for a system that operates along these lines."
