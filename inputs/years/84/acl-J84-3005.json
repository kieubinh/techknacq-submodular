        "What makes a language a natural language?",
        "A long-standing tradition in generative grammar holds that a language is natural just in case it is learnable under a constellation of auxiliary assumptions about input evidence available to children.",
        "Yet another approach seeks some key mathematical property that distinguishes the natural languages from all possible symbol-systems.",
        "With some exceptions – for example, Chomsky's demonstration that a complete characterization of our grammatical knowledge lies beyond the power of finite state languages – the mathematical approach has not provided clear-cut results.",
        "For example, for a variety of reasons we cannot say that the predicate is context-free characterizes all and only the natural languages.",
        "Still another use of mathematical analysis in linguistics has been to diagnose a proposed grammatical formalism as too powerful (allowing too many grammars or languages) rather than as too weak.",
        "Such a diagnosis was supposed by some to follow from Peters and Ritchie's demonstration that the theory of transformational grammar as described in Chomsky's Aspects of the Theory of Syntax could specify grammars to generate any recursively enumerable set.",
        "For some this demonstration marked a watershed in the formal analysis transformational grammar.",
        "One general reaction (not prompted by the Peters and Ritchie result alone) was to turn to other theories of grammar designed to explicitly avoid the problems of a theory that could specify an arbitrary Turing machine computation.",
        "The proposals for generalized phrase structure grammar (GPSG) and lexical-functional grammar (LFG) have explicitly emphasized this point.",
        "GPSG aims for grammars that generate context-free languages (though there is some recent wavering on this point; see Pullum 1984); LFG, for languages that are at worst context-sensitive.",
        "Whatever the merits of the arguments for this restriction in terms of weak generative capacity – and they are far from obvious, as discussed at length in Berwick and Weinberg (1983) – one point remains: the switch was prompted by criticism of the nearly two-decades old Aspects theory.",
        "Much has changed in transformational grammar in twenty years.",
        "Modern transformational grammars no longer contain swarms of individual rules such as Passive, Raising, or Dative.",
        "The modern government-binding (GB) theory does not reconstruct a \"deep structure\", does not contain powerful deletion rules, and has introduced a whole host of new constraints.",
        "Given these sweeping changes, it would seem appropriate, then, to re-examine the Peters and Ritchie result, and compare the power of the newer GB-style theories to these other current linguistic theories.",
        "That is the aim of this paper.",
        "The basic points to be made are these:",
        "• Since modern transformational grammars do not contain the powerful deletion rules available in the Aspects theory and need not explicitly reconstruct an underlying deep structure, they are not immediately subject to the Peters and Ritchie results.",
        "Thus the fears recently advanced by Bresnan and Kaplan (1982: xli – xlii) or Johnson-Laird (1983: 280) simply do not hold.",
        "• Because modern transformational grammars use traces to mark the site of displaced constituents, the size of underlying structures that need be recovered for language recognition are just linearly larger than their corresponding surface sentences.",
        "Indeed, it appears that deep structures (\"D-structures\" in the current theory) need not be built at all to test grammaticality.",
        "• Modern transformational grammars seem more",
        "restricted than theories like LFG, not less restricted, in the sense that the agreement predicates available in a modern transformational theory are defined solely over unordered sets of features, rather than, as in the lexical-functional theory, over hierarchical trees.",
        "Agreement (\"unification\") over trees adds extra power to the Copyright 1985 by the Association for Computational Linguistics.",
        "Permission to copy without fee all or part of this material is granted provided that the copies are not made for direct commercial advantage and the CL reference and this copyright notice are included on the first page.",
        "To copy otherwise, or to republish, requires a fee and/or specific permission.",
        "lexical-functional formalism.",
        "The result is that there are some strikingly unnatural grammars that lexical-functional grammars can describe, but not GB grammars.",
        "This result about strong generative capacity shows up on the weak generative capacity side: GB grammars cannot generate some strictly context-sensitive languages that can be easily generated by lexical-functional grammars.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 1 reviews some of the basic formal and linguistic examples demonstrating that the excess power of the Aspects theory comes from unbounded deletion.",
        "It then shows why this power is not permitted in current transformational theories.",
        "Section 2 turns to a general analysis of the power of government-binding grammars.",
        "Section 3 compares the strong and weak generative capacity, of lexical-functional grammar and transformational grammars.",
        "It aims to pinpoint just why lexical-functional grammars are more powerful than government-binding grammars.",
        "Section 4 concludes with some speculations about the precise formal characterization of natural languages.",
        "More generally, these results suggest a different role for the formal analysis of natural languages.",
        "Instead of trying to fit natural languages into some predefined mathematical or formal mold, this revised strategy aims to discover the properties of natural languages first, and then characterize them formally.",
        "The results here may be regarded as the first fruits of this strategy, applied to current linguistic theories."

      "text": [
        "It has long been recognized that the possibility of unbounded deletion is at the root of the computational power of Aspects style transformational theories.",
        "If what a machine must do to recognize whether or not a given sentence (surface string) is in the language generated by some transformational grammar is to recover its deep structure, and if deep structures can be arbitrarily large compared to the surface strings derived from them, then the recognition procedures for such languages are not even recursive.",
        "Before describing Peters and Ritchie's formal characterization of this connection between deep structure length and the complexity of recognition, it would be valuable to give some insight into just why this connection should hold.",
        "Recall that a recursive set is one where membership in the set can be determined in some finite (though perhaps large) amount of time.",
        "Here, the set we have in mind is the language generated by some transformational grammar, L(TG); given some sentence s, our job is to calculate s e L(TG) and return a yes or no answer in some finite amount of time.",
        "Also recall that a set is recursively enumerable (r.e.)",
        "if, whenever s is in fact in L(TG), there is a procedure such that the answer yes can come back in some finite amount of time, but if s is not in the language, we have no such guarantee; the procedure could just run forever.",
        "The key insight connecting length of deep structure to recursive enumerability comes from examining the conditions under which a computation could run forever.",
        "If we use a standard Turing machine model of computation, one thing that could happen is that the machine could just keep using more and more new tape cells, moving a step each time.",
        "This could go on forever.",
        "So one way to obtain unbounded computation time is to use unbounded space.",
        "If we substitute for the \"tape cells\" of the Turing machine the number of embedded s or np cycles in some arbitrarily large deep structure, and if we must recover this deep structure in order to figure out whether or not the sentence is in the grammar, then.",
        "we have our correspondence between unbounded deep structures and unbounded time for computation.",
        "But is this the only way to achieve unboundedly long computations?",
        "Why not just have the machine shuttle back forth along some fixed sequence of tape cells, using the same space but looping forever?",
        "This is certainly possible, but in this case one can show that the number of distinct machine configurations is bounded above by the crossproduct of a fixed number of possible moves times a fixed number of possible cell contents.",
        "But this means we could \"shut off\" the machine after this number of time steps (counting each Turing machine move as a tick of the clock), since the machine cannot do anything new after this number of moves.'",
        "In other words, given an upper bound on the space a machine uses, we can fix an upper bound on the length of time the machine can ever use without looping forever.'",
        "In short then, the only way to get non-recursive computations is by using unbounded space.",
        "In the transformational analog, Peters and Ritchie (1973) connected recognition complexity to the possible difference in length between deep structures and surface strings: Let G be a transformational grammar.",
        "Let fG be the cycling function of G, where fix is 0 if x is not in L(G), and otherwise is the least number s such that G assigns x a deep structure with s subsentences.",
        "If fG is bounded by an elementary (primitive) recursive function, then L(G) is elementary (primitive) recursive.",
        "(In fact, if fG is linear, then L(G) is in a still smaller class.)",
        "If the cycling function is not bounded, then L(G) is not even recursive.",
        "It is the possibility of arbitrary deletion that makes a surface sentence arbitrarily \"shorter\" than its corresponding underlying deep structure.",
        "Lapointe (1977), in an excellent review, sums up the situation: Putnam noted that early theories of transformations allowed grammars which could generate any r.e.",
        "language (whether recursive or not).",
        "The chief reason for this was that early theories allowed arbitrary deletions and substitutions in the course of a derivation.",
        "Arbitrary permutations or copying could never cause a grammar to generate a nonrecursive set, for if Ti and Ti4/ are successive steps in a derivation such that Ti+I arises through the application",
        "of a permutation or copying rule [from] Ti then .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "the number of terminal symbols in Ti+1 will be at least as great as [the number of] terminal symbols in But this property, that successive steps in a derivation do not \"shrink\" in length, is the basic defining characteristic of context-sensitive grammars.",
        "Therefore only the application of rules which reduce length (that is, deletions and substitutions) could cause a grammar to generate a non-CS [context-sensitive rcb], and perhaps a nonrecursive,",
        "We can exhibit this result in a compact form.",
        "It is well known that any r.e.",
        "set can be described as the homomorphic image of the intersection of two context-free languages (Ginsburg, Greibach, and Harrison 1967).",
        "That is,",
        "Recall that a homomorphism is simply a \"respelling\" of the symbols of a language.",
        "The key point is that the homomorphism required here permits the deletion of unbounded strings of symbols, that is, H(z)=A where A is the empty string.",
        "In fact, all the proofs demonstrating the power of Aspects-style transformational grammars make use of this erasing power in one fashion or another.",
        "The remainder of this section reviews two of these demonstrations in the literature, one by Peters (1973), and one by Kimball (1967).",
        "(Another demonstration that Aspects-style TGs can generate any r.e.",
        "language, given by Salomma (1971), also uses unbounded deletion, but is similar to Kimball's approach and will not be discussed here.)",
        "The point of going through the examples in detail is to show exactly how each proof relies on unbounded deletion, and why it is that each does not go through under the assumptions of the current government-binding theory.",
        "The basic reason for the change is that unlimited erasing or deletion is no longer allowed.",
        "Indeed, as the next section will make clear, only a linear amount of erasing is permitted in current theories.",
        "This insight is the key to the analysis of the modern theory.",
        "We begin with Peters's 1973 demonstration.",
        "Peters gives a specific example showing just how \"large\" deep structures can be associated with \"short\" surface sentences.",
        "Again, copying and deletion are the culprits.",
        "Peters's example relies on the \"Equi np deletion\" analysis of sentences such as these:",
        "1.",
        "Their sitting down promises to steady the canoe.",
        "On this account, such sentences have an underlying structure that explicitly reconstructs the missing np subject of the embedded complement to promise:",
        "2.",
        "[Np Their sitting down] promises Es [NP their sitting down] to steady the canoe].",
        "Note that this sentence consists of three S phrases: the root S and two embedded S phrases (the subject NP of the matrix clause and the subject NP of the complement of the VP).",
        "The subject NP of the VP complement is deleted under structural identity with the matrix subject NP.",
        "This deletion follows the \"recoverability of deletion\" constraint.",
        "Peters next builds a surface string that has a large associated deep structure by embedding this sentence recursively in a construction of the same type, that is, a sentence that has a matrix subject NP structurally identical to the subject NP of a verb complement.",
        "But the subject NP has more than two S phrases (three).",
        "Given identity between subject NP of the matrix and the subject of the complement, it follows that at the level of deep structure the subject NP of the complement must have the same number of subsentences as the subject NP of the matrix, here, three.",
        "The new sentence given below must have a deep structure with more than 22 = 4 S phrases in all:",
        "3.",
        "Their sitting down promising to steady the canoe threatens to spoil the joke.",
        "Clearly, as Peters notes, we can carry out this embedding over and over again.",
        "Each time the number of deep structure subsentences is at least doubled, because of the assumption that the complement NP subject is identical to that of the matrix subject.",
        "If we let ds(n) be the size of the deep structure corresponding to such a sentence of length n, then we have the inductive formula that ds(n) > 2ds(n – I).",
        "If we solve this formula, we find that the number of deep structure subsentences grows as an exponential function when compared to the length of the surface string, exactly the sort of sentence that was to be constructed.",
        "If the sentence recognizer must reconstruct this entire deep structure in order to determine language membership, then at least this much space, and hence at least this much time, will be required, just to write down the deep structure.",
        "Interestingly, the argument does not work under current versions of transformational theory.",
        "The simple reason is that we no longer explicitly copy material to reconstruct a deep structure; in fact, we no longer rebuild deep structure at all.",
        "In place of the literally duplicated subject complement NPs, we have an empty category placeholder, PRO, indexed to the proper antecedent NP as appropriate.'",
        "4• [Np [Np Their sitting down], promising [Pro, to steady the canoe]] • threatens [Pro to spoil the joke]",
        "Crucially, the indexed Pros are not \"nested\".",
        "What does this mean and why does this matter?",
        "Prod is indexed to the entire matrix subject NP their sitting down promising to steady the canoe.",
        "But it does not contain as a subpart the PRO corresponding to their sitting down (although it may be indexed to a subpart of a long antecedent string).",
        "The underlying predicate-argument structure is fixed without building up an explicit representation of antecedents in the embedded clause, what used to be called \"deep structure.\"",
        "By changing what the representation looks like we have avoided the problem of exponential space growth.",
        "At each step we add just a single new element to the reconstructed structure, the new PRO.",
        "Our new inductive equation is simply ds(n)=ds(n-1)+1 – a linear increase in the size of reconstructed forms, compared to the surface sentence lengths.",
        "In fact, if we ignored the bracketing and just counted the PROs, at each step we also add a new word (the new verb) and the underlying representations are always just a fixed constant larger than the corresponding surface sentences.",
        "One subtle point still remains.",
        "At each step we add an indexed element, PRO,.",
        "The index itself must grow as the number of PROs increases.",
        "If we assume a standard binary encoding, an index of size i will take log2i space to write down, not the constant space implicitly assumed just above.",
        "Since logi < i, at worst the space added for each embedding will be proportional to i. Summed over n possible embeddings, this is at worst n' space, not exponential space.",
        "In the next section we shall see how this representation of so-called \"empty categories\" works in general.'",
        "Peters's example centered on a \"natural\" example that exhibited exponential deep structure growth.",
        "We next turn to a more artificial example, but one showing how arbitrarily large deep structures may be used to generate any r.e.",
        "language.",
        "Kimball (1967) does this by exhibiting a transformational grammar that meets a variant of the Ginsburg, Greibach, and Harrison theorem (due to Haines, cited in Kimball 1967: 185).",
        "In brief, Kimball sets up a base context-free grammar to generate two trees, rooted at S1 and S2, corresponding to the two context-free languages demanded by the homomorphism theorem (CFL1 and CFL2) and a third tree dominating these two that eventually \"simulates\" the homomorphism H. S1 dominates a terminal string labeled x and S2, a terminal string labeled y.",
        "Dominating these two subtrees is a third tree that, besides x and y, dominates a terminal string z.",
        "The idea is to use a single transformation to successively check that the first member of x matches the first member of y and z; if so, this element is erased in x and y.",
        "If all elements match, and we are at the end of z (indicated by a special symbol), then the two strings are identical; this step carries out the intersection of the two context-free languages.",
        "A final transformation performs the required homomorphism.",
        "Figure 1 depicts the overall scheme.",
        "It is important to point out that both S1 and S2 generate context-free languages that are self-embedding, of the general form atcaii.",
        "Thus they must exhibit recursion on some nonterminal node in the relevant context-free grammar.",
        "As Kimball notes, the strings x and y are deleted under identity with z, so nothing is amiss here in the Aspects theory.",
        "X and y are arbitrarily long.",
        "The underlying \"deep structure\" (the context-free base) is arbitrarily larger than the resulting surface string, namely, some part of z that remains after the homomorphism does its work.",
        "What happens to this example in a modern transformational theory?",
        "The key point is that the modern theory does not have a deletion operation like the one just presented.",
        "Instead, a constituent is moved from one position to a \"landing site\" within its own cyclic domain or to the next higher cyclic domain.'",
        "In English, the cyclic nodes are S and NP.6 When a node is moved, it leaves behind a trace, denoted e, of the same category as the displaced constituent, but with no phonological features.",
        "(Thus the trace is not \"pronounced\" and does not show up in the surface sentence.)",
        "The trace is co-indexed to the displaced constituent, as indicated by a subscript.",
        "For example, given the sentence,",
        "5.",
        "John bought what we could move what, yielding (after some adjustment with the auxiliary verb), 6.",
        "What did John buy ei",
        "Both solutions are ruled out in current theories of transformational grammar.",
        "The movement of an arbitrary number of nodes in a single cycle is impossible because it calls for an arbitrary number of \"landing sites\" in domain n+1.",
        "In fact, there can only be a finite number of such possibilities, as specified by a set of context-free base rules.",
        "For example, we can move an NP to a subject or object 4 There is another solution to the index growth problem, one that will be required later on.",
        "Suppose that each indexed NP or PRO is in effect a distinct element of the grammar's vocabulary.",
        "Thus the grammar allows a denumerable infinity of \"pre-indexed\" elements N Pi, NP2, ....",
        "This is not such a strange proposal, since the index is not used for any syntactic process, but simply for co-indexing.",
        "As we shall see, this same proposal is made, usually implicitly, in most current theories, for example, in the lexical-functional theory.",
        "position, a wh phrase to a comp position (the position occupied by that in I know that Mary likes ice cream): But we cannot move n nodes in a single cycle, because there will not be enough places td put the moved constituents.",
        "The second solution is also ruled out.",
        "Either the adjoined NPs linked to the traces violate subjacency (as pictured), or else we must also adjoin at each step i a copy of the i – lsi trace to the ith trace.",
        "But this last method is also barred, because we do not admit \"nested\" traces, or tree structures that dominate some arbitrarily deep sequence of nested empty elements.",
        "In other words, a trace can be co-indexed at its \"top-level\" to a displaced constituent, but is otherwise \"opaque\"; it has no interior structure.",
        "There are in fact good linguistic reasons for a principle banning nested traces (see Hornstein 1984).",
        "Section 3 probes the formal implications of this constraint in more detail.",
        "It is hard then to see how the required trace structure linking x and z could even be built.",
        "But this is just the first step in Kimball's proof.",
        "Enforcing equality between x and y looks even harder.",
        "Of course, this by no means shows that there is no way to carry out Kimball's construction, but it does hint at some of the difficulties in a revised grammatical framework that does not permit the same liberties with deletions as Aspects, and does not rely on an explicitly reconstructed D-structure."

        "This makes a difference.",
        "As Lapointe (1977) shows, it makes the recognition problem for such languages recursive.",
        "Whatever the merits of their arguments on other grounds, Lapointe's result renders moot Bresnan and Kaplan's concerns (1982: xli) about the non-recursiveness of transformational theory, since their criticisms apply only to the older Aspects theory.",
        "This is our first conclusion.",
        "Much more than this can be said.",
        "If the recognizer does not have to recover full deep structures, then its job could be much easier, as observed by Peters and Ritchie 1973: Putnam proposed that the class of transformational grammars be defined so that they satisfy a \"cut-elimination\" theorem.",
        "We can interpret this rather broadly to mean that for for every grammar G1 in a class there exists 2 such that (i) L(GI) = L(G2) and (ii) there is a constant k with the property that for every x in L(G2), there is a deep phrase marker underlying x with respect to G2 such that 1[d(4)] < kx.",
        "Here, the notation 1(x) stands for \"length or, while d(() is the \"debracketization\" of the deep structure.",
        "The debracketization consists of terminal elements sans right and left brackets, but with traces and PROs.",
        "As Peters and Ritchie go on to say: We now see that any grammar satisfying such a cut-elimination theorem generates a language which more than being recursive is context sensitive.",
        "This is so because a nondeterministic linear bounded automaton can determine both that a labeled bracketing is strongly generated by a context sensitive grammar and that it underlies a given string $x$ if the automaton has enough tape to write 0.",
        "(1973:82) How would such a linearly-bounded recognizer work?",
        "Roughly, it would use a kind of \"analysis by synthesis\": given a sentence of length n, it would mark out a length of input tape kn, k a constant depending on the transformational grammar.",
        "The machine would be guaranteed that annotated surface structures could not get larger than this.",
        "The machine would then use its nondeterministic power to \"guess\" all possible annotated surface structures less than or equal to this length, now with the proviso that one of them must be a correct underlying structure if the sentence in question is in fact in the language generated by the grammar.",
        "Since the number of (NP or S) cycles in each structure is bounded, we may simply try all possible transformational rules (again nondeterministically) to produce possible surface sentences, one at a time.",

        "What then of modern transformational grammar?",
        "We claim that D-structure need not be reconstructed at all to determine grammaticality.",
        "This may be a surprise for some readers accustomed to the older picture of a transformational grammar, where annotated surface structure is just the result of mapping from D-structure under the operation of Move a.",
        "But it is nonetheless true.",
        "Chomsky (1981: 91ff.)",
        "observes that annotated surface structures may be simply defined with respect to certain admissibility conditions (more on these shortly) without regard to an actual movement rule that maps from one level to another.`' Our goal, then, will be to assume that only annotated surface structure is built to test grammaticality.u) We must now define more carefully just what annotated surface structure is in the current GB theory.",
        "We then show that these representations are at most linearly larger than their corresponding surface sentences.",
        "We begin simply by describing the set of admissible annotated surface structures without reference to D-structure.",
        "That is, we define the set of annotated surface structures statically, in the manner that Joshi and Levy (1977) define a set of admissible tree structures.",
        "Roughly, the annotated surface structures of a given grammar are just the set of all well-formed labeled bracketings produced by the constraints of X theory plus the restrictions imposed by lexical subcategorization, plus bracketings where empty categories appear in certain positions, governed by a fixed set of conditions.",
        "In more detail, the well-formed annotated surface structures are defined inductively as follows:\" (I): Following standard assumptions, constraints along with locality conditions on subcategorization together yield a system describable by a context-free grammar (see, e.g., Gazdar and Pullum 1981).",
        "All NPs dominate some lexical material and correspond in one and only one way to the A positions, arguments subcategorized by the relevant verbs, again following the method outlined by Joshi and Levy (1977); the positions in English are: adjacent to the verb, for an object NP; first NP under S, for subject NP; first NP under PP for oblique PP, and so forth.",
        "''- Further, all such lexical NPs must appear in argument (A) positions, where the notion of an argument position again depends in a strictly local way on the verb (e.g., the subject position of seem in English is not an argument position).",

        "Summarizing the analysis so far, we have seen just how modern transformational theories differ formally from their older counterparts.",
        "We have also seen that that difference is reflected as a weak and strong generative capacity difference between the new theory and the lexical-functional theory.",
        "Some questions are still unanswered.",
        "In the previous section, we came to a partial diagnosis of the source of the extra power of the lexical-functional theory.",
        "In this section we would like to pin down that diagnosis.",
        "At the same time we shall offer a different perspective on the formal characterization of natural languages.",
        "This analy21 For example, suppose we interchanged V2 and V3.",
        "Then the control verb V3 is less deeply embedded than the object NP it is supposed to control.",
        "This structure should be ruled out, and it is.",
        "The lefthand functional structure will be as before.",
        "But now the righthand functional structure will not merge properly with the lefthand functional structure because that functional structure demands that the object be embedded inside two VCOMPs, whereas the righthand structure calls for an object embedded inside just one.",
        "Similarly, if V3 were embedded one more level down, the number of VCOMPs would not match.",
        "Only when the number of embeddings is the same (plus one) on both left and righthand sides is the structure well-formed.",
        "sis will necessarily be more speculative.",
        "Still, it is hoped that the discussion will provoke a fresh look at how to go about the mathematical analysis of natural languages.",
        "To begin, let us recall that the suspected source of extra power in the lexical-functional theory is the unification procedure defined over hierarchical structures (constituent structures).",
        "We also argued that nothing like this kind of power is required to describe natural languages.",
        "In this section we shall investigate this claim more deeply.",
        "We shall look at one case, co-ordination, that might seem to require full unification, and see that in fact hierarchical unification is not required.",
        "At first glance, coordination would seem to demand some kind of unification predicate.",
        "The reason is that coordinate structures obey a familiar principle (Williams 1978) that permits only \"similar\" conjuncts to be linked.\"",
        "One way to visualize the parallelism constraint is to imagine the two conjuncts being laid on top of one another.",
        "If they match, then the conjunction is permitted, otherwise, it is not permitted.",
        "Williams (1978) formalizes this condition.",
        "This process is reminiscent of the lexical-functional unification procedure.",
        "(Compare it to the Dutch example given earlier.)",
        "Here too, we \"overlaid\" two hierarchical structures to determine well-formedness.",
        "The Dutch sentences were legal just in case two hierarchical spines could be so overlaid, or unified.",
        "Is unification required?",
        "On closer inspection the analogy with unification breaks down.",
        "It is true that the parallelism of coordinate conjuncts demands a match in terms of phrasal nodes.",
        "The key difference between lexical-functional unification and the coordination constraint is that coordinate parallelism need only hold at the top level of a phrasal sequence.",
        "Internal details of the matched conjuncts do not matter.",
        "This is in contrast to the unification predicate, which, as the Dutch example shows, can demand a hierarchical match.",
        "For example, the following conjunction is perfectly grammatical, even though the conjoined VPs are internally different, one containing an Adjectival Phrase and the other a Noun Phrase (example from Goodall 1983): the bouncer was muscular and was a guitarist.",
        "One can even conjoin active and passive sentences (John went to Boston and was taken for a ride).",
        "As Goodall (1983) demonstrates, one way to describe this effect is as the union of the top level of phrasal nodes (actually, phrase markers).",
        "In contrast, the Kaplan and Bresnan unification procedure (1982: 272), as defined by their statement (190c), recursively defines a union over what may be an entire tree: (190) c. If e1 e2 are both f-structures, letA1,A2 be sets of attributes e1 and e2, respectively.",
        "Then a new f-structure e is constructed with e = {(a,v) la E Al U A2 and v = merge [Locate ke pa)], Locate Re2,a)fil (Locate is an operator that actually finds the sub-f-structure with the specified attribute structure.)",
        "Here, (a, v) is the union of a hierarchical attribute set, since this last step is carried out recursively to all levels of structure.",
        "This means that there is nothing to stop us from writing a coordination rule in the lexical-functional system that demands equality in tree structure through all levels of hierarchical detail, contrary to what is observed.\"",
        "We might speculate then that a general property of constraint statements in natural languages is that they are defined in terms of predicates on linear sequences of structures (phrase markers), rather than by hierarchically defined unification predicates.",
        "It remains to explore just what this restriction comes to, but it is clear that this is exactly where and how lexical-functional grammar diverges from the \"classical\" view of generative grammar.",
        "The classic view, outlined in Chomsky's Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory, defined predicates in terms of a concatenative algebra at each of several levels of representation (phonetic, syntactic, and so forth).",
        "The details are not essential here, but one property of these algebras is: they fixed predicates in terms of linear sequences of elements, rather than trees.24 The lexical-functional system extends the power of representational description to include the possibility of unification predicates defined over nonlinear constituent structures.",
        "While this violation of the usual syntactic adjacency restrictions (observed from earliest days of generative grammar) is certainly sufficient to describe natural languages, the examples presented here show that it is not necessary.",
        "This diagnosis also tells us one way to repair the lexical-functional theory.",
        "One could restrict the lexical-functional theory to ban hierarchical unification predicates.",
        "One way to do this is to simply eliminate the recursive step of Kaplan and Bresnan's unification procedure (190c), (1982:272) excerpted earlier.",
        "For example, feature merger could be restricted to operate over just two cyclic (S or NP) domains.",
        "One would still need a way to handle constructions like those in Dutch, or, should they be necessary, the ww constructions.",
        "Of course, it may be that other restrictions suffice.",
        "Whatever the outcome of these changes, a more general question for future work centers on the status of the concatenation algebras underpinning traditional generative grammar.",
        "While there has been some formal work in this area (see Borgida 1983 and Berwick 1982), it remains to be seen whether the linear predicates presupposed by such a model do indeed characterize what it means to be a natural grammar.",
        "If they do, then extensions to more general unification predicates, as in LFG, unification grammar, or PATR-II, may well be unwarranted."
