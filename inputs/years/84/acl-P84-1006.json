        "The key property of the transformational family that establishes learnability is dubbed Bounded Degree of Error.",

        "The was that the learner can tell that a currently hypothesized grammar is wrong given some sample sentence is by trying to see whether the current grammar can map from a deep structure for the sentence to the observed sample sentence.",
