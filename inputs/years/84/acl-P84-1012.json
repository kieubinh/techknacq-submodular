        "Traditionally, they have defined des-no questions (YNQs) as propositional questions (?P) or as a special type of alternative question (?P V ?Q), in which the second alternative is simply the negation of the first (?P V ?-sP).",
        "So 'Does Mary like skiing?' would be represented as ?like(Mary,skiing) or ?like(Mary,skiing) V ?-dike(Mary,skiing) and the range of appropriate responses would he yes, no and, possibly, unknown.",
        "However, both theoretical work and empirical studies of naturally occurring question-answer exchanges have shown this approach to be inadequate: Ycs, no, and unknown form only a small portion of the set of all appropriate responses to a YNQ.",
        "Furthermore, for some YNQ's, none of these simple direct responses alone is.",
        "appropriate.",
        "While it is widely recognized (Hobbs, 1979, Pollack, 1982) that indirect responses' to YNQs represent an important option for respondents in natural discourse, standard theories of question-answering have not been revised accordingly.",
        "A practical consequence surfaces when attempts are made to support indirect responses to YNQs computationally.",
        "For lack of alternative representations, question-answering systems which would permit indirect responses must still represent YNQs as if the direct responses were the 'norm', and then resort to ad hoc manipulations to generate second-class 'indirect' responses.",
        "thus perpetuating an a.synitiletric distinction between 'direct' and 'indirect' responses.",
        "However.",
        "research under way on how a type of generalized conversational implicature, termed here scalar implicature, can be used to guide the generation and hiterpretion of indirect responses to YNQs suggests a revised representation for YNQs which accommodates a wide variety of responses in a uniform way."
