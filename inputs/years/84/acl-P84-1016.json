        "Wilks and Bien 1983, Barnden 1983. and Nilsson 1983: 9).",
        "Such a data base constitutes the \"knowledge\" (more accurately, the belipfs) of the system about these entities and about thaiL beliefs.",
        "Among the interrelated issues in knowledge representation that can be raised in such a context are those of multiple reference and the proper treatment of pronouns.",
        "For instance, is the person named 'Lucy' whom John believes to be rich the same as the person named 'Lucy' who is believed by the system to be young?",
        "How can the system (a) represent the person named 'Lucy' who is an object of its am belief without (b) confusing her with the person named 'Lucy' who is an object of Jahn's_ belief.",

        "A solution to this problem turns out to be a side effect of a solution to a subtler problem in pronominal reference, namely, the proper treatment of pronouns occurring within belief-contexts."
