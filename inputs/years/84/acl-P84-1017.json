        "In studying the pronss of answering questions from fifty pages of the Al Handbook, it is striking that such subsections as those describing problem representations are organized so as to define conceptual dictionary entries for the terms.",
        "First, class definitions are offered and their terms defined; then examples are given and the computational terms of the definitions are instantiated.",
        "Finally the technique described is applied to examples and redefined mathematically.",
        "Organizing these texts (by hand) into coherent hierarchic structures of discourse results in very usable conceptual dictionary definitions that are related by taxonomic and partitive relations, leaving gaps only for non-technical terms.",
        "For example, in 'give snapshots of the state of the problem at various stages in its solution,' terms such as 'state', 'problem, and 'solution' are defined by the text, while 'give', 'snapshots', and 'stages' are not.",
        "Our first, studies in representing and questioning this text have used semantic networks with a minimal number of case arcs to represent the sentences and Superset/Instance and 50f/Has arcs to represent, respectively, taxonomic and partitive relations between concepts.",
        "Equivalence arcs are also used to represent certain relations signified by uses of 'is' and apposition",
        "and *AND and *OR arcs represent conjunction.",
        "Since June 1982, eight question-answering systems have been written, some in procedural logic and some in compilable ELISP.",
        "Although we have so far studied questioning and data manipulation operations on about 40 pages of the text, the detailed study of inheritance costs discussed in this paper was based on 170 semantic relations (SRs), represented by 733 binary relations each composed of a node-arc-node triple.",
        "In this study the only inference rules used were those needed to obtain transitive closure for inheritance, but in other studies of this text a great deal of power is gained by using general inference rules for paraphrasing the question into the terms given by an answering text.",
        "The use of paraphrastic inference rules is computationally expensive and is discussed elsewhere [Simmons 1983].",
        "The text-knowledge base is constructed either as a set of triples using subscripted words, or by establishing node-numbers whose values are the complete SR and indexing these by the first element of every SR.",
        "The latter form, shown in Figure 1, occupies only about a third of the space that the triples require and neither form is clearly computationally better than the other.",
        "The first experiments with this text-knowledge base showed that the cost of following inheritance arcs, i.e. obtaining taxonomic closures for concepts, was very high; some questions required as much as a minute of central processor time.",
        "As a result it was necessary to analyze the process and to develop an understanding that would minimize any redundant computation.",
        "Our current system for questioning this fragment knowledge base has reduced the computation time to the range of 1/2 to less than 15 seconds per question in uncompiled ELISP on a DEC 2060.",
        "I believe the approach taken in this study is of particular interest to researchers who plan to use the taxonomic structure of ordinary dictionaries in support of natural language processing operations.",
        "Beginning with studies made in 1975 [Simmons and Chester, 1977] it was apparent to us that question-answering could be viewed profitably as a specialized form of theorem proving that",
