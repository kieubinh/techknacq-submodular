        "Several text production models implemented on computers are able to print grammatical sentences and coherent text (see e.g. contributions in Allen, 1983, Mann & Matthiessen, 1982).",
        "There is, however, to my knowledge no such verbal production system with spoken output, simulating spontaneous speech, except the experimental version of Commentator to be described.",
        "The task to design a speech production system cannot be solved just by attaching a speech synthesis device to the output instead of a printer.",
        "The whole production model has to be reconsidered if the system is to produce natural sound and prosody, in particular if the system is to have some psychological reality by simulating the hesitation pauses, and speech errors so common in spontaneous speech.",
        "This paper discusses some of the problems in the light of the computer model of verbal production presented in Sigurd (1982), Fornell (1983).",
        "For experimental purposes a simple speech synthesis device (VOTRAX) has been used.",
        "The Problem of producing naturally sounding utterances is also met in text-to-speech systems (see e.g. Carlson & Granstrtim, 1978).",
        "Such systems, however, take printed text as input and turn it into a phonetic representation, eventually sound.",
        "Because of the differences between spelling and sound such systems have to face special problems, e.g. to derive single sounds from the letter combinations th, El, sh, chin such words as the, thing, shy, change.",
        "2.",
        "Commentator as a speech production system The general outline of Commentator is presented in fig. 1.",
        "The input to this model is perceptual data or equivalent values, e.g. information about persons and objects on a screen.",
        "These primary perceptual facts constitute the basis for various calculations in order to derive secondary facts and draw conclusions about movements and relations such as distances, directions, right/left, over/under, front/back, closeness, goals and intentions of the persons involved etc.",
        "The Commentator produces comments consisting of grammatical sentences making up coherent and well-formed text (although often soon boring).",
        "Some typical comments on a marine scene are: THE SUB",
        "MARINE IS TO THE SOUTH OF THE PORT.",
        "IT IS APPROACHING THE PORT, BUT IT IS NOT CLOSE TO IT.",
        "THE DESTROYER IS APPROACHING THE PORT TOO.",
        "The original version commented on the movements of the two persons ADAM and EVE in front of a gate.",
        "A question menu, different for different situations, suggests topics leading to propositions which are considered appropriate under the circumstances and their truth values are tested against the primary and secondary facts of the world known to the system (the simulated scene).",
        "If a proposition is found to be true, it is accepted as a protosentence and verbalized by various lexical, syntactic, referential and texual subroutines.",
        "If, e.g., the proposition CLOSE (SUBMARINE, PORT) is verified after measuring the distance between the submarine and the port, the lexical subroutines try to find out how closeness, the submarine and the port should be expressed in the language (Swedish and English printing and speaking versions have been implemented).",
        "The referential subroutines determine whether pronouns could be used instead of proper or other nouns and textual procedures investigate whether connectives such as but, however, too, either and perhaps contrastive stress should be inserted.",
        "Dialogue (interactive) versions of the Commentator have also been developed, but it is difficult to simulate dialogue behaviour.",
        "A person taking part in a dialogue must also master turntaking, questioning, answering, and back-channelling (indicating, listening, evaluation).",
        "Expert systems, and even operative systems, simulate dialogue behaviour, but as everyone knows, who has worked with computers, the computer dialogue often breaks down and it is poor and certainly not as smooth as human dialogue.",
        "The Commentator can deliver words one at a time whose meaning, syntactic and textual functions are well-defined through the verbalization processes.",
        "For the printing version of Commentator these words are characterized by whatever markers are needed.",
        "3.",
        "A Simple speech synthesis device",
        "The experimental system presented in this paper uses a Votrax speech synthesis unit (for a presentation see Giarcia, 1982).",
        "Although it is a very simple system designed to enable computers to deliver spoken output such as numbers, short instructions etc, it has some experimental potentials.",
        "It forces the researcher to take a stand on a number of interesting issues and make theories about speech production more concrete.",
        "The Votrax is an inexpensive and unsophisticated synthesis device and it is not our hope to achieve perfect pronunciation using this circuit, of course.",
        "The circuit, rather, provides a simple way of doing research in the field of speech production.",
        "Votrax (which is in fact based on a circuit named SC-01 sold under several trade names)",
        "offers a choice of some 60 (American) English sounds (allophones) and 4 pitch levels.",
        "A sound must be transcribed by its numerical code and a pitch level, represented by one of the figures 0,1,2,3.",
        "The pitch figures correspond roughly to the male levels 65,90,110,130 Hz.",
        "Votrax offers no way of changing the amplitude or the duration.",
        "Votrax is designed for (American) English and if used for other languages it will, of course, add an English flavour.",
        "It can, however, be used at least to produce intelligible words for several other languages.",
        "Of course, some sounds may be lacking, e.g. Swedish u and v and some sounds may be slightly different, as e.g. Swedish sh-, ch-, r-, and 1-sounds.",
        "Most Swedish words can be pronounced intelligibly by the Votrax.",
        "The pitch levels have been found to be sufficient for the production of the Swedish word tones: accent 1 (acute) as in and-en (the duck) and accent 2 (grave) as in ande-n (the spirit).",
        "Accent 1 can be rendered by the pitch sequence 20 and accent 2 by the sequence 22 on the stressed syllable (the beginning) of the words.",
        "Stressed syllables have to include at least one 2.",
        "Words are transcribed in the Votrax alphabet by series of numbers for the sounds and their pitch levels.",
        "The Swedish word h8ger (right) may be given by the series 27,2,58,0,28,0,35,0, 43,0, where 27,58,28,35,43 are the sounds corresponding to h,8:,g,e,r, respectively and the figures 2,0 etc after each sound are the pitch levels of each sound.",
        "The word h8ger sounds American because of the 6, which sounds like the (retroflex) vowels in bird.",
        "The pronunciation (execution) of the words is handled by instructions in a computer program, which transmits the information to the sound generators and the filters simulating the human vocal apparatus.",
        "4.",
        "Some problems to handle",
        "4.1.",
        "Pauses and prosodic units in speech The spoken text produced by human beings is normally divided by pauses into units of several words (prosodic units).",
        "There is no generally accepted theory explaining the location and duration of the pauses and the intonation and stress patterns in the prosodic units.",
        "Many observations have, however, been made, see e.g. Dechert & Raupach (1980).",
        "The printing version of Commentator collects all letters and spaces into a string before they are printed.",
        "A speaking version trying to simulate at least some of the production processes cannot, of course, produce words one at a time with pauses corresponding to the word spaces, nor produce all the words of a 'sentence as one prosodic unit.",
        "A speaking version must be able to produce prosodic units including 3-5 words (cf Svartvik (1982)) and lasting 1-2 seconds (see JOnsson, Mandersson & Sigurd (1983)).",
        "How this should be achieved may be called the chunking problem.",
        "It has been noted that the chunks of spontaneous speech are generally shorter than in text read aloud.",
        "The text chunks have internal intonation and stress patterns often described as superimposed on the words.",
        "Deriving these internal prosodic patterns may be called the intra-chunk problem.",
        "We may also talk about the inter-chunk problem having to do with the relations e.g. in pitch, between succesive chunks.",
        "As human beings need to breathe they have to pause in order to inhale at certain intervals.",
        "The need for air is generally satisfied without conscious actions.",
        "We estimate that chunks of 1-2 seconds and inhalation pauses of about 0.5 seconds allow convenient breathing.",
        "Clearly, breathing allows great variation.",
        "Everybody has met persons who try to extend the speech chunks and minimize the pauses in order to say as much as possible, or to hold the floor.",
        "It has also been observed that pauses often occur where there is a major syntactic break (corresponding to a deep cut in the syntactic tree), and that, except for so-called hesitation pauses, pauses rarely occur between two words which belong closely together (corresponding to a",
        "shallow cut in the syntactic tree).",
        "There is, however, no support for a simple theory that pauses are introduced between the main constituents of the sentence and that their duration is a function of the depthof the cuts in the syntactic tree.",
        "The conclusion to draw seems rather to be that chunk cuts are avoided between words which belong closely together.",
        "Syntactic structure does not govern chunking, but puts constraints on it.",
        "Click experiments which show that the click is erroneously located at major syntactic cuts rather than between words which are syntactically coherent seem to point in the same direction.",
        "As an illustration of syntactic closeness we mention the combination of a verb and a following reflexive pronoun as in Adam n4rmar+sig Eva.",
        "(\"Adam approaches Eva\").",
        "Cutting between narmar and sii would be most unnatural.",
        "Lexical search, syntactic and textual planning are often mentioned as the reasons for pauses, so-called hesitation pauses, filled or unfilled.",
        "In the speech production model envisaged in this paper sounds are generally stored in a buffer where they are given the proper intonational contours and stress patterns.",
        "The pronunciation is therefore generally delayed.",
        "Hesitation pauses seem, however, to be direct (on-line) reflexes of searching or planning processes and at such moments there is no delay.",
        "Whatever has been accumulated in the articulation or execution buffer is pronounced and the system is waiting for the next word.",
        "While waiting (idling), some human beings are silent, others prolong the last sounds of the previous word or produce sounds, such as ah, eh, or repeat part of the previous utterence.",
        "(This can also be simulated by Commentator.)",
        "Hesitation pauses may occur anywhere, but they seem to be more frequent before lexical words than function words.",
        "By using buffers chunking may be made according to various principles.",
        "If a sentence termination (full stop) is entered in the execution buffer, whatever has been accumulated in the buffer may be pronounced setting the pitch of the final part at low.",
        "If the number of segments in the chunk being accumulated in the buffer does not exceed a certain limit a new word is only stored after the others in the execution buffer.",
        "The duration of a sound in Votrax is 0.1 second on the average.",
        "If the limit is set at 15 the system will deliver chunks about 1.5 seconds, which is a common length of speech chunks.",
        "The system may also accumulate words in such a way that each chunk normally includes at least one stressed word, or one syntactic constituent (if these features are marked in the representation).",
        "The system may be made to avoid cutting where there is a tight syntactic link, as e.g. between a head word and enclitic morphemes.",
        "The length of the chunk can be varied in order to simulate different speech styles, individuals or speech disorders."
