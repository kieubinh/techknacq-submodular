        "This paper present a new method for parsing English sentences.",
        "The parser called LUTE-EJ parser is combined with case analysis and ATNG-based analysis.",
        "LUTE-EJ parser has two interesting mechanical characteristics.",
        "One is providing a structured buffer, Structured Constituent Buffer, so as to hold previous fillers for a case structure, instead of case registers before a verb appears in a sentence.",
        "The other is extended HOLD mechanism(in ATN), in whose use an embedded clause, especially a \"bedeleted\" clause, is recursively analyzed by case analysis.",
        "This parser's features are (1)extracting a case filler, basically as a noun phrase, by ATNG-based analysis, including recursive case analysis, and (2)mixing syntactic and semantic analysis by using case frames in case analysis."

        "In a lot of natural language processing including machine translation, ATNG-based analysis is a usual method, while case analysis is commonly employed for Japanese language processing.The parser described in this paper consists of two major parts.",
        "One is ATNG-based analysis for getting case elements and the other is case-analysis for getting a semantic clause analysis.",
        "LUTE-EJ parser has been implemented on an experimental machine translation system LUTE (Language Understander, Translator & Editor) which can translate English into Japanese and vice versa.",
        "LUTE-EJ is the English-to-Japanese version of LUTE.",
        "In case analysis, two ways are generally used for parsing.",
        "One way analyzes a sentence from left to right, by using case registers.",
        "Case fillers which fill each case registers are major participants of constituents, for example SUBJECT, OBJECT, PP(Prepositional Phrase)'s and so on, in a sentence.",
        "In particular, before a verb appears, at least one participant(the subject) will be registered, for example, in the AGENT register.",
        "The other method has two phases on the analysis processing.",
        "In the first processing, phrases are extracted as case elements in order to fill the slots of a case frame.",
        "The second is to choose the adequate case element among the extracted phrases for a certain case slot and to continue this process for the other phrases and the other case slots.",
        "In this method, there are no special actions, i.e. no registering before a verb appears.",
        "(Winograd [83] ) English question-answering system PLANES (Waltz [78] ) uses a special kind of case frames, \"concept case frames\".",
        "By using them, phrases in a sentence, which are described by using particular \"subnets\" and semantic features (for a plane type and so on), are gathered and an action of a requirement (a sentence) is constructed."

      "heading": "2.1. LUTE-EJ Parser's Domain",
      "text": [
        "The domain treated by LUTE-EJ parser is what might be called a set of \"complex sentences and compound sentences\".",
        "Let S be an element of this set and let CLAUSE be a simple sentence (which might include an embedded sentence).",
        "Now, if MAJOR-CL and MINOR-CL are principal clause and subordinate clause, respectively, S can be written as follows.",
        "where NHD(Noun HeaDer) is \"premodification\" and NMP(Noun Modifier Phrase) is \"postmodification\".",
        "Thus, NMP is a set including various kinds of embedded finite clauses, relative or be-deleted relative finite clauses.",
        "2.2.",
        "LUTE-EJ Parser Overview After morphological analysis with looking up words for an input sentence in the dictionary, an input sentence analysis is begun from left to right.",
        "Thus, after a verb has been seen, it makes progress to analyze a CLAUSE by referring to the case frame corresponding to the verb, as each slot in the case frame is filled with an NP or an object of PP.",
        "A case slot consists of three elements: one semantic filler condition slot and two syntactic and semantic marker slots.",
        "Here, a preposition is directly used as a syntactic marker.",
        "Furthermore, four pseudo markers, \"subject\", \"object\", \"indirect-object\" and \"complement\", are used.",
        "As a semantic marker, a so-called deep case is used (now, 41 ready for this case system).",
        "Then, LUTE-EJ Parser extracts the semantic structure implied in a sentence (S or CLAUSE) as an event or state instance created from a case frame, which is a class or a prototype.",
        "An NP is parsed by the ATNG-based analysis in order to decide a case slot filler (now, 81 nodes on this ATNG).",
        "Next, the reason why the case analysis and ATNG-based analysis are merged will be stated.",
        "It has two main points.",
        "One point is about the depth of embedded structures.",
        "For example, the investigation on the degree of a CLAUSE complexity resulted in the necessity to handle a high degree of complexity with efficiency.",
        "The NMP structure is also more complex.",
        "In particular, embedded VPs or ADJPHs appear recursively.",
        "Therefore, a recursive process for analyzing NP is needed.",
        "The other point is about the representation of grammatical structures.",
        "Grammar descriptions should be easy to read and write.",
        "Representations by using case frames make rules of any kind for NMP very simple, describing no NMP contents.",
        "In order to deal with the above two points, combining the case analysis with ATNG-based analysis solves those problems.",
        "Verbal NMP(VTYPE-NMP)s are dealt with by recursive case-analyzing 2.3.",
        "Structured Constituent Buffer As mentioned above, syntactic and semantic structures are basically derived from a sentence by analyzing a CLAUSE.",
        "Analysis control depends on the case frame, when the verb has been just appearing in a CLAUSE.",
        "However until seeing the verb, all of the phrases, which may be noun phrases with embedded clauses, PPs or ADVs before the verb, must be held in certain registers or buffers.",
        "Here, a new buffer, STRuctured CONstituent Buffer(STRCONB), is introduced to hold these phrases.",
        "This buffer has surface constituents structure, and consists of specific slots.",
        "There are two slot types.",
        "One is a register to control English analysis and the other is a buffer to hold some mentioned-above constituents.",
        "The first type has two slots ; one is similar to a blackboard and registers the names of unfilled-slots.",
        "The other stacks the names of filled-slots in order of phrase appearance and is used for backtracking in the analysis.",
        "The second slot type involves several kinds of procedures.",
        "One of the main procedures, \"getphrase\", extracts some candidates for the slot filler from the left side of a CLAUSE.",
        "It fills the slot with these candidates.",
        "This procedure takes one argument, which is a constituent marker, \"prepositional-phrase\", \"noun-phrase\" and so on (in practice, using each abbreviation).",
        "For example, when the following sentence is given, the evaluation for \"(getphrase 'preph)\"in LISP returns one symbol generated for the head prepositional phrase, \"In the machine language\", and determines the slot filler.",
        "(sl) \"In the machine language each basic machine operation is represented by the numerical code that invokes it in the computer, and However, if the argument is 'verb\", this procedure only tells that the top word of unprocessed CLAUSE is a verb.",
