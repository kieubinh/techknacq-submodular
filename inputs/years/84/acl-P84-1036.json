        "In previous papers it has been pointed out that in a well-structured Lexical Data Base it becomes possible to detect automoticaliy.",
        "and to evidence through interactive queries a number of morphological, syntactic, or semantic relationships between lexical entries, such as synonymy, hyponymy, hyperonymy.",
        "derivation.",
        "case-argument, lexical field, etc.",
        "The present article examines hyponymy, as an example of paradigmatic relation, and what can be called \"restriction or modification\" relation, as a syntagmatic relation.",
        "by restriction or modification relation, i mean that port of a so-called \"aristotelian\" definition which has the function of linking the \"genus\" and the \"differentia specifica\".",
        "When evidenced in a lexicon, the hyponymy relation produces hierarchical trees partitioning the lexicon in many semantically coherent subsets.",
        "These trees are not created once and for all, but it is important that they are procedurally activated at the query moment..",
        "While evidencing the second relation considered, one can investigate as to whether it is possible to discover any correlation between lexical or grammatical features in definitions and particular kinds of \"definienda\", and thus try to answer questions such as the following: \"Are there any connections between these restriction relations and the fundamental ways of definition, i.e. the criterial parameters by which people defines things?\" I am trying to develop and exploit the idea of considering the language of dictionary definitions as a particular sublanguage within natural language.",
        "This perspective cannot obviously be adopted for subject matter restrictions in definitions, but only for the purpose of the text, i.e. the specific communicative goal.",
        "From this restriction on the purpose of the text, certain lexico-grammatical restrictions do result, which prove to be very useful.",
        "As to the restrictions on the lexical richness of definitions, these are not due to the fact that they relate to a specific domain of discourse, but only to the property of closure (although not satisfied at 100%) that the defining vocabulary should in principle be simpler and more restricted than the defined set of lemmas, i.e. the former should be a proper subset of the latter.",
        "This kind of quantitative restriction on the vocabulary of definitions would not be of any interest in itself, if it were not accompanied by other kinds of constraints both on a) the lexical, and on b) the grammatical side.",
        "a) From the frequency list of the words used in definitions (about 800,000 word-occurrences, and 75,000 word-types), it appears in fact that some words have a much greater importance than in normal language, as evidenced by a comparison with the data of the Lessico di Frequenza della Lingua Wiliam, Conterporanea (Bortolini et al., 1971).",
        "These are the defining generic terms",
        "which are traditionally used by lexicographers, such as ACT, EFFECT, PERSON, OBJECT, WHO, PROCESS, CAUSE, etc.",
        "It is not by chance that these same concepts are of relevance in many Artificial Intelligence systems.",
        "b) Not only single words, or classes of words, are particularly relevant in the defining sublanguage.",
        "There are also lexical patterns and syntactic patterns which occur with great frequency, and which play a very special role in defining sentences.",
        "The combination of these constraints can be and actually is very useful, when trying to exploit the information contained in definitions, and when transforming an archive of natural language definitions into a knowledge base.",
        "structured as a network.",
        "Some important parts of knowledge are in fact already retrievable in interactive mode from the Italian Lexical Data Base, which has recently been restructured.",
        "Analyses on large corpora of definitions, carried out on many dictionaries (Amsler, 1980; Calzolari, 1983a, 1983b; Michiels, Noel.",
        "1982) have in fact shown that the definitions sublanguage displays several regularities of lexical and syntactic occurrences and patterns.",
        "These general lexical classes and the classes of recurrent patterns can be more or less easily captured for instance by pattern-matching rules, and if possible characterized with formal rules."

        "Hyponymy is the most important relation to be evidenced in a lexicon.",
        "Due to its taxonomic nature, it gives the lexicon, when implemented, a particular hierarchical structure: its result is obviously not a tree, but many tangled hierarchies (Amsler, 1980).",
        "Instead of evidencing and labelling this relation by hand, I have tried to characterize it procedurally.",

        "185.000 for 103,000 lemmas).",
        "was based almost exclusively on the position of the \"genus\" term at the beginning of the definitional phrases, giving Nouns, Verbs, and Adjectives as superordinates of defined entries of the same lexical category.",
        "Ad hoc subroutines solved exceptional cases where a) quantifiers, or other modifiers preceded the genus term (e.g. aletta ---> piccolo gruppo di penne dietro l'angolo dell'ala), or b) more than one genus was present in the definition (e.g. assordare attutire, smorzarsi detto di suono), or c) a prepositional phrase, usually of locative type, was at the beginning of the phrase (e.g. piazzato ---> nel rugby, ca/do al pallone collocato sul terreno).",
        "Even though the first immediate purpose of this procedure is of classificational nature, the ultimate goal is the extraction and formalization of the most relevant relationship between lexical items which is implicitly stored in any standard printed dictionary.",
        "It is in fact now possible to retrieve in the lexical data base not only all the definitions in which any possible word-form appears, together with the defined lemmas (e.g. SUONO appears in 328 definitions), but also to retrieve on-line, if desired, only the definitions in which the given word-form is used as a superordinate, therefore with the list of its hyponyms (e.g. the same word SUONO is used as superordinate of only 65 words, i.e. of a subset of the preceding set containing MUSICA, RUMORE, SQUILLÂ°, SUSSURRO, etc.).",

        "The links produced can be analyzed, evaluated, and, if necessary, interactively corrected.",
        "From explorations on the trees thus obtained, we can also try to set up classes and subclasses of superordinates, on the basis of the upper nodes to which many other nodes are connected as descendants.",
        "Only as an example, the identification criterion for the noun-class \"SET-OF\" containing 1NSIEME, GRUPPO, COLLEZIONE, COMPLESSO, AGGREGATO.",
        "etc., among the set of noun-superordinates, is the fact that they are linked one to the other in the tree which results from querying the data base.",
        "Their hyponyms will obviously be for the most part collective nouns.",
        "The identification of word-classes like this one leads to the next step in the formalization of the hyponymy relation, which will consist in the insertion of a label indicating a semantic class to these sets of superordinates.",
        "It will thus be possible to retrieve, for example, all the nouns generically definable as \"SET-OF\", independently of the particular word denoting a set used in definitions.",
        "Since it is already possible to trace these chains of hyponyms going upwards or downwards for more than one level, one can immediately ask whether, for example, MASSERIA belongs to the set of collectives even if it is defined as MANDRIA.",

        "The implementation of these links allows to produce another kind of partitioning within the lexical system, and permits to better investigate the internal structure of words.",
        "A procedure of the kind exemplified above, based on pattern-matching, is possible for a good number of definition types: for example, with a different format, for many adjectives: def NP 7 Adj RELY ' VP where several groups of definitions are found to share a common underlying structure in terms of the restriction relation involved, in spite of other lexical and syntactic_ differences."
