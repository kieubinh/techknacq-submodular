        "This paper describes an analysis method which uses heuristic knowledge to find local syntactic structures of Chinese sentences.",

        "Our purpose is to guide the global analysis through the search space, to avoid unnecessary computation.",
        "To realize this, we use a set of special words that appear in commonly used patterns in Chinese.",
        "We call them \"characteristic words\" .",
        "They enable us to pick out fragments that might figure in the syntactic structure of the sentence.",
        "Knowledge concerning the use of characteristic words enables us to rate alternative fragments, according to pattern statistics, fragment length, distance between characteristic words, and so on.",
        "The preprocessing system proposes to the global analysis level a most \"likely\" partial structure.",
        "In case this choice is rejected, backtracking looks for a second choice, and so on.",
        "For our system, we use 200 characteristic words.",
        "Their rules are written by 101 automata.",
        "We tested them against 120 sentences taken from a Chinese physics text book.",
        "For this limited set, correct partial structures were proposed as first choice for 94% of sentences.",
        "Allowing a 2nd choice, the score is 98%, with a 3rd choice, the score is 100%."

        "Being a language in which only characters ( ideograms ) are used, Chinese language has specific problems.",
        "Compared to languages such as English, there are few formal inflections to indicate the grammatical category of a word, and the few inflections that do exist are often omitted.",
        "In English, postfixes are often used to distinguish syntactical categories (e.g. translation, translat: difficult, dificulty), but in Chinese it is very common to use the same word (characters) for a verb, a noun, an adjective, etc..",
        "So the ambiguity of syntactic category of words is a big problem in Chinese analysis.",
        "In another example, in English, \"-ing\" is used to indicate a participle, or \"-ed\" can be used to distinguish passive mode from active.",
        "In Chinese, there is nothing to indicate participle, and although there is a word, \"0. \"",
        ", whose function is to indicate passive mode, it is often omitted.",
        "Thus for a verb occurring in a sentence, there is often no way of telling if it transitive or intransitive, active or passive, participle or predicate of the main sentence, so there may be many ambiguities in deciding the structure it occurs in.",
        "If we attempt Chinese language analysis using a computer, and try to perform the syntactic analysis in a straightforward way, we run into a combinatorial explosion due to such ambiguities.",
        "What is lacking, therefore, is a simple method to decide syntactic structure."

        "In the Chinese language, there is a kind of word (such as preposition, auxiliary verb, modifier verb, adverbial noun, etc..), that is used as an independant word (not an affix).",
        "They usually have key functions, they are not so numerous, their use is very frequent, and so they may be used to reduce ambiguities.",
        "Here we shall call them \"characteristic words\".",
        "Several hundreds of these words have been collected by linguists(2),and they are often used to distinguish the detailed meaning in each part of a Chinese sentence.",
        "Here we selected about 200 such words, and we use them to try to pick out fragments of the sentence and figure out their syntactic structure before we attempt global syntactic analysis and deep meaning analysis.",
        "The use of the characteristic words is described below.",
        "a) Category decision: Some characteristic words may serve to decide the category of neighboring words.",
        "For example, words such as \"3 \", .41\", \"44\", are rather like verb postfixes, indicating that the preceding word must be a verb, even though the same characters might spell a noun.",
        "Words like \" \", \"1k \", can be used as both verb and auxiliary.",
        "If, for example, is followed by a word that could be read as either a verb or a noun, then this word is a verb and \"t\" is an auxiliary.",

        "with a preposition such as \"le\", \"11\", \"9\", and finish on a characteristic word belonging to a subset of adverbial nouns that are often used to express position, direction, etc..",
        "When such characteristic words are spotted in a sentence, they serve to forecast a prepositional phrase.",
        "Another example is the pattern used a little like \"... is to ...\" in English, so when we find it, we may predict a verbal phrase from to \"0\", that is in addition the predicate VP of the sentence.",
        "These forecasts make it more likely for the subsequent analysis system to find the correct phrase early.",
        "c) Role deciding The preceding rules are rather simple rules like a human might use.",
        "With a computer it is possible to use more complex rules (such as involving many exceptions or providing partial knowledge) with the same efficiency.",
        "For example, a rule can not usually with certainty decide if a given verb is the predicate of a sentence, but we know that a predicate is not likely to precede a characteristic word such as \" or \"it .",
        "or follow a word like .0., or \"W. We use this kind of rule to reduce the range of possible predicates.",
        "This knowledge can be used in turn to predict the partial structure in a sentence, because the verbal proposition begins with the predicate and ends at the end of the sentence.",
        "In the example shown in Fig .1, fragments f3 and f4 are obtained through step (a) (see above), fl through (b), and f2 and f5 through (c).",
