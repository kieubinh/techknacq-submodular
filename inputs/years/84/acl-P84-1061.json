        "The paper characterizes natural language inferencing in the TIBA0 method of question-answering, focussing on three aspects: (i) specification of the structures on which the inference rules operate, (ii) classification of the rules that have been formulated and implemented up to now, according to the kind of modification of the input structure the rules invoke, and (iii) discussion of some points in which a prorerly designed inference procedure may helo the search of the answer, and vice versa.",

        "Outline of the TIBA2 Method Ihen the TIBA (text-and-inference based answering of auestions) project was designed, main emphasis was laid on the automatic build-up of the stock of knowledge from the (non-pre-edited) input text.",
        "The experimental system based on this method converses automatically the natural language input (both the questions and new Fieces of information, i.e. eTech sentences in their usual form) into the representations of meaning (tectogrammatical representations, TR s); these TR-s serve as input structures for the inference procedure that enriches the set of TR-s selected by the system itself as possibly relevant for an answer to the input ouestion.",
        "In this enriched set suitable TR's for direct and indirect answers to the given question are retrieved, and then transfered by a synthesis procedure into the output (surface) form if sentences (for an outline of the method as such, see Eaji6ova, 1970;- Jaji6ovd and Sgall, 1931; Sgall, 1982).",
        "B. I'hat Kind of Structure Inferences :Mould Be Based on To decide what kind of structures the inference procedure should operate, one has to take into account several criteria, some of which seemingly contradict each other: the structures should be as simple and transparent as possible, so that inferencing can be perforeted in a well-defined way, and at the same time, these structures Jhould be as°expressive\"as the natural language sentences are, not to lose any piece of information captured by the text.",
        "\"atural language has a major drawback in its ambiguity: when a listener is told that the criticism of the Polish delegate was fully justified, one does not know (unless indicated by the context or situation) whether s/he should infer that someone criticized the Polisn delegate, or whether the Polish delegate criticized someone/something.",
        "On the other hand, there are means in natural language that are not preserved by most languages that logicians.",
        "have used for drawing consequences, but that are critical for the latter to be drawn correctly: when a listener is told that !Zussian is spoken in SIBERIA, s/he draws conclusions partly different from those when s/he is told that in Siberia, AlESIAN is spoken (cabitals denoting the intonation center); or, to borrow one of the widely discussed examples in linguistic writings, if one hears that Joan called eary a 77=LICAA and that then she insulted LIM, one should infer that the speaker considers \"heing a Rpbublican- an insult; this is not the case, if the speaker said that then she INSULTED him.",
        "These and similar considerations have led the authors of TIBAO to a strong conviction that the structures representing knowledge and serving as the base for inferencing in a cuestion-answering system with a natural language interface should he linguistically based: they should he deprived of all ambiguities of natural language and at the same time they should preserve all the information relevant for",

        "Thd retrieval of an answer in the enriched set of assertions (TR s) is performed in the following steps!",
        "(a) first it is checked whether the lexical value of the root of the TR is identical with that of the TR of the question; if the question has the form \"What is performed (done, carried out) by X?\", then the TR from the enriched set must include an action verb as a label of its root;",
        "(b) the path leading from the root to the wh-word is checked (yes-no questions are excluded from the first stage of our experiments); the rightmost path in the relevant TR must coincide with the wh-path in its lexical labels, contextual boundness, grammatemes and functors (with some possible deviations determined by conditions of substitutability: Singular - Plural, Manner - Accompaniment, etc.",
        "); the wh-word in the question must be matched by a lexical unit of the potential answer, where the latter may be further expanded; (c) if also the rest of the two compared TR s meet the conditions of identity or",
        "substituttbility, the relevant TR is marked as a full answer to the given question; if this is not the case but at least one of the nodes depending on a node included in the wh-path meets these conditions, then the relevant TR is marked as an indirect (partial) answer.",
        "B.",
        "Towards an Effective Application of Inference Rules In the course of the experiments it soon became clear that even with a very limited number of inference rules the memory space was rapidly exceeded.",
        "It was then necessary to find a way how to achieve an effective application of the inference rules and at the same time not to restrict the choice of relevant answers.",
        "Among other things, the following issues should be taken into consideration: The rules substituting subtrees for subtrees are used rather frequently, as well as those substituting only a label of one node (in the Q-tree, i.e. one element of the complex symbol in the CDS), preserving the overall structure of the tree untouched.",
        "These rules operate in both directions, so that it appears as useful to use in such cases a similar strategy as with synonymous expressions, i.e. to decide on a single representation both in the TR of the question and that included in the stock of knowledge; this would lead to an important decrease of the number of TR's that undergo further inference transformations.",
        "Only those TR's are selected for the final steps of the retrieval of the answer (see point (a) in III.A) that coincide with the TR of the question in the lexical label of the root, i.e. the main verb.",
        "If the inference rules are ordered in such a way that the rules changing an element of the label of the root are applied before the rest of the rules, then the first step of the retrieval procedure can be made before the application of other inference rules.",
        "This again leads to a con",
        "siderable reduction of the number of TR-s on which the rest of the inference rules are applied; only such TR-s are left in the stock of relevant TR s (i)that agree with the TR of the question in the label of the root (its lexical label may belong to superordinated or subordinated lexical values: device - amplifier, etc.",
        "), (ii) that irclude the lexical label of the root oc the question in some other place than at the root of the relevant TR, (iii) if the question has the form \"Which N ...\", (i.e. the wh-node depends on its head in the relation of general relationship), then also those TR-s are preserved that contain an identical N node (noun) on any level of the tree.",
        "The use of Q-language brings about one difficulty, namely that the rules have to be formulated for each level for the tree separately.",
        "It is possible to avoid this complication by a simple temporary rearrangement of the Q-tree, which results in a tree in which all nodes with lexical labels are on the same level; the rules for a substitution of the lexical labels can be then applied in one step, after which the tree is returned into its original shape.",
        "These and similar considerations have led us to the following ordering of the individual steps of the inference and retrieval procedure:",
        "1. application of rules transforming the input structure to such an extent that the lexical label of the root of the tree is not preserved in the tree of a potential answer; 2. a partial retrieval of the answer according to the root of the tree; 3. application of rules substituting other labels pertinent to the root of the tree; 4. partial retrieval of the answer according to the root of the tree; 5. application of inference rules operating on a single tree; 6. application of inference rules operating on two trees; 7. the steps (b) and (c) from the retrieval of the answer (see III.A above)."
