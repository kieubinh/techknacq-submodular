        "One of the promising approaches to analyzing task-oriented dialogues has involved modeling the plans of the speakers in the task domain.",
        "The earliest work in this area involved tracking the topic of a dialogue by tracking the progress of the plan in the task domain [Grosz, 1977], as well as explicitly incorporating speech acts into a planning framework [Cohen and Perrault, 1979; Allen and Perrault, 1980].",
        "A good example of the current status of these approaches can be found in [Carberry, 1983].",
        "In general, these models work well as long as the topic follows the task structure closely, but they have difficulty in accounting for clarification subdialogues and topic change.",
        "Sidner and Israel [1981] suggest a solution to a class of clarification subdialogues that correspond to debugging the plan in the task domain.",
        "They allow utterances to talk about the task plan, rather than always being a step in the plan.",
        "Using their suggestions, as well as our early work [Allen et al., 1982; Litman, 1983], we have developed a model based on a hierarchy of plans and metaplans that",
        "accounts for the debugging subdialogues they discussed, as well as other forms of clarification and topic shift.",
        "Reichman [1981] has a structural model of discourse that addresses clarification subdialogues and topic switch in unconstrained spontaneous discourse.",
        "Unfortunately, there is a large gap between her abstract model and the actual processing of utterances.",
        "Although not the focus of this paper, we claim that our new plan recognition model provides the link from the processing of actual input to its abstract discourse structure.",
        "Even more important, this allows us to use the linguistic results from such work to guide and be guided by our plan recognition.",
        "For example, consider the following two dialogue fragments.",
        "The first was collected at an information booth in a train station in Toronto [Horrigan, 19771, while the second is a scenario developed from protocols in a graphics command and control system that displays network structures [Sidner and Bates, 1983].",

        "While still \"task-oriented,\" these dialogues illustrate phenomena characteristic of spontaneous conversation.",
        "That is, subdialogues correspond not only to subtasks (utterances (6)-(7) and (10)-(11)), but also to clarifications ((3)-(4)), debugging of task execution ((8)-(9)), and other types of topic switch and resumption.",
        "Furthermore, since these are extended discourses rather than unrelated question/answer exchanges, participants need to use the information provided by previous utterances.",
        "For example, (3) would be difficult to understand without the discourse context of (1) and (2).",
        "Finally, these dialogues illustrate the following of conversational conventions such as terminating dialogues (utterance (5)) and answering questions appropriately.",
        "For example, in response to (1), the clerk could have conveyed much the same information with \"The departure location of train 537 is gate seven,\" which would not have been as appropriate.",
        "To address these issues, we are developing a plan-based natural language system that incorporates knowledge of both task and discourse structure.",
        "In particular, we develop a new model of plan recognition that accounts for the recursive nature of plan suspensions and resumptions.",
        "Section 2 presents this model, followed in Section 3 by a brief description of the discourse analysis performed and the task and discourse interactions.",

        "During a dialogue, we shall build a stack of such plans, each plan on the stack referring to the plan below it, with the domain-dependent task plan at the bottom.",
        "As an example, a clarification subdialogue is modeled by a plan structure that refers to the plan that is the topic of the clarification.",
        "As we shall see, the manipulations of this stack of plans is similar to the manipulation of topic hierarchies that arise in discourse models.",
        "To allow plans about plans, i.e., metaplans, we need a vocabulary for referring to and describing plans.",
        "Developing a fully adequate formal model would be a large research effort in its own right.",
        "Our development so far is meant to be suggestive of what is needed, and is specific enough for our preliminary implementation.",
        "We are also, for the purpose of this paper, ignoring all temporal qualifications (e.g., the constraints need to be temporally qualified), and all issues involving beliefs of agents.",
        "All plans constructed in this paper should be considered mutually known by the speaker and hearer.",
        "We consider plans to be networks of actions and states connected by links indicating causality and subpart relationships.",
        "Every plan has a header a parameterized action description that names the plan.",
        "The parameters of a plan are the parameters in the header.",
        "Associated with each plan is a set of constraints, which are assertions about the plan and its terms and parameters.",
        "The use of constraints will be made clear with examples.",
        "As usual, plans may also contain prerequisites, effects, and a decomposition.",
        "Decompositions may be sequences of actions, sequences of subgoals to be achieved, or a mixture of both.",
        "We will ignore most prerequisites and effects thoughout this paper, except when needed in examples.",
        "For example, the first plan in Figure 1 summarizes a simple plan schema with a header \"BOARD (agent, train).\" with parameters \"agent\" and \"train,\" and with the constraint \"depart-station (train) = Toronto.\" This constraint captures the knowledge that the information booth is in the Toronto station.",

        "Throughout this paper we assume a typed logic that will be implicit from the naming of variables.",
        "Thus, in the above formula, agent is restricted to entities capable of agency, term is a description of some object, and plan is restricted to objects that are plans.",
        "Plans about plans, or metaplans, deal with specifying parts of plans, debugging plans, abandoning plans, etc.",
        "To talk about the structure of plans we will assume the predicate IS-PARAMETER-OF (parameter, plan), which asserts that the specified parameter is a parameter of the specified plan.",
        "More formally, parameters are skolem functions dependent on the plan.",
        "Other than the fact that they refer to other plans, metaplans are identical in structure to domain plans.",
        "Two examples of metaplans are given in Figure 2.",
        "The first one, SEEK-ID-PARAMETER, is a plan schema to find out a suitable description of the parameter that would allow the plan to be executed.",
        "It has one step in this version, namely to achieve KNOWREF (agent, parameter, plan), and it has two constraints that capture the relationship between the metaplan and the plan it concerns, namely that \"parameter\" must be a parameter of the specified plan, and that its value must be presently unknown.",
        "The second metaplan, ASK, involves achieving KNOWREF (agent, term, plan) by asking a question and receiving back an answer.",
        "Another way to achieve KNOWREF goals would be to look up the answer in a reference source.",
        "At the train station, for example, one can find departure times and locations from a schedule.",
        "We are assuming suitable definitions of the speech acts, as in Allen and Perrault [1980].",
        "The only deviation from that treatment involyes adding an extra argument onto each (nonsurface) speech act, namely a plan parameter that provides the context for the speech act For HEADER: SEEK-ID-PARAMETER (agent, parameter, plan) STEPS: achieve KNOWREF (agent, parameter, plan) CONSTRAINTS: IS-PARAMETER-OF (parameter, plan) – KNOWREF (agent, parameter, plan) HEADER: ASK (agent, term, plan) STEPS: do REQUEST (agent, agent2, INFORMREF (agent2, agent, term, plan), plan) do INFORMREF (agent2, agent, term, plan) EFFECTS: KNOWREF (agent, term, plan) CONSTRAINTS: – KNOWREF (agent, term, plan)",
        "example, the action INFORMREF (agent, hearer, term, plan) consists of the agent informing the hearer of a description of the term with the effect that KNOWREF (hearer, term, plan).",
        "Similarly, the action REQUEST (agent, hearer, act, plan) consists of the agent requesting the hearer to do the act as a step in the specified plan.",
        "This argument allows us to express constraints on the plans suitable for various speech acts.",
        "There are obviously many more metaplans concerning plan debugging, plan specification, etc.",

        "The lower plans may be only partially specified, and be filled in by later utterances.",
        "An example of this appears in considering Dialogue 2 from the first section.",
        "but there is no space to discuss this here (see [Litman and Allen, forthcoming]).",
        "The knowledge-based relationships were crucial to the analysis of indirect speech acts (ISA) in Allen and Perrault [1980].",
        "Following the argument above, this means that the indirect speech act analysis will always occur in a metaplan to the task plan.",
        "This makes sense since the ISA analysis is a communicative phenomena.",
        "As far as the task is concerned, whether a request was indirect or direct is irrelevant.",
        "In our present system we have a set of metaplans that correspond to the common conventional ISA.",
        "These plans are abstractions of inference paths that can be derived from first principles as in Allen and Perrault.",
        "Similar \"compilation\" of ISA can be found in Sidner and Israel [1981] and Carberry [1983].",
        "It is not clear in those systems, however, whether the literal interpretation of such utterances could ever be recognized.",
        "In their systems, the ISA analysis is performed before the plan recognition phase.",
        "In our system, the presence of \"compiled\" metaplans for ISA allows indirect forms to be considered easily, but they are just one more option to the plan recognizer.",
        "The literal interpretation is still available and will be recognized in appropriate contexts.",
        "For example, if we set up a plan to ask about someone's knowledge (say, by an initial utterance of \"I need to know where the schedule is incomplete\"), then the utterance \"Do you know when the Windsor train leaves?\" is interpreted literally as a yes/no question because that is the interpretation explicitly expected from the analysis of the initial utterance.",
        "Sidner and Israel [1981] outlined an approach that extended Allen and Perrault in the direction we have done as well.",
        "They allowed for multiple plans to be recognized but did not appear to relate the plans in any systematic way.",
        "Much of what we have done builds on their",
        "suggestions and outlines specific aspects that were left unexplored in their paper.",
        "In the longer version of this paper [Litman and Allen, forthcoming], our analysis of the dialogue from their paper is shown in detail.",
        "Grosz [1979], Levy [1979], and Appelt [1981] extended the planning framework to incorporate multiple perspectives, for example both communicative and task goal analysis; however, they did not present details for extended dialogues.",
        "ARGOT [Allen et al., 1982] was an attempt to fill this gap and led to the development of what has been presented here.",
        "Pollack [1984] is extending plan recognition for understanding in the domain of dialogues with experts; she abandons the assumption that people always know what they really need to know in order to achieve their goals.",
        "In our work we have implicitly assumed appropriate queries and have not yet addressed this issue.",
        "Wilensky's use of meta planning knowledge [1983] enables his planner to deal with goal interaction.",
        "For example, he has meta-goals such as resolving goal conflicts and eliminating circular goals.",
        "This treatment is similar to ours except for a matter of emphasis.",
        "His meta-knowledge is concerned with his planning mechanism, whereas our metaplans are concerned with acquiring knowledge about plans and interacting with other agents.",
        "The two approaches are also similar in that they use the same planning and recognition processes for both plans and metaplans."

        "Although both Sidner and Israel [1981] and Carberry [1983] have extended the Allen and Perrault paradigm to deal with task plan recognition in extended dialogues, neither system currently performs any explicit discourse analysis.",
        "As described earlier, Carberry does have a (non-discourse) tracking mechanism similar to that used in [Grosz, 1977]; however, the mechanism cannot handle topic switches and resumptions, nor use surface linguistic phenomena to decrease the search space.",
        "Yet Carberry is concerned with tracking goals in an information-seeking domain, one in which a user seeks information in order to formulate a plan which will not be executed during the dialogue.",
        "(This is similar to what happens in our train domain.)",
        "Thus, her recognition procedure is also not as tied to the task structure.",
        "Supplementing our model with metaplans provided a unifying (and cleaner) framework for understanding in both task-execution and information-seeking domains.",
        "Reichman [1981] and Grosz [1977] used a dialogue's discourse structure and surface phenomena to mutually account for and track one another.",
        "Grosz concentrated on task-oriented dialogues with subdialogues corresponding only to subtasks.",
        "Reichman was concerned with a model underlying all discourse genres.",
        "However, although she distinguished communicative goals from speaker intent her research was not concerned with either speaker intent or any interactions.",
        "Since our system incorporates both types of analysis, we have not found it necessary to perform complex communicative goal recognition as advocated by Reichman.",
        "Knowledge of plans and metaplans, linguistic surface phenomena, and simple discourse conventions have so far sufficed.",
        "This approach appears to be more tractable than the use of rhetorical predicates advocated by Reichman and others such as Mann et al.",
        "[1977] and McKeown [1982].",
        "Carbonell [1982] suggests that any comprehensive theory of discourse must address issues of metalanguage communication, as well as integrate the results with other discourse and domain knowledge, but does not outline a specific framework.",
        "We have presented a computational model which addresses many of these issues for an important class of dialogues."
