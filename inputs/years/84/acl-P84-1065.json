        "Phenomena reflecting immediate focus in text have been studied by several linguists.",
        "Terminology and definitions for these vary widely; some of the names that have emerged include topic/comment, given/new, and theme/rheme.",
        "These linguistic concepts describe distinctions between functional roles elements play in a sentence.",
        "In brief, they can be defined as follows:",
        "• Topic: Constituents in the sentence that represent what the speaker is talking about.",
        "Comment labels constituents that represent what s/he has to say about that topic (see Sgall, Hajicova, and Benesova, 1973; Lyons, 1968; Reinhart, 1981).",
        "• Given: Information that is assumed by the speaker to be derivable from context where context may mean either the preceding discourse or shared world knowledge.",
        "New labels information that cannot be derived (see Halliday, 1967; Prince, 1979; and Chafe, 1976).",
        "• Theme: The Prague School of linguists (see Firbas, 1966; Firbas, 1974) define the theme",
        "of a sentence as elements providing common ground for the conversants.",
        "Rheme refers to elements that function in conveying the information to be imparted.",
        "In sentences containing elements that are contextually dependent, the contextually dependent elements always function as theme.",
        "Thus, the Prague School version is close to the given/new distinction with the exception that a sentence always contains a theme, while it need not always contain given information2.",
        "What is important here is that each of these concepts, at one time or another, has been associated with the selection of various syntactic structures.",
        "For example, it has been suggested that new information and rheme usually occur toward the end of a sentence (e.g., Halliday, 1967; Lyons, 1968; Sgall et al., 1973; Firbas, 1974).",
        "To place this information in its proper position in the sentence, structures other than the unmarked active sentence may be required (for example, the passive).",
        "Structures such as it-extraposition, there-insertion, topicalization, and left-dislocation3 have been shown to function in the introduction of new information into discourse (Sidner, 1979; Prince, 1979), often with the assumption that it will be talked about for a period of time (Joshi and Weinstein, 1981).",
        "Pronominalization is another linguistic device associated with these distinctions (see Akmajian, 1973; Sidner, 1979).",
        "One major difference between linguistic concepts and immediate focus is that focusing describes an active process on the part of speaker and listener.",
        "However, the speaker's immediate focus influences the surfacing of each of the linguistic concepts in the text.",
        "It influences topic (and Halliday's theme) in that it specifies what the speaker is focusing on (i.e., talking about) now.",
        "But it also influences given information in that immediate focus is linked to something that has been mentioned in the previous utterance and thus, is already present in the reader's consciousness.",

        "KDS (Mann, 1981) uses heuristics that sometimes dictate that a complex sentence is appropriate, but the heuristics are not based on general linguistic principles.",
        "Ana (Kukich, 1983) can also combine propositions, although, like Davey, the decision is based on rhetorical relations rather than functional information.",
        "In sum, those systems that are capable of generating complex sentences tend to rely on rhetorical, semantic, or syntactic information to make their decisions.",
        "Those systems that make use of functional information have not investigated the general problem of choosing between complex and simple sentences."
