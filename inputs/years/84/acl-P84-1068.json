        "The most promising results in computational linguistics and specifically in Machine Translation (MT) have been obtained where applications were limited to languages for special purposes and to restricted text types (Kittredge, Lehrberger, 1982).",
        "In light of these prospects, the prototype MT system described below' should be seen as an experiment in the carputational treatment of a particular sublanguage.",
        "The project is meant to serve both as a didactic tool and as a vehicle for research in MT.",
        "The development of a large-scale operational system is not envisaged at present.",
        "The following research objectives have been defined for this project: - to establish linguistic specifications of the sublanguage as a basis for automatic processing; - to develop translation algorithms tailored to a computational treatment of the sUblanguage.",
        "The emphasis of the research lies in defining the depth of linguistic analysis necessary to adequately treat the complexity of the text type with a view to acceptable machine translation.",
        "It is the conjecture of our research group that, within the particular sublanguage defined by our corpus, acceptable translation does not necessarily depend on standard linguistic structural analysis but can be obtained with a relatively shallow analysis.",
        "Thus, as a working hypothesis, the principle of 'flat trees' has been adopted for the representation of the linguistic data.",
        "Flat trees, as opposed to deep trees, only partially reflect the dependency struc-,",
        "Project sponsored by the Swiss government.",

        "The adoption of flat trees goes hand in hand with the further hypothesis that the sublanguage can be translated mechanically with only minimal semantic analysis similarly to the TAUMMETE0 system (Chevalier, et al., 1978)."
