        "For generative grammarians, such as Chomsky (1965), a primary problem of linguistics is to explain how the language learner can acquire the grammar of his or her language on the basis of the limited evidence available to him or her.",
        "Chomsky introduced the idealization of instantaneous acquisition, which I adopt here, in order to model the language acquisition device as a function from primary linguistic data to possible grammars, rather than as a process.",
        "Assuming that the set of possible human languages is small, rather than large, appears to make acquisition easier, since there are fewer possible grammars to choose from, and less data should be required to choose between them.",
        "Accordingly, generative linguists are interested in delimiting the class of possible human languages.",
        "This is done by looking for properties common to all human languages, or universals.",
        "Together, these universals form universal grammar, a set of principles that all human languages obey.",
        "Assuming that universal grammar is innate, the language learner can use it to restrict the number of possible grammars he or she must consider when learning a language.",
        "As part of universal grammar, the language learner is supposed to innately possess an evaluation metric, which is used to \"decide\" between two grammars when both are consistent with other principles of universal grammar and the available language data."

        "This approach deals with acquisition without reference to a specific discovery procedure, and so in some sense the results of such research are general, in that in principle they apply to all discovery procedures.",
        "Still, I think that there is some utility in considering the problem of acquisition in terms of actual discovery procedures.",
        "Firstly, we can identify the parts of a grammar that are underspecified with respect to the available data.",
        "Parts of a grammar or a rule are strongly data determined if they are fixed or uniquely determined by the data, given the requirement that overall grammar be empirically correct.",
        "By contrast, a part of a grammar or of a rule is weakly data determined if there is a large class of grammar or rule parts that are all consistent with the available data.",
        "For example, if there are two possible analyses that equally well account for the available data, then the choice of which of these analyses should be incorporated in the final grammar is weakly data determined.",
        "Strong or weak data determination is therefore a property of the grammar formalism and the data combined, and independent of the choice of discovery procedure.",
        "Secondly, a discovery procedure may partition a phonological system in an interesting way.",
        "For instance, in the discovery procedure described here the evaluation metric is not called apon to compare one grammar with another, but rather to make smaller, more local, comparisons.",
        "This leads to a factoring of the evaluation metric that may prove useful for its further investigation.",
        "Thirdly, focussing on discovery procedures forces us to identify what the surface indications of the various constructions in the grammar are.",
        "Of course, this does not mean one should look for a one-to-one correspondence between individual grammar constructions and the surface data; but rather complexes of grammar constructions that interact to yield particular patterns on the surface.",
        "One is then investigating the logical implications of the existence of a particular constructions in the data.",
        "Following from the last point, I think a discovery procedure should have a deductive rather than enumerative structure.",
        "In particular, procedures t hat work essentially by enumerating all possible (sub)grammars and seeing which ones work are not only in general very inefficient, but also not very insightful.",
        "These discovery by enumeration procedures simply give us a list of all rule systems that are empirically adequate as a result, but they give us no idea as to what properties of these systems were crucial in their being empirically adequate.",
        "This is because the structure imposed on the problem by a simple recursive enumeration procedure is in general not related to the intrinsic structure of the rule discovery problem."

Since both rule contexts and words can be written as sets of features, I use \"contexts\" to refer both to rule contexts and to words.",

        "For example, if the alternation involves nasalization of a vowel, something that usually only occurs in the context of a nasal, and one of the contexts in Sc involves the feature nasal but the other C in Sc do not, a reasonable requirement is that the discovery procedure should select the context involving the feature nasal as the appropriate context C for the rule.",
        "Another possibility is that Sc's containing more than one member indicates to the discovery procedure t hat it simply has too little data to determine the grammar.",
        "and it defers making a decision on which C to use until it has the relevant data.",
        "The decision as to which of these possibilities is correct is is not unimportant, and may have interesting empirical consequences regarding language acquisition.",
        "McCarthy (1981) gives some data on a related issue.",
        "Spanish does not tolerate word initial sC clusters, a fact which might be accounted for in two ways; either with a rule that inserts e before word initial sC clusters, or by a constraint on well-formed underlying structures (a redundancy rule) barring word initial sC.",
        "McCarthy reports that either constraint is adequate to account for Spanish morphophonemics, and there is no particular language internal evidence to prefer one over the other.",
        "The two accounts make differing predictions regarding the treatment of loan words.",
        "The e insertion rule predicts that loan words beginning with sC should receive an initial e (as they do: esnob, esmoking, esprey), while the well-formedness constraint makes no such prediction.",
        "McCarthy's evidence from Spanish therefore suggests that the human acquisition procedure can adopt one potential analysis and rejects an other without empirical evidence to distinguish between them.",
        "However, in the Spanish case, the two potential analyses differ as to which components of the grammar they involve (active phonological processes versus lexical redundancy rules) which affects the overall structure of the adopted grammar to a much greater degree than the choice of one C from Sc.",
