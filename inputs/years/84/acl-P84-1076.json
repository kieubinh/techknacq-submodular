        "[McDonald 80]) and McKeown (the TEXT system [McKeown 82]).",
        "All of these are informative in other areas but, except for McKeown, they say very little about text organization.",
        "Appelt acknowledges the need for a discourse component, but his system operates only at the level of single utterances.",
        "Davey's excellent system uses a simple fixed narrative text organization for describing tic-tac-toe games: moves are described in the sequence in which they occurred, and opportunities not taken are described just before the actual move which occurred instead.",
        "Mann and Moore's KDS system organizes the text, but only at the whole-text and single-utterance levels.",
        "It has no recursion in text structure, and no notion of text structure components which themselves have text structure.",
        "McDonald took as his target what he called \"immediate mode,\" attempting to simulate spontaneous unplanned speech.",
        "His system thus represents a speaker who continually works to identify something useful to say next, and having said it, recycles.",
        "It operates without following any particular theory of text structure and without trying to solve a text organization problem.",
        "McKeown's TEXT system is the only one of this collection that has any hint of a scale-insensitive view of text structure.",
        "It has four programmed \"schemas\" (limited to four mainly by the computational environment and task).",
        "Schemas are defined in terms of a sequence of text regions, each of which satisfies a particular \"rhetorical predicate.\" The sequence notation specifies optionality, repeatability, and allowable alternations separately for each sequence element.",
        "Recursion is provided by associating schemas with particular predicates and allowing segments of text satisfying those predicates to be expressed using entire schemas.",
        "Since there are many more predicates than schemas, the system as a whole is only partially recursive.",
        "McKeown's approach differs from RST in several ways:",
        "1.",
        "McKeown's schemas are ordered, those of RST unordered.",
        "2.",
        "Repetition and optionality are specified locally; in PSI they are specified by a general convention.",
        "3.",
        "McKeown's schemas do not have a notion of a nuclear element.",
        "4.",
        "McKeown has no direct correlate of the RST relation.",
        "Some schema elements are implicitly relational (e.g., an \"attributive\" element must express an attribute of something, but that thing is not located as a schema element).",
        "The difference is reduced by McKeown's direct incorporation of \"focus.\" The presence of nuclear elements in PSI and its diverse collection of schemas make it more informative about the functioning of the texts it describes.",
        "Its relations make the",
        "connectivity of the text more explicit and contribute strongly to an account of implicit communication.",
        "[Cohen & Perrault 79] Cohen, P. R., and C. R. Perrault, \"Elements of a plan-based theory of speech acts,\" Cognitive Science 3, 1979.",
        "Beyond these differences, McKeown's schemes give the impression of defining a more finely divided set of distinctions over a narrower range.",
        "The four schemes of TEXT seem to cover a range included within that of the RST Inform schema, which relies strongly on its five variants of the \"elaboration\" relation.",
        "Thus RST is more comprehensive, but possibly coarser-grained in providing varieties of description.",
        "Our role for text organization is also different from McKeown's. In the TEXT system, the text was organized by a schema-controlled search over thinoe that are permissible Ip say, In constructive RST, text will be organized by goal pursuit, i.e., by aoal-based ;election.",
        "For McKeown's task the difference might not have been important, but the theoretical differences are large.",
        "They project very different roles for the writer, and very different top-level general statements about the nature of text.",
        "Relative to all of these prior efforts, RST offers a more comprehensive basis for text organization.",
        "Its treatment of order, optionality, organization around a nucleus, and the relations between parts are all distinct from previous text generation work, and all appear to have advantages."
