        "There is a tendency for non-syntactic analysers and semantic grammars in automatic text understanding.",
        "However, this proposal is motivated by the fact that syntactic structures.",
        "once analyzed and classified in terms of semantic relatedness, provide much information for understanding.",
        "This is supported by the fact that human beings use syntactically related sentences when they ask questions about texts.",
        "The system we are proposing has the following elements:",
        "I) Verb classes.",
        "2) Mapping of noun phrases between or among some verb classes.",
        "3) Direction of possible inference between the classes with information on tense and aspect.",
        "Our experiment, in which subjects are asked to make true-false questions about certain texts, revealed that native speakers think that they understand texts by deducting sentences lexically or semantically related.",
        "For instance, a human being relates questions such as 'Did Mary go to a theater?' to a sentence in texts such as 'John took Mary to a theater.' Or, by the same sentence, he understands that 'Mary was in the theater.'"
