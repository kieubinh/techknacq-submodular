        "A SYNTACTIC APPROACH TO DISCOURSE SEMANTICS Livia Polanyi and Remko Scha English Department University of Amsterdam Amsterdam The Netherlands ABSTRACT A correct structural analysis of a discourse is a prerequisite for understanding it.",
        "This paper sketches the outline of a discourse grammar which acknowledges several different levels of structure.",
        "This grammar, the \"Dynamic Discourse Model\", uses an Augmented Transition Network parsing mechanism to build a representation of the semantics of a discourse in a stepwise fashion, from left to right, on the basis of the semantic representations of the individual clauses which constitute the discourse.",
        "The intermediate states of the parser model the intermediate states of the social situation which generates the discourse.",
        "The paper attempts to demonstrate that a discourse may indeed be viewed as constructed by means of sequencing and recursive nesting of discourse constituents.",
        "It gives rather detailed examples of discourse structures at various levels, and shows how these structures are described in the framework proposed here.",
        "I DISCOURSE STRUCTURES AT DIFFERENT LEVELS If a discourse understanding system is to be able to assemble the meaning of a complex discourse fragment (such as a story or an elaborate description) out of the meanings of the utterances constituting the fragment, it needs a correct structural analysis of it.",
        "Such an analysis is also necessary to assign a correct semantic interpretation to clauses as they occur in the discourse; this is seen most easily in cases where this interpretation depends on phenomena such as the discourse scope of temporal and locative adverbials, the movement of the reference time in a narrative, or the interpretation of discourse anaphora.",
        "The Dynamic Discourse Model, outlined in this paper, is a discourse grammar under development which analyses the structure of a discourse in order to be able to deal adequately with its semantic aspects.",
        "It should be emphasized at the outset that this system is a formal model of discourse syntax and semantics, but not a computer implementation of such a model.",
        "For a system to be able to understand a discourse, it must be able to analyse it at several different levels.",
        "1.",
        "Any piece of talk must be assigned to one Interaction -- i.e., to a socially constructed verbal exchange which has, at any moment, awell-defined set of participants.",
        "2.",
        "Virtually every interaction is viewed by its",
        "participants as belonging to a particular predefined genre -- be it a doctor-patient interaction, a religious ceremony, or a casual chat.",
        "Depending on the genre, certain participants may have specific roles in the verbal exchange, and there may be a predefinedagenda specifying consecutive parts of the interaction.",
        "An interaction which is socially \"interpreted\" in such a fashion is called a Speech Event (Hymes,1967,1972).",
        "3.",
        "A stretch of talk within one Speech Event may be characterized as dealing with one Topic.",
        "4.",
        "Within a Topic, we may find one or more Discourse Units (DU's) -- socially acknowledged units of talk which have a recognizable \"point\" or purpose, while at the same time displaying a specific syntactic/semantic structure.",
        "Clear examples are stories, procedures, descriptions, and jokes.",
        "5.",
        "When consecutive clauses are combined into one syntactic/semantic unit, we call this unit a discourse constituent unit (dcu).",
        "Examples are: lists, narrative structures, and various binary structures (\"A but B\", \"A because B\", etc.).",
        "6.",
        "Adjacency Structures may well be viewed as a kind of dcu, but they deserve special mention.",
        "They are two or three part conversational routines involving speaker change.",
        "The clearest examples are question-answer pairs and exchanges of greetings.",
        "7.",
        "The smallest units which we shall deal with at the discourse level are clauses and operators.",
        "Operators include \"connectors\" like \"and\", \"or\", \"because\", as well as \"discourse markers\" like \"well\", \"so\", \"incidentally\".",
        "The levels of discourse structure just discussed are hierarchically ordered.",
        "For instance, any DU must be part of a Speech Event, while it must be built up out of dcu's. The levels may thus be viewed as an expansion of the familiar linguistic hierarchy of phoneme, morpheme, word and clause.",
        "This does not mean, however, that every discourse is to be analysed in terms of a five level tree structure, with levels corresponding to dcu, DU, Topic, Speech Event and Interaction.",
        "To be able to describe discourse as it actually occurs, discourse constituents of various types must be allowed to be embedded in constituents of the same and other types.",
        "We shall see various examples of this in later sections.",
        "It is worth emphasizing here already that \"high level constituents\" may be embedded in \"low level constituents\".",
        "For instance, a dcu may be interrupted by a clause which initiates another Interaction.",
        "Thus, a structural description of the unfolding discourse would include an Interaction as embedded in the dcu.",
        "In",
        "this way, we can describe \"intrusions\", \"asides to third parties\", and other interruptions of one Interaction by another.",
        "In the description of discourse semantics, the level of the dcu's (including the adjacency structures) plays the most central role: at this level the system defines how the semantic representation of a complex discourse constituent is constructed out of the semantic representations of its parts.",
        "The other levels of structure are also of some relevance, however:",
        "- The Discourse Unit establishes higher level semantic coherence.",
        "For instance, the semantics of different episodes of one story are integrated at this level.",
        "- The Topic provides a frame which determines the interpretation of many lexical items and descriptions.",
        "- The Speech Event provides a script which describes the conventional development of the discourse, and justifies assumptions about the purposesofdis-course participants.",
        "- The Interaction specifies referents for indexicals like \"I\", \"you\", \"here\", \"now\"."

      "heading": "II THE DYNAMIC DISCOURSE MODEL",
      "text": [
        "Dealina with linguistic structures above the clause level is an enterprise which differs in an essential way from the more common variant of linguistic activity which tries to describe the internal structure of the verbal symbols people exchange.",
        "Discourse linguistics does not study static verbal objects, but must be involved with the social process which produces the discourse -- with the ways in which the discourse participants manipulate the obligations and possibilities of the discourse situation, and with the ways in which their talk is constrained and framed by the structure of this discourse situation which they themselves created.",
        "The structure one may assign to the text of a discourse is but a reflection of the structure of the process which produced it.",
        "Because of this, the Dynamic Discourse Model that we are developing is only indirectly involved in trying to account for the a posteriori structure of a finished discourse; instead, it tries to trace the relevant states of the social space in terms of which the discourse is constructed.",
        "This capability is obviously of crucial importance if the model is to be applied in the construction of computer systems which can enter into actual dialogs.",
        "The Dynamic Discourse Model, therefore, must construct the semantic interpretation of a discourse on a clause by clause basis, from left to right, yielding intermediate semantic representations of unfinished constituents, as well as setting the semantic parameters whose values influence the interpretation of subsequent constituents.",
        "A syntactic/semantic system of this sort may very well be fromulated as an Augmented Transition Network grammar (Woods, 1970), a non-deterministic parsing system specified by a set of transition networks which may call each other recursively.",
        "Every Speech Event type, DU type and dcu type is associated with a transition network specifying its internal structure.",
        "As a transition network processes the consecutive constituents of a discourse segment, it builds up, step by step, a representation of the meaning of the segment.",
        "This representation is stored in a register associated with the network.",
        "At any stage of the Process, this register contains a representation of the meaning of the discourse segment so far.",
        "An ATN parser of this sort models important aspects of the discourse process.",
        "After each clause, the system is in a well-defined state, characterized by the stack of active transition networks and, for each of them, the values in its registers and the place where it was interrupted.",
        "When we say that discourse participants know \"where they are\" in a complicated discourse, we mean that they know which discourse constituent is being initiated or continued, as well as which discourse constituents have been interrupted where and in what order -- in other words, they are aware of the embedding structure and other information captured by the ATM configuration.",
        "The meaning of most clause utterances cannot be determined on the basis of the clause alone, but involves register values of the embedding dcu -- as when a question sets up a frame in terms of which its answer is interpreted (cf. Scha, 1983) or when, to determine the temporal reference of a clause in a narrative, one needs a \"reference time\" which is established by the foregoing part of the narrative (section III B 2).",
        "From such examples, we see that the discourse constituent unit serves as a framework for the semantic interpretation of the clauses which constitute the text.",
        "By the same token, we see that the semantics of an utterance is not exhaustively described by indicating its illocutionary force and its propositional content.",
        "An utterance may also cause an update in one or more semantic registers of the dcu, and thereby influence the semantic interpretation of the following utterances.",
        "This phenomenon also gives us a useful per7 spective on the notion of interruption which was mentioned before.",
        "For instance, we can now see the difference between the case of a story being interrupted by a discussion, and the superficially similar case of a story followed by a discussion which is, in its turn, followed by another story.",
        "In the first case, the same dcu is resumed and all its register values are still available; in the second case, the first story has been finished before the discussion and the re-entry into a storyworld is via a different story.",
        "The first story has been closed off and its register values are no longer avilable for re-activation; the teller of the second story must reinitialize the variables of time, place and character, even if the events of the second story concern exactly the same characters and situations as the first.",
        "Thus, the notions of interruption and resumption have not only a social reality which is experienced by the interactants involved.",
        "They also have semantic consequences for the building and interpretation of texts.",
        "Interruption and resumption are often explicitly signalled by the occurrence of \"discourse markers\".",
        "Interruption is signalled by a PUSH-marker such as \"incidentally\", \"by the way\", \"you know\" or \"like\".",
        "Resumption is signalled by a POP",
        "-markers such as \"O.K.\", \"well\", \"so\" or \"anyway\".",
        "(For longer lists of discourse marking devices, and somewhat more discussion of their functioning, see Reichman (1981) and Polanyi and Scha(1983b).)",
        "In terms of our ATN description of discourse structure, the PUSH and POP-markers do almost exactly what their names suggest.",
        "A PUSH-marker signals the creation of a new embedded discourse constituent, while a POP-marker signals a return to an embedding constituent (though not necessarily the immediately embedding one), closing off the current constituent and all the intermediate ones.",
        "The fact that one POP-marker may thus create a whole cascade of discourse-POPs was one of Reichman's (1981) arguments for rejecting the ATN model of discourse structure.",
        "We have indicated before, however, that accommodating this phenomenon is at worst a matter of minor technical extensions of the ATNfor-malism (Polanyi and Scha, 1983b); in the present paper, we shall from now on ignore it.",
        "III DISCOURSE CONSTITUENT UNITS A.",
        "Introduction.",
        "This section reviews some important ways in which clauses (being our elementary discourse constituent units) can be combined to form complex discourse constituent units (which, in most cases, may be further combined to form larger dcu's, by recursive application of the same mechanisms).",
        "For the moment, we are thus focussing on the basic discourse syntactic patterns which make it possible to construct complex discourses, and on the semantic interpretation of these patterns.",
        "Sections IV and V will then discuss the higher level structures, where the interactional perspective on discourse comes more to the fore.",
        "To be able to focus on discourse level phenomena, we will assume that the material to be dealt with by the discourse grammar is a sequence consisting of clauses and operators (connectors and discourse markers).",
        "It is assumed that every clause carries the value it has for features such asspeak-er, clause topic, propositional content (represented by a formula of a suitable logic), preposed constituents (with thematic role and semantics), tense, mood, modality.",
        "(The syntactic features we must include here have semantic consequences which can not always be dealt with within the meaning of the clause, since they may involve discourse issues.)",
        "The semantics of a dcu is built up in parallel with its syntactic analysis, bythelsame recursive mechanism.",
        "When clauses or dcu's are combined to form a larger dcu, their meanings are combined to form the meaning of this dcu.",
        "Along with registers for storing syntactic features and semantic parameters, each dcu has a register which is used to build up the logical representation of its meaning.",
        "Since the syntactic and semantic rules operate in parallel, the syntactic rules have the possibility of referring to the semantics of the constituents they work on.",
        "This possibility is in fact used in certain cases.",
        "We shall see an example in section III C 1.",
        "Complex discourse constituent units can be divided into four structurally different types:",
        "- sequences, which construct a dcu out of arbitrarily many constituents (e.g.: lists, narratives).",
        "- expansions, consisting of a clause and a subordinated unit which \"expands\" on it.",
        "- structures formed by a binary operator, such as \"A because B\", \"If A then B\".",
        "- adjacency structures, involving speaker change, such as question/answer pairs and exchanges of greetings.",
        "In the next subsections, III B and III C, we shall discuss sequences and expansions in more detail.",
        "One general point we should like to make here already: sequences as well as expansions correspond to extensional semantic operations.",
        "The propositions expressing the meanings of their constituents are evaluated with respect to the same possible world -- the successive constituents simply add up to one description.",
        "(We may note that some of the binary structures which we shall not consider further now, certainly correspond to in-tensional operations.",
        "\"If A then B\" is a clear example.)",
        "Since we will not discuss adjacency structures in any detail in this paper, the problem of accommodating speaker change and different illocutionary forces in the discourse semantics will be left for another occasion."

        "We now leave the discussion of the basic syntactic/semantic mechanisms for building discourse out of clauses, and turn to the higher levels of analysis, where considerations involving the goals of the interaction start to come in.",
        "First of all, we shall discuss the entities which Wald (1978) calls Discourse Units*, corresponding closely to the entities which Longacre (1983) simply calls \"Discourses\".",
        "Discourse Units (DU's) are socially acknowledged units of talk, which have a recognizable point or purpose, and which are built around one of the sequential dcu's discussed in section III B. Discourse Unit types which have been investigated include stories (Labov, 1972; Wald, 1978; Polanyi, 1978b), descriptions of various sorts (Linde, 1979; Ehrich and Koster, 1983), procedural discourse and hortatory discourse (see various references in Longacre (1983)).",
        "* Wald restricts his notion to monologic discourse fragments.",
        "It seems reasonable to generalize it to cases where more than one speaker may be involved.",
        "Because of the pragmatic relation between the Discourse Unit and the surrounding talk (specifically, the need to appear \"locally occasioned\" (Jefferson, 1979) and to make a \"point\" (Polanyi, 1978b), the central part of the Discourse Unit usually is not a piece of talk standing completely on its own feet, but is supported by one or more stages of preparatory and introductory talk on one end, and by an explicit closure and/or conclusion at the other.",
        "This may be illustrated by taking a closer look at conversationally embedded stories -- the paradigmatic, and most widely studied, DU type.",
        "specific past dap,: en,rance setting narrative dcu:exit story A typical story is initiated with entrance talk which sets the topic and establishes the relation with the preceding talk.",
        "Often we find an abstract, and some kind of negotiation about the actual telling of the story.",
        "Then follows the \"setting\" which gives the necessary background material for the story*.",
        "Then follows the \"core\": a specific past narrative, relating a sequence of events.",
        "The story is concluded with \"exit talk\" which may formulate the point of the story quite explicitly, connecting the storyworld with more general discourse topics.",
        "For instance, one story in Labov's (1972) collection has as its entrance talk an explicit elicitation and its response to it Q: What was the most important fight that you remember, one that sticks in your mind... A: Well, one (I think) was with a girl.",
        "There is an extensive section describing the setting: \"Like I was a kid you know.",
        "And she was the baddest girl, the baddest girl in the neighborhood.",
        "If you didn't bring her candy to school, she would punch you in the mouthf and you had to kiss herwhen she'd tell you.",
        "This girl was only twelve years old, man, but she was a killer.",
        "She didn't take no junk; she whupped all her brothers.\" Then, the event chain starts, and finally ends: \"And I came to school one day and I didn't have any money.",
        "(....) And I hit the girl: powwww!",
        "and I put something on it.",
        "I win the fight.\" The story is explicitly closed off: \"That was one of the most important.\" Not every specific past narrative may be the core of a story.",
        "Because of the interactional status of the story (its requirement to be \"pointful\") there are other properties which are noticeable in the linguistic surface structure -- notably the occurrence of \"evaluation\" (Polanyi, 1978b) and of a \"peak\" in the narrative line (Lonoacre,1093).",
        "* That the necessary background material must be given before the actual event sequence, is attested by a slightly complicated storytelling strategy, described in Polanyi (1978a) as the \"True Start\" repair: the storyteller first plunges right into the event sequence, then breaks off the narrative line and restarts the telling of the story, now with the insertion of the proper background data.",
        "The structural description of stories, given above, should probably be further elaborated to account for the phenomenon of episodes: a story may be built by consecutive pieces of talk which constitute separate narrative dcu's. At the level of the story DU, the meanings of these narratives must be integrated to form a description of one storyworld rather than many.",
        "In English and other Western European languages, the Discourse Unit seems to be a largely interactional notion.",
        "Its constituents are pieces of talk defined by the independently motivated dcu-grammar.",
        "The DUgrarrnaronly imposes constraints on the content-relations between its constituent dcu's; it does not define structures which an adequate dcu grammar would not define already.",
        "In other languages of the world, the situation seems to be somewhat different: there are syntactically defined ways for building DU's out of dcu's, which were not already part of the dcu grammar.",
        "For details, one should investigate, for instance, the various works referred to in Longacre (1983).",
        "Also in this body of work, however, one can find numerous cases where the structural difference between a DU (\"Discourse\", inLongacre'sterms) and the corresponding sequential dcu (\"paragraph\", in his terms) is not very clear.",
        "V INTERACTIONS AND SPEECH EVENTS The system we present here is intended to analyze the verbal material occurring in one Interaction.",
        "By an Interaction we mean a social situation in which a set of participants is involved in an exchange of talk.",
        "Each of the participants knows to be taking part in this situation, arid assigns to the others the same awareness.",
        "By focussing on one interaction, we single out, from all the talk that may be going on at one place at the same time, the talk which belongs together because it is intended to be part of the same social situation.",
        "(Cf. Goffman, 1979) The set of participants of an Interaction determines the possible speakers and addressees of the talk occurring in it.",
        "Similarly, the physical time and place of an interaction provide the referents for indexicals like \"now\" and \"here\".",
        "A simple two person Interaction would be described as an exchange of greetings, followed by a piece of talk as defined by a lower level of the grammar, followed by an exchange of farewells.",
        "Greetings and farewells are the only kinds of talk which directly engage the Interaction level of description -- they correspond to signing on and signing off to the list of participants.",
        "An \"unframed\" interaction between \"uninterpreted\" people is a rare event.",
        "People use a refined system of subcategorization to classify the social situations they engage in.",
        "These subcategories, which we shall call Speech Event types (cf. Hymes, 1967, 1972), often assign a specific purpose to the interaction, specify roles for the participants, constrain discourse topics and conversational registers, and, inmany cases, specify a conventional sequence of component activities.",
        "The most precisely circumscribed kinds of Speech Events are formal rituals.",
        "Speech Event types characterized by grammars which are less explicit and less detailed include service encounters (Merritt, 1978), doctor-patient interactions (Byrne and Long, 1976), and casual conversations.",
        "The structure of talk which is exchanged in order to perform a task will follow the structure of some goal/subgoal analysis of this task (Grosz, 1977).",
        "In Speech Event types which involve a more or less fixed goal, this often leads to a fixed grammar of subsequent steps taken to attain it.",
        "For instance, students looking at transcripts of the ongoings in a Dutch butchershop, consistently found the following sequential structure in the interaction between the butcher and a customer:",
        "1. establishing that it is this customer's turn.",
        "2. the first desired item is ordered, and the order is dealt with, , the nth desired item is ordered and the order is dealt with.",
        "3. it is established that the sequence of orders is finished.",
        "4. the bill is dealt with.",
        "5. the interaction is closed off.",
        "butchershop interaction Each of these steps is filled in in a large variety of ways -- either of the parties may take the initiative at each step, question/answer sequences about the available meat, the right way to prepare it, or the exact wishes of the customer may all be embedded in the stage 2 steps, and clarification dialogs of various sorts may occur.",
        "In other words, we find the whole repertoire of possibilities admitted by the dcu grammar ( particularly, the part dealing with the possible embeddings of adjacency structures within each other).",
        "Thus, we note that the arcs in a Speech Event diagram such as the above do not impose syntactic constraints on the talk they will parse.The labels on the arcs stand for conditions on the content of the talk -- i.e., on the goals and topics that it may be overtly concerned with.",
        "An important Speech Event type with characteristics slightlydifferent from the types mentioned so far, is the \"casual conversation\".",
        "In a casual conversation, all participants have the same role: to be \"equals\"; no purposes are pre-established; and the range of possible topics is open-ended, although conventionally constrained."
