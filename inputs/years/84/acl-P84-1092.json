        "Computational Neurolinguistics (CN) incorporates initial assumptions about language processing that are often indirectly referenced in other computational approaches to language study.",
        "These assumptions focus on neural-like computational mechanisms (Ballard 1982; Feldman 1981; Gigley, 1982a; 1982b; 1983a; McClelland and Rumelhart, 1981) which subserve language behavior (Lavorel and Gigley, 1983).",
        "Furthermore, CN approaches to different aspects of language processing include extensive use of behavioral data.",
        "Research exists within the CN paradigm along various behaviorally defined dimensions.",
        "These are at the level of phonetic speech studies that simulate speech errors (Le-cours and Lhermitte, 1969; Reggia and Sanjeev, 1984), a model of aphasic language production, JARGONAUT, (Lavorel, 1982), as well as within lesionable models at a neural network level.",
        "These latter models simulate association, discrimination, and recognition of patterns employing associative network models that have been tuned or have adaptively learned to relate certain discriminations (Gordon, 1982; Wood, 1978; 1980).",
        "1 The research described in this paper was supported by an NIH-CNRS research exchange grant entitled \"Computational Neurolinguistics\" and was undertaken at Laboratoire de Neuropsychologie ExpÃªrimentale, INSERM-Unite 94, BRON, France.",
        "There is much philosophical and linguistic discussion of the nature of the representations that exist in humans and form the basis of our cognitive function.",
        "We will not present the debate here, but instead will claim that the CN models we build include the assumption that the internal representation of concepts, words, and phonemes are given by the overall activation state of the \"network\" representation within the system at a moment in time.",
        "Furthermore, this means that unless activations are interpreted externally (in our case by labels so that we can talk about them), they in and of themselves reflect the \"mental\" representation.",
        "To this end, CN models present time-synchronized snapshots of an interactive, parallel, distributed process that are interpreted to represent hierarchies of linguistic knowledge that can be distinguished during processing, such as a recognized word, a grammatical interaction, or even a disambiguated meaning.",
        "Before turning to our efforts to adapt a working implementation within the CN paradigm, HOPE, into one that can process French with equal facility, l'ESPERANCE, we will present necessai'y background to illustrate why focusing on the \"process\" of language, as it can exist, based on our current understanding of brain function, contributes significantly to our increased understanding of representations which have been defined within linguistics, psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics, and Al approaches to language study."

      "text": [
        "In developing CN models, the claim is that by focusing on process independently from representation, we gain several perspectives that are unattainable from other more usual approaches.",
        "CN models include processing which is neurally plausible.",
        "Language is seen as the behavioral result of an interactive, time-dependent process.",
        "This frees us from pre-specifying either all \"correct\" linguistic possibilities for constraint satisfaction at all levels of representation, or all possible errors or recognized omissions as in more flexible approaches (Hayes and Mouradian, 1981; Kwasny and Sondheimer, 1981; Lehnert, Dyer, Johnson, Yong, and Hurley, 1983; Weischeidel and Black, 1980).",
        "We utilize what has been discovered by these other approaches to be the most likely, most plausible set of relevant features to tune our \"normal\" model.",
        "Through interconnections at a metalinguistic level, between recognized phonetic word representations, grammatical aspects of meaning, and specific referential meaning for disambiguated words, CM models must tune the process so that asynchronously activated instantiations at these interpretable levels which result from local contextual recognition achieve the same behavioral results that are defined within different methodologies.",
        "In other words, we use the AI preconditions or ATN states with as much corroboration from psychological, and linguistic studies as is available to tune our models for \"normal\" processing.",
        "This provides an extremely valuable means of studying processing effects in neurally motivated \"lesion\" states that are consistent within our system, and completely defined over our model of study in a mathematical sense.",
        "This has been discussed in detail elsewhere in Gigley (1982b; 1983a; 1983b), and Gigley and Duffy (1982) and will not be repeated here."

        "While raising many questions of language within a new computational perspective, it provides a first attempt to answer them as well.",

        "HOPE stresses the process of natural language.",
        "by incorporating a neurally plausible control that is internal to the processing mechanism.",
        "There is no external evaluation made to decide what happens next.",
        "At each process time interval, there are six types of serial-order process that can occur and affect the state of the process.",
        "The most important aspect of the control is that all of the serial order computations can occur simultaneously and affect any information that has been defined in the model.",
        "Similar control philosophies have been employed in letter perception by McClelland and Rumelhart (1981), and in the connectionist theories applied to visual processing and language parsing (Ballard, 1982; Cottrell, 1983; Feldman, 1982; Small, Cottrell, and Shastri, 1982).",
        "The major difference in the control in HOPE is that the control process can be \"lesioned\" by modifying parameter settings relative to their \"normal\" settings to define hypothesized causes of pathological language behavior.",
        "Example \"lesions\" are changes in memory decay, elimination of a knowledge type, and slowing of processing relative to on-line word recognition.",
        "Studying the results of such \"lesions\" and their occurrence or not in pathological behavior is used to further understanding of the behavior and to suggest evolutionary changes in the model to better its approximation to language process.",
        "Information is presented at a phonological level as phonetic representations of words, at a word meaning level as multiple pairs of designed syntactic category types and orthographic spelling associates, within grammar, and as a pragmatic interpretation.",
        "Each piece of information is a thresholding device with memory.",
        "It has an activity value, initially at a resting state, that is modified over time depending on the input, interconnections to other information, and an automatic activity decay scheme.",
        "In addition, the decay scheme is based on the state of the information, whether it has reached threshold and fired or not.",
        "Activity is propagated in a fixed sense to all aspects of the meaning of words that are \"connected\" by spreading activation.",

        "This is achieved by the time coordination of asynchronously encoded serial order processes.",

      "text": [
        "Because of the parallel activation of all meanings of each recognized word in HOPE, the determination of the phonetic representation of a recognized word determines the breadth of active competition among meanings for subsequent time intervals of the process.",
        "Depending on how the words are chunked, different homophone sets, sets of associated meanings for a given homophone, may arise.",
        "For spoken English, word boundaries tend to be marked by intonation or pauses.",
        "However, for French this is not the case.",
        "Depending on the context, the ending of one word may be phonetically affixed to the following one called liason.",
        "In addition, when a content word begins with a vowel or silent h, the ending vowel of the preceding word is dropped, called elision.",
        "The problem is particularly evident with respect to the use of articles which are very often spoken in such context.",
        "In addition, these same articles do not have the same meaning as they do in English.",
        "\"Le, la, les\" do not always mean \"the\" in the definite sense, but are often generic and mark masculine, feminine, or plural (Gross, 1977; Goffic and McBride, 1975).",
        "And furthermore, these same articles often are not translated into meaning preserving sentences in English.",
        "An example sentence demonstrating this is: Ce singe aime le cafe.",

        "The degradation of these same morphemes has also been associated with certain types of aphasic behavior in English speaking patients, specifically in agrammatics and Broca's aphasics.",

        "Because of the import of articles in language processing, as briefly mentioned, how they are represented is of great interest when one wants to",

        "The question becomes should the phonetic representation be defined as \"l'eau\" or as the content word in isolation, \"eau?\"",

        "Finally, the automatic translation work for French was consulted to see if there were any rdlevant discussions included in the systems regarding the representations of words similar to \"eau\".",
        "In Ariane-78, article constraints are affixed as features to content words and elision is decided in the final stage of the production of the French sentences (Boitet and Nedobejkine, 1981).",
        "The content words are specifically marked as beginning with vowels or silent \"h\".",
        "The final stage of the process joins the marked content word with an appropriate article to produce output words such as l'eau.",
        "This suggests that for comprehension, one would first recognize the unit \"l'eau\" and decompose it to the article and content word with appropriate masculine/feminine indicators (Jayez, 1982).",
        "Initial assessment of the literature with respect to this problem has provided little evidence.",
        "The role of articles has not been studied for French to the extent that it has for English.",
        "Therefore, a pilot study with French aphasics was designed to analyze if and in what contexts these morphemes are affected.",

        "Adapting a neurolinguistically motivated CN model for a second language can be seen to motivate a different type of question with regard to the second language than occurs when one bases the studies on English surface phenomena.",
        "This is very important because often surface phenomena are assumed to be more similar than warranted.",

        "Within developing computational neurolinguistic research which assumes that we can define cognitively based simulation models using Al methodologies which are incorporated with neural processing paradigms, we have demonstrated how one can begin to study universals of language in a new perspective.",
        "The CM paradigm for natural language processing includes claims that new perspectives on linguistically interpretable hierarchical representations that arise in language behavior are introduced by including neurally motivated processing control as the focus of model definition and by including behaviorially defined constraints, both normal and pathological.",
        "The issues are not whether human brains work in a universal fashion, but instead raise questions of how interpreted levels of representation, which functionally produce similar language behavior need to be represented for different languages.",
        "This processing approach includes many assumptions which are important to linguistic theory.",
        "Furthermore, it provides a way of developing specific, verifiable questions about behavior which are mathematically better defined than through other methods, because it enables one to develop a broader perspective of the questions within an analysis of the hypothesis in the context of a characterization of the \"how\" of the entire behavior.",
        "By adapting HOPE for processing French, we furthermore claim that new perspectives on language universals are demonstrated.",
