        "The phenomenon we wish to model is the understanding of garden path sentences (GPs) by native speakers of English.",
        "Parsers designed by Marcus [811 and Shieber [83] duplicate a reader's first reaction to a GP such as (1) by rejecting it as ungrammatical, even though the sentence is, in some sense, grammatical.",
        "(1)The horse raced past the barn fell.",
        "Thinking first that •raced • is the main verb, most readers become confused when they see the word, •fell'.",
        "Our parser, responding like the average reader, initially makes this mistake, but later determines that \"fell • is intended to be the main verb, and •raced • is a passive participle modifying •horse.",
        "We are particularly interested in a class of sentences which Shieber's and Marcus' parsers will consider to be GPs and reject as ungrammatical although many people do not.",
        "For example, most people can easily understand (2) and (3) without conscious reanalysis.",
        "(2) Three percent of the courses filled with freshmen were cancelled.",
        "(3)The chicken cooked with broccoli is delicious.",
        "The syntactic structure of (2) is similar to that of sentence (1).",
        "However, most readers do not initially mistake \"filled • to be the Current Address: The Aerospace Corporation P.O.",
        "Box 92957 Los Angeles, CA 90009 main verb.",
        "LAZY goes a step further than previous parsers by modeling the average readers ability to deterministically recognize sentences (2) and (3).",
        "If 'filled were the main verb, then its subject would be the noun phrase 'three percent of the courses* and the selectional restrictions [KATZ 631 associated with •to fill' would be violated.",
        "LAZY prefers not to violate selectional restrictions.",
        "Therefore, when processing (2), LAZY will delay deciding the relationship among •filled • and •three percent of the courses' until the word •were • is seen and it is clear that 'filled • is a passive participle.",
        "We call sentences like (2) semantically disambiguatable garden path sentences (SDGPs).",
        "Crain and Croker (79) have reported experimental evidence which demonstrates that not all potential garden path sentences are actual garden paths.",
        "LAZY uses a language recognition scheme capable of waiting long enough to select the correct parse of both (1) and (2) without guessing and backing up [MARCUS 761.",
        "However, when conceptual links are strong enough, LAZY is careless and will assume one syntactic (and therefore semantic) representation before waiting long enough to consider alternatives.",
        "We claim that we can model the performance of native English speakers understanding SDGPs and misunderstanding GPs by using this type of strategy.",
        "For example, when processing (1), LAZY assumes that the horse\" is the subject of the main verb \"raced • as soon as the word •raced • is seen because the selectional restrictions associated with •raced • are satisfied.",
        "One implication of LAZY's parsing strategy, is that people could understand some true GPs if they were more careful and waited longer to select among alternative parses.",
        "Experimental evidence [Matthews 791 suggests that people can recognize garden path sentences as grammatical if properly prepared.",
        "Mathhews found that subjects recognized sentences such as (2) as being grammatical, and after doing so, when later presented with a sentence like (1) will also judge it to be grammatical.",
        "(In a more informal experiment, we have found that colleagues who read papers on GPs, understand new GPs easily by the end of a paper.)",
        "LAZY exhibits this behavior by being more careful after encountering SDGPs or when reanalyzing garden path sentences."

        "A request from \"stuff' then finds that 'plane' is in the default position to be the subject, but its action is not executed because two of the four tests have not passed: the selectional restrictions are violated and it is too early to consider the positional predicate because the sentence type is unknow.",
        "A request looking for the direct object of 'stuff' does not succeed at this time because the default location of the direct object follows the verb.",

        "(9)The chicken cooked with broccoli.",

        "With it included, (9) would currently be recognized as a sentence.",
        "We have decided to include condition 3, because it delays the resolving of this ambiguity until both possibilities are clear.",
