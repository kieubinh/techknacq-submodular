        "NC's can exhibit various degrees of lexica-lization, but we will focus our attention on productive rules for forming novel compounds.",
        "As to their surface syntax, NC's can assume any structure generated by the rule N --> N N; accordingly, their structural ambiguity grows exponentially with their length (following the \"Catalan sequence\").",

        "We believe that the analysis of NC's represents an important and largely unsolved problem.",
        "From a theoretical point of view this problem raises the question of how to deal with noun semantics.",
        "And since noun meaning appears to be closely connected with knowledge of the world, one is led to explore the modes of interaction between linguistic and conceptual knowledge.",
        "From an NLP perspective, NC's have turned out to be an important stumbling block for systems that attempt to deal with real-life text, especially in technical domains, for purposes such as machine translation (Isabelle, to appear), information retrieval, etc.",
        "Our ultimate goal is to develop an NLP system capable of analyzing large classes of NC's in the sublanguage (Kittredge and Lehrberger, 1982) of aircraft maintenance manuals.",
        "We do not aim at solving all cases, since we believe the problem to be exceedingly difficult.",
        "At the present stage of our inquiry, we concentrate on the design of a suitable theoretical framework.",
        "In section II, we present a brief review of previous work in linguistics and NLP.",
        "In sections III and IV, we examine two aspects of the semantics of nouns that are crucially relevant to the analysis of NC's: predicative nouns and role nominals.",

        "The early study of Lees (1963) classified NC's on purely grammatical criteria, and it failed to provide constraints that could explain how NC's are semantically interpreted.",
        "In a number of more recent studies, such as Levi (1978), there has been an attempt to view NC's as governed by tight semantic constraints.",
        "Thus, according to Levi, any novel NC realizes a pattern where either: a) the head noun is a deverbal nominalization and its modifier is interpreted as an argument of the related verb; or b) the two nouns are related by one of exactly nine deletable predicates (\"is the cause of\", \"is for\", etc.).",
        "This reductionist attempt has been criticized, most notably by Downing (1977), on the",
        "grounds that the interpretation of NC's crucially involves pragmatic knowledge, and that numerous cases of NC's (such as thalidomide parents) will resist any analysis in terms of a closed set of relations.",
        "These criticisms have led theorists like Selkirk (1982) to adopt the position that only \"verbal compounds\" (those constructed on a pattern \"argument + nominalization\") are amenable to linguistic characterization; all other NC's would have to be explained in separate extralinguistic theories.",
        "C. Approaches in NLP Several systems have been developed in an NLP framework to deal with the problem of interpreting NC's; two recent examples are reported in Finin (1980) and McDonald (1982).",
        "In both systems, the individual nouns of an NC are first mapped onto conceptual representations where concepts are characterized by a set of \"roles\" or \"slots\", and are arranged in an abstraction hierarchy.",
        "Interpreting a compound then amounts to forming a derived concept on the basis of the constituent concepts; in most cases, this is done by interpreting one of the concepts as a slot filler for the other.",
        "For example, the interpretation of steel adapter would involve inserting the concept associated with steel into a RAW-MATERIAL slot within the representation of adapter.",
        "But the authors do not examine in any detail the question of eventual constraints on this interpretation process, such as the effect of word order.",
        "Another crucial issue which has not been explored in sufficient detail, is the nature of, and the justification for the particular set of slots which is assigned to a given concept.",
        "Finin is somewhat more explicit on this question.",
        "Some nouns have slots which represent standard case roles.",
        "Role nominals, on the other hand, are nouns which refer to a particular case role of another concept; for example, food refers to the object role of eat, and this fact provides the key to the interpretation of cat food.",
        "This notion will be examined in detail below.",
        "But Finin also resorts to other types of slots (e.g. \"raw-material\") which are not discussed."

In other cases, it seems that the resultant meaning is less predictible (good food has certain properties concerning nutritiousness and taste; a good house is comfortable, built to last, etc.).",

        "For example, Max subwayed downtown means that Max went downtown on a subway.",
        "Intuitively, it appears obvious that the knowledge involved in this interpretation process is very closely related to whatever permits interpreting the NC downtown subway as \"the subway that goes downtown\".",
        "An important aspect of C & C's work is to show that the formation of denominal verbs is heavily dependent on contextual knowledge.",
        "Thus if you and me both know that Phil has long had the crazy habit of sticking trombones into the nose of bypassers, I can inform you that Phil has just tromboned a police officer.",
        "Notice that in the same context, good trombone would presumably mean a trombone that is easy to stick into someone's nose.",
        "In such cases, the interpretation is based on particular, situational knowledge.",
        "NC's can also be based on this type of knowledge.",
        "For example, if that same Phil uses different types of trombones for men and women, we might speak of his women trombones, to mean trombones of the type that Phil sticks into the nose of female bypassers.",
        "But C & C claim that, more frequently, denominal verbs are based on generic knowledge about concrete objects, knowledge which is accessible to all speakers in a linguistic community.",
        "This claim is to be linked with Downing's (1977) remark that although NC's are sometimes \"deictic\", they are most often based on generic or permanent relationships.",
        "Obviously, the relevant knowledge (whether particular or generic) is at least as much about the world as about language.",
        "In fact, it is clear that both types condition each other.",

        "However, we will minimize this risk, by limiting the scope of our inquiry to a suitably restricted sublanguage.",
        "Technical manuals are interesting in this respect because they exhibit at the same time a tightly constrained universe of interpretation, and an exceptional productivity in compounding.",
        "As to the semantic framework, we will not use case grammar, even if our discussion of role nominals was couched in the terms of this theory for expository purposes.",

        "Since action verbs can generally occur with an agent, an instrument, or both, it does not seem necessary to include two slots for each verb in the dictionary: general rules should predict the relevant facts.",
