        "Syntactical ambiguity, as part of the ambiguity problem in general, is widely recognized as a major difficulty in MT.",
        "To solve this problem, the efforts of computational linguists have been mainly directed to the process of analysis: a unique analysis is searched (semantical and/or world knowledge information being basically employed to this end), and only having obtained such an analysis, it is proceeded to the process of synthesis.",
        "On this approach, in addition to the well known difficulties of general-linguistic and computational character, there are two principle embarrasments to be encountered.",
        "It makes us entirely incapable to process, first, sentences with \"unresolvable syntactical ambiguity\" (with respect to the disambiguation information stored), and, secondly, sentences which must be translated ambiguously (e.g. puns and the like).",
        "In this paper, the burden of solution of the syntactical ambiguity problem is shifted from the domain of analysis to the domain of synthesis of sentences.",
        "Thus, instead of trying to resolve such ambiguities in the source language (SL), syntactically ambiguous sentences are synthesized in the target language (TL) which preserve their ambiguity, so that the user himself rather than the parser disambiguates the ambiguities in question.",
        "This way of handling syntactical ambiguity may be viewed as an illustration of a more general approach, outlined earlier (Penchev and Pericliev 1982, Pericliev 1983, Penchev and Pericliev 1984), concerned also with other types of ambiguities in the SL translated by means of syntactical, and not only syntactical, ambiguity in the TL.",
        "In this paper, we will concentrate on the linguistics grounds for adopting such a manner of handling of syntactical ambiguity in an English into Bulgarian translation system."

      "text": [
        "This approach may be viewed as an attempt to simulate the behavior of a man-translator who is linguistically very competent, but is quite unfamiliar with the domain he is translating his texts from.",
        "Such a man-translator will be able to say what words in the original and in the translated sentence go together under all of the syntactically admissible analyses; however, he will be, in general, unable to make a decision as to which of these parses \"make sense\".",
        "Our approach will be an obvious way out of this situation.",
        "And it is in fact not infrequently employed in the everyday practice of more \"smart\" translators.",
        "We believe that the capacity of such translators to produce quite intelligible translations is a fact that can have a very direct bearing on at least some trends in MT.",
        "Resolving syntactical ambiguity, or, to put it more accurately, evading syntactical ambiguity in MT following a similar human-like strategy is only one instance of this.",
        "There are two further points that should be made in connection with the approach discussed.",
        "We assume as more or less self-evident that: (i) MT should not be intended to explicate texts in the SL by means of texts in the TL as previous approaches imply, but should only translate them, no matter how ambiguous they might happen to be; (ii) Since ambiguities almost always pass unnoticed in speech, the user will unconsciously disambiguate them (as in fact he would have done, had he read the text in the SL); this, in effect, will not diminish the quality of the translation in comparison with the original, at least insofar as ambiguity is concerned."

        "The empirical basis of the approach is provided by an extensive study of syntactical ambiguity in English and Bulgarian (Pericliev 1983), accomplished within the framework of a version of dependency grammar using dependency arcs and bra-cketings.",
        "In this study, from a given list of configurations for each language, all logically-admissible ambiguous strings of three types in English and Bulgarian were calculated.",
        "The first type of syntactically ambiguous strings is of the form: 1/2",
        "(1) A e.g.",
        "where A, B, ... are complexes of word-classes, \"---:>\" is a dependency arc, and 1, 2, ... are syn- tactical relations.",
        "The second type is of the form:",
        "The third type is of the form: (3) A 1 1C, e.g.",
        "It was found, first, that almost all logically admissible strings of the three types are actually realized in both languages (cf. the same result also for Russian in Jordanskaja (1967)).",
        "Secondly, and more important, there turned out to be a striking coincidence between the strings in English and Bulgarian; the latter was to be expected from the coincidence of configurations in both languages as well as from their sufficiently similar global syntactic organization."

      "text": [
        "To conclude, some syntactically ambiguous strings in English can have literal, others non-literal, and still others do not have any correspondences in Bulgarian.",
        "In summary, from a total number of approximately 200 simple strings treated in English more than 3/4 can, and only 1/4 cannot, be literally translated; about half of the latter strings can be put into correspondence with syntactically ambiguous strings in Bulgarian preserving their ambiguity.",
        "This gives quite a strong support to the usefulness of our approach in an English into Bulgarian translation system.",
        "Several advantages of this way of handling of syntactical ambiguity can be mentioned.",
        "First, in the processing of the majority of syntactically ambiguous sentences within an English into Bulgarian translation system it dispenses with semantical and world knowledge information at the very low cost of studying the ambiguity correspondences in both languages.",
        "It could be expected that investigations along this line will prove to be fruitful for other pairs of languages as well.",
        "Secondly, whenever this way of handling syntactical ambiguity is applicable, the impossibility of previous approaches to translate sentences with unresolvable ambiguity, or such with verbal jokes and the like, turns out to be an easily attainable task.",
        "Thirdly, the approach seems to have a very natural extension to another principal difficulty in MT, viz. coreference (cf. the three-ways ambiguity of Jim hit John and then he (Jim, John or neither?)",
        "went away and the same ambiguity of tot (=he) in its literal translation into Bulgarian: Djim udari Djon i togava toj(?)",
        "si otide).",
        "And, finally, there is yet another reason for adopting the approach discussed here.",
        "Even if we choose to go another way and (somehow) disambiguate sentences in the SL, almost certainly their translational equivalents will be again syntactically ambiguous, and quite probably preserve the very ambiguity we tried to resolve.",
        "In this sense, for the purposes of MT (or other man-oriented applications of CL) we need not waste our efforts to disambiguate e.g. sentences like John hit the dog with the long bat or John hit the dog with the long wool, since, even if we have done that, the correct Bulgarian translations of both these sentences are syntactically ambiguous in exactly the same way, the resolution of ambiguity thus proving to be an entirely superfluous operation (cf. Djon udari kucheto s dalgata palka and Djon udari kucheto s dalgata valna)."
