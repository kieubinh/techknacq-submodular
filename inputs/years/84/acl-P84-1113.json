        "INTRODUCTION The main objective of this paper is to develop an analysis-synthesis system whose parameters can be varied at will to realize any desired voice characteristics.",
        "This will enable us to determine factors responsible for the unnatural quality of synthetic speech.",
        "It is also possible to determine parameters of speech that contribute to intelligibility.",
        "The key ideas in our basic system are similar to the usual linear predictive (LP) coding vocoder [1], [2].",
        "Our main contributions to the design of the basic system are: (1) the flexibility incorporated in the system for changing the parameters of excitation and system independently and (2) a means for combining the excitation and system through convolution without further interpolation of the system parameters during synthesis.",
        "Atal and Hanauer [I] demonstrated the feasibility of modifying voice characteristics through an LPC vocoder.",
        "There have been some attempts to modify some characteristics (like pitch, speaking rate) of speech without explicitly extracting the source parameters.",
        "One such attempt is with the phase vocoder [3].",
        "A recent attempt to independently modify the excitation and vocal tract system characteristics is due to Senef [4].",
        "Unlike the LPC method, Senef's method performs the desired transformations in the frequency domain without explicitly extracting pitch.",
        "However, it is difficult to adjust the intonation patterns while modifying the voice characteristics.",
        "In order to transform voice from one type (e.g., masculine) to another (e.g., feminine), it is necessary to change not only the pitch and vocal tract system but also the pitch contour as well as the glottal waveshape independently.",
        "It is known that glottal pulse shapes differ from person to person and also for the same person for utterances in different contexts [5].",
        "Since one of our objectives is to determine factors responsible for producing natural sounding synthetic speech, we have decided to implement a scheme which controls independently the vocal tract system characteristics and the excitation characteristics such as pitch, pitch contour and glottal waveshape.",
        "For this reason we have decided to use the standard LPC-type vocoder.",

        "C. Synthesis Synthesis consists of two steps: Generation of the excitation signal and synthesis of speech.",
        "Separation of the synthesis procedure into these two steps helps when modifying the voice characteristics as will be evident in the following sections.",
        "The excitation parameters are used to generate the excitation signal as follows: The pitch period and gain contours as a function of analysis frame number (i) are first nonlinearly smoothed using a 3-point median smoothing.",
        "Two arrays (called Q and H for convenience) are created as illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "The smoothed pitch contour P(i) is used to generate a 0-array using the value of the pitch period at any point to determine the next point on the pitch contour.",
        "Since the pitch period is given in number of samples and the interframe interval is known, say N samples, the value of the pitch period at the end of the current pitch period is determined using suitable interpolation of P(i) for points in between two frame indicies.",
        "The values of the pitch period as read from the pitch contour are stored in the 0-array.",
        "The entry in the 0-array is the value of the pitch period for that frame.",
        "For nonvoiced frames the number of samples to be skipped along the horizontal axis is N, although on the pitch contour the value is zero.",
        "The entry in the 0-array for unvoiced frames is zero.",
        "For each entry in the 0-array the corresponding squared gain per sample can be computed from the gain contour using suitable interpolation between two frame indices.",
        "The squared gain per sample corresponding to each element in the 0-array is stored in the H-array.",
        "From the 0 and H arrays an excitation signal is generated as follows.",
        "For each nonvoiced segment, identified by an entry zero in the Q-array, Ns samples of random noise are generated.",

        "The system parameters are updated every N samples.",
