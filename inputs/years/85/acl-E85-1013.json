        "When discussing implementation in the last section we shall argue (as in Wilks 1978) that semantic material that is to be the base of a parsing process cannot be thought of as simply attaching to a verb (rather than to nouns and all other word senses) In what follows we shall assume case predicates in the dictionary entries of verbs, nouns etc.",
