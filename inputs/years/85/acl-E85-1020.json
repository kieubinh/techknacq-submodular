        "A recognition grammar to supply information to a text-to-speech system for the synthesis of Italian must rely heavily upon lexical information, in order to instantiate the appropriate grammatical relations.",
        "Italian is an almost free word order language which nonetheless adopts fairly analysable strategies to move major constituents: some of these can strongly affect the functioning of the phonological component.",
        "Two basic claims will be made: i. difficulties in associating grammatical functions to constituent structure can be overcome only if Lexical Theory is adopted as a general theoretical framework, and translated into adequate computational formalisms like ATN or CHART; ii.",
        "decisions made at previous point affect focus structure construal rules, which are higher level phonological rules which individuate intonation centre, build up adequate Intonational Groups and assign pauses to adequate sites, all being very sensitive to syntactic and semantic information.",
        "We will concentrate on Subject/Object function association to c-structure in Italian, and its relation to ATN formalism, in particular HOLD mechanism and FLAGging.",
        "Then we will show how syntactic decisions interact with an intonation grammar.",

        "In a recent paper we presented (Delmonte, 1983) a phonological processor for Italian which has been implemented at the University of Venice and is used in a text-to-speech system (Delmonte et al., 1984) for the synthesis of Italian at the Centre of Computational Sonology of the University of Padua.",
        "Recently the system has been equipped with a lexicon and a morphological analyser (Delmonte et al., 1985) while the parser is on its way to be built, which, since we adopt Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) (Bresnan, 1982), as background linguistic theory, should take the form of a chart, much in the vein of Kay's (1977,1979,1980) and Kaplan's (1973) functional and general syntactic parsers.",
        "At present we are working at the context-free grammar and the semantic information to be associated with each lexical entry.",
        "As it appears, Italian is a much more complex language to be analysed when compared with English, German and French.",
        "As we shall discuss in the paper, difficulties arise basically because Italian has a relatively much higher freedom in the order of constituents than the above mentioned languages.",
        "Also, the phenomenon of the unexpressed Subject or Null Subject, makes the working of a parser a much harder task.",
        "In this sense, a chart being unbiased as to what procedure to adopt in the course of the analysis, will allow the parser to benefit both from tcp-down and bottom-up procedures in an efficient way (plus the obvious backup and parallel processing operations usually required).",
        "Besides, both semantic and grammatical features need to be present throughout the parsing process, and they will be used to guide the overall parsing strategy."

        "Assuming that the ultimate goal of a parser is that of accomplishing the analysis of the input text in terms cf underlying grammatical relations, we are usually fronted with the task of assigning thematic roles to functional representations mapped onto constituent structures, as well as defining other non trivial semantic relations including ellipsis, predication, coordination, quantifier/negation and modality scope, head to modifier/complement/adjunct relations.",
        "All these aspects are relevant to a constructional rule of focus structure which addresses directly the informational structure of the text.",
        "The intermediate level of grammatical function assignment is in this perspective a relevant level of representation in that it allows the mapping from c-structure to 0-roles: in this sense, it contributes to speed up the recognition procedure.",
        "In English, a completely reversible structure is",
        "the following: 1.",
        "The secretary has been killed by the director.",
        "in which, either NP arguments of the predicate KILL can assume the grammatical functions of SUBJect or OBJect of the sentence.",
        "On the contrary, in non-reversible passive structures like, 2.",
        "The book has been read by John.",
        "only an animate NP argument can be interpreted as SUBJect of the predicate READ; thus, inanimate NP arguments can only be interpreted as OBJect of the sentence.",
        "It is clear that non-reversible passive structures contain additional grammatical cues to speed up comprehension.",
        "but these cues are only available from lexical entries in which selectional restrictions are listed.",
        "Semantic features are thus called into question, and are used to constrain 0-role assignment in recognition grammars, in order to derive from functional structure adequate mapping for focus structure.",
        "In a more strictly computational perspective, verb morphology is accessed first for Agreement tests; when passive morphology is detected, this local cue is sufficient to reverse grammatical function assignment carried out so far to the previously analysed NP SUB-ject, and assign it Object function.",
        "Also transitivity test is necessary not to get entangled with intransitive verbs taking Auxiliary BE.",
        "If we regard constituent discontinuities as the major issue to be addressed in the grammatical perspective so far outlined, passive structures are the canonical case of NP movement in Transformational Grammar (TG), in which traces or gaps are left behind by displaced constituents; or within LFG theory of control, the coindexing performed on f-structures between metavariables and empty nodes.",
        "In a strictly configurational language like English there does not seem to be such a strong motivation for adopting LFG theoretical framework and introducing the intermediate representation in terms of f-structures.",
        "It might as well be sufficient to inspect precedence and dominance relations as instantiated by constituent structure and relate them to PSR of a context-free grammar in which canonical constituent order is encoded.",
        "Since in tensed clauses either a lexical or a pronominal SUBJect must be expressed in preverbal position - or else a dummy pronoun like \"there, it\" it could be possible to label NP1, or the one dominated directly by S, as SUBJect, whereas postverbal NP2 if present, as OBJect of the clause, or the one dominated directly by VP.",
        "Unfortunately, what applies to English or other fixed word order languages, does not apply to romance languages and in particular to Italian or Spanish, which have been called Null Subject Languages (NSL).",
        "One of the distinguishing properties of NSL is that they do not have a canonical position for NP",
        "Subject: it can either appear in preverbal position as in English, or i. in postverbal position as a case of Subject Inversion; ii.",
        "be unexpressed as a case of obviative or extra-sentential pronominal, in tensed clauses; iii..be stranded or extraposed, usually in tensed clauses; NP Subject has been moved out of its matrix clause and placed after an embedded clause, which it controls (Subject must be unexpressed), or not - no intervening lexical NP Subjects are allowed, however.",
        "Before going into the analysis of Italian with more detail, it is worth while noticing that not always NP1 entertains Subject function, nor NP2 can be interpreted as Object of a finite clause in English, as the following examples show:",

        "SELL is used in ergative structural configuration, in which NP2 is raised to Subject; the same applies to 6, a case in which Subject NP would be always omitted (subjectless impersonal structures are frequently used in technical and scientific English); also 7. is a subjectless structure, in which \"tough predicate\" appears and Object NP2 is raised to Subject position.",

        "In B. constituent order is irrelevant, and it is crucial in A.; B. is typical of NSL, while A. is typical of configurational languages in which grammatical functions can be associated in a reliable way to fixed or canonical constituent orders.",

        "Subject is subsequently set to a dummy NP,which as Winograd comments, is used to indicate an NP node with no register contents, constructed to represent un unknown subject.",
        "When the PP with preposition \"by\" is parsed, it is taken as the phrase specifying the agent; thus the dummy subject NP will be set to the (by) NP, now the deep subject, or stay empty if the sentence is an agent-deleted passive like \"the fish have been caught\".",
        "In order to parse our null subject sentences we would adopt the same procedure used for passives, except for the fact that our Subject NP need not be present in the same S/NP network in which the hole is detected.",
        "As we noted in extra posed subject sentences, the NP could appear rightward beyond two bounding nodes (even more are allowed as long as no intervening NP Subject appears).",
        "All networks where a hole has been FLAGged should be accessed by the parser whenever an \"exceeding\" NP is parsed, or simply an NP eligible to be interpreted as Subject of the higher predicates already encountered in the analysis."

        "There are clear asymmetries which can be detected in the following Italian structures, we shall discuss.",
        "Basically what is addressed structurally by focus structure is the VP in c-structure, which must include the last argument in the c-dominion of the predicate or f-controlled by it; complements/adjuncts Syntactically-bound are adjoined into focus structure.",
        "Also the first of optional arguments adjacent to the VP - like PP, complements, adjuncts possibly controlled by Strong Lexical Form of the predicate, or adjoined to it by means of a Theory of Syntactic Closure - can constitute focus structure.",
        "Let us first go back to our examples, 22.",
        "23., which can be defined completely functionally reversible structures, and see how they interact with focus structure construal rules.",
        "In particular, they can be analysed as follows, 22.i Chi intendeva mettere in imbarazzo Mario?",
        "23.i Quale segretaria conosceva it direttore?",
        "what in English is achieved by means of syntactic structure, in Italian is achieved via focus structure, which we have represented here as underlining, at the end of which a pause may be produced.",
        "The phonological focus or intonational centre must be included in focus structure on one of its constituent, usually the last on the right.",
        "According to the constituents, in condition of adjacency, focus structure can thus be expanded and produce two different focus assignment: with focus on the question",
        "ed element this will be interpreted as Subject of the clause; with focus on the VP, the questioned element will be interpreted as Object.",
        "Usually the VP de limits focus structure in wh- questions in Italian.",
        "As we said previously, in functional reversibility, even though both positions are available to be filled by the two arguments of the verb, only one will produce the desired grammatical relations.",
        "Nonetheless both positions in c-structure are grammatically viable to instantiate meaningful sentences, in keeping with structural and semantic restrictions of the grammar of Italian.",
        "As with reversible passives, in 22.",
        "23. both arguments of the verbs can be interpreted as either SUBJect or OBJect, but differently from reversible passives, reversible wh- clauses don't make available to the parser any constituent structural hint as to which NP argument enacts which grammatical function.",

        "Finally in 9. we have a wh- question in which the questioned element is included in FS according to which grammatical relations have to be instantiated: SUBJect function in narrow FS, OBJect function in wider FS.",

        "In particular, since \"causer\" thematic role can only be assigned to Subject NPs and not to OBJect NPs - the more so in functionally reversible structures - the appropriate grammatical relations will be altered if grammatical functions are not properly assigned.",
        "In-choative lexical redundancy rule allows only the agentive meaning to be instantiated, simply because this lexical form derives via a lexical rule applied not to causative but to active transitive lexical form of predicate SPOSARE.",
