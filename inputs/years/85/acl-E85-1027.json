        "What kinds of information decisions about style have access to.",
        "Our theory emerged out of design experiments we have made over the past year with our natural language generation system, the Zetalisp program MUMBLE.",
        "In the process we have extended MUMBLE through the addition of an additional process that now mediates between content planning and linguistic realization.",
        "This new process, which we call \"attachment\", provides the further significant benefit that text structure is no longer dictated by the structure of the message: the sequential order and dominance relationships of concepts in the message no longer force one form onto the words and phrases in the text.",
        "Instead, rhetorical and intentional directives can be interpreted flexibly in the context of the ongoing discourse and stylistic preferences.",
        "The text is built up through composition under the direction of linguistic organizing principles, rather than having to follow conceptual principles in lockstep.",
        "We will begin by describing what we mean by prose style and then introducing the generation task that lead us to this theory, the reproduction of short encyclopedia articles on African tribes.",
        "We will then use that task to outline the parts of our theory and the operations of the attachment process.",
        "Finally we will compare our techniques to the related work of Davey, McKeown and Derr, and Gabriel, and consider some of the possible psycholinguistic hypotheses that it may lead to."

        "Style is an intuitive notion involving the manner in which something is said.",
        "It has been more often the professional domain of literary critics and English teachers than linguists, which is entirely reasonable given that it involves ovtional, often conscious decisions and preferences rather than the unconscious, inviolable rules that linguists term Universal Grammar.",
        "To illustrate what we mean by style, consider the three paragraphs in Figure 1.",
        "As we see it, the first two of these have the same style, and the third has a different one.",
        "The Ibibio are a group of six related peoples living in southeastern Nigeria.",

        "We began looking at texts like these during the summer of 19â‚¬3, as part of the work on the \"Knoesphere Project\" at Atari Research (Horning et al. [1983D.",

        "With the demise of Atari Research, this ambitious goal has had to be put on the shelf; we have, however, continued to work with the articles on our own.",
        "Research on these articles lead us to begin work on prose style.",
        "This remains an interesting domain in which to explore style since we are working with a body of texts whose organization is not totally dictated by its internal form.",
        "These paragraphs are representative of all the African tribe articles in the Academic American, which is not surprising since all of the articles were written by the same person and under tight editorial control.",
        "What was most striking to us when we first looked at these articles was their similarity to each other, both in the information they contained and the way they were structured as a text.",
        "We will assume that for such texts, \"encyclopedia style\" involves at least the following two generalizations: (1) be consistent in the information that you provide about each tribe; and (2) adopt a complex, \"information loaded\" sentence structure in your presentation.",
        "This sentence structure is typified by a rich set of syntactic constructions, including the use of conjunction reduction, reduced relative clauses, coordination, secondary adjunction, and prenominal modification whenever possible.",
        "A contrasting style might be, for example, one that was aimed at children; we have rewritten the information on the Ashanti tribe as it might look in such a style.",
        "We have not yet tried implementing this style since it will call for doing lexicalization under stylistic control, which we have not yet designed.",
        "The style of the Academic American paragraphs, on the other hand, is much tighter, with more compact sentence structure, and a more sophisticated choice of phrasing.",
        "Such differences are the sort of thing that rules of prose style must capture."

        "This has been an important question in psycholinguistic research as well (Garrett (1982]).",
        "This continues our ongoing line of research on the psychological consequences of our computational analysis of generation.",
        "The following are a few of the questions that must be addressed in the research on planning: o What is the size of the planning units at various stages; o What is the vocabulary that the units are stated in, e.g. are conceptual and linguistic objects mixed together or are there distinct unit-types at different levels, with some means of cascading between levels; o Should units be modelled as \"streams\" with conceptual components passing in at one end and text passing out at the other, or are they \"quanta\" that must be processed in their entirety one after the other; and finally o Can the components of a planning unit be revised after they are selected, or may they only be refined.",
        "This appears to relate to similar questions in psycholinguistic research (see Garrett [1982] for review)."
