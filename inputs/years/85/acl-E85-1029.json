        "From a practrical view point, it provides clear image of syntactic/semantic computation for language processing in analysis and synthesis.",

        "The VENUS analysis model consists of two components, Legato and Crescendo, as shown in Fig. 1.",
        "Legato based on the ADG framework, constructs semantic dependency structure of Japanese input sentences by feature-oriented dependency grammar rules as main control information for syntactic analysis, and by semantic inference mechanism on a object fields' fact knowledge base.",
        "Legato maps syntactic dependency directly to meaningful logical dependency if possible, or maps it to language-particular semantic dependency if two kinds of dependencies do not coincide.",
        "The second component, Crescendo, extracts a conceptual structure about facts from the semantic dependency structure through logical interpretation on the language-particular semantic dependency using knowledge based inferences.",
        "A computational comprehension model for the ADG is given in Fig. 2.",
        "Three different kinds of information sources other than the lexicon support language comprehension, and two inference functions defined on them extract the interpretation of input sentences.",
        "The top level information is a language structure model.",
        "The bottom is a logical(factual/conceptual) interpretation model which determine the possible logical relations between \"OBJECTs and THINGs\".",
        "The semantics located between the above two models, which has not been clarified in any paper.",
        "Suppose interpretaion is a process of determining the relation between \" OBJECTs and THINGs \", the ordinary notion of semantics allows us to determine words' semantics in particular syntagmatic relations, but not relational interpretation between concepts.",
        "The notion of basically binary \"dependency\" has a primary role to simplify the above interface, just in the sense that either syntactic or semantic inference recognizes interpretable binary relation.",
        "The semantics in the sense used here may not necessarily be shared among languages, while facts are shared among languages.",
        "Legato built on the model is syntactic and semantic analysis module which construct directly semantic dependency structure from surface structure.",
