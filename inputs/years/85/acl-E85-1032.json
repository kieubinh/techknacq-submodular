        "There has long been, and still is, a controversy about the meaning of if (e.g. Grice, 1967; Stalnaker, 1975; Harper et al., 1981).",
        "Much of this discussion presupposes that there is indeed one meaning of if.",
        "Is this presupposition justified?",
        "At one level the answer is clearly 'no', e.g. if can be used to introduce a noun clause following an illocutionary verb: John asked if he could come in now.",
        "Such examples do not conform to the conditional use of if as in: If John asked he could come in now.",
        "This is so different a use of if that one might claim it should be set aside from the .conditional if.",
        "Thus there would be two ifs: if' for subordinate clauses and if\" for noun clauses.",
        "Our question should be reformulated as: is there only one meaning of if'?",
        "Austin (1961) claimed that the answer was 'no', providing examples that did not conform to two logical properties that are associated with if'.",
        "There is a stipulative use of if' which does not contrapose, e.g. from 1.",
        "I promise to marry him if he asks me.",
        "one does not conclude that If I do not promise to marry him, he does not ask me.",
        "There is also an if of doubt or hesitation which not only fails to contrapose, but which also asserts the proposition underlying the main clause (the 'apodosis proposition'), e.g. from",
        "2.",
        "There are biscuits on the table if you want some.",
        "fails to contrapose, but also we are willing to accept the apodosis simpliciter.",
        "Can this claim be rebutted?",
        "We believe that it can be.",
        "Austin's fault lies in working with the surface structure rather than with the underlying propositions.",
        "He thus fails to take account of the scope of if and of the scope of the speech act involved.",
        "With conditional if', the condition falls within the scope of the speech act.",
        "When there is a performative verb in the apodosis, then the conditional is within the scope of the performative; so the performative itself is not within the conditional, just as with Austin's example of stipulative if'.",
        "Thus 1 is paraphrasable as: I promise that I will marry him if he asks me.",
        "in which the promise is contraposable: I promise that he does not ask me if I will not marry him.",
        "In the case of an if of doubt or hesitation it is the speech act that falls within the scope of the conditional.",
        "Thus 2 is: If you want biscuits, accept the declaration that there are some on the table.",
        "This act of speech is to be noticed only when the proposition underlying the protasis (the if clause) holds; it is NOT made simpliciter.",
        "This explanation of the reading of Austin's two ifs, based on the relative scopes of the speech act and if, can be extended to other subordinating conjunctions (SC's), e.g.",
        "I promise to marry him unless/provided/when he's rich.",
        "The case for the non-restrictive use, with the speech act falling within the scope of the SC was made by Rutherford (1970), e.g. He'll marry you, unless I'm mistaken.",
        "In view of this generality it is parsimonious to regard Austin's two ifs as two different uses arising out of the context of the speech act, rather than as two different meanings of if.",
        "Rejecting Austin's ifs as possible contenders for an if' having a non standard meaning does not, however, show that there are no non standard meanings.",
        "In fact the O.E.D suggests 9 different uses of if:",
        "1. conditional; 2. semi-factual; 3. counterfactual; 4. a pregnant sense, e.g.",
        "If they are poor, they are at any rate happy; 5. an archaic use with that; 6. an elliptic use, e.g. if at all; 7. the protasis alone, e.g.",
        "If I had only known; 8. in phrases, e.g. as if; 9. introducing a noun clause, e.g. ask if.",
        "(Note that this list does NOT include Austin's two uses of if!)",
        "To check whether or not there were further possible uses we have taken a 10% sample of if sentences from the Brown University corpus of American printed texts, available on magnetic tape (Kucera & Francis, 1967).",
        "In our judgement in 61% of the 218 sentences in the sample, if was used in a standard conditional way.",
        "In 8% the if was preceded by some modifier, e.g. as if.",
        "This left 69 (31%) non standard uses of if as possible contenders for different meanings of if.",
        "A TAXONOMY OF NON STANDARD IF To consider the possibility that some meanings of if differ from the conditional, we need some way of classifying the 69 non standard sentences in our sample.",
        "The taxonomy we chose is based on two features that are present in the conditional uses of if: if enables a proposition to be referred to or entertained without being asserted as being (possibly) true or false, and if signals an inference relation from the protasis proposition to the apodosis proposition.. By an inference relation we mean that the apodosis proposition may be inferred from the protasis proposition, together with the context propositions.",
        "(See the critique of Bree (1973) on Wason and Johnson-Laird's (1972) proposal for the different interpretations of if.)",
        "In the non standard uses of if one or the other of these two features is either absent or altered.",
        "Thus we propose that there are two major categories of non standard if: A. in which the inference relation is present but the protasis proposition is NOT in doubt, being either true or false; B. in which the truth status of the protasis proposition is in doubt, but the inference relation does not run from the protasis to the apodosis proposition.",
        "This last class is divided into two subclasses: Bl.",
        "in which the inference relation is present but with a different scope from the standard use; B2.",
        "in which the inference relation is absent.",
        "The complete classification of the sample of if sentences according to their different uses is shown in Table I.",
        "We will now consider each of the different uses in turn, in order to determine whether the use requires a different meaning of if from the standard conditional.",
        "We will check whether or not the non standard use is to be found with other SCs, so that it can be accounted for without postulating a new meaning; whether it is related to another non standard use, so that both uses are based on the same non standard meaning; or whether it requires its own idiosyncratic non standard meaning of if."

        "However this is not the only difference between the two: counterfactuals have a standard inference relation from the protasis to the apodosis proposition, while factuals do not.",
        "For the factuals it is the speech act that is conditional upon the protasis proposition.",
        "Why is it that we do not find two other subcategories: false protasis with conditional speech act and true protasis with standard inference?",
        "There is no pragmatic situation in which the former might occur; if both the writer and the reader know that the protasis proposition is false, then the speech act would never be accepted at all.",
        "For the latter there is another SC which fulfills the function, namely non-temporal since.",
        "Neither do we find the condition falling within the scope of a performative verb in category A.",
        "It cannot occur with counterfactuals as the performative would have to be countered in which case it would no longer be performed, e.g.",
        "I would have promised to marry him if he had asked me.",
        "is simply no promise at all but a standard counterfactual.",
        "Neither have we been able to construct a factual within a performative.",
        "So there are no subcategories missing from A.",
        "Within the B1 category, with non standard inference, we find a symmetrical situation.",
        "For the conditional speech act, the speech act is moved IN to within the scope of the protasis; for the performative use the main verb in the apodosis is moved OUT beyond the scope of the protasis.",
        "Thus we do not expect to find further subcategories within Bl.",
        "Within the B2 category, in which the inference relation is absent, we found 5 subcategories within the sample.",
        "In the subcategory in which if introduces a noun clause there is no apodosis; if is being used just to introduce a proposition with unknown truth value.",
        "There is another subcategory with no apodosis, when the protasis is sufficient for the speaker to stop.",
        "The remaining 3 subcategories within B2 are all related in several ways: the protasis may be a phrase (in two cases, restricitive and concessive use, it MUST be a phrase); while the protasis is in doubt the apodosis proposition is true, with a minor exception; this exception is being put forward in the protasis as possibly although not necessarily the case.",
        "In the restrictive use (if not) the writer suggests the possibility of a further restriction to one of the features of the apodosis; in the.",
        "use to doubt a presupposition, the apodosis, on the contrary, goes too far in one of its presuppostions; in the concessive use it is not something as strong as a presupposition that goes too far but just a likely connotation of a phrase within the apodosis.",
        "While there is some pattern to this B2 category, we believe that it is essentially open; innovative uses of if will be found here rather than in the other two categories."

      "heading": "CONCLUSION",
      "text": [
        "We have found 9 different non standard uses of if, as summarised in Table 1.",
        "However this does not require there to be 9 different meanings for if.",
        "Three meanings are sufficient.",
        "Four of the different uses are explainable by pragmatic considerations, a point we made when criticising Austin's claim.",
        "His two ifs are the two uses in category Bl; the differences arise from differences in the scopes of the speech act and the conditional and are common to other SCs.",
        "The factual use occurs when both the writer and reader know that the protasis proposition is true and is used for emphasis.",
        "Lastly the protasis may occur without an apodosis when the speaker is interrupted.",
        "All four uses are based on the standard conditional meaning of if; the non standard uses arises from pragmatic considerations.",
        "The counterfactual use arises from an interaction with the subjunctive mode in the apodosis.",
        "This is common to other SCs and so does not require an apart meaning of if.",
        "The use of if to introduce a noun clause DOES require an apart meaning of if as no inference relation is present.",
        "This suggests that the feature of if to introduce a proposition of unknown truth value is predominant over the inference relationship feature.",
        "The factual use of if is the only use in which the former feature is absent; then it is a stylistic consideration that leads to the use of if, i.e.",
        "to add emphasis.",
        "The three remaining uses are possible candidates for a third meaning of if, as none display an inference relationship.",
        "These uses cannot be accounted for by some pragmatic variation of the standard conditional, such as a shift in the scope of the speech act, nor are similar uses found with other SCs in general.",
        "In two of these uses, restrictive and concessive, the protasis must be a phrase; but these phrases cannot be derived from a corresponding standard conditional clause.",
        "Two uses, doubtful presuppostion and restrictive, have a semantic feature in common, namely that there is some feature of the apodosis, x, which may need to be modified.",
        "We propose that if here has a meaning equivalent to material implication, i.e. x v not-p, which is equivalent to p x.",
        "This is the traditional logicians suggestion for the standard meaning of if.",
        "We do not accept that in the standard conditional use the meaning of if is equivalent to material implication; such an equivalence runs into difficulties.",
        "For instance it requires the equivalence of: If I hit you, it'll hurt.",
        "Either I don't hit you or you'll be hurt.",
        "and such unacceptable reasoning as: God doesn't exist, so if God exists we are free to do what we want.",
        "Several attempts to save the equivalence have been made.",
        "For instance Grice (1967) did so by requiring that speakers adhere to certain conversational implicatures, such as saying as much as they know, thus ruling out the use of a conditional if sentences with a false protasis.",
        "Formal semanticists propose some slight modifications.",
        "For instance Stalnaker (1975) claimed that in any context in which a sentence of the form not-p or q is acceptable, a sentence of the form if p then q is also acceptable.",
        "Elsewhere (Bree, 1981) we have taken issue with these and other attempts to demonstrate equivalence of if with material implication.",
        "However in the use of if to doubt a presupposition or to make a restriction, the meaning of if can be considered to be equivalent to material implication.",
        "It also occurs infrequently (3%) with standard conditionals: (62) (...) if I don't put my two cents in, someone else will.",
        "in which there is no inferential relation.",
        "This meaning differs from our standard meaning in that the truth of the apodosis proposition is sufficient to confirm the sentence, e.g. knowing that 'someone else will' is sufficient to confirm 62.",
        "Similarly for two other uses: with the doubtful presupposition use of if, knowing that the apodosis is true is sufficient to confirm the sentence, as the presupposition is no longer in doubt; with the restricitve use, the apodosis is the minimal assertion that is being made so its truth is sufficient for the truth of the sentence.",
        "So the x v not-p, or material implication, meaning of if accounts for these two uses of if.",
        "The last non standard use of if, the concessive, is an anomaly.",
        "There is no question of inference, but neither is there any affinity with material implication, e.g. speedy if temporary A speedy or not temporary.",
        "It is possible that this use is a contraction from even if.",
        "We refrain from suggesting a fourth meaning of if.",
        "We would expect that translations into other languages would not be to the conditional, e.g. with Dutch if in such expressions is translated using zij het, literally be it.",
        "In conclusion, we propose that if has three different meanings, all of which have one feature in common: the truth status of the protasis is in doubt.",
        "They are, in order of frequency of occurence in our sample:",
        "1. inferential (p-•q): as used in standard, counterfactual and factual conditionals, together with the conditional speech act, the performative conditional and the use of the protasis without an apodosis (in this last case the inference is left open); 2. material implication (q v not-p): as used in a few standard conditionals, for doubting a presupposition and in the restrictive use; 3. doubting: as used in noun clauses, in which only the",
        "truth of the associated proposition is put into doubt.",
        "We expect that other languages will use different words for these three meanings.",
        "This is the case in Dutch, for example, where the uses depending on an inferential meaning are indicated by als or the more formal indien, the material implication by zo and doubting by of (which is also used to translate whether).",
        "There is only one exception to this, the factual use in Dutch is not indicated by als but by a change in word order.",
        "Any computer program which purports to understand the English language will need to be able to distinguish between these three different meanings.",
        "The last, doubting, is easy to detect as if is then used to introduce a noun clause as opposed to a sub clause.",
        "However distinguishing between the inferential and material implication is not solvable on syntactic grounds.",
        "One suggestion is to assume that if has an inferential meaning; if no inference relation can be found, then it must be equivalent to material implication.",
        "This should be easy to decide when if is being used to put a presupposition into doubt or in its restrictive use; more difficult would be to detect material implication in standard uses of if."
