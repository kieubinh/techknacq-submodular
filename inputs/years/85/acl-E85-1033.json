        "The following paper concerns a general scheme for multilingual text generation, as opposed to just translation.",

        "From this representation, a new text is generated, using a text model and action rules.",
        "This process is done in six steps : word analysis, sentence analysis using a Functional Grammar, reference solving and inference, construction of the text pattern, sentence generation, and word generation.",
        "Different kinds of information are used at each step of the process : text organization, syntax, semantic, etc.",
        "All the knowledge, as well as the text, is given in a declarative manner.",
        "It is expressed in a single formalism named Functional Descriptions.",
        "It consists of lexical data, a Functional Grammar, a knowledge network, action rules for reference solving and sentence generation, models of text, rules of structuration, and sentence schema.",
        "Text representation, included in the semantic network, is composed of different kinds of objects (not necessarily distinct) : text organization, syntactical information, objects introduced by the discourse, affirmations on these objects, and links between these affirmations."

        "The language of functional descriptions comes from the functional grammars (DIK 78), which is a linguistic formalism that can be related to case grammars (FILLMORE 68).",
        "Historically, Kay (81) used functional descriptions as a general tool to represent grammars, independently of any specific linguistic theory, after which Rousselot (84) then used functional descriptions to represent any kind of knowledge (grammar, semantic rules, scripts..) in a system of story understanding.",

        "This allows us to put various kinds of information in the same description : syntactic, semantic, etc.",
        "The objects may be other DFs or paths.",
        "A path is a notation whose aim is to point to objects that are already defined .",
        "We have two kinds of paths : A local path <1 list-of-identifier> points to an object in the current OF, as defined by the list of identifiers.",
        "For example, in fig. 3, the path <1 actor name> refers to \"William\".",
        "A global path, <g starting-point list-of-identi fiers> points to an object in the knowledge base.",
        "It is defined in the same way as the local path, except that the starting point is the current DF.",
        "The internal representation of a DF is a labelled graph.",
        "For example, the representation of the DF in fig. 3 is shown in fig. 4. as input and converts it directly into the labelled graph as shown in fig. 4, which is then integrated into the knowledge base.",
        "A functional description network is the graph that represents a set of interlaced DFs, i.e. the knowledge base.",
        "This network is a labelled graph whose nodes correspond to DFs, and whose links to elementary object properties.",
        "These links are labelled with identifiers.",
        "colour table blue object (DF) property object (DF) fig. 5 Each identifier (e.g. colour) may be given different properties (e.g. inheritance properties).",
        "This is done through attaching a node to the identifier.",
        "The graph may contain Dynamic Paths , which allow access to the objects.",
        "A dynamic path is a function <f starting-point list-of-identifiers> whose value is a node on the graph.",
        "For example, in fig. 4, the dynamic path <f (M) actor name> points to the node \"William\".",
        "Dynamic Paths are very similar to substituable variables in formal systems.",
        "The processing of a DF network can be done at two levels : - elementary level : insert or delete links (i.e. properties) or nodes (i.e. objects) ; - form level : each node of the network can still be viewed as a description, which corresponds to a complex set of links.",
        "This allows us to work on the form of the objects (pattern matching and merging).",
        "The main algorithms that operate at the form level are those of compatibility (pattern matching) and merging.",
        "\"Compatilibity\" is a boolean function that decides whether two descriptions may correspond to the same object of the real world.",
        "For example, could the events described by \"William speaks to himself\" also be described by \"Somebody speaks to Ted\" ?",
        ": action cut actor +e\" named William (N) obj act past fig. 4 The system takes the DF, as shown in fig. 3,",
        "These two descriptions are not compatible, because the name of the \"obj-act\" is \"William\" on one hand and \"Ted\" on the other.",
        "Two compatible descriptions can be merged.",
        "The result is a new description, more complete than either of the originals.",
        "For example, the first two DFs of fig. 7 are compatible, and give the third one as the result of merging.",
        "These two algorithms, inspired by the functional unification introduced by Kay, are very powerful and are used at each step of text processing.",
