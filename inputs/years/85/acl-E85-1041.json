        "The elaboration of advanced user-computer dialogue systems requires the canrnunication laws to be investigated and formalized.",
        "This domain of research has not yet been officially acknowledged as a part of computational linguistics.",
        "However, developing the formal models of speech interaction requires to take into account not only linguistic but communicative competence also.",
        "That is necessary for creating natural-language systems as well as any complicated system of \"natural\" dialogue, and especially important in view of constructing new generation computers intended for mass non-programming users.",
        "We propose here a draft scheme of the model formalizing the structure of communicative context in dialogue interaction.",
        "The relationships between the interacting partners are considered as a system of three automata.",
        "Two of them represent the agents of the dialogue and the third one is a model of the world including the environnent of interaction and other agents if they participate.",
        "The automaton-agent is the central component of the oomnunicative competence model.",
        "We divide nemory of each agent into extracommunicative and communicative parts.",
        "The latter directly concerns with the relationships between the agents in projection onto the interaction process.",
        "Two restrictions have been accepted to simplify the model.",
        "(a) Communicative ccmpetences of both the agents, i.e. their beliefs about communication laws and actual state of their relations are identical just up to current aannunicative act (CA) because the contents of the act (including the communicative contents) at the mutant of its producing is known to the speaker only.",
        "(b) Receiver extracts fran CA just the same information the speaker implies."

        "We shall introduce necessary notions and notations.",
        "Let (M} be a set of all propositions reflecting the possible states of the three automata within the model, and M be a memory representing the agents' mutually coordinated beliefs about the world.",
        "State of M at moment T (i.e. MC) is a consistent subset of propositions from {191}, each of which being characterized by index of certainty.",
        "The machinery of interaction between the agents is dominated by a system of contracts.",
        "Here contracts represent all kinds of human-to-human relationships (social, interpersonal, business, etc.)",
        "For example, \"chief-subordinate\", \"official-client\", \"friends\", \"married couple\", \"patron-ward\", etc.",
        "Contract is represented with a tuple k, X, Y, Cond, Cond-Act, Cond-Des, T, where k is a name of contract; X and Y are roles of partners X and Y in the contract; Cond, Cond-Act and Cond-Des are consistent subsets of propositions from (M}, called general conditions, conditions of activation and conditions of decartivation of the contract, respectively; T is a set of interaction topics related to given contract.",
        "The interaction between the agents is realized by means of communicative acts (CA), in particular, of speech acts.",
        "Every CA is characterized with roles (author-receiver), aim, topic and value of phase function indicating the relation between CA and the topic (CA can be initiating, continuing, closing and re-initiating in respect to its topic).",
        "A subsequence of coherent connunicative acts connected with the same topic is called a t-i n t e r a c tin g. Discourse is considered as a system of embedded t-interactings.",
        "The simplest t-interacting",
        "may consist of a single CA which simultaneously initiates and closes its awn topic (for example, CA requiring no reaction fran the receiver).",
        "Topic is represented here by the following tuple t, X, Cond, Scr, Cnsq, where t is a name of topic; Y and Cond have the same meaning as for contract in the above definition; Scr is a set of scripts of t-inter-actings which realize the topic t (a script is either a single CA being the simplest t-interacting mentioned above or a chain of correlated embedded subtopics, respectively); the scripts in Scr may be just listed or/and specified by means of a formal generative procedure; Cnsq is a set of all possible consequences of closing t, i.e. a set of modifications of the memory M resulting fran t-interactings which realize the potential scripts of Scr; Aim is a subset of Cnsq which conventionally is considered as the aim of agent initiating the topic t. Initiating some topic t the agent chooses sane script from Scr he plans to realize; in general case a script allows several possible continuations at every intermediate point of its realization, one of these continuations corresponds to the script the agent plans to realize at the given moment."

        "Thus the carmunicative competence of the agents is defined by the set {M) of propositions, the set (K) of contracts and the set (T) of topics possible for X and Y.",
        "To demonstrate the functioning of our model we shall consider the component of M related directly to the process of 03U-munication.",
        "This component being called Communicative Context (CC), includes: - a set TT of current topics, i.e. the topics initiated before a moment T and not closed yet, to each topic t E T current script of its realization is put in correspondence.",
        "The topics belonging to TT are hierarchically embedded so that the topic t is embedded into the topic t' (or t' is on higher level than t) if t is initiated according to the current script of t'; a current topic/script which CAT_/ belongs to,will be referred as actual topic/script;",
        "- a set KT of contracts being in the activated state for the agent at the moment T; - a subset +KtC KT of contracts related to the topics included in TT; i.e. the contracts immediately related to the contents of the interaction.",
        "The transformation of KT is defined by the following rules (for each k E K);",
        "(a) if Cond-Act (MT) and k E KT is true, then the contract k is included into KT1.1; (b) if (k E KT)s,(Condk(M)=false), i.e. conditions of the contract k are not fulfilled, the contract k is excluded fran Kr+1; (c) if Cond-Desk(MT)&k E KT is true, the contract k is excluded from KT+1; it does not mean that Cond-Desk(MT)- NO Condk(MT) takes place.",
        "The rules (a) and (b) require Cond-Actk(MT)•Condk(MT).",
        "For the contracts in K a system of relations can be defined, for example: contracts kl and k2 are mutually incompatible if Condki&Condk2=false; kl is n c o m p at i b 1 e with k2 if (k2 E KTVCondk2(MT)) ▪ (Cond-Desk1(M4)- V NO Condki);k1 implies k2 if (CondkiN7Cond-Actki).. Cono-Actk2 or klEKt*Cond-Actk2(MT).",
        "The main scheme of the considered machinery of communication can be described as follows.",
        "A current state MT causes agent (X) to set some goal; X forms a plan to achieve the goal and begins to realize it.",
        "Some step of X's plan demands to involve the partner Y: to perform definite action or to accept sane proposition as valid or to provide information needed, etc.",
        "To get this result is the aim of X at the given step of this plan.",
        "To gain the aim, X should choose an appropriate topic (one of the topics with this aim).",
        "In the simplest case it is possible to use just the next topic t in the script of the higher level topic with an aim being more general in the X's plan than the current one.",
        "In this situation initiating the subtopic t produces minimal modification of CC (which is adding t to T) and does not modify the set K of the activated contracts and its subset +K.",
        "In more complex cases to initiate an appropri-te topic t it is necessary to include in +K one of contracts from K/+K or even to activate sane new contract k', i.e. to include k' in K. Closing a current topic t may produce sane consequences fran Cnsq with the corresponding modification of M which can lead to - the end of communication, - a new goal for X and/or Y, - moving to the next subgoal in the current plan.",
