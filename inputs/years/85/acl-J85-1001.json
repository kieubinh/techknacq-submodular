        "Machine Translation (MT) of natural human languages is not a subject about which most scholars feel neutral.",
        "This field has had a long, colorful career, and boasts no shortage of vociferous detractors and proponents alike.",
        "During its first decade in the 1950s, interest and support was fueled by visions of high-speed high-quality translation of arbitrary texts (especially those of interest to the military and intelligence communities, who funded MT projects quite heavily).",
        "During its second decade in the 1960s, disillusionment crept in as the number and difficulty of the linguistic problems became increasingly obvious, and as it was realized that the translation problem was not nearly so amenable to automated solution as had been thought.",
        "The climax came with the delivery of the National Academy of Sciences ALPAC report in 1966, condemning the field and, indirectly, its workers alike.",
        "The ALPAC report was criticized as narrow, biased, and short-sighted, but its recommendations were adopted (with the important exception of increased expenditures for long-term, research in computational linguistics), and as a result MT projects were cancelled in the U.S. and elsewhere around the world.",
        "By 1973, the early part of the third decade of MT, only three government-funded projects were left in the U.S., and by late 1975 there were none.",
        "Paradoxically, MT systems were still being used by various government agencies here and abroad, because there was simply no alternative means of gathering information from foreign [Russian] sources so quickly; in addition, private companies were developing and selling MT systems based on the mid-60s technology so roundly castigated by ALPAC.",
        "Nevertheless the general disrepute of MT resulted in a remarkably quiet third decade.",
        "We are now into the fourth decade of MT, and there is a resurgence of interest throughout the world – plus a growing number of MT and MAT (Machine-aided Translation) systems in use by governments, business and industry: in 1984 approximately half a million pages of text were translated by machine.",
        "Industrial firms are also beginning to fund M(A)T R&D projects of their own; thus it can no longer be said that only government funding keeps the field alive (indeed, in the U.S. there is no government funding, though the Japanese and European governments are heavily subsidizing MT R&D).",
        "In part this interest is due to more realistic expectations of what is possible in MT, and realization that MT can be very useful though imperfect; but it is also true that the capabilities of the newer MT systems lie well beyond what was possible just one decade ago.",
        "In light of these events, it is worth reconsidering the potential of, and prospects for, Machine Translation.",
        "After opening with an explanation of how [human] translation is done where it is taken seriously, we present a brief introduction to MT technology and a short historical perspective before considering the present status and state of the art, and then moving on to a discussion of the future prospects.",
        "For reasons of space and perspicuity, we shall concentrate on MT efforts in the U.S. and western Europe, though some other MT projects and less-ambitious approaches will receive attention."

      "text": [
        "When evaluating the feasibility or desirability of Machine Translation, one should consider the endeavor in light of the facts of human translation for like purposes.",
        "In the U.S., it is common to conceive of translation as simply that which a human translator does.",
        "It is generally believed that a college.",
        "degree [or the equivalent] in a foreign language qualifies one to be a translator for just about any material whatsoever.",
        "Native speakers of foreign languages are considered to be that much more qualified.",
        "Thus, translation is not particularly respected as a profession in the U.S., and the pay is poor.",
        "In Canada, in Europe, and generally around the world, this myopic attitude is not held.",
        "Where translation is a fact of life rather than an oddity, it is realized that any translator's competence is sharply restricted to a few domains (this is especially true of technical areas), and that native fluency in a foreign language does not bestow on one the ability to serve as a translator.",
        "Thus, there are college-level and postgraduate schools that teach the theory (translatology) as well as the practice of translation; thus, a technical translator is trained in the few areas in which he will be doing translation.",
        "Of special relevance to MT is the fact that essentially all translations for dissemination (export) are revised by more highly qualified translators who necessarily refer back to the original text when post-editing the translation.",
        "(This is not \"pre-publication stylistic editing\".)",
        "Unrevised translations are always regarded as inferior in quality, or at least suspect, and for many if not most purposes they are simply not acceptable.",
        "In the multinational firm Siemens, even internal communications that are translated are post-edited.",
        "Such news generally comes as a surprise, if not a shock, to most people in the U.S.",
        "It is easy to see, therefore, that the \"fully-automatic high-quality machine translation\" standard, imagined by most U.S. scholars to constitute minimum acceptability, must be radically redefined.",
        "Indeed, the most famous MT critic of all eventually recanted his strong opposition to MT, admitting that these terms could only be defined by the users, according to their own standards, for each situation (Bar-Hillel 1971).",
        "So an MT system does not have to print and bind the result of its translation in order to qualify as \"fully automatic\".",
        "\"High quality\" does not at all rule out post-editing, since the proscription of human revision would \"prove\" the infeasibility of high-quality Human Translation.",
        "Academic debates about what constitutes \"high-quality\" and \"fully-automatic\" are considered irrelevant by the users of Machine Translation (MT) and Machine-aided Translation (MAT) systems; what matters to them are two things: whether the systems can produce output of sufficient quality for the intended use (e.g., revision), and whether the operation as a whole is cost-effective or, rarely, justifiable on other grounds, like speed."

        "This does not rule out preprocessing (assuming this is not for the purpose of marking phrase boundaries and resolving part-of-speech and/or other ambiguities, etc.",
        "), nor post-editing (since this is normally done for human translations anyway).",
        "However, an MT system is solely responsible for the complete translation process from input of the source text to output of the target text without human assistance, using special programs, comprehensive dictionaries, and collections of linguistic rules (to the extent they exist, varying with the MT system).",
        "MT occupies the top range of positions on the scale of computer translation ambition.",
        "MAT systems fall into two subgroups: human-assisted machine translation (HAMT) and machine-assisted human translation (MAHT).",
        "These occupy successively lower ranges on the scale of computer translation ambition.",
        "HAMT refers to a system wherein the computer is responsible for producing the translation per se, but may interact with a human monitor at many stages along the way – for example, asking the human to disambiguate a word's part of speech or meaning, or to indicate where to attach a phrase, or to choose a translation for a word or phrase from among several candidates discovered in the system's dictionary.",
        "MAHT refers to a system wherein the human is responsible for producing the translation per se (on-line), but may interact with the system in certain prescribed situations – for example, requesting assistance in searching through a local dictionary or",
        "thesaurus, accessing a remote terminology data bank, retrieving examples of the use of a word or phrase, or performing word processing functions like formatting.",
        "The existence of a preprocessing stage is unlikely in a MA(H)T system (the system does not need help, instead, it is making help available), but post-editing is frequently appropriate.",
        "Terminology Data banks (TD) are the least ambitious systems because access frequently is not made during a translation task (the translator may not be working on-line), but usually is performed prior to human translation.",
        "Indeed the data bank may not be accessible (to the translator) on-line at all, but may be limited to the production of printed subject-area glossaries.",
        "A TD offers access to technical terminology, but usually not to common words (the user already knows these).",
        "The chief advantage of a TD is not the fact that it is automated (even with on-line access, words can be found just as quickly in a printed dictionary), but that it is up-to-date: technical terminology is constantly changing and published dictionaries are essentially obsolete by the time they are available.",

        "More likely, he could understand the content of the text well enough that a more careful translation would not be necessary.",
        "The classic example of the latter purpose of translation is technology export: an industry in one country that desires to sell its products in another country must usually provide documentation in the purchaser's chosen language.",

        "Direct translation is characteristic of a system (e.g., GAT) designed from the start to translate out of one specific language and into another.",
        "Direct systems are",
        "limited to the minimum work necessary to effect that translation; for example, disambiguation is performed only to the extent necessary for translation into that one target language, irrespective of what might be required for another language.",
        "Indirect translation, on the other hand, is characteristic of a system (e.g., EUROTRA) wherein the analysis of the source language and the synthesis of the target language are totally independent processes; for example, disambiguation is performed to the extent necessary to determine the \"meaning\" (however represented) of the source language input, irrespective of which target language(s) that input might be ,translated into.",
        "The interlingua approach is characteristic of a system (e.g., CETA) in which the representation of the \"meaning\" of the source language input is intended to be independent of any language, and this same representation is used to synthesize the target language output.",
        "The linguistic universals searched for and debated about by linguists and philosophers is the notion that underlies an interlingua.",
        "Thus, the representation of a given unit of meaning would be the same, no matter what language (or grammatical structure) that unit might be expressed in.",
        "The transfer approach is characteristic of a system (e.g., TAUM) in which the underlying representation of the \"meaning\" of a grammatical unit (e.g., sentence) differs depending on the language from which it was derived or into which it is to be generated; this implies the existence of a third translation stage which maps one language-specific meaning representation into another: this stage is called Transfer.",
        "Thus, the overall transfer translation process is Analysis followed by Transfer and then Synthesis.",
        "The transfer versus interlingua difference is not applicable to all systems; in particular, direct MT systems use neither the transfer nor the interlingua approach, since they do not attempt to represent \"meaning\".",
        "Local scope versus global scope is not so much a difference of category as degree.",
        "Local scope characterizes a system (e.g., SYSTRAN) in which words are the essential unit driving analysis, and in which that analysis is, in effect, performed by separate procedures for each word which try to determine – based on the words to the left and/or right – the part of speech, possible idiomatic usage, and \"sense\" of the word keying the procedure.",
        "In such systems, for example, homographs (words that differ in part of speech and/or derivational history [thus meaning], but that are written alike) are a major problem, because a unified analysis of the sentence per se is not attempted.",
        "Global scope characterizes a system (e.g., METAL) in which the meaning of a word is determined by its context within a unified analysis of the sentence (or, rarely, paragraph).",

        "The METAL German-English system passed tests in a production-style setting in late 1982, mid-1983, and twice in 1984, and the system was then installed at the sponsor's site in Germany for further testing and final development of a translator interface.",
        "Renamed LITRAS, it was introduced for sale at the Hanover Fair in Germany in April 1985.",
        "The METAL dictionaries are now being expanded for maximum possible coverage of selected technical areas, and work on other language pairs has begun in earnest.",
        "One of the particular strengths of the METAL system is its accommodation of a variety of linguistic theories/strategies.",
        "The German analysis component is based on a context-free phrase-structure grammar, augmented by procedures with facilities for, among other",
        "things, arbitrary transformations.",
        "The English analysis component, on the other hand, employs a modified GPSG approach and makes no use of transformations.",
        "Analysis is completely separated from transfer, and the system is multilingual in that a given constituent structure analysis can be used for transfer and synthesis into multiple target languages.",
        "(Translation from German into Chinese and Spanish, as well as from English into German, has transpired on an experimental basis.)",
        "The transfer component of METAL includes two transformation packages, one used by transfer grammar rules and the other by transfer dictionary entries; these cooperate during transfer, which is effected during a top-down exploration of the (highest-scoring) tree produced in the analysis phase.",
        "The strategy for the top-down pass is controlled by the linguist who writes the transfer rules.",
        "These are most often paired 1-1 with the grammar rules used to perform the original analysis, so that there is no need to search through a general transfer grammar to find applicable rules (potentially allowing application of the wrong ones); however, the option of employing a more general transfer grammar is available, and is in fact used for the translation of clauses.",
        "As implied above, structural and lexical transfer are performed in the same pass, so that each may influence the operation of the other; in particular, transfer dictionary entries may specify the syntactic and/or semantic contexts in which they are valid.",
        "If no analysis is achieved for a given input, the longest phrases which together span that input are selected for independent transfer and synthesis, so that every input (a sentence, or perhaps a phrase) results in some translation.",
        "In addition to producing a translation system per se, the Texas group has developed software packages for text processing (so as to format the output translations like the original input documents), data base management (of dictionary entries and grammar rules), rule validation (to eliminate most errors in dictionary entries and grammar rules), dictionary construction (to enhance human efficiency in coding lexical entries), etc.",
        "Aside from the word-processing front-end (developed by the project sponsor), the METAL group has developed a complete system, rather than a basic machine translation engine that leaves much drudgery for its human developers/users.",
        "Lehmann et al.",
        "(1981), Bennett (1982), and Slocum (1983, 1984, 1985) present more details about the METAL system.",
        "GETA As discussed earlier, the Groupe d'Etudes pour la Traduction Automatique was formed when Grenoble abandoned the CETA system.",
        "In reaction to the failures of the interlingua approach, GETA adopted the transfer approach.",
        "In addition, the former software design was largely discarded, and a new software package supporting a new style of processing was substituted.",
        "The core of the GETA translation system (ARIANE-78) is composed of three types of programs: one converts strings into trees (for, e.g., word analysis), one converts trees into trees (for, e.g., syntactic analysis and transfer), and the third converts trees into strings (for, e.g., word synthesis).",
        "(A fourth type exists, but may be viewed as a specialized instance of one of the others.)",
        "The overall translation process is composed of a sequence of stages, wherein each stage employs one of these programs.",
        "Other modules in ARIANE-78 support editing and system maintenance functions.",
        "One of the features of ARIANE-78 that sets it apart from other MT systems is the insistence on the part of the designers that no stage be more powerful than is minimally necessary for its proper function.",
        "Thus, rather than supplying the linguist with programming tools capable of performing any operation whatever (e.g., the arbitrarily powerful Q-systems of TAUM), ARIANE-78 supplies at each stage only the minimum capability necessary to effect the desired linguistic operation, and no more.",
        "This reduces the likelihood that the linguist will become overly ambitious and create unnecessary problems, and also enabled the programmers to produce software that runs more rapidly than would be possible with a more general scheme.",
        "A \"grammar\" in the ROBRA subsystem is actually a network of subgrammars; that is, a grammar is a graph specifying alternative sequences of applications of the subgrammars and optional choices of which subgrammars are to be applied (at all).",
        "The top-level grammar is therefore a \"control graph\" over the subgrammars that actually effect the linguistic operations – analysis, transfer, etc.",
        "ARIANE-78 is sufficiently general to allow implementation of any linguistic theory, or even multiple theories at once (in separate subgrammars) if such is desired.",
        "Thus, in principle, it is completely open-ended and could accommodate arbitrary semantic processing and reference to \"world models\" of any description.",
        "In practice, however, the story is more complicated.",
        "In order to increase the computational flexibility, as is required to take advantage of substantially new linguistic theories, especially \"world models\", the underlying software would have to be changed in many various ways.",
        "Unfortunately, the underlying software is rigid (written in low-level languages), making modification extremely difficult.",
        "As a result, the GETA group has been unable to experiment with any radically new computational strategies.",
        "Back-up, for example, is a known problem (Tsujii, personal communication): if the GETA system \"pursues a wrong path\" through the control graph of subgrammars, it can undo some of its work by backing up past whole graphs, discarding the results produced by entire subgrammars; but within a subgrammar, there is no possibility of backing up and reversing the effects of individual rule applications.",
        "Until GETA receives enough funding that programmers can be hired to rewrite the software in a high-level language (LISP/PROLOG is being evaluated), facilitating present and future redesign, the",

        "Unless the GETA software basis can be updated, however, it may not long remain a viable system.",
        "(The GETA staff are actively seeking funding for such a project.)",

        "After the failure of a project intended to modify GAT for Russian-German translation, a new system was designed along somewhat similar lines to translate Russian into German after \"global\" sentence analysis into dependency tree structures, using the transfer approach.",
        "Unlike most other MT projects, the Saarbriicken group was left relatively free to pursue research interests, rather than forced to produce applications, and was also funded at a level sufficient to permit significant ongoing experimentation and modification.",
        "As a result, SUSY tended to track external developments in MT and AI more closely ,than other projects.",
        "For example, Saarbrticken helped establish the cooperative MT group LEIBNIZ (along with Grenoble and others) in 1974.",
        "Until 1975, SUSY was based on a strict transfer approach; since 1976, however, it has evolved, becoming more abstract as linguistic problems mandating \"deeper\" analysis have forced the transfer representations to assume some of the generality of an interlingua.",
        "Also as a result of such research freedom, there was apparently no sustained attempt to develop coverage for specific end-user applications.",
        "Developed as a multilingual system involving English, French, German, Russian, and Esperanto, work on SUSY has tended to concentrate on translation into German from Russian and, recently, English.",
        "The strongest limiting factor in the further development of SUSY seems to be related to the initial inspiration behind the project: SUSY adopted a primitive approach in which the linguistic rules were organized into strictly independent strata and, where efficiency seemed to dictate, incorporated directly into the software (Maas 1984).",
        "As a consequence, the rules were virtually unreadable, and their interactions, eventually, became almost impossible to manage.",
        "In terms of application potential, therefore, SUSY seems to have failed, even though it is used (within University projects) for the translation of patent descriptions and other materials.",

        "The justification for the project is simple, inescapable economics: over a third of the entire administrative budget of the EEC for 1982 was needed to pay the translation division (average individual cost: $43,000 per year), which still could not keep up with the demands placed on it; technical translation costs the EEC $0.20 per word for each of six translations (from the seventh original language), and doubles the cost of the technology documented; with the addition of Spain and Portugal, the translation staff would have to double for the current demand level (unless highly productive machine aids were already in place) (Perusse 1983).",
        "The high cost of writing SYSTRAN dictionary entries is presently justifiable for reasons of speed in translation, but this situation is not viable in the long term.",
        "The EEC must have superior quality MT at lower cost for dictionary work.",
        "Human translation alone will never suffice.",
        "EUROTRA is a true multinational development project.",
        "There is no central laboratory where the work will take place, but instead designated University representatives of each member country will produce the analysis and synthesis modules for their native language; only the transfer modules will be built by a \"central\" group and the transfer modules are designed to be as small as possible, consisting of little more than lexical substitution (King 1982).",
        "Software development will be almost entirely separated from the linguistic rule development; indeed, the production software, though designed by the EUROTRA members, will be written by whichever commercial software house wins the contract in bidding competition.",
        "Several coordinating committees are working with the various language and emphasis groups to ensure cooperation.",
        "The theoretical linguistic basis of EUROTRA is not novel.",
        "The basic structures for representing \"meaning\" are dependency trees, marked with feature-value pairs partly at the discretion of the language groups writing the grammars (anything a group wants, it can add), and partly controlled by mutual agreement among the language groups (a certain set of feature-value combinations has been agreed to constitute minimum information; all are constrained to produce this set when analyzing sentences in their language, and all may expect it to be present when synthesizing sentences in their language) (King 1981, 1982).",
        "This is not to say that no new linguistic knowledge is being gained for, aside from the test of theory that EUROTRA is about to perform, there is the very substantial matter of the background contrastive linguistic investigation that has been going on since about 1978.",
        "In one sense, the software basis of EUROTRA will not be novel either.",
        "The basic rule interpreter will be \"a general rewrite system with a control language over grammars/processes\" (King, personal communication).",
        "As with ARIANE-78, the linguistic rules can be bundled into packets of subgrammars, and the linguists will be provided with a means of controlling which packets of rules are applied, and when; the individual rules will be non-destructive rewrite rules, so that the application of any given rule may create new structure, but will never erase any old information.",
        "In another sense, however, the software basis of EUROTRA is quite remarkably different from other systems that have preceded it.",
        "The analysis, transfer, and synthesis strategies will not be incorporated into algorithms that the programmers implement; rather, they will be formulated by linguists and represented in a special control language (not the rule-writing language, which is algorithm-independent).",
        "This formulation of the dynamic control strategies will be compiled into a program that will then interpret the \"static\" rules describing the linguistic facts.",
        "This is a bold step.",
        "There are, of course, pitfalls to any such action.",
        "Aside from the usual risk of unforeseen problems, there are two rather obvious unresolved issues.",
        "First, it remains to be seen whether linguists, trained mostly in the static, \"descriptive\" framework of linguistics (modern or otherwise), can accommodate themselves to the expression of dynamic algorithms – a mode of thinking that programmers (including almost all computational linguists) are far more adept at.",
        "Second, it also remains to be seen whether the system can be designed sufficiently flexibly to adjust to the wide range of experimental strategies that is sure to come when the staff is given such a large degree of freedom (remembering that the software implementation is seen as an essentially one-shot process to be performed on contract basis), while at the same time retaining sufficient speed to ensure that the computing requirements are affordable.",
        "Affordability is not merely an issue belonging to the eventual production system!",
        "On the contrary, it is critically important that a development group be able to conduct experiments that produce results in a reasonable amount of time.",
        "After too long a delay, the difference becomes one of category rather than degree, and progress is substantially – perhaps fatally – impeded.",
        "The EUROTRA charter requires delivery of a small representative prototype system by late 1987, and a prototype covering one technical area by late 1988.",
        "The system must translate among the official languages of all member countries that sign a \"contract of association\"; thus, not all seven EEC languages will necessarily be represented, but by law at least four languages must be represented if the project is to continue.",
        "It appears that the requisite number of member states have committed to join.",
        "It will be interesting to see whether this, the most ambitious of all MT projects, succeeds; either way, the consequences promise to be noteworthy.",
        "Human languages are, by nature, different.",
        "So much so that the illusory goal of abstract perfection in translation – once and still imagined by some to be achievable – can be comfortably ruled out of the realm of possible existence, whether attempted by machine or man.",
        "Even the abstract notion of \"quality\" is undefinable, hence immeasurable.",
        "In its place, we must substitute the notion of evaluation of translation according to its purpose, judged by the consumer.",
        "One must therefore accept the truth that the notion of quality is inherently subjective.",
        "Certainly there will be translations hailed by most if not all as \"good\", and correspondingly there will be translations almost universally labelled \"bad\".",
        "Most translations, however, will surely fall in between these extremes, and each user must render his own judgement according to his needs.",
        "In corporate circles, however, there is and has always been an operational definition of \"good\" versus \"bad\" translation: a good translation is what senior translators are willing to expose to outside scrutiny (not that they are fully satisfied, for they never are); and a bad one is what they are not willing to release.",
        "These experienced translators – usually post-editors – impose a judgement the corporate body is willing to accept at face value: after all, such judgement is the very purpose for having senior translators.",
        "It is arrived at subjectively, based on the purpose for which the translation is intended, but comes as close to being an objective assessment as the world is likely to see.",
        "In a post-editing context, a \"good\" original translation is one worth revising – i.e., one the editor will endeavor to change, rather than reject or replace with his own original translation.",
        "Therefore, any rational position on the state of the art in MT and MAT must respect the operational decisions about the quality of MT and MAT as judged by the present users.",
        "These systems are all, of course, based on old technology (\"ancient\", by the standards of AI researchers); but by the time systems employing today's AI technology hit the market, they too will be \"antiquated\" by the research laboratory standards of their time.",

        "If MT systems are to continue to improve so as to further reduce the burden on human translators, there will be a greater need and demand for continuing MT R&D efforts."

        "The translation problem will not go away, and human solutions (short of full automation) do not now, and never will, suffice.",
        "MT systems have already scored successes among the user community, and the trend can hardly fail to continue as users demand further improvements and greater speed, and MT system vendors respond.",
        "The half-million pages of text translated by machine in 1984 is but a drop in the bucket of translation demand.",
        "Of course, the need for research is great, but some current and future applications will continue to succeed on economic grounds alone – and to the user community, this is virtually the only measure of success or failure.",
        "It is important to note that translation systems are not going to \"fall out\" of AI efforts not seriously contending with multiple languages from the start.",
        "There are two reasons for this.",
        "First, English is not a representative language.",
        "Relatively speaking, it is not even a very hard language from the standpoint of Computational Linguistics: Japanese, Chinese, Russian, and even German, for example, seem more difficult to deal with using existing CL techniques – surely in part due to the nearly total concentration of CL workers on English, and their consequent development of tools specifically for English (and, accidentally, for English-like languages).",
        "Developing translation ability will require similar concentration by CL workers on other languages; nothing less will suffice.",
        "Second, it would seem that translation is not by any means a simple matter of understanding the source text, then reproducing it in the target language – even though many translators (and virtually every layman) will say this is so.",
        "On the one hand, there is the serious question of whether, in for example the case of an article on front-line research in semiconductor switching theory, or particle physics, a translator really does \"fully comprehend\" the content of the article he is translating.",
        "One would suspect not.",
        "(Johnson (1983) makes a point of claiming that he has produced translations, judged good by informed peers, in technical areas where his expertise is deficient, and his understanding, incomplete.)",
        "On the other hand, it is also true that translation schools expend considerable effort teaching techniques for low-level lexical and syntactic manipulation – a curious fact to contrast with the usual \"full comprehension\" claim.",
        "In any event, every qualified translator will agree that there is much more to translation than simple analysis/synthesis (an almost prime facie proof of the necessity for Transfer).",
        "What this means is that the development of translation as an application of Computational Linguistics will require substantial research in its own right in addition to the work necessary in order to provide the basic multilingual analysis and synthesis tools.",
        "Translators must be consulted, for they are the experts in translation.",
        "None of this will happen by accident; it must result from design."
