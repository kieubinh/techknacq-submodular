        "In 1965, with funding from the National Research Council of Canada, the CETADOL research center in computational linguistics was created at l'Universite de Montreal.",
        "Around 1970, the center narrowed its focus to the problem of machine translation (MT), renaming itself TAUM (Traduction Automatique Universite de Montreal).",
        "In the next few years, several MT protypes were developed: TAUM-71, TAUM-73, and TAUM-76 (Colmerauer et al.",
        "1971, Kittredge et al.",
        "1973, Kittredge et al.",
        "1976).",
        "Starting in 1973, the Canadian Secretary of State Department (Translation Bureau) assumed responsibility for funding the project, in the hope that tangible results would soon emerge.",
        "Between 1974 and 1976, TAUM produced its first practical application: the TAUM-METEO system, for the translation of weather forecasts (Chevalier et al.",
        "1978).",
        "Since 1977, this system has been used on a daily basis for the Canadian Environment Department (Chandioux and Gueraud 1981).",
        "Its current workload represents an annual volume of 8.5 million words (Bourbeau 1984).",
        "In spite of its very narrow scope, TAUM-METEO represents an important breakthrough in MT, since it is the only system that currently produces high quality translation without the need for human revision (although approximately 20% of the input is rejected).",
        "The AVIATION project was undertaken in 1976, even before the on-site implementation of TAUM-METEO was completed.",
        "The aim was to develop a system capable of translating aircraft maintenance manuals.",
        "Obviously, this was a more difficult challenge than translating weather forecasts.",
        "The magnitude of the task necessitated a massive infusion of new personnel and the development of a set of new metalanguages (e.g. LEXTRA, SISIF).",
        "A prototype of the TAUM-AVIATION system, restricted to hydraulic system maintenance manuals, was demonstrated in 1979.",
        "The following year, an independent evaluation (Gervais 1980) concluded that it was not possible to envisage immediate cost-effective production using TAUM-AVIATION.",
        "This evaluation led the Translation Bureau to stop funding the TAUM-AVIATION project, and to look for a broader funding base for MT research and development in Canada.",
        "In the meantime, the TAUM Group had to be disbanded."

        "Selectional restrictions constitute the main semantic mechanism used by the system to eliminate ambiguities of two types: a. structural ambiguities introduced by syntactic rules; thus the spurious structure proposed by the parser for (5) is eliminated because the verb drain does not accept as direct object something in the semantic category of plug.",
        "b. lexical ambiguity in the semantic properties of certain lexical items; polysemous words like the noun line (which can denote either an abstract geometrical object, or physical objects such as conductors) are frequently disambiguated by selectional restrictions; for example, in Flush the line, the concrete sense is selected.",

        "Rules such as the following are used: • all of the semantic features of a headnoun are raised onto the dominating NP node; • the intersection of the features of two conjoined NP nodes is raised onto the dominating NP node; and • when the headnoun is a partitive noun (e.g. portion), and the NP has an of NP complement, the features of this complement are raised onto the dominating NP node.",
        "The system also makes use of standard control rules for subjectless infinitives and gerundives, and of some pronoun/antecedent rules, in order to enforce semantic constraints wherever possible.",
        "Semantic ambiguity, whether real homography (e.g. the two nouns lead) or polysemy (e.g. the various senses of the noun line), is not handled by creating multiple entries in the source language dictionary.",

        "At run time, they are retrieved from an arbitrarily large lexical data base and applied to the chart.",
        "The lexical database system includes some maintenance facilities, such as integrity constraints on its contents, and facilities for retrieving entries through arbitrarily complex requests on their contents.",
        "We saw in 4.3 that lexical transfer involves rules that perform complex transformations on tree structures.",
        "The LEXTRA metalanguage makes it possible to associate with any lexical item an arbitrarily complex set of tree transformations.",
        "These transformations describe a pattern (anchored in the relevant lexical item), which is to be matched against the tree structure at run time.",
        "When a match is found, a series of associated actions specifying structural changes is performed.",
        "An important idea embodied in LEXTRA is that a transfer component should have an explicit description of the intermediate language.",
        "In the TAUM approach this intermediate language is partially defined by a set of context-free rules that describe a common base component for SL and TL.",
        "LEXTRA takes as data this context-free grammar and guarantees that any manipulated tree structure corresponds to a permissible derivation in terms of that context-free grammar.",
        "This notion is to be related to computational formulations of transformational grammar such as Petrick (1973), where the deep structures produced by the inverse transformations are checked against the rules of the base component.",
        "No equivalent check is performed with parsing systems like ATNs.",
        "LEXTRA rules are compiled into list structures.",
        "It was found that some of the constraints on admissible tree structures could be enforced at compile time (Gerin-Lajoie 1980).",

        "It helps validate the work of the lexicographer.",

        "• REZO includes a number of primitives to perform pattern matching over tree structures; • in addition to regular ATN states where all transitions are tried, REZO includes \"deterministic\" states where only the first transition whose test is met is followed; • REZO accords special status to the states to which a recursive call can be made, so that the resulting grammar is a collection of sub-networks.",
        "The REZO grammar is compiled into a set of instructions for a virtual machine, which is simulated by the runtime interpreter.",
        "Parsing is done in the usual top-down, depth-first, left-to-right, serial manner.",
        "The interpreter can either work in an all-paths or in a first-path mode.",
        "One important difference from Wood's ATN interpreter is that REZO takes as input a chart structure in which lexical ambiguities are encoded and applies the grammar in parallel to all the paths of this chart.",
        "The result is also a chart structure: REZO is thus a chart-to-chart transducer.",
        "In 4.2, it was mentioned that syntactic rules create structural ambiguities, and that semantic processing can eliminate some of these.",
        "Serial parsing provides another means of selecting a particular reading.",
        "Since the transitions of the REZO networks are followed in a fixed order, the grammar can be made to produce the most likely reading first.",
        "In TAUM-AVIATION's analysis grammar, the ordering of the transitions reflects:",
        "• general parsing principles such as those discussed in human performance studies (e.g. Kimball 1973); and • sublanguage-specific statistical tendencies.",
        "Structural transfer and syntactic synthesis are implemented in the well-known Q-SYSTEMS, which we will not describe here.",
        "This introduces some heterogeneity into TAUM-AVIATION, since: a) unlike the other metalanguages, Q-SYSTEMS do not support trees with complex symbols as node labels; and b) the compiler and the interpreter are written in FORTRAN while PASCAL is used for the other metalanguages.",
        "In fact, the original design of the system included provisions for a new metalanguage well suited to synthesis; but time constraints precluded its development."

        "Some of the differences are:",
        "• REZO does not support morphological analysis, which is performed in a separate component; • tree nodes are complex symbols that include sets of features on which boolean operations can be performed;",
        "In 1981, the sponsor submitted TAUM-AVIATION to a cost-benefit evaluation, in order to determine if the system was usable in a production environment.",
        "This evaluation made by an independent consultant is reported in Gervais (1980), and we will only summarize the main conclusions.",
        "Raw machine output was deemed to have a degree of intelligibility, fidelity, and style that reaches 80% of unrevised human translations (HT).",
        "Revised MT and revised HT have a comparable degree of quality, but revision costs are twice as high for MT; thus, globally, revised MT turns out to be more expensive than revised HT as shown in Table 3.",
        "However, it is noted in the evaluator's report that MT reduces by half the human time required in the translation/revision process.",
        "The direct costs of MT could probably be reduced to an acceptable level, for example by interfacing the system with a suitable word-processing environment and by reducing the percentage of sentences for which no translation is produced (Isabelle 1981).",
        "Cost-effective production would require the system to be applicable to at least 6 million words per year.",
        "In order to reach that target, the system would have to be extended to translate domains other than hydraulics.",
        "But the indirect costs involved in these extensions (e.g. dictionary development) are very high.",

        "Cost-benefit evaluations are certainly necessary, but a single evaluation of this type tells one very little about how the system can be expected to perform on different texts, or after further investment.",
        "TAUM developed a methodology for analyzing the performance of an MT system through a systematic examination of its translation errors.",
        "The first step is to collect all the errors in the translation of the sample text; translators/revisors then have the responsibility of deciding what is to be counted as an error.",
        "A classification scheme for translation errors will include headings such as the following: incorrect TL equivalent for a word, incorrect word order, lack of an article, etc.",
        "In itself, an absolute number of such errors for a given text is not very revealing; but a comparison of the ratio of errors to word tokens in different texts, or at various stages of development of the system is an initial source of useful information.",
        "Still, from the point of view of system development, these \"surface\" translation problems are merely symptoms for problems in some component of the system.",

        "• incorrect marking in a dictionary entry; • mistake in TL syntactic rules for agreement; • incorrect scoping in SL analysis (e.g. give the wrong bracketing to an ADJ NOUN NOUN sequence); or • absence of relevant marking in SL (e.g. when translating federal and provincial governments into French, should one pluralize the adjectives?",
        ").",
        "A sophisticated error classification grid was developed, so that the sources of translation errors could be investigated in a coherent and meaningful way.",
        "Basically, this error grid reflects the internal organization of the system, so that translation errors can be assigned a precise cause in the operation of the system.",
        "Once a coherent scheme is available, one can proceed with the classification of the translation errors found in the sample text.",
        "This classification process is difficult and tedious, but it is crucial that it be done with accuracy and consistency.",
        "Frequently, one has to follow \"execution traces\" to discover the exact source of a given error.",
        "The final step is to look at the possible remedies for the problems that have been identified.",
        "A careful examination of each problem source will reveal whether or not there is a known way of eliminating it, and if so, what amount of effort is needed.",
        "If this type of technical evaluation can be carried out at successive stages of development (with both old and new texts), one gets a clear picture of the evolution of the system.",

        "The main goal was to see how well a system developed on the basis of corpora from the domain of hydraulics would fare in the domain of electronics.",
        "Some results were as follows:",
        "• In both tests, more than 70% of the failures were classified as having a known solution; the vast majority of these could be corrected in 12 person/months of work.",
        "• From a syntactic point of view, there is no notable difference between hydraulics and electronics.",
        "In fact, as a result of a minimal effort in correcting some problems discovered in the test on hydraulics, the overall performance of the parser turned out to be better in the electronics test.",
