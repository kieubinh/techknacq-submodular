        "Machine translation research at the LRC began with the founding of the center in 1961.",
        "For much of the history of this research, funding came from the U.S. Air Force's Rome Air Development Center and other U.S. government agencies.",
        "In January 1979, Siemens AG began funding the current development phase of the METAL system; the project then comprised one full-time and five or six half-time workers.",
        "As a result of Siemens's support, the existing system was scrapped and a new implementation effort was undertaken in the spring of that year; the project staff grew slowly at first, but with a recent substantial increase now numbers seven full-time and five half-time workers.",
        "The first operational version of the system was delivered to the sponsor for market testing in January 1985.",
        "The current system translates only from German into English, although work to add other Target Languages (Spanish and Chinese), as well as a second Source Language (English), is underway.",
        "The German grammar in its present form contains more than 600 rules; the lexicon has well in excess of 20,000 monolingual entries for German and English, and is expected to double in size in the near future."

      "text": [
        "Like any modern MT system, METAL is to be used in a technical translation environment where human revision of the output is expected – just as is the case with human translation around the world.",
        "The justification for using an MT system is a combination of pure economics (cost reduction) and necessity (to achieve the desired speed, perhaps required to get the job done at all); the trade-off between these two differs, depending on the organization and circumstance.",
        "In general, we expect that the LRC MT system must prove cost-effective in order to gain user acceptance: speed per se will be a secondary consideration.",
        "This means that the cost of using METAL for draft translation, and a human revisor thereafter, must be significantly [not marginally] less than the cost of using humans for draft translation, and a human revisor thereafter; the cost of \"using\" METAL must include its full amortization, etc.",
        "In an environment of technical translation, particularly of operation and maintenance manuals, one of the big problems is text format.",
        "As a glance at any technical manual will show, it is not the case that all material in a document must or can be translated.",
        "Large portions of a",
        "formatted text (up to 50% of the characters, in our experience) may not be translatable; the bulk of this may fall outside \"sentence\" boundaries, but some will fall within them.",
        "Thus, it is necessary for a text to be marked, or annotated, to distinguish that which is to be translated (e.g., tables of contents, instructions, prose paragraphs) from that which is not (e.g., flowchart box boundaries, sentence-internal formulas and acronyms, and various attention-focusing devices).",
        "The translatable units (not always \"complete sentences\") must then be extracted, translated, and finally reconstituted so as to appear like the original text.",
        "In the LRC MT system, special programs have been developed to handle the formatting problems associated with technical manuals.",
        "This software automatically marks texts and extracts translatable units for input to METAL, and reformats the translation afterwards (Slocum and Bennett 1982; Slocum et al.",
        "1984).",
        "The only human intervention expected prior to translation is checking and correcting the output of the routines that mark translatable units; the human does not, for example, resolve anaphora or disambiguate homographs or word senses.",
        "Nothing in the LRC MT system provides for human intervention during the actual translation phase.",
        "Text processing is presently done on a DEC-2060, post-editing on a PDP-11, and the actual translation on Symbolics Lisp Machines.",
        "For the foreseeable future a Lisp Machine will continue to be used as the \"translation engine.\" The project sponsor is constructing a microcomputer .front end supporting four to six translator workstations (as well as OCR devices, floppy-disk drives, printers, 'etc.",
        "), on which texts will be prepared and sent to the batch translation unit, and on which the output will be reformatted and revised; software specially suited to text preparation and post-editing is being programmed.",

      "heading": "3 GENERAL TRANSLATION APPROACH",
      "text": [
        "In METAL, translation proper consists of four successive phases: Analysis (parsing), Integration, Transfer, and Synthesis (generation).",
        "The Integration phase works with analysis tree structures, performing (at the present time) inter and extra-sentential anaphora resolution.",
        "Until recently, the Transfer and Synthesis phases were essentially a single phase, but work is in progress to split this phase, and introduce a much more powerful Synthesis phase.",
        "In this section we describe \"Transfer\" and defend it as our general translation approach; in the next section we discuss our linguistic techniques more fully.",
        "It is frequently argued that translation should be a process of analyzing the Source Language (SL) into a \"deep representation\" of some sort, then directly synthesizing the Target Language (TL) (e.g. Carbonell 1978).",
        "We and others (King 1981) contest this claim – especially with regard to \"similar languages\" (e.g., those in the Indo-European family).",
        "One objection is based on large-scale, long-term trials of the \"deep representation\" (in MT, called the \"pivot language\") approach by the CETA group at Grenoble (Boitet and Nedobejkine 1980).",
        "After an enormous investment in time and energy, including experiments with massive amounts (400,000 words) of text, it was decided that the development of a suitable pivot language (for use in Russian-French translation) was not yet possible.",
        "Another objection is based on practical considerations: since it is not likely that any NLP system will in the foreseeable future become capable of handling unrestricted input – even in the technical area(s) for which it might be designed – it is clear that a \"fail-soft\" technique is necessary.",
        "It is not obvious that such is possible in a system based solely on a pivot language; a hybrid system capable of dealing with shallower levels of understanding seems necessary in a practical setting.",
        "This being the case, it is better in near-term applications to start off with a system employing a \"shallow\" but usable level of analysis, and deepen the level of analysis as experience dictates, and theory plus project resources permit.",
        "The standard alternative, which we have adopted, is to have a transfer component that maps \"shallow analyses of sentences\" in the SL into \"shallow analyses of equivalent sentences\" in the TL, from which synthesis then takes place.",
        "This assumes the form of a transfer dictionary and a transfer grammar.",
        "While we and the rest of the NLP community continue to explore the nature of an adequate pivot language (i.e., the nature of deep semantic models and the processing they entail), we can, we believe, proceed to construct usable systems amenable to progressive enhancement as linguistic theory becomes able to support deeper models."

        "At first this may seem wasteful, but the majority of such cases in our dictionaries are German strong verbs – which sometimes behave differently, depending on inflection, and thus would require separate entries anyway.",
        "At system-generation time, the allomorphs are entered into a letter tree, which is searched during lexical analysis.",
        "The analysis of a word occurrence, then, is normally one or more sequences of morphemes (stems and affixes, mixed), each morpheme being an allomorph corresponding to one or more dictionary entries.",
        "These are fed to the parser as if they had been separate [alternative sequences of] \"words\" in the text (except that each morpheme is marked according to whether it was word-initial and/or word-final), which parses them [back] into words while it is parsing the words into a sentence.",
        "Lexical ambiguity (including homography and polysemy, as well as ambiguity in morphological decomposition) is tolerated as a natural phenomenon in the system, and is resolved according to a scoring scheme, discussed below, which handles syntactic ambiguity as well."

        "Thus, the application of rules is partially ordered.",
        "Furthermore, once the parser has applied all rules at a given level it halts if there exist one or more \"sentence\" interpretations of the input; only if there are none does it apply more rules – and then, it always starts back at level 0 (in case any rules at that level have been activated through the application of rules at a higher level, as can happen with a recursive grammar).",

        "Besides sheer elegance, this has the added advantage that \"ungrammatical\" parenthetical expressions may undergo phrasal analysis and thus become single-phrase entities as far as the analysis of the encompassing sentence is concerned; thus, ungrammatical parenthetical expressions need not result in ungrammatical (hence poorly handled) sentences."

        "If the lexical coding process is too complex, semantic errors will multiply and translation quality will suffer.",
        "Menu schemes wherein one selects the proper value of a feature from a short (10 item) list of options are greatly preferred over long lists of options or, worse, a scheme wherein one must volunteer the information via type-in.",
        "Even better is a scheme wherein the system, with minimal clues (e.g., root form and part of speech) generates an entry likely to be mostly correct, which the terminolo-gist then verifies and edits (again, via menu selection) as necessary.",
        "Needless to say, arcane codes that one must have a manual to keep track of are to be avoided at all cost.",
        "The lexicon for METAL is stored in an on-line DBMS written in LISP.",
        "Input of lexical entries is facilitated by an INTERCODER, a menu-driven interface that asks the user for information in English and converts the answers into the internal form used by the system.",
        "An integral part of the INTERCODER is the \"lexical default\" program that accepts minimal information about the particular entry (root form and lexical category) and heuristically encodes most of the remaining necessary features and values.",
        "Entries may also be created using any text editor, without the aid of the INTERCODER or lexical defaulter.",
        "Interfacing with the lexical data base is done by means of a number of functions that permit the user to access, edit, copy, and/or delete entries individually, in small groups (using specific features), by entire categories, or in toto (essentially no longer done for reasons of size).",
        "In order to assure a high degree of lexicon integrity the METAL system includes validation programs that identify errors in format and/or syntax.",
        "The validation process is automatically used to check lexical items that have been edited or added, to ensure that no errors have been introduced.",
        "Our terminologists indicate substantial subjective satisfaction with METAL's lexical coding scheme.",
        "Performance measurements indicate that, for categories other than verbs, a very few (2-5) minutes is all that is required to enter a pair of terms (in two languages, thus three dictionaries including Transfer); for verbs, the process is more complex, requiring as much as 20 minutes per word pair.",
        "But these times include the terminology research per se – i.e., the process of discovering or generating a proper translation of a term – so the overall burden of lexical maintenance seems quite acceptable, and cost-effectiveness is not adversely affected."

        "(1) there are classical problems in Computational Linguistics that remain unsolved to this day (e.g., anaphora, quantifiers, conjunctions); (2) these problems will, in any practical setting, compound on one another so as to result in a very low probability that any given sentence will be correctly translated; (3) it is not in principle possible for a system suffering from malady (1) above to reliably identify and mark its probable errors; (4) if the human post-editor must check every sentence to determine whether it has been correctly translated, then the translation is useless.",

        "There is a meaningful, more-or-less objective metric by which any MT system can and should be judged: overall (man/machine) translation performance.",
        "The idea is simple.",
        "The MT system must achieve two simultaneous goals: first, the system's output must be acceptable to the post-editor for the purpose of revision; second, the cost of the total effort (including amortization and maintenance of the hardware, the software, and the dictionaries) must be less than the current alternative for like material – human translation followed by post-editing.",
        "Regarding user acceptance, we can relate that the editors revising METAL translations in a series of experiments spanning the past few years have recently stated that the system has achieved a level of quality that they find acceptable for their day-to-day work (Whiffin, personal communication).",
        "From our experimental evidence, it would seem that this is a harder goal to reach than mere cost-effectiveness; i.e., \"cost-effectiveness\" can be demonstrated in experimental settings, with an output quality that the editors will not accept on a daily basis.",
        "In addition, translators have noted that the time required to create a triple of METAL dictionary entries monolingual German term, monolingual English equivalent, and bilingual Transfer pair – varies from two to twenty minutes, depending on the part of speech and the amount of terminology research [needed for human translation in any case] required.",
        "On an ongoing average basis, a new term can be expected once per page of text.",
        "Until METAL is evaluated by unbiased third parties, taking into account the full costs of translation and revision using METAL versus conventional (human) techniques, the question of METAL's cost-effectiveness cannot be answered definitively.",
        "However, we have identified some performance parameters that are interesting.",
        "Our sponsor has calculated that METAL should prove cost-effective if it can be implemented on a system supporting four to six post-editors who can sustain an average total output of about 60 revised pages per day.",
        "At 275 words per page, and eight hours per day, this works out to 1.7 seconds per word, minimum real-time machine performance.",
        "Our mid-84 real-time performance figure of 2+ seconds per word on a Symbolics 3600 approaches this goal; it also compares very favorably with the human translation rate (experienced at Siemens, for decades) of four to eight pages per day for like material.",
        "If this level of performance can be slightly increased while maintaining a high enough standard of quality so an individual revisor can indeed edit 10 to 15 pages per day, on a daily basis, METAL will have achieved cost-effectiveness.",
        "Most important, we have also measured revision performance: the amount of time required to edit texts translated by METAL.",
        "In the first such experiment, conducted late in 1982, two 'Siemens post-editors revised METAL's translations at the rate of 15 to 17 pages per day (depending on the particular editor).",
        "In a second experiment, conducted in mid-83, the rates were only slightly higher (15-20 pages/day), but the revisors nevertheless reported a significant improvement in their subjective impression of the quality of the output.",
        "In a third experiment, conducted in early 1984, the editors reported further improvement in their subjective impression of the quality of the output, and their revision rates were much higher: almost 30 pages per day.",
        "In a fourth experiment, conducted in mid 1984, their average revision rate climbed to over 40 pages per day; this figure also compares favorably with the revision rate of human translations experienced at Siemens: eight to twelve pages per day for like material (not including original translation time: four to six pages per day).",
        "These MT revision figures are surely biased by virtue of the experimental setting itself (i.e., one-shot measures of post-editing performance on human translations would be significantly higher than the ongoing eight to twelve average quoted above), but nevertheless these numbers indicate that we have probably reached the goal of cost-effectiveness.",
