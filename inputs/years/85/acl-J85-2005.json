        "However, as will be seen, linguistic work is in a very early stage, and no very concrete results are as yet available.",
        "The paper is composed as follows.",
        "In the first two sections, we describe the project's purpose, some of the external factors influencing its organisation, its infrastructure and some of the design principles deriving from these general considerations.",
        "Section 3 discusses in more detail the model of translation on which the project is based and some of the linguistic and metalinguistic issues involved.",
        "In section 4 we turn to the issue of communication between the linguists developing the linguistic modules and the computer.",
        "It presents our choice of a software environment that allows rapid development and modification of problem-oriented notations for linguists.",
        "Section 5 describes the architecture of the current software prototype, which has been implemented following the principles outlined in section 4.",
        "Since EUROTRA, as already noted, is barely out of its preparatory phase, the final sections do little more than sketch some factors that will determine the project's future development."

        "The choice of a corpus is constrained by two factors: equivalent versions of the corpus must be available in all of the languages, and, although the subject area should be technical, it should be an area with which the people in the language groups are reasonably familiar in order to minimize dependence on outside help for technical terminology.",

        "An important consequence of decentralized development in EUROTRA is that a serious amount of attention must be given to the nature of Rt, because a research group writing generation for language L should have concrete ideas about the class of inputs to expect.",
        "Moreover, this class should make sense to people who only know about L. In EUROTRA, we relate Rs to Rt, where these are both representations of texts in L; one would expect there to be some similarity between the Rs of some text T and the Rt that represents the same text.",

        "(2) [T,R] e AN(L) iff [R,T] e GEN(L)",
        "Given (2), there is a lot of structure in the framework.",
        "If a given representation theory determines the Rs for some text, it also determines the Rt.",
        "This has two advantages:",
        "• First, since the class of Rs for language L is clearly understandable to linguists of L, the class of Rt is also understandable.",
        "• Second, given (2), it becomes possible to relate simplicity of transfer directly to the \"depth\" of the representations (for discussion, see section 4.2.2).",
        "However, (2) is too strong, and may be in conflict with the idea of simple transfer.",
        "For example, if surface constituent structure is taken as (the basis for) a theory of representation, then (2) implies that TRF relates source language surface word order to target language word order, which clearly involves a lot more than substitution of lexical elements.",
        "Therefore, we define an equivalence relation between representations.",
        "We will not say anything about the contents of this relation here, since its definition clearly depends on the contents of the representation theory discussed in section 4.",

        "[R',T] GEN(L) iff [T,R] AN(L) and R' isoduid to R In practical terms, this means that generation will relate each R' that is isoduid to R to the T that R belongs to.",

        "For our present purposes the linguistic interpretation of the nodes of the tree is irrelevant; it could be surface constituents, units of meaning, or whatever.",

        "Actually, if this view were guaranteed to be correct, then the generalized relation introduced here would be just a useless complication of the description of transfer: instead, we then would just say that transfer equals substitution of the lexical unit in a given representation.",

        "First, and most important, there are well known problem cases such as the translation of the Dutch adverb graag to the English verb like: (5) Tom zwemt graag translates as 'Tom likes to swim' Many examples like this are caused by lexical holes in the languages; in the example, English does not have the adverb corresponding to graag.",
        "If we stick to the basic view, examples like these force us to have a rather abstract, \"deep\" theory of the interface structure.",
        "Such a deep theory may cause difficulties to analysis and generation in many cases; it would be motivated on the grounds of exceptions.",
        "Second, we assume that whatever theory we choose at the end of the second phase of the project has to stabilise and undergo no further modification during the third phase.",
        "Thus, even if it were feasible to construct this deep theory, it would be hard, if not impossible, to guarantee that problems like the one described will never turn up during the third phase.",
        "Third, one importar t way in which EUROTRA is said to be extensible is the possibility of adding other languages.",
        "But it is really impossible to have a version of the representation theory, based on the current seven languages, guaranteed to be compatible with the basic view on simple transfer when languages like Spanish or Portuguese are added.",
        "For these reasons, we believe that the possibility of some \"complex transfer\" will have to be accepted, where \"complex\" means that the relation translates-as is not always trivial.",
        "However, the intention of the basic view remains valid.",
        "That is, the number of complex transfer relations must be minimized.",
        "A more precise formulation is the following.",

        "Apart from this extension, it is planned to increase the variety of text-types dealt with, although remaining within the general area of Community texts.",
        "There will also be some experimentation with subject areas other than the one initially chosen.",
        "Throughout the programme period, the flexibility and modularity of the system design will encourage experimentation with different linguistic techniques, as well as making it possible to expand and repair the system with ease, since the extremely modular approach taken makes it possible for any single module, for instance a primitive process treating noun groups or carrying out dictionary look-up, to be modified independently of other processes, even, in the limit, being replaced by a completely different process.",
        "When a process is modified, the goal attached to each process becomes important in that by specifying the results to be delivered by the process, unforeseen interactions with other processes in the system are prevented.",
        "During the third phase, planning of the future after the programme period will begin.",
        "The feasibility and desir",
        "ability of an economic development of the working prototype system will be investigated, and specifications drawn up if it is decided to go ahead.",
        "At the' same time, by Community conventions for research and development projects, both the prototype system and the kernel software will be distributed at cost to Government institutions, and to Universities and research institutes in the Member States.",
        "Indeed, the software can be distributed to these parties before the end of the programme period to be used as a research tool.",
        "This is one of the ways in which EUROTRA hopes to stimulate research outside the immediate environment of the project itself.",
        "It could, with some justice, be said that all of EUROTRA lies in the future: given the time and resources invested in defining a sound linguistic basis and a flexible, heavily problem oriented software, it is our hope that the future can be faced with confidence."
