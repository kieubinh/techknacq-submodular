        "In this paper, I argued for an integration of insights gained from linguistic, psychological, and AI-based research to provide c pragmatic theory and cognitive model of how temporal inferences can be explained within the framework of computational information processing.",
        "A pragmatic theory focuses on the information from the context (e.g., co-text, discourse situation, intentions of interlocutors) to explain linguistic behavior.",
        "I have shown how an integration of linguistic and extra linguistic knowledge achieves a form of comprehension, where comprehension is characterized as a conversion of information based on knowledge from on representation into another.",
        "I have also shown how this approach leads to a parsing technique which avoids common pitfalls, and, at the same time, is consistent with results in psycholinguistic research.",
        "I have furthermore shown that such a procedural approach is a basis for an event-based theory for temporal information processing.",
        "In particular, the findings implemented in GROK show the shortcomings of the orthodox rule-based approach to language processing which reduces words to tokens in a larger context while overemphasizing the role of the phrase and sentence level.",
        "It does this by providing a temporal knowledge representation and algorithms for processing pragmatic information which are applicable to a wider range of phenomena than most of the notable computational NL theories within the field of Al (Schank 81, Rieger 79, Wilks 751, or Linguistics [Marcus 801.",
        "In particular, my research shows that:",
        "• ML can be processed realistically by a deterministic algorithm",

        "A realistic NLPS tries to emulate human behavior.",

        "A mental model provides an internal representation of the state of affairs that are described in a given sentence [Johnson-Laird 811.",
        "• Temporal information processing is adequately explained only",
        "in a pragmatic theory that captures the duality of interval and point-based representation of time.",
        "In my theory, temporal processing is possible because of domain-specific key events which provide the \"hooks\" for the temporal structure of a text.",
