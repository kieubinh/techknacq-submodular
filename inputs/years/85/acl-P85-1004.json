        "Modality is additive information represented by auxiliary words such as modal particles, ending particles, and auxiliary verbs and sentence adverbs.",
        "The modal particle is attached to a noun phrase or a sentence element while the ending particle is attached to the eoci position of a sentence.",
        "The auxiliary verb immediately follows a verb phrase.",
        "Modality represented in such grammatically different context is incorporated into the ease structure, and the result construction is named as an extended case structurem which enable us to propose a uniform framework for analyzing both proposition and modality.",

        "We have already proposed a method named extended case analysis for Japanese sentences.m Input to the extended case analysis is an ordered list of word frames produced by a morphological analysis.",
        "The analysis begins to predict a constituent construction of the sentence to be analyzed by utilizing syntactic structure patterns, and then enter into the detail analysis of semantic relations between pairs of the modifier and the modificant by utilizing semantic relation frames.",
        "There are four types of the semantic relations, namely, case relation, noun concept relation, embeding relation and conjunctive relation.",
        "All of these semantic relations are analyzed in a uniform framework.",
        "The both analyses go on iteratively and/or recursively from a small chunk of constituents to large one.",
        "Each iteration and recursion executes both the prediction of the syntactic structure and the analysis of semantic structure.",
        "The modality analysis is incorporated into those processes.",
        "Let us show the modality analysis process for the following example sentence : (s22)Niku wa nokot teite, yasai dake ga Hiroko ni tabe rare teita.",
        "Meat had remained, and",
        "At first, it is analysed that this sentence is a complex sentence by utilizing syntactic structure patterns.",
        "After semantic structures of the modifier and the main clause are analysed, conjunctive relation between these clauses is analyzed.",
        "Now, we show analysis of the main sentence.",
        "The following case elements and a predicate are analysed by applying structure patterns before starting case analysis : casel = \"yasai\" , \"ga\" , \"dake\", case2 = \"Hiroko\" , \"ni\", predicate = \"taberu\" , \"rareru\" , \"teiru\", \"ta\", where \"dake\", \"rareru\", \"teiru\", and \"ta\" are modality expressions.",
        "\"Hiroko\" and \"yasai\" have semantic categories, [human) and [food] respectively in each word frame.",
        "(2) Modification of case frame Case frame is prepared for each meaning of each predicate.",
        "An intrinsic case frame for the verb \"taberu (eat)\" is as follows (Optional cases such as time and place are omitted here) [the intrinsic case frame of the verb \"taberu (eat)\"]: Agent = [human] , \"ga'', Object = [food], \"wo\".",
        "Each case slot in the case frame is assigned semantic categories and case particles as constraints to be satisfied by the filler.",
        "The following alternative case frames produced by modifying the intrinsic frame are also prepared before starting case analysis because of the existence of the auxiliary verb \"rareru\" : [\"passive\" modification of the case frame] : Agent = [human] , \"ni\", Object = [food] , \"ga\", [\"affected-passive\" modification of the case frame] Affected-agent = [human] , \"ga\", Agent = [human] , \"ni\", Object = [food] , \"wo\".",
        "These three case frames are examined whether each case element in the sentence satisfies constraints.",
        "As a result, in this case, \"passive\" modification case frame is selected as a best matching, and case role of each case element is determined as follows casel= Object, case2 =Agent.",
        "This result is showing that the meaning of \"rareru\" is \"passive\".",
        "(3) Determination of meaning of modality Modality by modal particles in case elements and auxiliary verbs are analyzed.",
        "Analysis of \"teiru\" is Is there a case element (noun phrase or adverb) suggesting \"terminative-state\" or \"durative\" or \"iterative\" aspect?",
        "Is conjunction of the subordinate clause conjunctive particle \"te\" \"to\" \"ba\" or \"renyou-chuushi\"7 and Does the subordinate clause have time information such as time cases?",
        "yes no operation Ioperate time information in the main clause over the subordinate clause",
        "performed by the heuristics shown in Fig. 3, where the meaning is determined as \"terminative-state\" judging from the fact that \"teiru\" follows \"rareru\".",
        "The meaning of the modal particle \"dake\" is multiple, that is, \"limitation\" and \"degree\".",
        "In this case, \"limitation\" is selected by heuristics.",
        "(4) Determination of scope of modality in the main clause After conjunctive analysis between the modifier and the main clause, scope of the auxiliary verb \"ta\" in the main clause is analyzed.",
        "Using heuristics shown in Fig. 4, it is analyzed that \"ta\" also 'operates on the subordinate clause.",
        "In a result, the meaning structure of (s22) is obtained as follows : 3x((Meat(x)A(past][terrninative-state IRemai n( x)) A3x((Vegetable(x) A[past][terminative-statelEat( Hi ro ko,x ) ) Avx((--Vegetable(x) D -1pastl[ terminative-state]E at( Hiro ko,x )) A{Focus(x)}).",
