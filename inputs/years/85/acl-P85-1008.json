        "The key move is to expand what kinds of entities one allows in one's ontology, rather than complicating the logical notation, the logical form of sentences, or the semantic translation process.",
        "Three classical problems - opaque adverbials, the distinction between de re and de dicto belief reports, and the problem of identity in intensional contexts - are examined for the difficulties they pose for this logical notation, and it is shown that the difficulties can be overcome.",

      "text": [
        "The real problem in natural language processing is the interpretation of discourse.",
        "Therefore, the other aspects of the total process should be in the service of discourse interpretation.",
        "This includes the semantic translation of sentences into a logical form, and indeed the logical notation itself.",
        "Discourse interpretation processes, as I see them, are inferential processes that manipulate or perform deductions on logical expressions encoding the information in the text and on other logical expressions encoding the speaker's and hearer's background knowledge.",
        "These considerations lead to two principal criteria for • logical notation.",
        "Criterion I: The notation should be as close to English as possible.",
        "This makes it easier to specify the rules for translation between English and the formal language, and also makes it easier to encode in logical notation facts we normally think of in English.",
        "The ideal choice by this criterion is English itself, but it fails monumentally on the second criterion.",
        "Criterion II: The notation should be syntactically simple.",
        "Since discourse processes are to be defined primarily in terms of manipulations performed on expressions in the logical notation, the simpler that notation, the easier it will be to define the discourse operations.",
        "The development of such a logical notation is usually taken to be a very hard problem.",
        "I believe this is because researchers have imposed upon themselves several additional constraints - to adhere to stringent ontological scruples, to explain a number of mysterious syntactic facts as a by-product of the notation, and to encode efficient deduction techniques in the notation.",
        "Most representational difficulties go away if one rejects these constraints, and there are good reasons for rejecting each of the constraints.",
        "Ontological scruples: Researchers in philosophy and linguistics have typically restricted themselves to very few (although a strange assortment of) kinds of entities - physical objects, numbers, sets, times, possible worlds, propositions, events, and situations - and all of these but the first have been controversial.",
        "Quine has been the greatest exponent of ontological chastity.",
        "His argument is that in any scientific theory, we adopt, at least insofar as we are reasonable, the simplest conceptual scheme into which the disordered fragments of our experience can be fitted and arranged.\"",
        "(Quine, 1953, p.",
        "16.)",
        "But he goes on to say that 'simplicity ... is not a clear and unambiguous idea; and it is quite capable of presenting a double or multiple standard.\"",
        "(Ibid., p.",
        "17.)",
        "Minimizing kinds of entities is not the only way to achieve simplicity in a theory.",
        "The aim in this enterprise is to achieve simplicity by minimizing the complexity of the rules in the system.",
        "It turns out this can be achieved by multiplying kinds of entities, bY allowing as an entity everything that can be referred to by a noun phrase.",
        "Syntactic explanation: The argument here is easy.",
        "It would be pleasant if an explanation of, say, the syntactic behavior of count nouns and mass nouns fell out of our underlying ontological stricture at no extra cost, but if the extra cost is great complication in statements of discourse operations, it would be quite unpleasant.",
        "In constructing a theory of discourse interpretation, it doesn't make sense for us to tie our hands by requiring syntactic explanations as well.",
        "The problem of discourse is at least an order of magnitude harder than the problem of syntax, and syntax shouldn't be in the driver's seat.",
        "Efficient deduction: There is a long tradition in artificial intelligence of building control information into the notation.",
        "and indeed much work in knowledge representation is driven by this consideration.",
        "Semantic networks and other notational systems built around hierarchies (Quillian, 1968; Simmons, 1973; Hendrix, 1975) implicitly assign a low cost to certain types of syllogistic reasoning.",
        "The KL-ONE representation language (Schmolze and Brachman, 1982) has a variety of notational devices, each with an associated efficient deduction procedure.",
        "Hayes (1979) has argued that frame representations (Minsky, 1975; Bobrow and Winograd, 1977) should be viewed as sets of predicate calculus axioms together with a control component for drawing certain kinds of inferences quickly.",
        "In quite a different vein, Moore (1980) uses a possible worlds notation to model knowledge and action in part to avoid inefficiencies in theorem",
        "proving.",
        "By contrast, I would argue against building efficiencies into the notation.",
        "From a psychological point of view, this allows us to abstract away from the details of implementation on a particular computational device, increasing the generality of the theory.",
        "From a technological point of view, it reflects a belief that we must first determine empirically the most common classes of inferences required for discourse processing and only then seek algorithms for optimizing them.",
        "In this paper I propose a flat logical notation with an ontologically promiscuous semantics.",
        "One's first naive guess as to how to represent a simple sentence like A boy builds a boat.",
        "is as follows:",
        "This simple approach seems to break down when we encounter the more difficult phenomena of natural language, like tense, intensional contexts, and adverbials, as in the sentence A boy wanted to build a boat quickly.",
        "These phenomena have led students of language to introduce significant complications in their logical notations for representing sentences.",
        "My approach will be to maintain the syntactic simplicity of the logical notation and expand the theory of the world implicit in the semantics to accommodate this simplicity.",
        "The representation of the above sentence, as is justified below, is",
        "That is, el occurred in the past, where el is X'S wanting es, which is the quickness of es, which is z's building of y, where x is a boy and y is a boat.",
        "In brief, the logical form of natural language sentences will be a conjunction of atomic predications in which all variables are existentially quantified with the widest possible scope.",
        "Predicates will be identical or nearly identical to natural language morphemes.",
        "There will be no functions, functional., nested quantifiers, disjunction., negations, or modal or intensional operators."
