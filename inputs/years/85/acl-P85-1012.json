        "Tree Adjoining Grammars, or \"TAG's\", (Joshi, Levy & Takahashi 1975; Joshi 1983; ICroch & Joshi 1985) were developed as an alternative to the standard syntactic formations that are used in theoretical analyses of language.",
        "They are attractive because they may provide just the aspects of context sensitive expressive power that actually appear in human languages while otherwise remaining context free.",
        "This paper describes how we have applied the theory of Tree Adjoining Grammars to natural language generation.",
        "We have been attracted to TAG's because their central operation – the extension of an Initial\" phrase structure tree through the inclusion, at very specifically constrained locations, of one or more \"auxiliary\" trees – corresponds directly to certain central operations of our own, performance-oriented theory.",
        "We begin by briefly describing TAG's as a formalism for phrase structure in a competence theory, and summarize the points in the theory of TAG's that are germaine to our own theory.",
        "We then consider generally the position of a grammar within the generation process, introducing our use of TAG's through a contrast with how others have used systemic grammars.",
        "This takes us to the core results of our paper: using examples from our research with well-written texts from newspapers, we walk through our TAG inspired treatments cZ raising and wh-movement, and show the correspondesias of the TAG \"adjunction\" operation and our \"attachment\" process.",
        "In the final section we discuss extensions to the theory, motivated by the way we use the operation corresponding to TAG's\" adjunction in performance.",
        "This suggests that the competence theory of TAG's can be profitably projected to structures at the morphological level as well as the present syntactic level."

        "The theoretical apparatus of a TAG consists of a primitively defined set of \"elementary\" phrase structure trees, a linking\" relation that can be used to define dependency relations between two nodes within an elementary tree, and an \"adjunction\" operation that combines trees under specifiable constraints.",
        "The elementary trees are divided into two sets: initial and auxiliary.",
        "Initial trees have only terminals at their leaves.",
        "Auxiliary trees are distinguished by having one non-terminal among their leaves; the category of this node must be the same as the category of the root.",
        "Ali elemental trees are \"minimal\" in the sense that they do not recurs: on any non-terminal.",
        "A node NI in an elementary tree may be linked (co-indexed) to a second node N2 in the same tree provided Ni c-commands N2.",
        "Linking is used to indicate grammatically defined dependencies between nodes such as subcategorization relationships or filler-gap dependencies.",

        "cations start with an initial tree, and continue via the adjunction of an arbitrary number of auxiliary trees.",
        "To adjoin an auxiliary tree A with root category X to a initial (or derived) tree T, we fiat select some node of category X within T to be the point at which the adjunction is to occur.",
        "Then (1) the subtree of T dominated by that instance of X (call it X') is removed from T, (2) the auxiliary tree A is knit into T at the position where X' had been located, and (3) the subtree dominated by X' is knit into A to replace the second occurenas of the category X at T's frontier.",
        "The two trees have now been merged by \"splicing\" A into T, displacing the sulxree of T at the point of the adjunction to the frontier of A.",

        "A TAG specifies surface structure.",
        "There is no notion of derivation from deep structure in the theory of TAG 's – the primitive tress are not transformed or otherwise changed once they are introduced into a text, only combined with other primitive trees.",
        "As 1Croch and loshi point out, this means that a TAG is incomplete as an account of the structure of a natural language, e.g. a TAG grammar will contain both an active and a passive form of the same verbal subcategorization pattern, without an thr)ry-mediated description of the very close relationship between them.",
        "To our minds this is by no means a deficit.",
        "The procedural machinery that generative grammars have traditionally carried with them to characterize relations like that of active to passive has only gotten in the way of employing those characterizations in processing models of generation.",
        "This is because a generation model, like any theory of performance, has a procedural structure of its own and cannot coexist with an incompatible one, at least not while still operating efficiently or while retaining a simple mapping from its actual machine to the virtual machine that its authors put forward as their account of psycholinguistic data.",
        "Our own generator uses surface structure as its only explicitly represented linguistic level.",
        "Thus grammatical formalisms that dwell on the rules governing surface form are more useful to us than those that hide those rules in a deep to surface transformational process.",
        "A TAG Involves the manipulation of very small elementary structures.",
        "This is because of the stipulation that elementary trees may not include recursive nodes.",
        "It implies that the sentences one sees in everyday usage, e.g. newpaper texts, are the result of many sucessive ad junctions.",
        "This melds nicely with a move that we have made in recent years to view the conceptual representation from which generation proceeds as consisting of a heap of very small, redundantly related information units that have been deliberately selected by a text planning process from the total state of the knowledge base at the time of utterance; each such unit will correspond in the final text to a head lexical item plus selected thematic arguments – a linguistic entity that is easily projected onto the elementary trees of a TAG.",
        "TAG theory includes only one operation, atikmedon, and otherwise makes no changes to the elementary trees that go Into • test.",
        "This comports well with the indelibility stipulation in our model of generation, since selected text fragments can be used directly as specified by the grammar without the need for any later transformation.",
        "The composition options delimited by the constraints on adjunction given with a TAG define a space of alternative text forms which can correspond directly in generation to alternative conceptual relations among information units, alternatives in rhetorical intent, and alternatives in prose style."

        "This means that architecturally our generator has always been designed to produce text from conceptual specifications, \"pians\", developed by another program and consequently has had to be sensitive to the limitations and varying approaches of the present state of the art in conceptual representation.",

        "To achieve this, we have restricted ourselves to a highly constrained set of representations and operations, and have adopted strong and suggestive stipulations on our design such as high locality, information encapsulation, online quasi-realtime runtime performance, and indelibility.3 This restricts us as programmers, but disciplines us as theorists.",
        "We see the process of generation as involving three temporally intermingled activities: (1) determining what goals the utterance is to achieve, (2) planning what information content and rhetorical force will best meet those goals given the context, and (3) realizing the specified information and rhetorical intent as a grammatical text.",

        "The principle device of a systemic grammar, the \"choice system\", supports this question by highlighting how the constructions of the language are grouped into sets of alternatives Choice systems pnrowle an anchoring point for the rules of a theory of language use since it is natural to associate the various semantic, discourse, or rhetorical criteria that bear on the selection of a given construction or feature with the choice system to which the construction belongs, thus providing the basis of a decision-procedure for selecting from its listed alternatives; the NIGEL system does precisely this in its \"chooser\" procedures.",
