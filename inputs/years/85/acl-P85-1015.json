        "In this paper I discuss the problem of describing and computationally processing the discontinuous constituents of non-configurational languages.",
        "In these languages the grammatical function that an argument plays in the clause or the sentence is not determined by its position or configuration in the sentence, as it is in configurational languages like English, but rather by some kind of morphological marking on the argument or on the verb.",
        "Word order in non-configurational languages is often extremely free: it has been claimed that if some string of words S is grammatical in one of these languages, then the string S' formed by any arbitrary permutation of the words in S is also grammatical.",
        "Most attempts to describe this word order freedom take mechanisms designed to handle fairly rigid word order systems and modify them in order to account for the greater word order freedom of non-configurational languages.",
        "Although it is doubtful whether any natural language ever exhibits such total scrambling, it is interesting to investigate the computational and linguistic implications of systems that allow a high degree of word order freedom.",
        "So the approach here is the opposite to the usual one: I start with a system which, unconstrained, allows for unrestricted permutation of the words of a sentence, and capture any word order regularities the language may have by adding restrictions to the system.",
        "The extremely free word order of non.",
        "configurational languages is described by allowing constituents to have discontinuous locations.",
        "To demonstrate that it is possible to parse with such discontinuous constituents.",
        "I show how they can be incorporated into a variant of definite clause grammars, and that these grammars can be used in conjunction with a proof procedure, such as Earley deduction, to coestruct a parser, as shown in Pereira and Warren (1983).",
        "This paper is organized as follows: section 2 contains an informal introduction to Definite Clause Grammars and discusses how they can be used in parsing, section 3 gives a brief description of some of the grammatical features of one non-conligurational language.",
        "Guugu Yimidltirr, section 4 presents a definite clause fragment for this language, and shows how this can be used for parsing.",
        "Section 5 notes that the use or discontinuous constituents is not limited to definite clause grammars, but they could be incorporated into such disparate formalisms as GPSG, I,FG or Gil.",
        "Section 6 discusses whether a unified account of parsing both configurational and non-configurational languages can be given, and section 7 compares the notion of discontinuous constituents with other approaches to free word order."

        "In fact, the DCG representation is even more general than is brought out here: as Pereira and Warren (1983) demonstrated, one can view parsing algorithms highly specialized proof procedures, and the process of parsing as logical inferencing on the representation of the utterance, with the grammar functioning as the axioms of the logical system.",
        "Given a context free grammar, as in (1), the parsing problem is to determine whether a particular utterance, such as the one in (2), is an S with respect to it.",
        "(2) the boy's 2 father 3 hit 4 the 5 dog 5 The subscripts in (2) serve to locate the lexical items: they indicate that, for instance, the utterance of the word dog began at time t and ended at time t4.",

        "I interpret the subscripts as the points in time that segment the utterance into individual words or morphemes.",
        "Note that they perform the same function as the vertices of a standard chart parsing system.",
        "Parsing (2) is the same as searching for an S node that dominates the entire string, ie.",
        "whose location is 10,61.",
        "By looking at the rules in (1), we see that an S node is composed of an NP and a VP node.",
        "The interpretation conventions associated with phrase structure rules like those in (1) tell us this, and also tell us that the location of the S is the concatenation of the location of the NP and the VP.",

        "Genitive nouns and noun phrases have the value Gen for their third argument, while non-genitive NP have the value 0, and the rule that expands NP explicitly passes the case of the mother to the head daughter'.",
        "We can use (3) and (4) to make inferences about the existence of constituents in utterance (2).",
        "For example, using the rule that expands NP in (3) together with the first two facts of (4), we can infer the existence of constituent NP(0,2,Gen).",
        "The simplest approach to parsing is probably to use (1) in a top-down fashion, and start by searching for an S with location 10,61; that is, search for goal S(0,6).",
        "This method, top down recursive descent, is the method the programming language Prolog uses to perform deduction on definite clauses systems, so Prolog can easily be used to make very efficient top-down parsers.",
        "Unfortunately, despite their intuitive simplicity, top down recursive descent parsers have certain properties that make them less than optimal for handling natural language phenomena.",
        "Unless the grammar the parser is using is very specially crafted, these parsers tend to go into infinite loops.",
        "For example, the rule that expands NP into Det and N in (3) above would be used by a top-down parser to create a Det subgoal from an NP goal.",
        "But Det itself can be expanded as a genitive NP, so the parser would create another NP subgoal from the Det subgoal, and so on infinitely.",
        "The problem is that the parser is searching for the same NP many times over: what is needed is a strategy that reduces multiple searches for the same item to a single search, and arranges to share its results.",

        "is capable of doing this.",

        "Interestingly, in some Guugu Yimidhirr constructions it appears that information about grammatical relations can be obtain either through word order or morphology: in the possessive construction When a complex NP carries case inflection, each element (in this case, both possession and possessive expression) may bear case inflection - and both must be inflected for case if they are not contiguous - but frequently the 'head noun' (the possession) [directly Mil precedes the possessive expression, and only the latter has explicit case inflection (Haviland 1979,p.56) Thus in (8), Iliad 'father' shows up without an ergative suffix because it is immediately to the left of the NP that possesses it (ie.",

        "Still, it would be interesting to investigate further the restrictions on scrambling that follow from the non-configurational encoding analysis and the basic principles of LFG.",
        "For instance, the a//line parsability property (Pereira and Warren 1983) that is required to assure decidablity in LFG (Bresnan and Kaplan 1982) essentially prohibits scrambling of single lexical elements from doubly embedded clauses, because such scrambling would entail one S node exhaustively dominating another.",
        "But these distinctions are quite subtle, and, unfortunately, our knowledge of non-configurational languages is insufficient to determine whether the scrambling they exhibit is within .the limits allowed by non-configurational encoding.",
        "8.",
        "Conclusion Hale (1983) begins his paper by listing three properties that have come to be associated with the typological label 'nonconfigurational', namely (i) free word order, (ii) the use of syntactically discontinuous constituents and (iii) the extensive use of null anaphora.",
        "In this paper I have shown that the first two properties follow from a system that allows constituents that have discontinuous constituents and that captures the mother daughter location relationships using a predicate like 'combines'.",
        "It is still far too early to tell whether this approach really is the most appropriate way to deal with discontinuous conatituenta: it may be that for a grammar of reasonable size some other technique, such as the non-configurational encoding of LFG, will be superior on linguistic and computational grounds."
