        "We have studied one class of elliptical utterances, intersentential fragments, in the context of an information-seeking dialogue.",
        "As noted by Allen(1980), such utterances differ from other forms of ellipsis in that interpretation often depends more heavily upon the speaker's inferred underlying task-related plan than upon preceding syntactic forms.",
        "For example, the following elliptical fragment can only be interpreted within the context of the speaker's goal as communicated in the first utterance: [Eli] \"I want to cash this check.",
        "all bills only.\" Furthermore, intersentential fragments are often employed to communicate discourse goals, such as expressing doubt, which a syntactically complete form of the same utterance may not convey as effectively.",
        "In the following alternative responses to the initial statement by SPEAKER-1, Fl expresses doubt regarding the proposition stated by SPEAKER-1 whereas F2 merely asks about the jet's contents.",
        "Previous research on ellipsis has neglected to address the speaker's discourse goals in employing the fragment but real understanding requires that these be identified (Mann, Moore, and Levin, 1977) (Webber, Pollack, and Hirschberg, 1982).",
        "In this paper, we investigate a framework for interpreting intersentential ellipsis that occurs in task-oriented dialogues.",
        "This framework includes: [1] a context mechanism (Carberry, 1983) that builds the information-seeker's underlying plan as the dialogue progresses and differentiates between local and global contexts.",
        "[2] a discourse component that controls the interpretation of ellipsis based upon discourse goal expectations gleaned from the dialogue; this component 'understands\" ellipsis by identifying the' discourse goal which the speaker is pursuing by employing the elliptical fragment, and by determining how the fragment should be interpreted relative to that goal.",
        "[3] an analysis component that suggests possible associations of an elliptical fragment with aspects of the inferred plan for the information-seeker.",
        "[4] an evaluation component which, given multiple possible associations of an elliptical fragment with aspects of the information-seeker's underlying plan, selects that association most appropriate to the discourse context and believed to be intended by the speaker."

        "Allen notes that the speaker's fragment must identify the aubgoals which the speaker is pursuing, but claims that in very restricted domains, identifying the speaker's overall goal from the utterance Is sufficient to identify the appropriate response in terms of the obstacles present in such a plan.",
