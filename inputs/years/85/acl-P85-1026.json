        "The goal of this work is the enrichment of human-machine interactions in a natural language environment.' We want to provide a framework less restrictive than earlier ones by allowing a speaker leeway in forming an utterance about a task and in determining the conversational vehicle to deliver it.",
        "A speaker and listener cannot be assured to have the same beliefs, contexts, backgrounds or goals at each point in a conversation.",
        "As a result, difficulties and mistakes arise when a listener interprets a speaker's utterance.",
        "These mistakes can lead to various kinds of misunderstandings between speaker and listener.",
        "including reference failures or failure to understand the speaker's intention.",
        "We call these misunderstandings miscommunication Such mistakes constitute a kind of \"ill-formed\" input that can slow down and possibly break down communication.",

        "the system is expected to allow users to be less than meticulously literal in conveying their intentions, and it is expected to make linguistic and pragmatic use of the previous discourse.\"",
        "Following in their footsteps, we want to build robust natural language processing systems that can detect and recover from miscommunication.",
        "The development of such systems requires a study on how people communicate and how tney recover from problems in communication.",

        "The study of miscommunication is a necessary task within such a context since any computer capable of communicating with humans in natural language must be tolerant of the imprecise, ill-devised or complex utterances that people often use Our current research [25, 28] views most dialogues as being cooperative and goal directed.",
        "i.e.. a speaker and listener work together to achieve a common goal.",
        "The interpretation of an utterance involves identifying the underlying plan or goal that the utterance reflects [5.",
        "1, 231.",
        "This plan, however, is rarely, if ever, obvious at the surface sentence level.",
        "A central issue in the interpretation of utterances is the transformation of sequences of imprecise, ill-devised or complex utterances into well-specified plans that might be carried out by dialogue participants.",
        "Within this context.",
        "miscommunication can occur.",
        "We are particularly concerned with cases of miscommunication from the hearer's viewpoint, such as when the hearer is inattentive to, confused about, or misled about the intentions of the speaker.",
        "In ordinary exchanges speakers usually make assumptions regarding what their listeners know about a topic of discussion.",
        "They will leave out details thought to be superfluous [2.",
        "19].",
        "Since the speaker really does not know exactly what a listener knows about a topic, it is easy to make statements that can be misinterpreted or not understood by the listener because not enough details were presented.",
        "One principal source of trouble is the description constructed by the speaker to refer to an actual object in the world.",
        "The description can be imprecise, confused, ambiguous or overly specific, it might be interpreted under the wrong context.",
        "This leads to difficulty for the listener when figuring out what object is being described, that is.",
        "reference identification errors.",
        "Such descriptions are \"illformed\" input.",
        "The blame for ill-formedness may lie partly with the speaker and partly with the listener The speaker may have been sloppy or not taken the hearer into consideration, the listener may be either remiss or unwilling to admit he can't understand the speaker and to ask the speaker for clarification, or may simply feel that he has understood when he in fact has not.",
        "This work is part of an ongoing effort to develop a reference identification and plan recognition mechanism that can exhibit more \"human-like tolerance of such utterances.",

        "In Section 2. we introduced a taxonomy of miscommunication problems that occur in expert-apprentice dialogues.",
        "We showed that reference mistakes are one kind of obstacle to robust communication.",
        "To tackle reference problems, we described how to extend the succeed/fail paradigm followed by previous natural language researchers.",
        "We represented real world objects hierarchically in a knowledge base using a representation language, KL-One, that follows in the tradition of semantic networks and frames.",
        "In such a representation framework, the reference identification task looks for a referent by comparing the representation of the speakers Input to elements in the knowledge base by using a matching procedure.",
        "Failure to find a referent in previous reference identification systems resulted in the unsuccessful termination of the reference task.",
        "We claim that people behave better than this and explicitly illustrated such cases in an expert-apprentice domain about toy water pumps.",
        "We developed a theory of relaxation for recovering from reference failures that provides a much better model for human performance.",
        "When people are asked to identify objects, they go about it in a certain way, find candidates, adjust as necessary, re-try, and, if necessary, give up and ask for help.",
        "We claim that relaxation is an integral part of this process and that the particular parameters of relaxation differ from task to task and person to person.",
        "Our work models the relaxation process and provides a computational model for experimenting with the different parameters.",
        "The theory incorporates the same language and physical knowledge that people use in performing reference Identification to guide the relaxation process.",
        "This knowledge is represented as a set of rules and as data in a hierarchical knowledge base.",
        "Rule-based relaxation provided a methodical way to use knowledge about language and the world to find a referent.",
        "The hierarchical representation made it possible to tackle issues of imprecision and over-specification in a speaker's description.",
        "It allows one to check the position of a description in the hierarchy and to use that position to judge imprecision and over-specification and to suggest possible repairs to the description.",

        "one would expect that \"closest\" match would suffice to solve the problem of finding a referent.",
        "We showed, however, that it doesn't usually provide you with the correct referent.",
        "Closest match isn't sufficient because there are many features associated with an object and, thus, determining which of those features to keep and which to drop is a difficult problem due to the combinatorics and the effects of context.",
