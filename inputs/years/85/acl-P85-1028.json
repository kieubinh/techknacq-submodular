        "The Output of an XSEL session is a purchase order consisting of a list of line-items that specify hardware and software components.",
        "There are two main phases to XSEL's processing, a fact gathering phase and a component selection phase.",
        "During the fact gathering phase XSEL carries on an interactive dialog with the salesperson to elicit values for facts that determine the customer's functional computing requirements.",
        "These might include requirements for total disk space, percent of removable disk storage, number of terminals, lines-per-minute of printing.",
        "etc.",
        "Natural language processing during the fact gathering dialog is minimal: XSEL displays menues and pre-formulated queries and accepts one or two-word answers from the user.",
        "Once enough facts have been collected XSEL begins a silent phase of processing.",
        "During this phase a set of candidate components that satisfy the customer's basic requirements is retrieved from the DEC parts database.",
        "Within each class of component, i.e., processor, disk, terminal.",
        "etc., candidates are ranked according to their score on an evaluation function that measures the degree to which a candidate satisfies the customer's weighted functional requirements.",
        "The candidate with the highest score is selected and placed on the purchase order.",
        "The most important knowledge structure used by XSEL during the fact gathering phase is a fact.",

      "text": [
        "The processing of a query by a link-dependent message generator goes as follows.",
        "When the initial query is input, a query-interpretation context is entered.",
        "In this context some rules fire to identify and locate the fact in question, to create a query-term with the same token as the fact, and to place that query-term in the query-queue.",
        "Following query-interpretation, a message generation cycle consisting roughly of the following five steps reiterates: 1) focus on the next query-term in the queue, 2) locate the links related to that query-term, 3) select an explanation schema3 based on the links found, 4) create",
        "additional query-terms and messages suggested by the selected schema.",
        "and 5) turn control over to the surface generator.",
        "Each time a new query-term is created, queue-control rules decide whether to place it in the query-queue, depending on such factors as whether the term has already been explained and how many levels of explanation the user has requested.",
        "As long as the query-queue is not empty, the message generation cycle is reiterated.",
        "When the message generator is in generic mode, it is constrained to locating generic links during step 2 of the cycle, and it is constrained to selecting the generic schema during step 3 of the cycle.",
        "A simplified version of the generic schema is depicted in Figure 3-4.",
        "The first directive of the generic schema (Schema-directives::Genenc-schema (make goal 'goal-name create-extra-query-terms 'status reiterate) (make goal rgoal-name create-message rpredicate IS-DEPENDENT rterm1 <current-focus)) (make goal rgoal-name create-message 'predicate ON rterm1 <link-focus) \"status reiterate) Figure 3-4: The Generic Schema directs the message generator to create additional query-terms for all the facts that are linked to the current query-term.",
        "The second directive directs the message generator to create one message with the predicate \"IS-DEPENDENT\" and with the focus-token of term 1, which is the current query-term.",
        "The surface realization of this message will be the clause \"THE VALUE OF 3600 MEGABYTES FOR TOTAL-DISK-SPACE IS DEPENDENT\".",
        "The third directive of the generic schema directs the message generator to create one additional message with the predicate \"ON\" and the focus-token of term1 for each of the link terms found.",
        "These messages will emerge as prepositional phrases in their surface form, such as \" ON 1424 KILOBYTES FOR TOTAL-APPLICATION-DISK-SPACE , 110592 KILOBYTES",
        "FOR PROGRAMMER-DISK-SPACE , 2816000 KILOBYTES FOR TOTAL-DATA-FILE-DISK-SPACE, 600 KILOBYTES FOR PAGE-AND-SWAP-SPACE AND 25600 KILOBYTES FOR SYSTEM-DISK-SPACE,\" When the message generator is in relational mode, it is constrained to locating relational links and using relational schemes.",
        "There are a variety of each.",
        "Currently, relational links are categorized as being either reasons, elaborations, or arithmetic links.",
        "During step 2 of the message-generation cycle, the message generator searches first for reason links, next for elaboration links, and finally for arithmetic links.",
        "In some cases.",
        "the search for arithmetic links may be suppressed.",
        "For example, some links whose relation is allocation are subcategorized as being arithmetic operations, as in \"75 percent of the total-disk-space requirement was allocated to removable-pack disks\".",
        "In these cases, expressing the arithmetic relation also would be redundant.",
        "When a relational link is located, a corresponding schema is selected.",
        "In contrast to the single generic schema, there are a variety of arithmetic and abstract relational tchemas.",
        "Figure 3-5 illustrates the arithmetic \"plus\" schema that was used to generate the messages for the first paragraph of the \"why quantity total-disk-space\" relational explanation shown in Figure 1-4.",
        "It contains five directives, one to create the new query-terms found in the arithmetic reasoning trace and four to create messages.",
        "The second message creation directive will create as many messages as are needed to account for at least 80 percent of the total value of the fact being explained.",
        "(The 80 percent factor was implemented in order to filter out insignificant facts, thus making the explanation more concise.",
        "Another process that contributes to more readable explanations is the conversion of all units in different clauses of the explanation to the same highest common denominator, eg.",
        "megabytes.)",
        "Following that, two additional messages will be created, one to mention that the remainder of the total is accounted for by other terms, and another to give an example.",

        "to create the messages for the first sentence of the \"why quantity RA60** explanation shown in Figure 1-5.",
        "It contains one directive to create an extra query-term matching the token of the new term identified in the \"satisfaction\" link, and three actions making the three messages which surface as three clauses of text in the explanation."

        "The knowledge structures just described, including messages.",

        "Perhaps some domain-independent set of reasoning relations and schemes might be found.",
        "Furthermore, such relations and schemes might facilitate the design of a knowledge acquisition system that would elicit knowledge from an expert represent it as relations, and generate inference rules from relations.",
