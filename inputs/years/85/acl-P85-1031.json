        "The ideal natural language interface would let any user, without any prior training, interact with a computer.",

        "As technicians are not familiar with formal knowledge representation schemes, a trained intermediary, a knowledge engineer, is generally employed to handcraft the internal format.",
        "This process is time-consuming and expensive.",
        "INKA (INglish Knowledge Acquisition) permits task experts to express their knowledge in a subset of English, and have it automatically translated into the appropriate representational formalism.",
        "In particular, the version of INICA to be discussed here accepts input in a sublanguage called GLIB which permits the statement of facts and rules relevant to the troubleshooting of electronic systems (Freiling et al., 1984), and translates these statements into Prolog unit clauses for later processing by a specialized inference mechanism.",
        "Experiments with 1NKA to date have enabled us to construct sufficient troubleshooting rules to build a localizing troubleshooter for a simple circuit.",
        "INKA is designed as one of the tools of DETEKTR, an environment for building knowledge based electronic instrument troubleshooters (Freiling & Alexander, 1984).",
        "DETEKTR supports an expert system development methodology which is outlined below.",
        "The design goal of INKA is that it serve as a natural language input system to facilitate transfer of knowledge during the knowledge acquisition phase of expert system development.",

        "McKeown (1984) has pointed out a number of important aspects of the pragmatics that relate to the usage phase of an expert system.",
        "Similar pragmatics are required to insure adequate construction of the system's knowledge base during the knowledge acquisition phase of an expert system's development.",
        "The most important pragmatic facility is one to estimate the degree of epistemic coverage of the knowledge acquired so far, and to prompt the task expert for more knowledge in areas where the coverage is weak.",
        "It is unfeasible to assume that any task expert can simply perform a \"memory dump\" of expertise into some natural language interface and be done with it.",
        "This paper discusses the natural language technology used in building 1NKA.",
        "The system incorporates a diverse collection of natural language technologies in its construction.",
        "Specifically, DMA utilizes a semantic grammar (Burton, 1976) to characterize the domain sublanguage, le.xical-functional semantics (Kaplan & Bresnan, 1982) to translate to the internal form of representation, and an interface that includes left-corner parsing with in-line guidance to address the linguistic coverage problem that arises with sublanguages.",
        "We feel this eclectic approach is a useful for building application-oriented natural language interfaces.",
        "Although we are describing a knowledge acquisition application, the methodology can be used for any application whose sublanguage can be stated in the prescribed grammar formalism.",

        "The major bottlenecks in building knowledge based systems have proven to be related to the definition and acquisition of knowledge to be processed.",
        "The first bottleneck occurs in the knowledge definition phase of system development, where symbolic structures are defined that represent the knowledge necessary to accomplish a particular task.",
        "A bottleneck arises because of the shortage of knowledge engineers, who are skilled in defining these structures and using them to express relevant knowledge.",
        "The second bottleneck occurs in the knowledge acquisition phase, which involves the codification of the knowledge necessary for a system to function correctly.",
        "A bottleneck arises here because in current practice, the presence of the knowledge engineer is required throughout this time-consuming process.",
        "In the course of defining a viable methodology for the construction of expert systems (Freiling & Alexander 1984; Alexander et al.",
        "1985), we have identified certain classes of problems where the task of defining the knowledge structures and the task of actually building them can be effectively separated, with only the former being performed by a trained knowledge engineer.",
        "The problem of building a large collection of knowledge-based troubleshooters for electronic instruments is an example.",
        "In order to support the construction of a large class of such systems, it makes sense to perform the knowledge definition step for the overall domain initially, and to build domain-specific development tools, which include problem-oriented subsets of English and special purpose graphical displays, that can be reused in the development of each individual knowledge-based system.",
        "Even in the context of such an approach, we have found that there is usually a shortage of capable knowledge engineers to carry out the knowledge definition phase, and that a well-defined methodology can be of great value here in aiding non-linguistically oriented computer scientists to carry out this verbal elicitation task.",
        "The major issue is how to get started defining the forms into which knowledge is to be cast.",
        "We have found it an effective technique to begin this process by recording statements made by task experts on tape, and transcribing these to fairly natural English.",
        "When enough recording has been done, the statements begin to take on recognizable patterns.",
        "It is then possible to build a formal grammar for much of the relevant utterances, using linguistic engineering techniques such as semantic grammars The symbols of this grammar and the task specific vocabulary provide convenient points for defining formal sub-structures, which are pieced together to define a complete symbolic representation.",
        "Once the grammar is reasonably well-defined, the mapping to symbolic representation can be carried out with mapping techniques such as the f-structure constraints of lexical-functional grammar.",
        "Up to this point, we can imagine that the entire task has been carried out on paper, or some machine-readable equivalent.",
        "Even in such a rudimentary form, the exercise is useful, because it provides a conveniently formal documentation for the knowledge representation decisions that have been made.",
        "However, it is also the case that these formal definitions, if appropriately constructed, provide all that is necessary to construct a problem specific interface for acquiring utterances expressed in this sublanguage.",
        "In fact, the idea of using this technique to build acquisition interfaces.",
        "using INGLISH, actually occurred as a result of wondering what to do with a grammar we had constructed simply in order to document our representation structures (Freiling et al.",
        "1984).",
        "We do not intend to imply that it is possible in complex knowledge based system applications to simply build a grammar and immediately begin acquiring knowledge.",
        "Often the process leading to construction of the grammar can be quite complex.",
        "In our case, it even involved building a simple prototype troubleshooting system before we had gained sufficient confidence in our representation structures to attempt a knowledge acquisition interface.",
        "Nor do we intend to claim that all the knowledge necessary to build a complete expert system need be computed in this fashion.",
        "Systems such as INKA can be justified on an economic basis if they make possible only the transfer of a significant fraction of the relevant knowledge."

        "1984).",
        "The grammatical structure of GLIB is that of a semantic grammar, where non-terminal symbols represent units of interest to the problem domain rather than recognizable linguistic categories.",
        "This semantic grammar formalism is an important part of the DETEKTR methodology because the construction of semantic grammars is a technique that is easily learned by the apprentice knowledge engineer.",
        "It also males possible the establishment of very strong constraints on the formal language developed by this process.",
        "Two of the design constraints we find it advisable to impose are that the language be unambiguous (in the formal sense of a unique derivation for each legal sentence) and that it be context-free.",
        "These constraints, as will be seen, make possible features of the interface which cannot normally be delivered in other contexts, such as menus from which to select all legal next terminal tokens.",

        "A choice from the menu can be typed or selected using the mouse.",
        "INGL1SH in fact allows all actions to be performed from the keyboard or with the mouse and for them to be freely intermingled.",

        "Figure 5, in the \"INGLISH\" window, shows a complete sentence and its translation, and a partial sentence with a menu of continuations.",
        "The numbers associated with each menu item provide a shorthand for entry, i.e., \"*12\" can be typed instead of \"RESISTANCE\".",
        "As menu entries can be phrases, this can save significant typing effort.",
        "Input is processed on a word-by-word basis.",
        "Single spaces and punctuation characters serve as word terminators.",
        "Words are echoed as typed and overwritten in uppercase when accepted.",
        "Thus, if lowercase is used for typing, the progress of the sentence is easily followed.",
        "An invalid entry remains visible along with the menu of acceptable continuations then is replaced when a selection is made.",
        "The spelling corrector (a Smalltalk system routine is used) only corrects to words that would be acceptable in the current syntactic/semantic context.",
        "As Carbonell and Hayes (1983) point out, this is more efficient and accurate than attempting to correct against the whole application dictionary.",
        "Word completion is provided with the \"escape\" character (cf. DEC, 1971).",
        "When this is used, INGL1SH attempts to complete the word on the basis of the characters so far typed.",
        "If there are several possibilities, they are displayed in a menu.",
        "Automatic phrase completion occurs whenever the context permits no choice.",
        "The completion will extend as far as possible In an extreme case a single word could yield a whole sentence!",

        "The system does not support anaphora, and ellipsis is offered indirectly.",

        "On the other hand he may form an overly conservative model of the system and fail to utilize the full capabilities of the interface (Tennant, 1980).",
        "An interface designer is confronted by many linguistic phenomena.",
        "e.g., noun groups, relative clauses, ambiguity, reference, ellipsis, anaphora, and paraphrases.",

        "Fortunately, Hendler Michaelis (1983) found that subjects were able to adapt to limited language systems.",
        "ENGLISH does not let the designer off the hook!",
        "A user can still have a statement in mind and not easily find a way to express it through the grammar.",
        "Diligent engineering is still needed to prepare a grammar that will allow a user to be guided to a paraphrase of his original thought.",
        "Nevertheless, the grammar design problem is simplified: when guidance is provided fewer paraphrases need be incorporated.",
        "The use of a semantic grammar to define the fragment of English to be processed does impose limitations on the complexity of acceptable input.",
        "In the INICA system as it is currently constructed, however, there are two distinct ways in which the semantic correctness of an input can be enforced, first in the parsing of the of the semantically constrained grammar, and second in the translation process, as the functional structures are built.",
        "In short, the our approach to building practical natural language interfaces does not depend on a semantic grammar to constrain input.",
        "In the future we intend to explore the use of a wider class of grammars that include a domain-independent kernel and a domain-specific component, like GLIB.",
        "In this approach we are in substantial agreement with Winograd (1984) who advocates a similar approach as an effective direction for further natural language research."
