        "For example, someday the Association for Computational Linguistics will maintain and update an exhaustive knowledge base immediately accessible to all computational linguists.",
        "Our present conception of computers as distinct objects will not fade away the local workstation seems destined to grow smaller and more powerful every year -- but developments in networking will allow users to think of their own workstations not merely as computers, but as windows into a vast information space that they can use however they desire.",
        "Most of the parts needed for such a system already exist, and fiber optic technology will soon transmit broadband signals over long distances at affordable costs.",
        "Putting the parts together into large, non-local networks is no trivial task, but it will happen.",

In a similar manner, verbs of possession -- \"possess,' \"have,\" \"own,\" 'borrow,\" \"buy,\" \"sell,\" 'find,\" and so on -- share a semantic primitive that has to do with rights of ownership.",
        "Not all semantic primes nucleate semantic fields, however.",
        "There is a causative primitive that differentiates \"rise\" and 'raise,\" 'fall\" and \"fell,' \"die\" and \"kill,\" and so on, yet the causative verbs 'raise,' 'fell,' \"kill\" do not form a causative semantic field.",
        "Johnson-Laird and I distinguished two classes of semantic primitives: those (like motion) around which a semantic field can form, and those (like causation) used to differentiate concepts within a given field.",
        "Although the nature of semantic primitives is a matter of considerable interest to anyone who proposes a semantic notation for writing the definitions that a language processing system will use, they have received relatively little attention from psychologists.",
        "Experimental psychologists have a strong tendency to concentrate on questions of function and process at the expense of questions of content.",
        "Perhaps their attempts to understand the processes of disambiguation will stimulate greater interest in these structural questions."

        "Their sentences included: \"The milk was chaste,\" \"The plates were still chaste after much use,\" and \"The amoeba is a chaste animal.\" In order to understand what they were doing, you have to see the dictionary entry for \"chaste\": CHASTE: 1. innocent of unlawful sexual intercourse.",

        "3. pure in thought and act, modest.",

        "Patti Gildea and I (Miller & Gildea, 1985) have confirmed Deese's observation many times over.",

        "As of this writing, our 10- and 11-year old friends have written a few thousand sentences for us, and we are still collecting them.",
        "Our goal is to discover which kinds of mistakes are most frequent.",

        "This project is still going on, so I can give only a preliminary report based on about 20% of our data.",
        "So far we have analyzed 457 sentences incorporating 22 target words: 12 are relatively common words that most of the children knew, and 10 are relatively rare words with which they were unfamiliar.",
        "The common words",
        "were selected from the core vocabulary of words introduced by authors of 4th-grade basal readers; the rare words were selected from those introduced in 12th-grade readers (Taylor, Frackenpohl, & White, 1979).",
        "It is convenient to refer to them as the 4th-grade words and the 12th-grade words, respectively.",
        "Errors were relatively frequent.",
        "Of the sentences classified so far, only 21% of those using 4th-grade words were sufficiently odd or unacceptable to indicate that the author did not have a good grasp on the meaning and use of the word, but 63% of the sentences using 12th-grade words were judged to be odd.",
        "Thus, the majority of the errors occurred with the 12th-grade words.",
        "Table 2 shows our current classification.",
        "Note that the categories are not mutually exclusive: some ingenious youngsters are able to make two or even three mistakes in a single sentence.",

        "As an example of \"Wrong prepo-sition,' consider the student who wrote: \"Be very METICULOUS on your work.\" An example of \"Inappropriate topic\" is: 'The train was TRANSITORY.' An example of 'Inappropriate object' is: \"I was METICULOUS about falling off the cliff.' Examples of \"Used rhyming word are 'Did it ever ACCRUE to you that Maria T. always marks with a special pencil on my face?\", 'Did you evict that old TENET?', and 'The man had a knee REPARATION.' Other categories were even less frequent, so return now to the most common type of mistake, the one labelled 'Selectional error.\""

She composed a sentence around this phrase: 'We had a branch COME AS A GROWTH on our plant', then substituted 'accrue\" for it.",
        "This strategy seems to account for the other examples.",

        "One intriguing clue is that sometimes the final substitution is not made: the written sentence contains the word selected from the definition but not the word that it defined.",
        "And, since substitution is not a simple mental operation for children, sometimes the selected word or phrase from the definition is actually written in the margin of the paper, alongside the requested sentence.",
        "These are called selectional errors because they violate selectional preferences.",
        "For example, the girl who discovered that 'stimulate' means 'stir up\" and so wrote, 'Mrs. Jones stimulated the cake,' violated the selectional preference that 'stimulate' should take an animate object.",
        "One reason these errors are so frequent is that dictionaries do not provide much information about selectional preferences.",
        "We think we know how to remedy that deficiency, but that is not what I want to discuss here.",

        "If we give the intelligent tutor strict rules in order to detect selectional errors like 'Our car depletes gasoline,\" will it not also treat \"Our car drinks gasoline\" as an error?",
        "On the other hand, if the tutor accepted the latter, would it not also accept the former?",
        "An even simpler dilemma, one often noted, is that a system that blocks such phrases as \"colorless green ideas\" will also block such sentences as 'There are no colorless green ideas.' If our tutor teaches children to avoid 'stimulate the cake,\" will it also teach them to avoid \"you can't stimulate a cake\"?",
        "When subtle semantic distinctions are at issue, it is customary to remark that a satisfactory language understanding system will have to know a great deal more that the linguistic values of words.",

        "Such remarks are probably true, but they offer little guidance in getting the job done.",
