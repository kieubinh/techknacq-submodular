        "The essential feature of a lexicon-grammar is that the elementary unit of computation and storage is the simple sentence: subject-verb-cornelement(s).",
        "This type of representation is obviously needed for verbs: limiting a Verb to its shape has no meaning other than typographic, since a verb cannot be separated from its subject and essential complement(s)2.",
        "We hove shown (M. Gross 1975) that given a verb, or equivalently a simple sentence, the set of syntactic properties that describes its variations is unique: in general, no other verb has an identical syntactic paradigm3.",
        "As a consequence, the properties of each verbal construction must be represented in a lexicon-grammar.",
        "The lexicon has no significance taken as an isolated component and the grammar component, viewed as independent of the lexicon, will have to be limited to certain complex sentences, Since be-Adjective forms are close to verbs, their description is quite similar, that is, they are considered as sentences.",
        "We have applied lexicon-grammar representation not only to the two obvious predicative parts of speech, verb and adjective, but to nouns and adverbs as well.",
        "In the same way as one adjoins the verb to be to adjectives, we have Systematically introduced support verbs (Vsup) for nouns and adverbs, as in the following examples (/.8.",
        "Harris 1976, M. Gross 1962, 1986): Vsup e: to be Prep: The text is in contradiction with the law Vsup to have This text has a certain importance for Bob4 Vsup S: to occur, etc.",
        "Accidents occur at random The accident (was, happened, occurred, took place) late at night",

        "UA 819 of civris.",
        "This research has been partly financed by contract \"PBC Inforrnatigee Linguistique\" 1965-86 from the Ministry of Research.",
        "2.",
        "The notion of essential complement has been refined through the systematic study of 12,000 verbs of French (M. Gross 1975; J,-P. Boons, A. Guillet, C. Leclerc.",
        "1976a, 1976b, 1987) and a study of adverbials, that is, of nonessential complements (hi.",
        "Gross 1986).",
        "The subject and/or the complements may be transformed and/or omitted through various syntactic operations, in particular, by norninalizing the verb (G. Gross, Vivbs 1986), but the full information can be recovered (7.8.",
        "Harris 1982).",
        "3.",
        "A line of \"+\" and \"-:\" marks in Figure 1 is such a paradigm.",
        "4 Both examples are not isolated entries of the lexicon-gralnmar, but rather (2.S.",
        "Harris 1964), transforms of other forms: This text contradicts the law This text is important for Bob Support verbs are frequent in technical texts, and may have stylistic variants, as in this last example.",
        "Grammatical elements such as determiners, prepositions and conjunctions, do not belong to the lexicon-grammar in the same sense as the tour major parts of speech do, since they are parts of structures or rules.",
        "For example, prepositions appear in the columns of the lexicon-grammar, An early representation of verbs in a lexicon-grafernar of about 12,000 verbs is given in figure 1.",
        "Each row of the matrix is art entry whose main construction is defined by a table or class code.",
        "In figure 1, the code 6 corresponds to the class of constructions: subject-verb-direct sentential complement, noted:",
        "(1) No V gee P",
        "(No is the subject tin(' P stands for sentence).",
        "Each column is a syntactic property, and corresponds to a structure into which V may enter, roughly a syntactic transform of the main structure.",
        ".or example, in columns we have placed the Passive forms, Extraposed and ronominal forms.",
        "Thus, the related structures are semantically close, \"T\" sign at the intersection of a row and a column indicates that the ntry in the row is accepted in the structure associated to the column, \"-\" sign corresponds to inacceptability.",
        "The process of accumulation that led to the formalized lexicon-grammar of 12,000 French verbs has run into what seemed to be at first a minor problem of representation of words: the difference between simple and compound words.",
        "On the one hand, there are simple words such as the verb know and complex (idiomatic) forms such as keep in mind, Both forms play the same syntactic arid semantic role in sentences such as: Bob knows that Max has moved to Tampa Bob keeps in mind that Max has moved to Tampa but the lexical content (one word vs three) requires different identification procedures (simple dictionary lookup vs a certain amount of syntactic analysis).",
        "The representation of figure 1 treats two forms such as to know (someone, something) and fo keep (someone, something) in mind in the same way, thus emphasizing the semantic equivalence between simple and compound verbs.",
        "But compound terms raise a problem of representation.",
        "The unit of representation in a linear lexicon is roughly the word5 as defined by its written form, that is, a sequence of letters separated from neighboring sequences by boundary blanks, As a consequence, compound words cannot be directly put into a dictionary the way simple words are.",
        "Au identification procedure is needed for their occurrences in texts, and this procedure will make use of the various simple parts of the compound utterance.",
        "Hence, the formal linguistic properties of compound terms will determine both the procedure of identification in texts and the type of storage they require.",
        "We thus have to discuss the main types of compounds and to single out those properties that bear on automatic parsing and dictionary lookup,",
        "1.",
        "Compound adverbs",
        "We call adverb any circumstancial complement, including sentential phrases, as in the following examples: (1) The show took place nightly at night during a busy night the night Bob missed his plane By compound adverbs, or frozen or idiomatic adverbs, we mean adverbs that can be separated into several words, with some or all of their words frozen, that is, semantically and/or syntactically noncompositional.",
        "In (1), at night is a compound adverb, the lack of compositionality is apparent from lexical restrictions such as: *al day, *at afternoon, *at evening and by the impossibility of inserting material that is a priori plausible, syntactically and semantically:",
        "5.",
        "Note that words or roots are often considered as units in most attempts to devise semantic representations.",
        "Notice that nightly can also be considered as a frozen compound, though not constituted of words but of a word and a suffix.",
        "Again, lack of compositionality stems from the observation that daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, etc.",
        "which are compounds of the same formal type have a regular formation, in the sense that their interpretation is homogeneous.",
        "Thus, nightly is an isolated case, as opposed to an open series of identical forms with a different interpretation.",
        "The two other adverbs of (1) are free forms.",
        "Thus, the determiners Del and modifiers (Adj and Relclause) of: during Det Adi night Relclause can vary freely (within semantic constraints).",
        "In the same way, the event associated with the sentence S in the form: the night (E, that) S can be expressed by a large variety of unconstrained forms, Frozen or compound adverbs constitute the simplest case of compound forms because they do not allow variations of their components.",
        "As mentioned above, in al night no adjective is authorized.",
        "Moreover, one cannot insert a determiner: *al (a, this) night, the plural is forbidden: *at nights and no relative clause can be appended: *al night (that, which) was agreed on.",
        "Such observations are general, and apply to many adverbs of varied form and lexical content: It rained cats and dogs *many cats and dogs *big cats and dogs *cat and dog",
        "from lime to time *from times to times *from a time to another time from long time to long time Consequently, these compound adverbs could be identified by a simple recognition procedure, for they do not require any lemmatization or syntactic analysis to be reduced to a dictionary form, as is the case with verb forms for example.",
        "A lexical study of compound adverbs has been performed in French and a systematic inventory has been compiled from various dictionaries.",
        "Running texts have been examined as well.",
        "It is interesting to note that whereas in current dictionaries there are about 1,500 one word adverbs, most of them in menu (-ly), we have found over 5,000 compound adverbs.",
        "These compound adverbs have been classified according to their syntactic shape.",
        "The syntactic forms are described at the elementary level of sequences of parts of speech.",
        "We use symbols with obvious interpretations such as Prep, Del, Aril, N, V, Con) (for conjunction) and W for a variable ranging over verb complements, etc.",
        "We write:",
        "It is largely frozen: no other determiner is allowed, no adjectives can be appended to either noun, etc., but the person of the possessive adjective Poss, may vary.",
        "This possessive adjective must refer to the subject of the sentence, and varies accordingly: *Max proposed ideas from the top of your hat *My sister proposed ideas from the top of his hat Bob and Max proposed ideas from the top of their hat(s) In this case, the recognition procedure is no longer a simple string matching operation, since a variable slot must be dealt with inside the fixed string.",
        "More general matching rules are required here6.",
        "Once this compound adverb has been identified in a text to be processed, it can be given an interpretation, for example in terms of a simple adverb such as leisurely or lightly and the referential information carried by Poss can then be ignored.",
        "However, one can easily construct particular discourses where the obligatory coreference relations involved will disambiguate some analysis.",
        "Thus, not only the variation of Peso must he accounted for at the lexical level, but its referential information has to be kept for possible use in a parser.",
        "Other compound adverbs offer different degrees of variation.",
        "There are cases where one part of the adverb is frozen and another part is entirely free: Max organized a party in honor of Bob Max hid the car at the far end of the parking lot The parts in honor, at the far end are frozen.",
        "For example, they do not allow modifiers.",
        "The parts of N are free, for we observe variations such as:",
        "curare louse mantic' de so belle mart ti gorge daployee en desespoir de cause au maven de N par rapport n N des pieds 4 la tote en tout el pour tow",
        "for the sake of ruining things for the sake of Bob for God's sake We call the combination forsake frozen, since the noun sake does not occur elsewhere than in adverbial phrases with the preposition for: it cannot be the subject or object of any verb.",
        "On the other Imad, the modifiers of sake are quite varied and regular from the point of view of the syntax of noun modifiers'.",
        "There are also cases of seemingly free adverbs which require an ad hoc treatment.",
        "For example, dates such as: Monday March 13, 1968 at 9 p.m. are described in a natural way by a finite automaton.",
        "Technical or specialized families of adverbs come close to being frozen adverbs:",
        "(2) They elected Bob on the (first, second) ballot (3) Max ate his noodles in a bowl",
        "The special semantic relations that hold between the adverbial complement and the rest of the sentence are limited.",
        "There are few verbs such as to eaf which combine with in a bowl and which have the non locative interpretation of (3).",
        "The usual interpretation is that found in: The examples discussed so far are entirely frozen, Hence, as a practical matter, they can be located in a text by using the search function available for strings in any text editor system.",
        "There are however more complex examples that require deeper analysis.",
        "Consider fey example the idiomatic adverb in the sentence:",
        "6.",
        "PROLOG rules are particularly well adapted to recognizing such frozen forms (P. Sabatier 1900).",
        "7.",
        "There are nonetheless restrictions on them: *for a heavenly sake",
        "Max put his noodles in a bowl Entering frozen adverbs into a lexicon-grammar raises many new questions.",
        "The bulk of adverbs can be described by means of the following type of derivation (Z.S.",
        "Harris 1976): Bob left; That Bob left occurred at 9 = Bob left, this occurred at 9 Bob left at 9 and support verbs play a crucial role here.",
        "However, there are cases where no general support verb is found and where adverbs have to ha considered as a part of the elementary sentence.",
        "Consider the adverb in: Bob sang at the top of his voice It is syntactically and semantically analogous to free adverbs such as noisily, powerfully.",
        "For these two free adverbs, a derivational source involving the adjective is available: The way Bob sang was (noisy, powerful) This is not the case for a( the lop of his voice which is practically limited to modifying the verbs of saying.",
        "Moreover the obligatory coreference link of his leads to a representation where this adverb is not analyzed.",
        "Thus two semantically similar types of adverbs have to he represented quite differently in the lexicon-grammar.",
        "All the situations just exemplified with adverbs are quite common, and are also encountered with nouns, adjectives and verbs.",
        "The paradox of representation they lead to can only be solved by introducing a complex level of semantic equivalence for the entries of the lexicon-grammar."
