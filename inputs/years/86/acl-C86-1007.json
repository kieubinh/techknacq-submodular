        "The work reported here is being conducted as part of the LOKI project (ESPRIT Project 107, \"A logic oriented approach to knowledge and data bases supporting natural user interaction\").",
        "The goal of the NL part of the project is to build a pragmatically sensitive natural language interface to a knowledge base.",
        "By \"pragmatically sensitive\", we mean that the system should not only produce well-formed coherent and cohesive language (a minimum requirement of any NL system designed to handle discourse), but should also be sensitive to those aspects of user behaviour that humans are sensitive to over and above simply providing a good response, including producing output that is appropriately decorated with those minor and semantically inconsequential elements of language that make the difference between natural language and natural natural language.",
        "This paper concentrates on the representation of the structure of conversation in our system.",
        "We will first outline the representation we use for dialogue moves, and then outline the nature of the definition of well-formed dialogue that we are operating with.",
        "Finally, we will note a few extensions to the representation mechanism."

        "We are assuming a seven-slat frame for the representation of moves within a dialogue, with the following slots: MOVE, USER, AGENT, TURN, ACT, BASE, CONT.",
        "Every move in a conversation is represented by such a frame.",
        "The MOVE slot uniquely idenitifies a particular move in the conversation by an arbitrary integer.",
        "The USER slot identifies the current user of the system.",
        "The AGENT slot specifies whether it is a user move o• a system move.",
        "The TURN slot has the value OPEN n or CLOSE n, where n is a number that refers to a particular exchange.",
        "Typically, a move with a value OPEN n for the TURN slot might be a request, and one with a CLOSE n value the corresponding response.",
        "The ACT slot specifies what act is performed by the utterance.",
        "This will be either a speech act, or the value ACTION, since not all moves need be speech acts.",
        "The range of speech acts that the system will have to recognise or produce is clearly smaller than that which occurs in conversations between humans.",
        "Furthermore, certain speech acts will be of primary importance given the domain of application of the system, namely, as a front end to an expert system.",
        "We have therefore produced an initial hierarchy of potentially relevant speech acts (Wachtel 1985a), where the major classification is into requests, assertions and commentaries.",
        "Some of these are referred to below.",
        "Many of the speech acts we use go one level below what is traditionally viewed as a speech act (i.e. in the sense of Austin (1962), Searle (1969), etc.)",
        "and may be compared with distinctions that McKeown (1985: 9ff.",
        "), for example, discusses under the category of \"rhetorical predicates\", though they are by no means the same.",

        "This simplistic view of topic is adopted here as a first step only, and serves to illustrate the points discussed below.",
        "The CONT slot specifies the semantic representation of the utterance, and we envisage using the same representation for semantics and for actions, so that all possible ACT types can be represented uniformly in the CONT slot.",
        "In particular, we will define an exchange as a pair of utterances with the same value for the CONT slot, for the time being.",
        "This is Of course too strict.",
        "Other functions specifying",
        "\"local coherence\" in the sense of Hobbs (1982: 227) are also relevant here.",
        "The particular illocutionary force of an utterance will be a function of the value of the ACT slot and the CONT slot.",
        "Subdialogues that are not in the mainstream of the conversation will be identified by particular relationship of values for the TURN slot between adjacent moves, enhanced by the values of the ACT slots for the moves.",
        "Some examples of the use of this frame to represent sequences of utterances in conversations can be found in Wachtel (1985b, 1985c), including its use to identify shifts of topic, subdialogues and relevance, as well as the contextual disambiguation of speech acts, which is the main topic of these working papers."

      "heading": "3. The structure of conversation",
      "text": [
        "We assume that it is possible to define the structure of a possible conversation by rule.",
        "Actual human-human conversations may defy such analysis, as illustrated by, for example, the work of Sachs, Schegloff & Jefferson (1974).",
        "However, the possible ways in which the conversations we are dealing with may go are severely limited by three factors: (a) this is an interface to an expert system (or some similarly specific software), which delimits the possible range of topics; (b) one of the participants in the dialogue is a machine, which means that it will not suddenly want to indicate that, for example.",
        "Albert's niece is a friend from school, but this fact has no bearing on the supportive things being said about her; and (c) the other participant knows that his interlocutor is a machine, and will behave accordingly.",
        "Therefore, what we need to model is not a typically natural open human conversation, hut a restricted type of conversation that also occurs between humans in certain well-circumscribed contexts.",
        "For example, a conversation between a would-be passenger and a ticket clerk at a railway station is closer to what we need to model, and in such cases it is possible to define what is or is not a well-formed conversation by rules of an abstract nature that may well be inadequate for other naturally occurring converations.",
        "We therefore propose three rules that define the notion of well-formed conversation in the present context, making the following assumptions.",
        "The structure of a conversation can be represented as a tree structure.",
        "The wellformedness of such trees can be defined by rewrite rules.",
        "The maximal number of levels of embedding in such trees is six (see below).",
        "In particular, subdialogues can be embedded within dialogues, but there can be no embedding within subdialogues.",
        "The last restriction conflicts with what people do.",
        "It is one of the restrictions we consider necessary, and which can be handled in such a way that the user will not notice that any such restriction exists.",
        "We assume that the fallowing four categories are sufficient for the representation of the structure of conversation.",
        "The symbols used serve as mnemonics for their approximate counterparts in English, but they should not be strictly equated with them: CONY (conversation), DIAL (dialogue), EXCH (exchange) and MOVE (as discussed above).",
        "To formulate in informal terms the general style and atmosphere of the rules that we will propose more formally below, let us say that a CONY may consist of one or more DIALs, a DIAL may consist of one or more EXCHs, and an EXCH consists of two MOVEs, with each of these MOVEs followed by an optional DIAL.",
        "A major point about conversations that must be handled in a grammar of this type is the faot that although MOVEs are the only terminal nodes, and are therefore the nodes that correspond to the utterances that are actually produced, with all other nodes representing more abstract elements, certain features of conversation need to be associated with these abstract nodes.",
        "For example, although each MOVE is specified for who the current user of the system is and each MOVE also has a particular topic, as discussed above, these notions properly belong to more abstract levels of conversational structure.",
        "Who the user is can be defined at the CONY level (i.e. we define a CONV as a conversation with one user).",
        "The topic of an utterance can be defined at the DIAL level (i.e. a CONY can consist of one or more dialogues, each on a single topic).",
        "Furthermore, a DIAL can consist of one or more EXCHs, and it is at this point that the content of the utterances that form part of that EXCH is defined.",
        "Let us now be more precise.",
        "We assume that some of the slots mentioned above in the MOVE frame are represented as features on the nodes in the trees representing the structure of the conversation of which the moves described by the MOVE frames are part.",
        "This association of features with nodes, plus the assumption that all features trickle down, with a few exceptions discussed below, provides for trees of the general form shown in Table 1.",
        "The lower case letters are constants.",
        "Note that the values of the BASE feature on the subdialogue nodes have not been specified.",
        "We return to this point below.",
        "Table 1 represents a goal: the sort of structures we want the rules to produce.",
        "The following three rules generate trees of this type.",
        "Kleene Plus notation is used.",
        "The notation should be interpreted as follows.",
        "Roman letters as feature values are constants.",
        "Greek letters are variables ranging over possible feature values, and are to be interpreted consistently within a rule, but not necessarily between rules.",
        "They are used to ensure that the oorrect",
        "feature values trickle down in the right cases.",
        "Node subscripts distinguish between different instances of the same node.",
        "Note that Greek letters are also used as variables for node subscripts (rule (3)).",
        "Round brackets indicate uptionality in the usual way.",
        "Angle brackets (rule (3)) are used in the same way as used by e.g. Labov (1972: oh.",
        "B) in the.",
        "study of sociolinguistic variation.",
        "They indicate a relationship between elements on the left and on the right of the rule.",
        "The expansion on the right is only possible if the feature on the left of the rule has the value specified, if both are enclosed in angle brackets.",
        "In the present case, they are used to prevent the expansion of a subdialogue as a further subdialogue.",
        "The feature ESUSDs-3 is introduced by the rule that expands CONV.",
        "The rule expanding DIAL copies this feature with this value.",
        "The rule expanding EXCH allows an expansion of EXCH to include (optionally) one or two DIALs, but if the DIALs appear, then they carry the feature [SUBD:+].",
        "The expansion of such a DIAL by rule (2) copies this feature with this value, as before, when the DIAL is expanded to one or more EXCHs.",
        "However, since the EXCHs so generated carry the feature CSUBD:+J, the rule that expands EXCH will not allow the possibility of further DIALs, because any such expansion is conditional upon the EXCH having the feature ESUBD:-3, as specified in rule (3).",
        "The value of the feature TURN is either OPEN or CLOSE plus a constant that refers to the relevant EXCH.",
        "Note the use of the Greek",
        "variable.",
        "The same constant is used as the value of the feature BASE in subdialogues.",
        "What this amounts to is a stipulation that the topic of a subdialogue is the EXCH that it is part of, which seems to be about right intuitively.",
        "This is what makes them metalinguistic in character.",
        "Furthermore, note that this is a case where a feature/value pair does not trickle down.",
        "This is tantamount to stipulating that DIAL is a BASE-bounding node: it creates \"islands\" with BASEs that do not extend upwards to the main dialogue, but without overwriting the BASE of the current main dialogue.",
        "Again, this seems intuitively correct.",
        "Let us now provide a concrete example of the structure that these rules assign to a dialogue such as (4).",
        "4 U1 When is the next JICAI meeting?",
        "S1 I presume you mean \"IJCAI\" U2 Yes 82 Do you mean the next conference or the next conveners' meeting?",
        "U3 Conference",
        "The structure is given as Table 2.",
        "The values for the feature CONT are given as constants rather than as full semantic representations, and the constants rather than as full semantic representations, and the constant IJCAI is used for the BASE, which is the actual conference due to take place on 12 August 1985.",
        "This value has been given in all relevant cases, thus glossing",
        "over the fact that the BASE could not be identified immediately, which is what triggered the subdialogues.",
        "We add, however, oertain features that were discussed earlier, such as MOVE, AGENT and ACT, to clarify how the final form of the frame representing each MOVE is derived.",
        "This is a conversation in which there is only one main dialogue and only one main exchange within that dialogue.",
        "I hope that it is clear how these additional elements would be incorporated into the structure, and how the appropriate values for BASE, CONY and SUBD would be maintained or changed.",
        "It is interesting to note that the nodes in conversation trees of this sort have a conceptual validity, in that different node types correspond to different aspects of a conversation.",
        "Thus a CONV node corresponds to \"this conversation with this user\", a DIAL ESUBD:-3 node corresponds to \"this topic\", an EXCH ESUBD:-T node corresponds to \"this point\", a DIAL.",
        "ESUBD:+71 node corresponds to \"a point that needed clarification\", and an EXCH ESUBD:ej node corresponds to \"what was unclear\".",
        "Each MOVE node represents an utterance, of course.",
        "The set of HOVE nodes dominated by EXCH ESUBDt-A corresponds to \"whet was ,aids the general line of the conversation\", and the set of MOVE nodes dominated by EXCH ESUBD:el corresponds to \"the sutidialognes\".",
        "Likewise, sets of other nodes correspond to other broade• elements of a conversation.",
        "The set of CONV nedes oorvends to \"all the different conversations a had in this session with different users\", the set of DIAL.",
        "SRUHD:-A nodes corresponds to \"the topihs covered\", the set of EXCH ESUBDt-A notice corresponds to \"the points discussed\", and eo on.",
        "By taking into account configurations of featuree at nodes, one can isolate, therefore, such elements au \"the last but one topic discussed by the previous user\" or \"the first point in this conversation that needed clarification\".",
