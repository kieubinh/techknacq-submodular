        "The reasons for proposing CCRs to state restrictions on the cooccurrence of categories within local trees are analogous to those for introducing Immediate Dominance (ID) and Linear Precedence (LP) rules in GPSG (cf GKPS, pp.",
        "44-50).",
        "A context free rule binds information of two sorts in a single statement, namely",
        "(a) information about which daughters a root has in a local tree and (b) information about the order in which the daughters appear.",
        "By separating this information in ID and LP rules, GPSG is able to state generalizations of the sort \"A preceeds B in every local tree which contains both as daughters,\" which cannot be captured in a context free grammar (CFG).",

        "This work was carried out under the financial support of the BMFT of the German Federal Government.",
        "The fundamental motivation for CCRs rests on the insight that such an ID rule itself combines two different kinds of information in a single statement, namely (a) information involving immediate dominance relations, here that <S, A>, <S, B>, and <S, C> are ordered pairs of categories in which the first category immediately dominates the second and",

        "(3) No local tree with C as a daughter also has D as a daughter.",
        "Statements such as (2) and (3) restricting the cooccurrence of categories in local trees are Category Cooccurrence Restrictions, which are expressions of first order predicate logic using two primitive predicates, 8(0, t) 'a is the root of local tree t' and D(a, t) 'a is a daughter in local tree t'.",
        "[2] CCRs have the form Vt: where TT is a schema and the notion of a possible schema is defined as follows:",

        "A CCR Vt: 7 may be rewritten in conjunctive normal form as Vt:A A where each clause is a disjunction of positive land negated predicate Pi expressions, which is equivalent to V t: cp A A Vt: (1)n' i.e. a conjunction of simple CCRs.",

        "It applies to any lexical ID rule with a category specified <DAR, 2> in the RHS and produces a rule with the specification <NULL, +> added to this category.",
        "It turns out that STM1 may be eliminated with two simple statements.",
        "An FCR expresses the fact that a category is specified for NULL (i.e. NULL takes the value + or -) if and only if it also is <BAR, 2>:",
        "(39) [NULL] ' [BAR 2]",
        "A CCR then stipulates that a category specified <NULL, +> must have a lexical category as its sister in a local tree: (40) J[ [+NULL] D [BAR 0] ji This is equivalent to the condition that STM1 - like all metarules - may only apply to lexical ID rules.",
        "Note that a root category is not indicated in (40) and that parasitic gaps (cf GKPS, pp.",
        "162 ff) are provided for.",
        "As in GKPS, an FCR requires that a category specified <NULL, +> also be specified for SLASH: (41) [+NULL] D [SLASH] (FCR 19) The distribution of SLASH is in turn governed by the CAP, HFC, and FFP.",
        "GKPS also postulates an FSD for NULL: (42) -[NULL] (FSD 3) FSD 3 is not required in this analysis since categories specified <BAR, 2> are freely specified with values from (+, -} for NULL, while all other categories must be unspecified for NULL according to (39).",
        "The treatment of gaps in GKPS is completed with the Slash Termination Metarule 2 (STM2) (cf GKPS, pp.",
        "160-162):",
        "S4'M2 says that for every lexical ID rule introducing V [+SUBJ, FIN] as a daughter, there is a corresponding rule with V2[-SUBJ, FIN] in place of V2[+SUBJ, FIN] and with the mother specified <SLASH, NP>.",
        "Examination of the lexical ID rules proposed for English in GKPS reveals that all V2[FIN] daughters introduced are also specified <SUBJ, -I->.",
        "We may therefore reformulate the typos of the lexical head categories so that V2[FIN] complements do not carry the specification <SUBJ, +>.",
        "The feature SUBJ is then freely specified but restricted by the FCR in (44) and the CCR in (45):",
        "(44) [SUBJ] F.: -N, BAR 2] (45) 1[ [BAR 0] A V2[-SUBJ, FIN] ]I X/NP",
        "The CCR of (45) states that a local tree with V2[-SUBJ, FIN] and [BAR 0] as daughters must have a root specified <SLASH, NP>.",
        "As in the case of STM1, the stipulation of a [BAR 0] sister is the CCR counterpart of the requirement that metarules apply only to lexical ID rules.",
        "Taken together, the two FCRs of (39) and (44) plus the two CCRs of (40) and (45) accomplish all the work of STM1 and STM2 and result in the same analyses for English as adopted in GKPS."
