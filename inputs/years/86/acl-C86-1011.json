        "Projectivity is word order constraint in dependency grammars, which is analogous to continuous constituency within phrase-structure systems.",
        "In a projective sentence, between two words connected by a dependency arc only such words can be positioned which are governed (directly or indirectly) by one of these words.",
        "Or, in other words, a sentence is projective in case there are no intersections between arcs and projections in its dependency tree diagram.",
        "Thus, for instance, sentence (1) is projective, whereas sentence (2) is non-projective:",
        "He took the book He the took book We might note that sentence (2) is ungrammatical.",
        "The projectivity hypothesis, originally propounded by Lecerf (cf. e.g. Lecerf 1960) and later gaining wide acceptence, amounts to the following: Natural languages are projective in the sense that the non-projective constructions in them are ungrammatical.",
        "And this has an important consequence.",
        "Thus, taking into account the self-evident fact that ungrammatical phrases do not occur in texts, in the'processing of texts we can rule out from consideration the non-projective parses on the basis of ungrammaticality.",
        "Projectivity thus serves as a filtering device, shown further to be of extremely powerful nature (op.cit.).",
        "To estimate the usefulness of the projectivity hypothesis for each particular language requires the conduct of extensive empirical testings.",
        "On the basis of statistical accounts from inspection of texts French was reported by Lecerf to be almost 100% projective.",
        "The same would be true, according to him, for other languages like German, Italian, Dutch etc., although the material available (at the time) was not sufficient for statistical processing.",
        "English is also believed to be a projective language: in 30 000 phrases only two non-projective ones were found (Harper and Hays 1959); in Kareva (1965) somewhat different, but still result in the same vein was obtained (using different notation): from 10 000 phrases of connected text 620 were found to be non-projective.",
        "Such investigations can be seen to be bound together by their approach to the testing of the projectivity hypothesis: texts are explored and statistical accounts are made of the correlation between projective and non-projective phrases.",
        "The very rare occurrence in such texts of non-projective sentences is interpreted as a confirming evidence.",
        "Such studies represent what we shall furtheron refer to as \"the textual approach to the testing of the projectivity hypothesis\" (or simply, \"the textual approach\")."

        "(i) Irrelevancy_ of data.",
        "The data the textual approach presents in justification of the hypothesis is, strictly speaking, irrelevant.",
        "Knowing that non-projective phrases do not occur in texts, naturally, gives us no formal right to infer that such phrases are ungrammatical as well.",
        "(ii) Insufficiency, of data.",
        "The data provided by this approach is insufficient to justify even a weaker claim to the effect that non-projective structures do not occur in texts.",
        "To justify this latter claim further steps in addition to direct inspection of certain (immaterially how large) corpora of texts should be made.",
        "In particular, a justifiable justification would have to involve both further factual confirmation (e.g. demonstration that predictions from the hypothesis in fact comply with actual data) and \"systematic\" confirmation (demonstration that the hypothesis is consistent with other linguistic principles, facts, etc.)",
        "(cf. e.g. Botha 1981: Ch.9; also ยง 3 below).",
        "(iii) Heuristic futility.",
        "The textual approach is heuristically futile in the sense that, being confined to a mere registration of non-projective constructions within specific texts, we have no way of knowing whether the structures encountered (if some are et all encountered) are all the non-projective structures in a given language, and if not, how many more are there, and which exactly they are."

        "in Bulgarian, and then inspect them for grammaticality.",
        "It was appropriate to accomplish our testing in two phases: preliminary (manual) testing, in which the plausibility of the projectivity hypothesis was to be estimated for the Bulgarian language, and testing aoper (automated testing), in which the non-projective structures in Bulgarian were to be automatically generated, and then checked for grammaticality/ungrammaticality."

        "On inspection, this principle turns out to contradict the projectivity hypothesis.",
        "This is so, since such situations may occur in which this fixed position of certain words leads to non-projectivity.",
        "Thus, one manifestation of this principle in Bulgarian syntax is reflected in the fact that the verb sam 'be' never occurs in sentence-initial or sentence-final position.",
        "Now, assume that we have a three-word sentence containing be in which moreover: (a) be governs another word, X2, X2 being positioned to the left or right of be; and (b) X2 governs X3, X3 being obligatorily positioned to the right of X2.",
        "This being the case, three structures are theoretically admissible, two projective and one non-projective:",
        "However, structures (4) and (5) will be ungrammatical, as predicted by the principle mentioned (notice the position of be).",
        "This latter fact, in turn, predicts the grammaticality of the non-projective structure (6) (knowing of course that there is nothing to forbid in Bulgarian the occurrence of three-word sentences containing be).",
        "As another illustration, this mode of testing would have to lead to the discovery of non-projectivities of the type: \"A 2s2-cedure is discussed which...\" in English which are due to the sentence-initial position of the subject in the English sentence.",
        "In summary, the results obtained from our preliminary testing showed the implausibility of the hypothesis for Bulgarian: we easily found numerous and diverse kinds of counterexamples to it.",

        "In principle, a hypothesis, in empirical sciences such as linguistics, may be said to be: (a) absolutely true (i.e. true without exceptions), (b) on the whole true (i.e. true, but with certain exceptions), and (c) false.",
        "The projectivity hypothesis would have been usable as a filtering device (in Bulgarian) if it fell under cases (a) or (b), case (b) presupposing further that there is a list available of all exceptions.",
        "The results obtained however unambiguously class it under case (c).",
        "Indeed, the great majority of non-projective constructions in Bulgarian are well-formed rather than unacceptable, as implied by the hypothesis.",
        "This seems to be the only correct conclusion, despite the fact that the results themselves should not be considered as absolutely final, this being due to the following circumstances: (1) We did not in fact inspect literally all admissible non-pro-jectivities but only those that were obtainable from the fragment of grammar stored for the experiment; and (2) the presense/absense of projectivity significantly depends on the conventions chosen for dependency arcs distribution.",
        "Still, our investigation on the whole is to be viewed as sufficiently reliable (another experimental testing in which a larger grammar was used and slightly different notation where linguistically justified gave similar results).",
        "Another point deserves special attention.",
        "Despite the fact that non-projective structures in Bulgarian are grammatical, the prevalent part of them are \"stylistically marked\".",
        "Whatever that means, the latter circumstance implies that, quite probably, such constructions will not occur in some kinds of texts at least.",
        "Our chances to pinpoint such texts to a great extent depend on our understanding of the constructions in question (the label \"stylistic mar-kedness\" in itself is no great progress in this direction).",
        "So we focused our attention on these constructions, having already completed the experimental testing described.",
        "The preliminary results of this latter study were quite interesting: non-pro-jectivity in fact turned out to finely describe sentences with a special type of logical emphasis in Bulgarian, characterized by: (i) presense of both non-projectivity and contrastive stress (CS) (in contrast to other emphatic sentences in Bulgarian, having a CS and \"normal\", projective word order); (ii) presense of CS only on one of the words (immaterially which) from the non-projective \"interval\" (an \"interval\" is constituted by a pair of words connected by an arc such that intersects with a projection); the non-projective constructions in this sense contrast with other emphatic constructions with projective word order , which can take a CS on any, word in them; (iii) having synonymous constructions of two types: with a projective word order and CS, or such analogous to the English cleft sentences (\"It is he who ..., where the underlined words are connected by an arc); perhaps, not by coincidence the latter constructions, both in Bulgarian and in English, are non-projective; (iv) having a relation to the topic-comment distinction; more specifically, one of the words from the non-projective interval (immaterially which) is necessarily the comment of the sentence (though, naturally, not each comment requires non-projectivity).",
        "These findings rehabilitate the projectivity/ /non-projectivity distinction (thogh not the hypothesis) for Bulgarian, syntactic ittow non-projectivity happens to be the word order part of a very general mechanism for formation of sentences with logical emphasis.",
        "Thus, though Bulgarian is generally characterized as a free word order language, sentences with logical emphasis are not with a \"free\", but rather with a precisely specified word order coinciding with non-projectivity.",
        "As to the need to retain the above distinction in syntactic processors of Bulgarian, things will be determined by the concrete applied goals: some small applications can certainly ignore non-projective structures (their emphatic part), whereas robust systems cannot do without them.",
        "That is, the former systems would have to keep the distinction and the latter reject it.",
        "Still, it will not be surprising if the distinction might be usefully accomodated even in the latter case.",
        "However, this needs further investigations, mostly in the line of textual linguistics: the study of context, topic/comment, etc.",
        "One is reminded in this train of thought of the remark of the philosopher K. Popper to the effect that a scientific investigation begins and ends with problems."
