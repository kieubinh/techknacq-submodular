        "Most approaches to 'processing reference' are concerned with the case of singular NPs and deal with the complications of plurals only peripherically by remarks of the kind \"The plural case can be considered analogously.\" But such hopes are only partially justified: the plural case is worse and therefore more interesting.",
        "In the present paper I will discuss some specific problems of ( in)definiteness with respect to plurals from an Al point of view.",
        "The heart of any knowledge-based system (KBS) - man or machine - is his/ her/its knowledge base (KB), containing different types of knowledge (cp.",
        "sect.",
        "2).",
        "The KB reflects the KBS' view of the world; in other (e.g. Jackendoffs, 1983) words: a projected world.",
        "(Oiving emphasis to projected worlds and thus to mental models leads to a psychological foundation of semantics.)",
        "The case easiest to manage is that of a complete and consistent KB.",
        "But in normal life - of man as well as machine - this almost never occurs; the knowledge is incomplete or inconsistent (or both).",
        "There are some reasons (cp.",
        "sect 3, 4) to see both types of problem as closely connected, as twin problems, abbreviated by l&l. It is important to extend the KBS' faculties with regard to the maintenance of l&l. This includes:",
        "- Recognition and detection of i&I - Correction of l&I , i.e. forcing completeness and consistency - Dealing, i.e. arguing or 'thinking', with Incomplete or",
        "inconsistent knowledge.",
        "These tasks for maintaining i&I is of specific importance in processing reference."

      "text": [
        "In representing the knowledge about the world (not linguistic knowledge) of a KBS I distinguish three types, knowIect e ofi*tts, knowledge of rules, and know/edge of objects, which is represented by 'Referential Nets' (RefN).",
        "The formal objects, which can be understood as internal (or mental) proxies for entities of the real (or other possible) world(s) are called 'Referential Objects' (Ref0).",
        "RefOs can be seen as underdetermined formal objects (UFOs) in case of incompleteness, or as overdetermined (0F0s) in case of inconsistency.",
        "For representing the knowledge of a KBS and the meaning of utterances I use a propositional 'semantic representation language' SRL.",
        "For processing, e.g. storing and retrieving, referential relations SRL contains specific 'description operators', which are from a formal point of view variable-binding, term-making operators.",
        "Here I will neglect the details of SRL and exemplify only those SRL-concepts which are involved in knowledge about objects (cp.",
        "!label, 1986).",
        "The totality of RefOs and their properties (see below) form a net-like knowledge structure: the Referential Net( RefN).",
        "RefNs are based on three types of formal entities: referential objeds(RefOs) as system-internal proxies of the objects of the world, designetionsof Ref0s, i.e. terms (as opposed to formulas) of SRL and attributes to RefOs and designations.",
        "From a formal point of view (Habel, 1985, 1986) these (double-attributed) RefNs form a relation with AARefN( R-ATT x REFO) x D-TER x D-ATT Remarks:",
        "1.",
        "REFO is the set of all referential objects at a specific point of time (1 neglect time indeces in the present paper); D TER, R-ATT, D-ATT are the set of SRL-expressions of the types 'designating term', 'attribute to RefOs', 'attributes to pairs of RefOs and 0-terms'.",
        "2.",
        "Bracketing RefOs and their attributes reflects that in AARefNs the 1st component is functional dependent of the 2nd.",
        "A first example will illustrate the concepts of the RefN: (1) John's children will travel abroad during their summer vacation.",
        "leads to the following entries in a RefN (only the most relevant parts are formulated; attributes are omitted in the present sect.",
        "): (1')r. I 'John'",
        "1.",
        "There are proxies for objects in a narrow sense as well as for some in a wider sense, e.g. w.r.t.",
        "locations (r.3) or time (r.4).",
        "Their SRL-designations will not be formalized here.",

        "RefNs: Under and overdetermination",
        "In the following I will mainly deal with proxies for concrete objects, especially persons.",
        "A first analysis of the situation in question shows that a hearer of (1) possesses a Ref representing \"John's children\" without the obligation to know more details about them.",
        "e.g., though s/he does not have to know how many they are it is possible to refer to them definitely.",
        "With the introduction of the additional concept 'attribute of a Ref0' it is possible to deal with the l&I problem, i.e. the problems of under and overdetermination of formal objects.",
        "(Furthermore, the use of attributes leads to knowledge representations which allow easy and quick access to the objects in question, e.g. in anaphora resolution and generation).",
        "A more adequate analysis of (1) should lead to a representation, which represents the plural explicitly (and not only implicitly via \"ALL\"): (1\")card 2 r.2 ALL x child_of ( r.1, x) human using a card/Wily attribute to the Ref() r.2 which represents the essential property that r.2's real-world counterpart is assumed to consist of more than one human being; the sortal attribute \"human\", which will be used here only, exemplifies another type of attribute, namely soma/ attributes Remark: By this attribute mechanism I represent the meaning of numerals, e.g. \"John's two cars\" leads to card = 2 r.9ALL x : car (x) & own( r.1, x) In text generation the communicative goals determine which designation(s) and R-ATTs are used to form the content of the message.",
        "What counts as determinate depends on the type of attribute in question.",
        "Each type of attribute possesses its own set of completeness and consistency conditions.",
        "In the case of cardinality, the determinacy condition is given by",

        "Structures of determination From a formal point of view the cardinality attributes are examples of approximation structures similar to the information lattices introduced by Scott (1970); cp.",
        "Belnap (1976).",
        "The lower part of the structure of determination (see Fig. 1), \"UD-CARD\", represents the underdetermined and the upper one, \"OD-CARD\", the overdetermined cardinalities.",
        "The determined cases are represented by the \"D-CARD\" level, which is the symmetry axis of the structure.",
        "0-Card is the set of singletons over the set N of natural numbers ( including zero); DO-CARD consistS of the not-singleton elements of the power-set of N with the partial ordering induced by the set inclusion.",
        "OD-CARD is built up by introducing a 'dual to each UD-CARD' element, which Is symbolized by square brackets \"{_]\".",
        "The 0-CARD elements stand for \"the cardinality is exactly the n which forms the singleton in question\".",
        "UD-CARD represents a set of possible cardinalities.",
        "The minimal entity in the approximation structure, namely N, holds no relevant information, since \"Card=N\" stands for \"the Ref() has a cardinality\", and this is true for all RefOs.",
        "('Card is a set of cardinalities 'card.)",
        "Oetting input from communication or inferential processes.",
        "leads to climbing up the structure, which reflects the enrichment of information with respect to cardinal ity, or to no change in knowledge about the attribute.",
        "The ideal-level is reached at the 0-CARD-level: an exact cardinality is assigned.",
        "Further input causes ( in the good case) no change and in the bad case of inconsistency climbing up into the OD-CARD-region.",
        "The structure of determination does not possess lattice properties; only the DO-CARD and the OD-Card parts are lattice-like.",
        "The sudden change at passing from UD-CARD or 0-CARD to inconsistent OD-CARDs destroys the lattice properties (see below).",
        "The approach of structures of determination, which is exemplified here with the case of cardinality attributes, can be used analogously with respect to other types of attributes.",
        "The base of all such structures are lattices, e.g. those of sort& attributes, which can be interpreted as approximation lattices.",
        "This means that climbing up the lattice can be understood as increasing information.",
        "(Note That the ALL-element in this interpretation is the bottom-element).",
        "In a (half) formal way, a structure of determination is built up from a Scottian approximation lattice (AL) by the following method:",
        "I. Delete NIL from the approximation lattice AL.",
        "2.",
        "Davide the rest in the level of determination ( LoD) which is formed by the direct neighbors of the ( now deleted) NIL and the underdetermined part of the lattice (LID-AL) which is given by those elements of AL which are neither NIL nor in LoD.",
        "3.",
        "With respect to UD-AL construct a dual counterpart of overdetermined elements.",
        "This is called OD-AL.",
        "4.",
        "Olue OD-AL with UD-AL via the level of determination LoD.",
        "5.",
        "The ordering relations can be defined in the canonical way.",
        "As mentioned for the case of cardinality attributes such structures of determination do not possess lattice properties.",
        "This is proven in Hebei (1986).",
        "The same phenomenon is observed by Belnap (1976) with respect to his set of epistemic steles, E. The lattice properties are violated at the passage to inconsistency (overdetermination).",
        "Nevertheless, the most relevant properties of Scott's approximation lattices also hold for structures of determination, especially the amplietivit)/ by input( using Belnap's terminology).",
        "One very important difference between Scott's approach and determination structures concerns the NIL, which is the ( I) failure element of ALs.",
        "In contrast, structures of determination contain many different failure elements, namely all beyond the level of determination.",
        "Thus a condensed history of informing and disinforming is abbreviated by the OD-attribute.",
        "(A chararcterization of Scott's approach could be: \"All failures are equal, namely disastrous.\") Repair processes, which e.g. can be triggered by input from an especially competent or believable informant, e.g. with respect to my example by John himself, lead to climbing downward in the structure.",
        "Note, that repairing is informing of a specific type.",
        "In contrast to normal informing it leads downwards; this changing of the direction demands a specific prior decision based on the experience that something was going wrong.",
        "I conclude this section with a remark on overdetermination: Overdetermined objects are a specific type of impassible objects (cp.",
        "Rapaport 1985), which constitute a test case for every semantic theory.",
        "'Impassibility' or 'non-existence' (as used in some approaches to this topic) refer to the real world and not to projected worlds, which are in the mind.",
        "5.",
        "Conclusion",
        "In this paper I have only dealt with I& problems concerning the subtype of referential knowledge.",
        "Obviously, a similar approach is appropriate for the other subtypes of knowledge, i.e. for other formal objects.",
        "(Notice that essential properties of Ref0s, such as cardinal ity, can also be seen as part of factual knowledge.)",
        "In the case of factual knowledge underdetermination or overdetermination concerns truth values.",
        "Belnap's (1976) four-valued logic with a lattice-theoretic semantics has influenced the concepts of the present paper from a logical point of view.",
        "Some types of RefNs and of structures of determination are implemented as parts of prototypical text-understanding systems by the KIT-projects at the Technical University Berlin."
