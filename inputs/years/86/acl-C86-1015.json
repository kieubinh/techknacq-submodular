        "In the present paper we provide a report on a joint approach to the computational treatment of sentence adverbials (such as surprisingly, presumably or probably) and focussing adverbials (such as only or at least, including negation (not) and some other adverbial expressions, such as for example or inter alia) within a system of question answering without a prearranged data base (TIBAQ).",
        "This approach is based on a joint theoretical account of the expressions in question in the framework of a functional description of language; we argue that in the primary case, the expressions in question occupy, in the underlying topic-focus articulation of a sentence, the focus-initial position, extending their scope over the focus, or the new information, of a sentence, thus specifying, in a broad sense of the word, how the new information of a sentence holds.",

        "In the present paper we propose to treat CA-expressions on a joint syntactico-semantic account, namely in terms of a single adverbial complementation (Complementation of Attitude), by means of which it is possible to economically account for all of the properties which they share from the viewpoint of the synthesis and analysis of sentences: essentially, we argue that the scope of CA expressions extends primarily over the focus, or the new information, of a sentence, and that CA expressions are usually moved on the surface to various scope-ambiguous positions, which can be disambiguated by several general strategies concerning the topic-focus articulation of a sentence (these strategies are used in the algorithm of analysis of CA expressions).",
