        "For quite some time, it has been recognized that the specification is very important in the development of large computer systems as well as the linguistic computer systems.",
        "But it is very difficult to make good use of specification without a well defined formalism and convenient tool.",
        "The Structural Correspondence Specification Grammar (SCSG) is a powerful linguistic specification formalism.",
        "The SCSGs were first studied in S.Chappuy's thesis (11, under the supervision of Professor B.Vauguois.",
        "In their paper presented at Colgate University in 1985 (61 SCSG was called Static Gramnar, as opposed to dynamic grammars which are executable programs, because the SCSG aims at specifying WHAT the linguistic models are rather than HOW they are calculated.",
        "A SCSG describes a linguistic model by specifying the correspondence between the valid surface strings of words and the multilevel structures of a language.",
        "Thus, from a SCSG, one can obtain at the same time valid strings, valid structures and the relation between them.",
        "A SCSG can be used for the synthesis of dynamic gramnars (analyser and generator) and as a reference for large linguistic systems.",
        "An SCS Language (SCSL) has been designed at GETA, in which the SCSG can be linearly written.",
        "The SCS Environment (SCSE) presented here is a computer aided SCSG design system.",
        "It will allow linguists to create, modify, consult and verify their grammars in a convenient way and therefore to augment their productivity.",
        "Section I gives a outline of the system: its architecture, principle, data structure and command syntax.",
        "Section II describes the main functions of the system.",
        "We conclude by giving a perspective for futher developments of the system."
