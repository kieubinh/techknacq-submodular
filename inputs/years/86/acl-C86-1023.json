        "are structure-bound in the sense that all the target sentences (i.e. translated sentences) are composed only from the syntactic structure of the source sentences, not from the meaning understanding of those.",
        "Though almost all the MT are utilizing some semantic devices such as semantic feature agreement checkers, semantic filters and preference semantics (See [Milks 1975] for example.)",
        "which are serving as syntactic structural disambiguation, they still remain im structure-bound approaches far from the total meaning understanding approaches.",
        "The structure-hound MT has a lot of advantageous features among which the easiness of formalizing translation process, that is, writing translation rules and the uniformity of lexicon description are vital from the practical standpoint that it must transact a huge vocabulary and inumerable kinds of sentence patterns.",
        "On the other hand, the structure-bound MT has the inevitable limitation on the treatment of linguistic idiosyncrasy originated from the different way of thinking.",
        "In this paper, first of all, we will sketch out the typical language modeling techniques on which the structure-bound MT(= current practical.",
        "machine translation systems) are constructed.",
        "Secondly, we will examine the difference between the principal.",
        "mechanism of machine translation and that of human translation from the viewpoint of the language understanding ability.",
        "Thirdly, we will illustrate the structural idiosyncratic gap (IC, in short) by comparing the sample sentences in English and that in Japanese.",
        "These sentences are sharing the same meaning.",
        "This comparison will be made by a somewhat new method which we call.",
        "\"Cross Translation Test (CTT, in short)\", which will eventually reveal the various IGs that have origins in the differences of culture, i.e., the way of thinking or the way of representing concepts.",
        "But at the same time, CTT will give some encouraging evidence that the principal technologies of today's not-yet-completed structure-bound MTs have the potential for producing barely acceptable translation, if the source language sentences are taken from the documents of less equivocations or are appropriately rewritten.",
        "Finally, we will briefly comment on the sublanguage to control or normalize source sentences as the promising and practical approaches to overcoming the IGs.",

        "Modeling natural language sentences is, needless to say, very essential to all kinds of natural language processing systems inclusive of machine translation systems.",

        "representations.",
        "So far various modeling techniques are proposed (See for example [Winograd 1983].)",
        "among which the two, the dependency structure modeling (Figure I.)",
        "and the phrase structure modeling (Figure 2) are important.",
        "The former associated with semantic role labeling such as case marker assignment is indispensable to analyze and generate Japanese sentence structure (See for example [Nitta, et al.",
        "1984].",
        "), and the latter associated with syntactic role labeling such as governor-dependent assignment, head-complement assignment, or mother-daughter assignment (See for example [Nitta, et al.",
        "1982].)",
        "is essential to analyze and generate English sentences.",
        "\"To what extent should (or can) we treat semantics of sentences?\"",
        "is also very crucial to the decision for selecting or designing the linguistic model for",
        "machine translation.",
        "But it might be fairly asserted that the majority of the current \"practical\" machine translation systems (MT, in short)are structure-bound or syntax-oriented, though almost all of them claim that they are semantics-directed.",
        "Semantics are used only for disambiguation and booster in various syntactic processes, but not used for the central engine for transformation, generation and of course not for paragraph understanding (See [Slocum 1985, pp.",
        "14'L16] for a good survey and discussion on this problem; and see also [Nitta, et al.",
        "1982] for the discussion on a typical (classical) structure-bound translation mechanism,i.e.",
        "local rearrangement method).",
        "Here \"practical\" means \"of very large scale commercial systems\" or \"of the daily usage by open users\", but neither \"of small scale laboratory sys-tems\" nor \"of the theory-oriented experimental sys-tems\".",
        "For structure-bound machine translation systems, both the dependency structure modeling and the phrase structure modeling are very fundamental technical tools.",
        "The semantic network medeling, which is recently regarded as an essential tool for semantic processing for natural languages (See for examples [Simmons 1984].",
        "), might also he viewed as a variation of dependency modeling.",
        "However modeling problems are not discussed further here.",
        "Comparing Figure 1 and Figure 2, note that the dependency structure modeling is more semantics-oriented, logical and abstract, in the sense of having some distance from surface word sequences.",

        "Machine Translation vs. Human Translation Today's practical machine translation systems (MT, in short) (See for example [Nagao 1985] and [Slocum 1985].)",
        "are essentially structure-bound literal type.",
        "The reasons for this somewhat extreme judgement are as follows: (1) The process of MT is always under the strong control of the structural information extracted from source sentences; (2) In all the target sentences produced by MT, we can easily detect the traces of wording and phrasing of the source sentences; (3) MT is quite indifferent to whether or not the output translation is preserving the proper meaning of the original sentence, and what is worse, MT is incapable of judging whether or not; (4) MT is quite poor at the extra-sentential information such as situational information, world knowledge and common sense which give a very powerful command of language comprehension.",
        "Now let us see Figure 3.",
        "This rather oversimplified figure illustrates the typical process of Japanese-English structure-bound machine translation.",
        "Here the analysis and transformation phase are based on the dependency structure modeling (cf.",
        "Figure 1) and the generation phase is based on the phrase structure modeling (cf.",
        "Figure 2) (For further details, see for example [Nitta, et al.",
        "1984].).",
        "This figure reveals that all the process is bound by the grammatical structure of the source sentence, but not by the meaning of that.",
        "Thus, the MT can easily perform the literal syntax-directed translation such as 'from (J1) into (E'l)' (cf.",
        "Figure 1).",
        "But it is very very difficult for MT to produce natural translation which reflects the idiosyncrasy of target language, pre serving the original meaning.",
        "(El) is an example of a natural translation.",
        "of (Jfl.",
        "In order for MT to produce this (El) from (J1), it may have to invoke a somewhat sophisticated heuristic rule.",
        "In Figure 3, the heuristic rule, HR (KK, KS, ...), can sucess-fully indicate the change of predicate which may improve the treatment for the idiosyncrasy of target sentence.",

        "MT.",
        "It might be almost impossible to find universal grammatical rules to manipulate this kind of gaps, and what is worse, the appropriate heuristic rules are not always found successfully.",
        "On the other hand, the human translation (HT, short) is essentially semantics-oriented type or meaning understanding type.",
        "The reasons for this judgement are as follows:",
        "(1) HT is free from the structure, wording and phrasing of a source sentence; (2) HT can \"create\" (rather than \"translate\") freely a target sentence from something like an image diagram obtained from a source sentence (figure 4); (Of course the exact structure of this image diagram is not yet known); (3) HT often refers the extralinguistic knowledge Duch as the common sense and the culture; (4) Thus, HT can overcome the idiosyncratic gaps (IG) freely and unconsciously.",
        "In order to examine the idiosyncratic gap, we have devised the practical method named \"Cross Translation Test (CTT, in short).\"",
        "The outline of CTT is as follows: First, take an appropriate well-written sample sentence written in one language, say English; Let E denote this sample sentence; Secondly, select or Brake the proper free translation of E in the other language, say Japanese; Let 1 denote this proper free translation; J must preserve the original meaning of P properly; At the same time, make a literal transition of E in the same language that J is written in; Let J' denote this literal translation; Lastly, make a literal translation of J in the same language-that E is written in; Let E' denote this literal translation.",

        "translation means the translation that is preserving the wording, phrasing and various sentential.",

        "Then, eventually we may be able to define (and examine) the idiosyncratic gap, IG, by Figure 5.",
        "In other words, we may be able to examine and grasp the idiosyncratic gap by comparing the structure of E and that of E', or by comparing that of J' and that of J.",
