        "The recent development of grammar theory exhibits convergencies among various approaches, such as Government-Binding Theory, Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar, Definite Clause Grammar, Lexical Functional Grammar, Functional Unification Grammar, and others.",
        "To varying degrees these theories share the following principles: (i) They take into account dependency relations, using notions such as \"head\" or \"governor\".",
        "Phenomena such as long distance dependencies are viewed as touchstones for the formalisms.",
        "(ii) They pay attention to functional aspects.",
        "The representation of syntactic roles is seen to be a task.",
        "(iii) They agree that syntax must be lexically restricted and thus place a large portion of the grammatical information in the lexicon.",
        "(iv) They base their algorithms on the principle of unification, i.e. complex categories are brought into agreement in the syntactic context.",
        "These common features make it possible to compare the solutions of the different formalisms as well as their problems.",
        "The main difficulty for the computer application of unification grammars lies in their complexity.",
        "LFG, for example, bases its syntactic c-structures on the phrase structure principle, while the functional f-structures represent dependency relationships between functers and arguments.",
        "This causes problems for the parser which needs information on both structures while it is creating them.",
        "The development of GPSG seems to be marked by the effort to introduce more and more types of rules so as to adequately constrain the formalism.",
        "As a result, the control of analysis is distributed over many resources and is, therefore, increasingly difficult.",
        "Since a large number of constraints are of a lexical nature, the lexicon becomes more and more unwieldy in all of the formalisms.",
        "Common advantages and common problems of unification grammars suggest examining strategies from still other frameworks.",
        "This is to be done here with respect to dependency grammar.",
        "DUG rearranges the available means of description.",
        "As a result, the benefits of the common principles are fully felt whereas the difficulties mentioned are largely avoided."

        "It is the characteristic feature of DRL that each node refers to a lexically defined atomic unit of an utterance and that the arcs represent direct relationships between these atomic units.",
        "According to the hierarchical structure of tree diagrams, one element in each relationship is dominant, the other one is dependent.",
        "Dependency grammar assumes that this asymmetry reflects the actual situation in natural language.",
        "Asymmetries between constituents are commonly conceded in modern grammar theory.",
        "It seems to be certain that only via the head-complement distinction can adequate constraints for the construction of natural language expressions be defined.",
        "Unfortunately, phrase structure, which prevails in most grammar formalisms, is at odds with the direct asymmetric relations between immediate constituents.",
        "A logical consequence would be to chose dependency as the primary principle of representing syntactic structure (see the arguments in Hudson 1984).",
        "Nevertheless, this proposal still encounters quite a bit of scepticism.",
        "The implementation of an efficient parser (see Hellwig 1980) has proven the practicability of the dependency approach.",

        "To put it in the terminology of LFG: f-structure and c-structure are totally synchronized.",
        "Since this cannot be achieved in a phrase structure representation, it is often assumed that there is a fundamental divergence between form and function in natural language.",
