        "to control the complex interaction of the various constraints.",
        "For instance, the FFI' admits local sets of nodes with slash feature values on parent and child where no such values occur in the licensing ID rule, i.e., it allows instantiation of slash features.",
        "But the CAP's above mentioned definition of control is sensitive to the value of the slash feature associated with the various constituents.",
        "A simple definition of the CAP would ignore the source of the slash value, whether inherited, instantiated by the FFP, or instantiated in some other manner.",
        "However, the appropriate definition of control needed for the CAP must ignore instantiated slash features, but not inherited ones.",
        "Say Gazdar et al.",
        ": We must modify the definition of control in such a way that it ignores perturbations of semantic type occasioned by the presence of instantiated FOOT features.",
        "[2, p. 87] Thus, the CAP is in some sense blind to the work of the FFP.",
        "As Gazdar ct al.",
        "note, this requirement makes stating the CAP a much snore complex task.",
        "The increased complexity of the principles resulting from this need for tracking the origins of feature values is evident not only in the CAP, but in the other principles as well.",
        "The head feature convention requires identity of the head features of parent and ad child.",
        "The features agr and slashfeatures that can be inherited from an ID rule or instantiated by the CAP or FFP, respectivelyare head features and therefore potentially subject to this identity condition.",
        "However, great care is taken to remove such instantiated head features from obligatory manipulation by the HFC.",
        "This is accomplished by limiting the scope of the HFC to the so-called free head features.",
        "Intuitively, the free feature specifications on a category 'the ones the HFC is to apply to] is the set of feature specifications which can legitimately appear on extensions of that category: feature specifications which conflict with what is already part of the category, either directly, or in virtue of the FCRs, FFP, or CAP, are not free on that category.",
        "[2, p. 05] That is, the FFP and CAP take precedence (intuitively viewed) over the IIFC.",
        "Finally, all three principles are seen to take precedence over feature specification defaults in the following quotation.",
        "In general, a feature is exempt from assuming its default specification if it has been assigned a different value in virtue of some ID rule or some principle of feature instantiation.",
        "[2, p. 100] Gazdar et al.",
        "accomplish this by defining a class of privileged features and excluding such features from the requirement that they take on their default value.",
        "Of course, instantiated head features, slash features, and so forth are all considered privileged.",
        "However, a modification of these exemptions is necessary in the case of lexical defaults, i.e., default values instantiated on lexical constituents.",
        "We will not discuss here the rather idiosyncratic motivation for this distinction, but merely note that lexical constituent defaults are to be insensitive to changes engendered by the HFC, as revealed its this excerpt: However, this simpler formulation is inadequate since it entails that lexical heads will always be exempt from defaults that relate to their HEAD features....",
        "Accordingly, the final clause needs to distinguish lexical categories, which become exempt from a default only if they covary with a sister, and nonlexical categories, which become exempt from a default if they covary (in relevant respects) with any other category in the tree.",
        "[2, p. 103] Thus the interaction of these principles is controlled through complex definitions of the various classes of features they are applicable to.",
        "These definitions conspire to engender the following implicit precedence ordering on the principles, principles earlier in the ordering being blind to the instantiations from later principles, which are themselves sensitive to (and exempt from applying to) features instantiated by the earlier principles.3 CAP Y-4 FFP IIFC >- FSDaosst,x Of course, all ID rules, both base and derived are subject to all these principles; yet metarule application is not contingent on instantiations of the base Ill rules.",
        "Conversely, LP constraints are sensitive to the full range of instantiated features.",
        "The precedence ordering can thus be extended as follows: 'Current efforts by at least certain GPSG practitioners are placing the GPSG type of analysis directly in a PATIWike formalism.",

        "claim that \"it is just HEAD feature specifications (other than those which are also FOOT feature specifications) and inherited FOOT feature specifications that determine the semantic types relevant to the definition of control.\" [2, p. 871 Unfortunately, the ordering we have given precludes instantiated head features front participating in the definition of semantic type and hence the CAP.",

        "Of course, the set of features necessary for type determination and tile set instantiated by the CAI' may be disjoint.",
