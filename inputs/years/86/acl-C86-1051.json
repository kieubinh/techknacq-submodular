        "Abstract This paper describes Kind Types (KT), a system which uses commonsense knowledge to reason about natural language text.",
        "KT encodes some of the knowledge underlying natural language understanding, including category distinctions and descriptions differentiating real-world objects, states and events.",
        "It embeds an ontology reflecting the ordinary person's top-level cognitive model of real-world distinctions and a database of prototype descriptions of real-world entities.",
        "KT is transportable, empirically-based and constrained for efficient reasoning in ways similar to human reasoning processes.",
        "I.",
        "The problem A model of the semantic knowledge of concepts underlying natural language is definitional rather than assertional in that it contains general descriptions of objects and their relations, as opposed to facts about specific objects (Levesque 84).",
        "Part of competence in English is the knowledge that an elephant is an animal, and therefore it moves on its own.",
        "Competence also involves knowing particular things about elephants, such as that they have trunks.",
        "This general description of the elephant concept is part of commonsense knowledge and belief.",
        "We will call this the cognitive model.",
        "In order to implement it, a computer system must represent what speakers of a language believe about the world and their named concepts, rather than represent the actual world.",
        "A complete computer model of the cognitive model would represent the commonsense conceptual scheme presupposed by a particular culture and language, in this case, urban American English.",
        "Knowledge of a natural language implies knowledge of a kind of theory of the environment used by a culture.",
        "In learning a language a child learns the category cuts recognized in that theory (Berlin 72) (Dougherty 78).",
        "Assuming that knowledge of word meaning is not differently represented than other kinds of knowledge (Tarnawsky 82), KT is designed to encode the world view embodied in natural language as ordinary knowledge, while retaining the autonomy of combinatorial semantics and of syntax.",
        "KT does not provide all the meaning, but it yields an interesting and transportable portion of it.",
        "The work reported here addresses two major problems.",
        "First, the knowledge associated with a concept does not always give necessary and sufficient conditions for deciding whether an object falls under the concept name.",
        "The problem is to find a systematic way of predicting which concepts can be reasoned about using first order logic directly and simply (as a conjunction of predicates) and which ones require default logic.",
        "Second, the cognitive model models the actual world, which is open and continuous (Hayes 85).",
        "The potential concepts and relations between them arc infinite.",
        "Nevertheless, humans manage to reason without cognitive overload.",
        "Can the computer model be systematically constrained using predictions paralleling those employed by humans in reasoning about the actual world?",
        "Consider the following database of facts (assertions) and axioms (definitions).",
        "The language used is irrelevant; any system isomorphic to first order logic will have the same deficiency."

        "(Rosch, et al. 76) (Smith and Medin 80).",
        "This view implies diversity of representations of predicate meanings across the lexicon.",
        "Some types of predicates will have criterial features, ODD NUMBER, others, such as names and natural kinds, LEMON, will not.",

        "Further, in KL-ONE, since the descriptions are meant to be defining, non-defining associated information is not encoded.",

        "ELEPHANT can have features \"forgetful\", \"lumbering\" and so forth, without claiming that all elephants have those features.",
        "Another implication of the prototype model is that the content of features is seen as essentially limitless.",
        "In contrast, the semantic net model assumes that there is a manageable set of primitive concepts whose size is much smaller that that of the English lexicon, that these arc explicitly connected.",
        "In KT, only ontological relationships are stated as rules.",
        "The relationships between specific descriptions can be derived through problem-solving, but is not encoded.",

        "In KT, that both have a color is stated in the kind type PHYSICAL OBJECT, but that they both have the same color is reasoned at run time.",

        "By overriding inherent features, KT gets around the cancellation problem which arises when features are viewed as logically necessary.",
        "If \"has four legs\" is taken to be a logically necessary feature, any three-legged elephant forces a contradiction, or special processing for exceptions (Braehman and Schtnolze 1985).",
        "'rho KT system accepts both facts as true, with no contradiction.",
        "This particular elephant has three legs, and elephants inherently have four legs.",
        "In attempting to match to both the textual and generic databases, the possibility of infinite recursion arises.",
        "This is true in principle for the human reasoner, as well.",
        "Kr prevents infinite recursion by limiting inferences to a depth of 5.",
        "Because of the feature typing, KT can answer queries as in (19).",
        "19) What color are the eggs?",
        "What function does the clinic have?",
        "Feature typing classifies \"brown\" as of type COLOR.",
        "When KT looks first at the translation of the text to see 'whether it contains an assertion winch states a color for the eggs, it must distinguish the facts in the text which are relevant to the feature type queried.",
        "With respect to Sample Text, in order for KT to answer 'What color are the eggs?\", KT must know that \"brown\" is a COLOR.",
        "Without feature types, KT would not contrast \"white\" with \"brown\".",
        "KT deduces sets of facts, as well as individual facts.",
        "When queried for a type of feature, such as FUNCTION, KT responds with all functions listed for a sort.",
        "For example, clinics prototypically have both outpatient and emergency functions, and Kr lists both when queried for function, For sorts which are structural, that is, concrete objects and institutions, KT is able to describe the structure.",
        "If asked \"What structure does the clinic have?\", KT answers that typically it has a hierarchy of head-assistant-clientele and has roles of doctor for head, nurse for assistant and patient for clientele.",
        "Similarly, if asked \"What structure does the fish haver, KT answers, inherently it has these parts: fins, 1 tail, 1 head, 2 eyes, scales.",
        "When KT lists parts, bare plurals mean an unspecified number greater than one.",
        "IV.5 Kind 'types The kind types are useful in both parsing and inferene-ing for text understanding.",
        "In the parsing phase, kind types can be used four ways.",
        "First, verb sense ambiguity can be resolved by the kind types of subject and object head nouns.",
        "In a sentence with the verb take, knowing that the subject is a vehicle forces the choice of the one sense of the verb, and knowing that it is a human forces another.",
        "Secondly, RI' can reason the other way around, and use selection restrictions on verbs to infer the kind types entities referred to in the sentence, Consider sentence (20).",
        "20) ABC sued the man.",
        "Using kind types for selection restrictions, KT infers that the entity named ABC is a SENTIENT.",
        "Given the further information in (21), KT infers that ABC is an INSTITIMON and not a PERSON, because the verb join requires an INSTITUTION as object.",
        "21) The man had joined ABC illegally.",
        "Thirdly, certain anaphoric references can be resolved using kind types.",
        "When verb selection restrictions classify the entity referred to by a pronoun as in a certain kind type, then possible antecedents are correspondingly constrained.",
        "Consider the relationships in (22).",
        "It corefers with milk because, when intransitive, spill requires a LIQUID as subject.",
        "22) The cat drank the milk.",
        "It spilled, Fourthly, attachment ambiguities for prepositional phrases can be resolved using kind types.",
        "Consider sentence (23).",
        "23) John bought the lock in the afternoon.",
        "It is syntactically possible for the prepositional phrase in the afternoon to modify the lock, the verb phrase or the whole sentence.",
        "Since afternoon is in the kind type TEMPORAL, KT can resolve this syntactic ambiguity, and attach the prepositional phrase so that it modifies the whole sentence (Dahlgren and McDowell, 1986).",
        "IV.6 Summary of Inference Mechanism In summary, predications used to derive inferences in the text are found in five aspects of common-sense knowledge:",
        "a) Ontological Schema b) Verb and adjective selection restrictions c) Generic Information d) Typing Information e) Kind types",
        "In using KT, queries drive these inferences.",
        "After a text such as the Sample Text has been read, KT can respond to queries and seem to understand the text in a more human-like way using the various aspects of knowledge indicated above.",
        "Below are listed some queries and responses.",
        "A: The man who lives in the town.",
        "--Prototypical town has people living in it.",
        "---Prototypical male person is a man (not a boy).",
        "Q: Was the town built?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "---By ontology of artifacts Q: Who built the town.",
        "A: People, By ontology of artifacts Q: Does John wear pants?",
        "A: Probably so.",
        "---By prototype database.",
        "Q: Does John eat eggs.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "---Because eggs are food.",
        "Q: What does health think?",
        "A: Health doesn't think.",
        "---By kind types.",
        "Q: Does John look like a clinic?",
        "A: No.",
        "---By ontology database.",
        "Q: Does John live in a'tent?",
        "A: Probably not.",
        "---By prototype of town Q: Does John have a function?",
        "A: Yes, By kind types IV.",
        "Basis for the Commonsense Knowledge Results in linguistic research underline the importance of category distinctions, such as those between abstract and concrete objects, and persons as opposed to other objects.",
        "These actively affect sentence interpretation and generation.",
        "The sentence \"The rock read the book\" must either be interpreted as anomalous or metaphorical because only persons read.",
        "These constraints provide an empirical basis for the ontology.",
        "Cognitive psychological research provides a further basis for the ontology.",
        "Kell's work on ontological categorization in cognitive development was consulted in constructing the schema (Keil 79).",
        "Gelman and Spelke's results suggested placing SENTIENT higher in the schema (Gelman and Spelke 81).",
        "Graesser and Clark's studies were the basis of the verb ontology (Graesser & Clark, 1985).",
        "Psycholinguistic research in the prototype theory provided descriptions of the actual prototypes shared by English-speakers for a number of these categories (Rosch, et al. 76) (Dahlgren 85).",
        "The ontological schema was developed in two steps.",
        "First, the verbs from the corpus of geography texts were classified according to selectional restrictions (SRs) on subjects and objects.",
        "Second, the minimal categories needed to accomodate these SRs were arranged in a hierarchical schema.",
        "Certain SRs, such as HUMAN, ANIMATE, CONCRETE, were expected.",
        "Others were surprises.",
        "Some verbs required complements that were marked for PLACE, and others required either subjects or objects to have certain moveability features.",
        "These are summarized below.",
        "STATIONARY: normally immobile, attached to the earth, moved only at great effort.",
        "SELFMOVING: normally in motion or designed for motion, in some cases with no apparent initial source.",
        "NONSELFMOVING: normally immobile but can be moved with slight effort.",
        "A source for the motion is expected, usually something SELFMOVING.",
        "One other interesting result from this stage of the project is that a number of verbs take either a PROPOSITIONAL or a SENTIENT subject.",
        "Both a book and a person can say something.",
        "Once the set of categories had been established, the next stage was fitting them into a hierarchy from which inheritance of features could be computed by KT.",
        "There were several constraints guiding this process.",
        "First, we wanted the ontology to be as compact as possible.",
        "Second, we wished to minimize nonexistent leaf nodes.",
        "Third, we preferred that the system infer too little than too much.",
        "During this process it was also necessary to decide which of the SRs represented true category cuts in an ontological schema and which were merely features on individual lexical items.",
        "The guiding principle here was that if the distinction under examination (i.e. ANIMATE/INANIMATE) pervaded some subtree, then it was assigned to a branching point.",
        "But if some distinction was needed in isolated parts of the tree, then it was represented as a feature.",
        "For instance, we found that the INDIVIDUAL/COLLECTIVE distinction pervades the lexicon and must be a primary cut in the ontology.",
        "Many verbs select only INDIVIDUAL (mingle) or only COLLECTIVE (stampede) subjects or objects.",
        "Properties which were assigned feature status were items like EDIBLE and SIZE.",
        "The NATURAL/SOCIAL distinction was placed high on the tree because human intervention pervades the world.",
        "All abstract entities are products of the human mind, but every category of real entities, including events and states, contains dozens of examples of the products of society.",
        "We therefore reserved the term ARTIFACT for inanimate man-made objects to distinguish them from natural inanimate objects.",
        "'rile SENTIENT/PHYSICAL distinction is also fairly high.",
        "SENTIENT is often placed as a subordinate of ANIMATE, but in commonsense reasoning, the properties of people and things are very different.",
        "'Die NATURAL/SOCIAL distinction applies to SENTIENT just as it does to PHYSICAL.",
        "A NATURAL, SENTIENT entity is a PERSON, that is a mats, woman, boy, girl, whereas a SOCIAL, SENTIENT entity is a ROLE, secretary, miner, president.",
        "A collection of PERSON is a BODY, crowd, mob, A collection of ROLE is an INSTITUTION, hospital, school.",
        "The INDIVIDUAL/COLLECTIVE cut had to be made at the level of ENTITY (the highest level) at the same place as the ABSTRACT/REAL cut.",
        "This was not the only place where multiple distinctions applied (see Figure 1), Our term COLLECTIVE applies to all collections of entities, classified into three subgroups.",
        "True collectives are sets in which each member of the set is identical to all the others (herct, mob, crowd, fleet).",
        "Masses are collections whose members are referred to only in terms of measurable",
        "units (sand water), Finally, there arc structures where the members have specified relations, such as in institutions (school, company, village).",
        "It was consideration of both the constraints listed above, and the assignments of SRs to feature or node status that led us to abandon both binary branching and planar trees as useful representational devices.",
        "While it was possible to model some distinctions as binary, others required more than two branches.",
        "For example, ABSTRACT entities which divided into IDEAL, PROPOSITIONAL, QUANTITY, and IRREAL, all of which have equivalent status as Sits.",
        "We were still faced with the fact that many entities still seemed to straddle the hierarchy.",
        "Is an individual human a PRIMA'T'E or a PERSON, or both?",
        "Is a hospital an INSTITUTION or a PLACE, or both?",
        "If we were to establish a hierarchy which would reflect these differences, we would pad up with a very large and unwieldy schema with huge gaps.",
        "Therefore, we decided on multiple attachment for those entities which reouired it.",
        "This decision was justified as well by examination of the texts which revealed that a human ming was generally dealt within a context as either a person or a physiological being, but rarely as both at the same time.",
        "Figure III gives examples of some nouns, their assignment to categories and rules by which terminal nodes in the schema are generated from higher-level nodes.",
        "Figure III shows only a few examples of terminal nodes in the schema.",
        "However, every path through the ontology results in a terminal node which is named and which represents a unique class defined by inheritance of features up the tree.",
        "Terminal node names distinguish the individuals from the collectives.",
        "For instance, the collective node corresponding to PLANT is FLORA.",
        "The individual node corresponding to DISCOURSE is PROPOSITION.",
        "Similarly, STUFF is the collective of MINERAL, INSTITUTION is the collective of ROLF, and BODY is the collective of PERSON, etc.",
        "The types of features which occurred in the data at each node in the ontology were the basis of the kind types.",
        "It is an empirical fact that feature types are correlated in relation to ontological classifications.",
        "At each node in the ontology is a kind type encoding certain sets of properties that any entity classified at that node may have.",
        "Inheritance up the tree ensures that any lower node has all the properties of higher nodes on a single path to ENTITY.",
        "For each property at a node, a set of values applies.",
        "While the values for items such as COLOR are fairly obvious, we have had to construct value ranges elsewhere.",
        "For SIZE, we have started with the set (microscopic, tiny, small, handleable, medium, large, huge, building-sized, skyscraper sized, mountainous, region-sized).",
        "which is a reality-oriented scale to be applied loosely.",
        "The kind types were extracted empirically from the generic data after all the features were typed, by inspection of types of features associated with sorts and predicates at each node of the ontology.",
        "The texts in the corpus describe lifestyle and industry in various countries, Generic descriptions of the nouns ill the text were drawn from the psycholinguistic literature, to the extent possible.",
        "((Bosch 76); (Ashcraft 76); (Dahlgren 85)).",
        "For ROLE, we used generic descriptions of social roles collected by Dahlgren and partially published in (Dahlgren 85).",
        "For PHYSICAL we used generic descriptions from (Ashcraft 76).",
        "For those nouns where no data existed, generic descriptions were created conforming to the types of information generated by subjects for similar nouns.",
        "We do not consider this a defect of our system, since we are not trying to argue for the psychological reality of any particular generic description, but merely for the efficacy of a reasoning system which uses them.",
        "The decision to place features in the prototype list or the inherent list for a sort or predicate was decided by two judges.",
        "It is a research goal to verify judgments experimentally.",
        "Conclusion In conclusion, KT encodes an ontology which models the top level of typical English speaker's cognitive model of the actual world.",
        "It employs several different types of information to reason in human-like ways about text that it reads.",
        "lit addition to the ontology, it uses vet b selection restrictions and generic information associated with concepts.",
        "By employing systematic constraints in the form of kind types associated with nodes in the ontology, KT reasons efficiently.",
        "All of the information KT uses is drawn from empirical studies of human cognitive psychology, linguistics or the corpus of text which KT reads.",
        "Because of this empirical basis, and the breadth of the ontology, KT is a transportable system which is potentially useful for understanding any text of a general, literal nature."
