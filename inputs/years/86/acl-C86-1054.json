        "We consider interpersonal communication as joint activity of LI agents (X and Y).",
        "Each agent has his own plan of behaviour which is represented here by a system of goals (G.X or G.Y), i.e.certain pragmatic and communicative tasks to be realized.",
        "The system of goals of the agent, for instance,G.X, may contain both the goals initiated by X himself and the goals initiated by his partner Y.",
        "Formation of the system of goals by the agent X is associated with the two following communicative metagoals: kl is an inclusion of a goal g into the partner's system of goals G.Y; -k2 is an inclusion of a goal g into X's own system of goals G.X.",
        "Language interaction is considered as a process aimed at accomplishing one of these metagoals.",
        "Each agent chooses a mode of achieving metagoals in response to socially determined relations between him and his partner.",
        "These relations are described by a system of contracts ( [1],[2],[3]).",
        "In this paper we propose a formal description of some elementary contracts formed by combination of basic relations between the partners."

      "text": [
        "In order to describe agents' positions with respect to a potential goal g we introduce three indices being individual for each agent: -INT(X,g) is a degree of X's interest (necessity, desirability) in achieving the goal g; this index may be either positive or negative; -CST(X,g) is a cost of achieving the goal g, i.e. the efforts to be made by X for achieving g; this index is always positive; -BEN(X,g) is a benefit which may be derived by X from achieving g; BEN(X,g)=INT(X,g)-CST(X,g).",
        "We consider some threshold t which,in general case, should be exceeded by BEN(X,g) (BEN(X,g)>t) for including the goal g into the X's system of goals.",
        "The value t of this threshold is individual for each agent in different communicative situation.",
        "The values of these indices are generated under the influence of different psychological, ethical, pragmatical and other factors.",
        "The degree of importance of each factor is determined by individual characteristics of each agent and may vary during the LI-process.",
        "Hence the values of relevancy indices may also vary."

        "In order to map contracts onto communicative level of the LI we introduce several types of elementary contracts formed by combination of basic domination and dependency relations between the partners.",
        "These relations control over the process of forming the system of goals, i.e. they influence upon the choice of the mode of achieving the metagoals.",
        "The domination relation fixes LI agent's \"rights\" and \"duties\" in achieving metagoal ki, i.e. in including a goal into the partner's system of goals.",
        "Dependency controls over achieving the metagoal k2.",
        "The \"rights\" and \"duties\" of the agent in the process of goal formation are represented by a set of rules known to both the agents.",
        "These rules belong to a set M which represents the agents' mutually coordinated beliefs about the world.",
        "3.2.",
        "Elementary contracts of the first type are based on the domination of X over Y for all the goals of the class G'.",
        "This relation allows X to oblige Y to include any goal g(EG' into Y's system of goals, if the proposition UEN(V,g)>ti belongs to the set M, ti being the minimum value of index BEN(Y,g) which is necessary for X to achieve the metagoal kl=(gEG.Y.).",
        "The value of ti is determined by the whole complex of constituents of complete contract which determines the level of cooperation, i.e.the degree of coordination of agents' actions, coincidence or conflict of their interests.",
        "So, provided that (X>Y,G',ti), EEG' and BEN(Y,g)>ti, it is sufficient for X to let Y know of metagoal kl= (g<EG.Y) being included in the system G.X for the goal g to be included into the Y's system of goals.",
        "The second type of elementary contracts is characterized by the absence of domination of X over Y (1),Y,G',t2): in general case it is not sufficient for X to let Y know of metagoal kl=(gEG.Y) being included in G.X.",
        "For X another way of achieving kl based on the values of some other constituents of the contract should he chosen.",
        "3.3.",
        "Elementary contracts which regulate achievement of the metagoal k2 are based on the dependency relation: (X<Y,W,t3) .",
        "If X depends on Y, it is necessary for him to get Y's permission for inclusion of a goal gEiG' into the X's system of goals, or the proposition BEN(Y,g<;(3.X)>t3 should belong to the set M, where t3 is the necessary value of index BEN for Y to include a goal into his system of goals.",
        "The absence of dependency (X0,0',t4) allows X to include any goal gE G' into his system of goals without Y's permission.",
        "But the index BEN(Y,gEG.X) has to exceed the value t4 being determined by the level of cooperation between the partners.",
        "3.4.",
        "The basic relations aren't mutually exclusive or interdependent: the domination of X over Y in the class G' doesn't exclude the domination of Y over X in the same class G' and doesn't presuppose the Y's dependency on X.",
        "The complete contract includes decomposition of the set of potential goals into classes, for each of which the given relations are defined on the part of X as well as on the part of Y."

        "These aspects of goal formation reflect some social and psychological roles of the LI agents.",
        "It is convenient for us to consider LI to be aimed at forming agents' systems of goals in order to map \"rights\" and \"duties\" of agents onto communicative level and to state possibility or/and necessity of a certain type of speech acts in the process of goal formation.",

        "If it is necessary for X to use additional information, the type of speech act performed by X is determined by the type of information to be chosen in accordance with the type of contract: neutral and cooperative contracts allow X to use only plus-stimulus, that is X performs a speech act of the type \"temptation\".",
        "Conflicting contract allows X to perform a speech act \"threat\" which is characterized by use of minus-stimulus.",
