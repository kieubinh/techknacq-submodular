        "We call those sentences text data.",
        "Next we get the source side and the sink side pattern of relations for each word appearing in the text data.",
        "Then we calculate a distance between words.",
        "The distance is defined as a correspondence between the patterns themselves and the frequency of each relation making the patterns.",
        "Words are classified by a clustering algorithm using this distance.",
        "The distance has two types; one for the source side patterns and the other for the sink side patterns.",
        "For each word, two clustering processes are applied corresponding to those two types of distances.",
        "In this paper, the dependency structure is called as the knowledge base."

        "There are many compound words in Japanese sentences which are made by combining words and act as one word.",
        "They are called Uukugogo in Japanese.",
        "If we treat them all as different from each other, many words appear rarely, so that the relating patterns of each word cannot be captured sufficiently.",
        "Because of this reason, we adopted a mechanism that replaces compound words by a normal one including the same meaning grammatical roles in grammar as the former.",
        "This mechanism can work automatically as a part of the system.",
        "As the result of this experiment,it was observed as expected that semantically related words tend to be combined.",
        "However, some words which have different meaning are combined with a well classified word group, and several well classified groups are combined.",
        "Not only synonyms, but also the words similar in some parts as the extension of the words, and also the words which have a common part in the upper concept tend to be combined.",
        "It is interesting that antonyms tend to be combined with each other.",
        "It was also found that words contained in the same group belong to the same part of speech almost always.",
        "John opened the door with this key SUB,]",
        "a)There is a problem that the long sentence with many Bunsetu often makes too many combinations of relation candidates.",
        "b)There are some cases that no result is obtained because only a part of words does not have a relation candidates although all of others have the correct relations.",
        "c)It is difficult to describe a parallel relation using relations between two words.",
        "Therefore, it is difficult to analyze a sentence containing parallel relations.",
        "d)The rate at which the analysis succeeds depends on the length of the sentence.",
        "As the sentence becomes longer, the rate becomes lower.",
        "The average of the rate was about 40 per cent.",

        "Effect of the relation Matrix Using this matrix,the ground for judging propriety of the relations becomes wider and the number of candidates can be effectively reduced.",
