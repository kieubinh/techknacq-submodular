        "The application of an English pronunciation rule is lexically determined, that is to say, is restricted to a generally arbitrary subset of the lexicon (compare, for example, the values of <ea> in the sets I bread, head, thread...t and I knead, bead, heat... 1 ).",
        "It is for this reason that many English-based systems include very extensive dictionaries, for example the pioneering work of Allen [21 with a 12000 morpheme lexicon.",
        "On the other hand, German rules have in general a much wider scope of application, which has led researchers working in the field of German to consider large lexical inventories unnecessary.",
        "The inventories in e.g. SAMT [3] or SPRAUS-VS CC are thus restricted to function words needed for the syntactic analysis (prepositions, pronouns, articles, etc.).",
        "Similarly, our earliest efforts in this area were based",
        "on a small lexicon and an extensive rule catalogue; however, numerous incorrect transcriptions at morphological boundaries and the frequent recurrence to ad-hoc rules (cf. [1]) made the lack of some sort of morphological indicator apparent.",
        "However more closely German spelling may reflect pronunciation than is the case in English, difficulties arise in producing a correct pronunciation automatically if knowledge available to the human speaker, such as the internal structure of a given word or its native as opposed to foreign origin, is not made use of.",
        "The following examples should suffice to demonstrate the relationship between morphology and the values of the written symbols: One fundamental rule is that vocalic quantity is determined by the number of following consonants: the first rule given in the DUDEN Aussprache-wOrterbuch [5] states that <a> is to be pronounced /a:/ when followed by only one consonant grapheme before the stem boundary, so that the inflectional form rast of the verb radon (\"rush\") becomes /ra:st/, whereas the simplex noun Rast (\"rest\") becomes /rast/.",
        "- Consonant or vowel groups may be assigned digraph or trigraph value only when they appear within morphological boundaries; compare for example the different values of <sch> in ldschen If/ (\"extinguish\") and lidschen /sc/ (dim.",
        "of \"pants\"), or of <ei> in Geier mai/ (\"vulture\") and geirrt /all/ (\"erred\").",
        "The first stem syllable in German (native stock) receives the primary word stress, a rule which implies this stem's being identifiable; compare geben /'ge:bn/ (\"give\") and Gebein /ga 'bain/ (\"bones\").",
        "These phenomena play a role in the domain of derivation and inflection, which has been dealt with in several systems, e.g. SYNTEX [6] or REDE [7]; these do contain lists of common prefixes and suffixes to permit affix-stripping, although they are predominantly rule-based.",
        "The same problems are found in the field of composition; their import is heightened by the very great frequency of this process in the German language.",
        "Still, Rilhl [6] proposes a decomposition algorithm which relies on distributional criteria and on lists of consonant clusters in initial and final position (based on Kiistner [8]).",
        "Other authors too prefer to minimize the lexical component: \"The attempt to incorporate this problem into a mainly rule-based system seemed to us to require a rather great and thus undesired step towards a kind of dictionary approach\" ([9], p.226).",
        "It is however certainly possible to make a case for a morphological analysis containing a morph-lexicon of some depth.",
        "The conversion program presented here makes extensive use of such an analysis component (see fig. 1) and thus in our opinion profits from the following advantages: inflection, derivation, and composition can be treated simultaneously, more economically, and with a reduced number of incorrect segmentations; this latter is achieved by specifying the respective environments of potential elements; simple and efficient treatment of exceptions, for instance the pronunciation of foreign words; this and the preceding result in a reduced transcription error rate and in simplified and more transparent grapheme-to-phoneme conversion rules; correct placement of word-internal boundaries, labelling of the constituents and the lexically stored information concerning native vs. foreign status favour accurate word stress assignment; the lexicon-based approach prepares the ground for word classification and extraction of certain syntactic constraints, providing the input for an elementary sentence parser."

        "A number of practical conventions has been set up for the form of the lemma: a given morph is represented by a maximum of ten lower-case letters ; the diacritic sign \" (umlaut) is made use of (cf. other systems which decompose the vowels in question as <ae>,<oe>,<ue>); likewise, the sign <13> is not replaced by <es> either in the input text or in the lexicon.",
        "An orthographic rule of German states that <ss> becomes <13> before a consonant or a word-boundary, so that the latter sign's usual function as an indicator of vowel length is neutralized in these positions (compare Fliisse \"rivers\" vs. Fu/3e \"feet\" with P1u13 (Ad) vs. FuE (/u:/)); this \"defect\" (cf. [10], p.108) can be got round by maintaining the opposition between Cue> and <13> in the lemma.",
        "The information-tree contains classificatory data pertaining to the morph itself and to those it may immediately select; they concern morphological status ( lexical stem - particle - derivational morph inflectional morph - juncture -...), native or foreign status, and combinatorial restrictions.",
        "In addition, the lexicon allows the introduction of information for the assignment to parts of speech and, wherever necessary, indications as to exceptional pronunciation or stress pattern.",
        "3.1.2.",
        "Extent of the Lexical Inventory At present the lexical inventory comprises some 2000 entries, the choice of which was based on Ortmann [11], itself compiled from four frequency lists.",
        "As for the contents of the entries, we relied on Auget [12], Mater [13], and Wahrig 1141.",
        "For the ongoing testing, revision, and supplementing of this primary list we depend on the frequency list in Meier [15] as well as on sample texts from various random sources.",
        "Inasmuch as affixes, particles, and junctures (at least native ones) constitute closed classes, they should be represented exhaustively in the inventory.",
        "This is unfortunately not the case as soon as one turns to foreign elements, to whose number are always being added new candidates.",
        "Moreover, it is very difficult if not impossible to establish general principles according to which foreign suffixes in particular may be isolated and the dividing line found between stem and suffix.",
        "Proper nouns are represented only to a very limited extent; their range should be adapted to the requirements of the task at hand.",
        "In fact, the compilation of the inventory has been carried out with the aims of expandability and maximum flexibility.",
        "It is of course not to be expected that the lexicon would ever cover the entire vocabulary of a native speaker, nor is that our intention; consequently, we foresee a \"joker morph\" which can stand for any stem that may happen to occur.",
        "This is made possible",
        "by the generalization that a German stem conforms to a number of structural principles: for example, every stem must contain a vowel and the variety of consonant clusters in initial, medial, and final position is restricted (cf. [8]).",
        "An even more general canonical description can be exploited in the case of foreign elements.",
        "Such a device has not yet been implemented.",

        "Specification of these properties is optional; however, the more information provided, the more restrictions with respect to the general structure formula are achieved, so that the number of potential labellings is reduced and the labellinga themselves bear more information.",
        "Thus, it is possible to provide at least a partial treatment for words whose stems are not represented in the 2000 entry lexicon.",
        "Should no match be obtained in this step, the process is repeated with a new segmentation until compatible sets of features are found.",

        "Although extensive tests on large corpora have not as yet been carried out, experiments with our current system permit evaluation of following aspects of the morphological analysis component in GRAPHON: - The development of the phonological component has shown that the setting up of a catalogue of pronunciation rules became simpler and more systematic, and at the same time, the rate of transcription errors could be greatly reduced.",
        "- A relatively limited number of lexical entries is capable of handling a considerable quantity of running text.",
        "The morphological information stored in each entry has proved to be relevant and in general sufficient for correct segmentation.",
        "However, in order to increase accuracy in determining lexical class, as required by the syntactic analysis, it would be advantageous to expand the number of categories represented in the lexicon entries.",
        "As it was not clear before the present tests exactly which additional classification would be useful, we chose to start from a minimum and provide for easy future expansion.",
        "For example, the experiments confirm our assumption that it would be desirable to specify the potential junctures for a given stem and to differentiate several inflectional paradigms within a lexical class, in particular strong and weak verbs.",
        "These data would have resolved the ambiguities encountered for the sample words in Fig. 2.",
        "- As the aims of our system do not include any attempt to incorporate semantics and as moreover there is no feedback from the syntactic component planned, a unique structural specification cannot be expected in the case of ambiguities requiring reference to these structural levels.",
        "Since such ambiguities do not necessarily lead to incorrect grammatical specification and only rarely to incorrect pronunciation, this is only a relative limitation.",
        "Correctness of the phonemic transcription certainly accounts for a great part of the quality and acceptability of a text-to-speech system.",
        "Nevertheless it is often claimed (e.g. [6]) that synthetic speech should be evaluated along further dimensions, such as intelligibility, listening comprehension and naturalness.",
        "One goal of the approach presented here is to lay the ground for the incorporation of rules for the assignment and realization of stress and intonation patterns not only on the word but also on the sentence level.",
        "Thus the basic phonetic transcription will be extended and modified so as to give a representation closer to natural speech."
