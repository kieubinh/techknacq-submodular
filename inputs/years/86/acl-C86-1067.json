        "In this approach, the segmentation which contains the least number of Bunsetsu is most likely to be correct.",
        "The authors have modified this method to improve the correctness of segmentation by changing the counting unit from the number of Bunsetsu to the sum of the weighted morphemes.",
        "The weights of morphemes are basically defined as 1 for each independent word and 0 for each dependent word.",
        "Since a Bunsetsu is usually composed of an independent word and some dependent words, the sum of the weights of a sentence is roughly equal to the number of Bunsetsu in the sentence.",
        "While the least bunsetsu number ignores the contents of the Bunsetsu, the new method evaluates the components of the Bunsetsu to achieve more realistic segmentation.",
        "The weights morphemes were modified based on empirical statistical data.",
