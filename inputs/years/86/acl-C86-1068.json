        "In every application that concerns the automatic processing of natural language, the problem of the dictionary size is posed.",
        "We can approach this important question in several ways and particularly : - By grouping together the common prefixes of the different language words.",
        "In the PIAF system,(interactive program for French Analysis) for instance, words are represented in chained lists following an alphabetical order [COUR 77]",
        "- By creating multiple dictionaries: one for each major topic area.",
        "This approach requires, in addition, a common base dictionary.",
        "When a particular area is concerned, a temporary master dictionary is created by increasing the base dictionary with selected local ones.",
        "- By using the Affix analysis which consists in performing a morphological analysis in order to identify, in a given word, the redundant elements (Affixes).",
        "The dictionary will be limited to the non-redundant elements (roots).",
        "This technique is used specially in the DEC10 - SPELL system for detecting and correcting spelling errors.",
        "In the present paper,, we will develop this last approach for the non_diacritical Arabic.",
        "The particularities of the algorithms that we propose, stem, in great part, form the specificities of the language used :",
        "- Words are written in consonantic form - Words can contain infixes - Morphological structures can be altered by linguistic transformations.",

        "The Affix analysis consists in decomposing a given word into its first elements among which we can distinguish the affixes (prefix, infix and suffix) which are the redundant elements of the language and the root which is its non redundant one .",
        "Let V be a finite Set and V*, the set of words built on V including nul sing noted 0",
        "This decomposition is based on the derivational structure of the language : nearly all the words are obtained by adding an affix combination to a given root.",

        "Among the possible affix combinations, we distinguish those that are valid and those that are not.",
        "Valid combinations constitute what is called Morphological Pattern (M P) For a given word, the number of possible morphological decompositions depends on the root, according to whether or not it contains characters which can he assimilated to different affixes.",

        "transformations",
        "The morphological derivation for a root can be accompanied with transformations caused by linguistic phenomena such as assimilation, contraction, metathisis.",
        "These transformations can affect the Root as well as the affixes (M P).",
        "The Roots affected are mainly those which contain the characters yaa : s, Waw : j and hamza :",
        "The morphological transformations can be classified into two categories : - The morpho-phonological transformation are those that substitute a character for another one without changing the length of the word (isometrical transformations)-(see EX1 and EX2).",
        "- The purely phonological transformations are those that suppress one or more characters, therefore they modify the length of the word.",
        "Those transformations are a source ofambiguity for the morphological decomposition.",
        "To remove these ambiguities, we use heuristics among which we can mention for instance : Let D be the morphological derivations operator such as :D(R,P,I,S) =W wev and T the operator composed of a derivation followed by a transformation.",
        "And D the morpyolOgical decomposition operator (inverse of D) and T the morphological decomposition operator taking into account the transformational rules (inverse of T).",
        "Consider W the word to be analysed.",
        "The affix analysis is composed of two modules (See Fig.",
        "I) :",
        "- morphological decomposition module - validation module 1.",
        "The morphological decomposition module",
        "permits to identify the different affix combinations.",
        "It is executed in two steps : Step one : identification of prefixes and suffixes by uiTg a table of prefixes and a table of suffixes.",
        "Step two : Identification of the infix by anaysing the remaining chain after eliminating P and s. The analyser has m. single initial.",
        "state and as many ways as there are infix possibilities.",
        "The interest of realising this decomposition into two steps lies in the use of a single analyser in order to recognise all the morphological forms.",
        "we distinguish different morphological Patterns . 2.",
        "Validation module",
        "The two preceding steps lead to a list of candidate decompositions.it is necessary to apply to this list an adequate validation mechanism to sort out the valid decomposition This filtering can provide multiple solutions.",
        "In these conditions, we talk about morphological ambiguity that can not be removed without considering the context of the word in the sentence.",
        "However, the affix analysis used for the purpose of verifying whether or not a word belongs to the language can be content with the first valid decomposition,",
        "The validation is based on the principle of affix congruity and on the result of the root dictionary checking.",
        "The affix congruity arises at three different levels : - Compatibility between the prefix (P) and the suffix (S)",
        "- Compatibility between the couple (P,g) the infix (I).",
        "- Compatibility between the Morphological Pattern (P,I,S) and the Root (R)",
        "Tlv compatibility between P andS is obtained from elements (21 prefixes and 29 sutfi.les).",
        "The values the affix congruity matrix C (P;,S.) composed of 609 attributed to a couple (P.,S.)",
        "are :",
        "The compatibility between (P., S,) and the infix I is obtained by performing thelintarsection of the Morphological Code (MC) generated by the analyser with the set of Morphological Codes associated with the couple (P.,S.)",
        ".",
        "This set or list is referred to by Nk.",

        "The detection of this incompatibility requires flagging the dictionary for eadb, root with its leRal non-systematic morphological patterns (ex derived verb forms ,Imasdar.",
        ", same nouns).",
        "The dictionary lookup permits to verify whether the word analysalbelongs to the linguistic corpus or not.",
        "It plays a decisive part in identifying the valid root if the analysis, for one morphological pattern, generates several candidate roots.",
        "(nondeterministic analysis).",
        "Our root dictionary being used has been built'by taking census of the roots related to the linguistic corpus of the Maghreb Countries.",
        "This corpus has been done by the Permanent Commission of Functional Arabic [ P C F A 76 J The size of the obtained dictionary is about 1,500 three-character roots and 100 four - character roots Its increase can easily be done thanks to its evolutionary structure.",
        "A,,ces to this dictionary is direct.",
        "The access argument is calculated from the first three characters of the root and its length L. V - CONCLUSION The affix analysis permits to replace an important dictionary containing roots only.",
        "This technique has proved efficient for Arabic because of its derivational structure.",
        "We have tested this technique on a corpus made up of 100,000 words or so using the dictionary of the 1,600 roots.",
        "The programs are written in FORTRAN for reasons of portability, easy calculation of the Dictionary access argument and index manipulation.",
        "Used in the context of the detection and correction of spelling errors, the affix analysis is interesting in that : - It makes easier the use of the dictionary loaded in memory - It performs a natural cutting of the words, which facilitates the algorithms of automatic correcting based on inferential mechanisms and heuristics These features give the suggested algorithms some originality and a contribution tb the work in the field of Arabic morphological analysis."
