        "Lieven Jaspaert Kathol eke Universiteit Leuven (Belgium) I wish to put the theory and metatheory currently adopted in the Eurotra project (Arno06) into a historical perspective, indicating where and why changes to its basic design for a transfer-based MT (TBMT) system have been made.",
        "1.",
        "A basic model for comparing TBMT theories,",
        "Let T. be some theory of representation, inducing sets of representations R. and R, for languages L, and L., (seen as sets of texts), respectively.",
        "Transfer-based translation is described as follows:",
        "where AN, GEN and TAR are binary relations, and IRA is the composition of AN, TRF and GEN, i.e.",
        "(i) AN x L. x R., GEN n R, x Lt, TAR s R. x R, (ii) TRA .",
        "AN 0 TRF 0 GEN",
        "We also need to introduce two parameters, viz. stratification and dimensionality, to characterise hypotheses about T. A theory (e.g. for the AN relation) is multistratal when it consists of a set of subtheories (tl,t2,...,trO, each characterising a set of representation R,, such that",
        "(iii) AN = AN, a AN2 AN,, (iv) AN, C. L. x R,, AN2 c R, x R2,",
        "AN, cJ x R..",
        "Otherwise, a theory is monostratal.",
        "A theory T is multidimensional when descriptions of linguistic objects along several linguistic dimensions are merged into one single representational object.",
        "The notion of linguistic dimension is meant to correspond to some organising principle for a theory of representation (e.g. constituency, grammatical relations, logical semantics, etc.).",
        "Otherwise, a theory is monodimensional, In what follows we describe the various Eurotra approaches to TBMT in terms of this basic model.",
        "1.",
        "The first Eurotra design; (Arbon], Initially, due to its GETA inheritance, Eurotra adhered to a monostratal multidimensional model for TBMT.",
        "Computationally, it was based on the Grenoble formalism of the generateur de structures (gds).",
        "Linguistically, it advocated a diluted form of dependency theory as a basis for TBMT.",
        "The observation that theoretical linguistics had been incapable of providing a practically applicable basis for translation had led Grenoble to build almost no linguistic commitment into the gds formalism.",
        "Every possible form of linguistic interpretation was to be expressed as an ordered tree with complex property lists on the nodes, which was manipulated by two basic operations, viz. tree transformations and lexical substitution.",
        "The BETA preoccupation with robustness, on the other hand, made them require that all linguistic information about texts should be merged into one single gds.",
        "On failure to compute parts of a deeper linguistic dimension, the intuition went, some clever algorithm could be used to extract from the gds an equivalent piece of representation on the next less pretentious dimension.",
        "The logical extreme of this reasoning was that, if all else failed, it should be possible to recover the original text from the gds.",
        "Grenoble, however, had perceived the usefulness of dependency theory (DT) for TBMT.",
        "There is a sense in which DT is a lexically oriented theory of language, and, in the end, translation is a question of getting the right translation for words.",
        "Nevertheless, the marriage between DT and the gds design led to (1) procrustinated linguistics, and",
        "(2) a formalism with untractable semantics.",
        "1.1.",
        "Mono,;tratal.",
        "The advocated representation theory was not stratified in any interesting sense.",
        "Rather, the whole burden of modularising the relation between text and representation was put on the translation of the relation into a procedure: discussions about clever linguistic strategies were long but were never brought to bear.",
        "The innovation of lArno833 was its attempt to derive requirements on T, from a set of more abstract principles, seen as a theory of MT providing a framework within which possible substantive theories for TBMT could be devised and compared.",
        "The weakness of the framework was to seek to motivate the tools inherited from BETA a-posteriori, Its merit was to be a partial theory of TBMT, independent of the inheritance.",
        "Its major concern was directed at elucidating the division of labour between AN, TAR and GEN, and at deriving implications on T, from this understanding.",
        "The pivotal principles of the framework that have survived the many face lifts of the Eurotra model are isoduidy and Q-differentiation, The principle of isoduiy allowed for a principled definition, in terms of properties of T“, of the domain of the GEN relation of some language in terms of the codomain of the AN relation for that mane language, thus indirectly defining the TRF relation.",
        "The principle of 0-differentiation required that T. should be sufficiently expressive to ensure that all meaning aspects of text that are relevant for-translation (called 'V) be represented in members of R. The two principles together provided a basis for designing a transfer device that was (1) developmentally simple, and (2) 0-preserving, These are necessary features of any multilingual MIT system striving for good-quality translation.",
        "1.2, Multidimensional.",
        "Despite its success in providing an initial framework for Eurotra, IArno83J failed dismally when it came to deriving from it a substantive linguistic representation theory.",
        "The failure was not unrelated",
        "to the absence of motivation for the GETA vestiges.",
        "The gds comprised a flat geometry and a rich decoration on the nodes.",
        "Given the requirement of merging, the geometry for all dimensions (text string, morphology, surface syntax, deep syntax, semantics) had to be very similar: this was only possible by making the geometry quite meaningless, and by putting the whole expressive burden on the labelling of nodes.",
        "The need to preserve surface word order (robustness) gave geometry its only interesting task: the representation of word order through the ordering of sister nodes.",
        "Within a merged approach, this requirement led to the arbitrary interdependence of the subtheories for the various linguistic dimensions.",
        "The problem was most tangible in the design of a suhtheory of T. for a semantic dimension.",
        "T. became unnecessarily complex and inconsistent.",
        "Given the absence of linguistic commitments built into the tools and the failure of the framework to answer substantive linguistic questions, debates about the relative merits of particular representational choices were inconclusive.",
        "We give an example of linguistic procrustination, Surface word order being represented by the order of sister nodes in the merged tree (the gds), tree geometry was seen as ordered.",
        "Thy geometry of dependency representations, on the other hand, are normally unordered.",
        "The way out was a refashioning of DT as a compromise between DT and P-theory with a single bar: a subset of the information about the governing node ace lowered into the sobtree representing its dependents and to require that the subtree be ordered conforming to the position of elements in the input text.",
        "This worked badly with all sorts of difficult linguistic phenomena: exocentric constructions (e.g. conjunction), gapping, discontinuity, long-distance dependencies, etc.",
        "Much of the linguistic research, than, was aimed et overcoming these problems in a principled way by means of a theory of empty elements.",
        "Although the latter was intuitively consistent, it caused such an increase in the complexity of the formalism that the latter defied any coherent formal characterisation.",
        "2, The second design: CArroflal.",
        "The first design was, amongst other things, unable to flesh out the problem of robustness.",
        "Combining a multidimensional representation with a basically all paths combinatorial algorithm led to the inability to rely on the actual computation of combinations of information required by the safety net algorithm.",
        "The second design (which was never formally accepted by the project) purported to solve this problem, without eliminating multidimensionality.",
        "It was multistratal and multidimensional.",
        "2.1, Hultistriltal.",
        "It was observed that the representations induced by T. had to meet two (possibly conflicting) requirements: (1) they had to have sufficient expressive power to allow for adequate translation via simple transfer, and (2) their computation had to be feasible.",
        "As a consequence, T. was split into two subtheories, T. and T,, were the former was directed at the needs of adequacy for simple transfer and the latter to the reliability of presence of a consistent representation from which either the more pretentious T. representation was reached or, alternatively, translation via less-simple transfer was possible.",
        "The model that emerged was the following: TRF.",
        "AN, 1 TRF, 1 GEN„ AN Rf,/f ------ Rt/f GEN AN, 1 1 PEN, L, TRA The motivation for this design hinged on (1) the fact that the f-stratum could make use of know-how in computational linguistics, (2) the f-stratum was a good starting point for innovative research on what T. should be for multilingual TENT, (3) the model gave content to the notion of safety nets (robustness), (4) developmental issues.",
        "The claim made was that with a monolithic T., the formulation of safety nets is hindered by the hybridity problem: their input domain could be any unpredictable combination of feasibly computable and adequate information on several dimensions in the gds.",
        "The new design provided the f-stratum as a more reliable basis for safe safety nets.",
        "2,2.",
        "Ne/tidipienional.",
        "This feature of the design did not change.",
        "Instead of one multidimensional representation, we now had two.",
        "No further attempt was made, however, to justify the use of multidimensional representations.",
        "3.",
        "The third de5i9p: CArno84biArno1151, Given the rejection of theoretical modularity on the basis of considerations of reliability of computation, the only course to take seemed to be to abandon the multidimensional view itself and to let the strata themselves represent linguistic dimensions.",
