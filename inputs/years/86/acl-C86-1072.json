Arnold/des Tombe/Jaspaert.1985 and the EUROTRA-REFERENCE MANUAL, version 1, revision 0).",

        "According to current EUROTRA legislation, these SRs are assigned to dictionary entries of verbs (and other word classes, which will be disregarded in this paper) by coders, and through these entries to clauses in a pattern matching process.",
        "This approach, while certainly valid in principle, leads to the problem of inter-coder-consistency, at least as long as the means for identifying SRs are paraphrase tests for SRs.",
        "In EUROTRA--D, we have for some time now been experimenting with a set of SRs, or PRs, which are identified with the help of syntactic criteria.",
        "This approach will be outlined in the following.",
