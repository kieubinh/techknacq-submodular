        "There are two aspects which play a role in the building of en MT-system: (1) the development of linguistic specifications and (2) the development of a formalism which allows for the implementation of linguistic results.",
        "This paper mainly deals with the first aspect and thus relates not only to EUROTRA but also at least to all stratificational systems, i.e. systems that break up the translation process into a sequence of simpler translation processes.",
        "Furthermore it relates at least to any system which uses dependency/valency information as e.g. LFG does with its functional structure.",
        "In EUROTRA, the level where information about dependency/valency is used is the ERS (Eurotra-Relational-Structure) which lies between the constituent structure (ECS) and the semantic interface structure (IS).",
        "So, in EUROTRA terms I try here to give a kind of ERS-definition in the language of empirical linguistics without touching the formalism itself.",
        "The investigation divides into three parts: (1) the sketch of a valency theory which comprises the following points: - the informal definition of the concepts valency, ccmplement,and adjunct, thereby trying to give a definition which holds for verbs, adjectives, nouns, and prepositions, - the operationalization of the oamplement adjunct distinction derived from this definition,",
        "- the classification of the complements, a subclassification of the complement classes (C-classes) according to their syntactic realization, and the determination of the relevant sentence patterns, - a short discussion of the relation of the dependency level to constituency level and from dependency level to semantic representation.",
        "(2) the application of the linguistic specifications to the problem of MT which has to investigate the role of dependency representation (D-representation) (or rather the role of the transitions to D-representation, since levels do not \"play a role\") in analysis and generation.",
        "(3) the way the gained linguistic information can be implemented according to the EUROTRA formalism.",
