        "That is, for two classes of languages to be interpretable by human being, there exists an interpreting procedure.",

        "(1) The theory of grammar",
        "We require an adjusted grammar to be suitable for description of the two languages as input and output.",
        "It is intuitively clear that the more communicatable the adjusted granmiar is, expressed by a powerful formal system, the more efficiently is the grammar interpreted.",
        "We adopt generalized phrase structure grammar(GPSG) framework[3].",
        "(2) The notion of direct realization of interpretation Because we need to connect competence and performance as directly as possible, one of the goals of our study is to identify rules of the grammar with the manipulative unit of interpretation in a one-to-one fashion.",
        "Thus we carefully distinguish between the grammar' and the rules of interpretation.",
        "For this, we adopt the following notions as the methodological principles of our system: 1) Equivalence of grammar[5], 2) grammar cover and grarmnar modification[6], 3) type transparency[ 21, and 4) an invariant of formal languages[4].",
