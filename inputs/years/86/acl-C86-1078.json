        "One of the main tasks of machine translation, besides the resolution of ambiguities and the generation of appropriate structural analyses, is the selection of adequate translation equivalents.",
        "It has been found that an analysis which even produces unequivocal results does not suffice for the production of pragmatically adequate texts in the target language.",
        "There are problems with respect to the selection of appropriate lexemes, collocations, idiomatic expressions on the one hand.",
        "On the other hand we have to know what kind of syntactic patterns and anaphorical or elliptical constructions usually are applied with respect to the text type.",
        "What we need is information on communicative norms.",
        "In addition to a syntactic and/or semantic analysis we have to provide a pragmatic component especially in order to solve problems on the level of transfer.",
        "The notion that linguistic usage and the selection of means of expression (lexis and syntax) is directed by - or at least influenced by - communicative intentions has received increasing attention with respect to problems of translation.",
        "Recent research in this area include communicative grammars for foreign-language learning.",
        "(e.g. Leech/Svartvik 1975), but also more specific studies which explicity take account of text function (Reiff/Vermeer 1984, Thiel 1980) and aspects of action in texts (HOnig/KuBmaul 1982).",
        "These studies have influenced the theoretical foundations of TEXAN to the extent that we view communicative aspects as decisive for the solution of translation problems.",
        "Some short examples of our texts (interacting-regulating texts, especially international treaties) may illustrate this approach.",
        "We should know when a special pattern has to be applied in different languages and when it has to be changed.",
        "It has been found in these texts that there is a special type of definition (DEFINE) with lexical restrictions and which always is realized by participle constructions in English, German, French, Italien, etc.",
        "A translation by a relative clause, e.g. in German, would be wrong.",
        "In a different text type it may be right or even must have this form.",
        "On the other hand, regulations (REGULATE) differ in verb forms.",
        "Thus in German present tense is to be used, in English shall-forms, and in French present and future may be alternatives.",
        "A general principle is, that the participants never are pronominalized.",
        "The question now is what kind of linguistic model can help us to structure the relevant components of the analysis system?",
        "2.",
        "Concept of Text Acts (TA)",
        "Our system needs a linguistic model in which content, function and form of lingusitic expressions in a text are connected.",
        "We think that a Oood concept for this purpose may be the concept of text acts (Rothkegel 1984).",
        "TA are speech acts in which texts are produced.",
        "When we translate, we are producing a new text.",
        "We follow Searle's analysis of speech acts into illo-cutionary, propositional and locutionary parts and assume, with respect to texts, the existence of three parts of text acts (I: text illocution; T: thematic specification of the propositional part; R: repertoires of lexical and grammatical expressions which are typically used for a specific communicative task).",
        "Automatic procedures for the processing of speech act basically have to do with the selection and representation of contextual factors.",
        "They determine the assignment of illocutions to linguistic utterances (Gazdar 1981).",
        "What models developed for this purpose have in common is the use of overall schemes whithin which the respective speech acts can be interpreted.",
        "While Evans (1981) handles general definitions of situation, Allen/Perrault (1980), Cohen (1978) and Grosz (1982) use general action plans in which the speech acts of interest are embedded.",
        "This principle, which is applied to dialogues in the models mentioned, we have applied to written texts in TEXAN (example of an article in Fig.1).",
        "3.",
        "Model of Analysis",
        "The analysis of text acts is oriented conceptually in a top-down fashion.",
        "In the context of machine processing, however, we have to rely on the linguistic surface as input data.",
        "TEXAN is a system which builds on other programs already completed within our project.",
        "We use a syntax parser (SATAN, cf. SALEM 1980), for instance, which provides a description of constituent structure and valencies.",
        "Furthermore, we use a program for case-grammatical analysis (PROLID, cf. Harbusch/ Rothkegel 1984) which provides a role interpretation on the description of constituent structure.",
        "Input into TEXAN , then, is a complete structural and case-relational description of sentences.",
        "This determines",
        "should arise ...... _ -â€¢auf dem Gemeinschaftsmarkt on the Community market, _ --eine zus6tzliche Nachfrage, the Community - - _ _ so will not object __ - hat ... nichts einzuwenden die Gemeinschaft, daft to these quantitative limits die vorgenannteri HOchstmengen being increased, Oberschritten werden, on the understanding that sofern the additional quantities die zus'atzlichen Mengen shall be determined -- - - ,von den Vertragsparteien on the basis of mutual agreements einvernehmlich between the Parties.",

        "In priciple, the task here is to bundle the available information on syntax, lexis and thematic roles in a form suitable to the determination of the underlying illocution.",
        "Nevertheless, the concept of text acts is the basis for the structure of data.",
        "We distinguish the following components (Fig.",
        "2):",
        "The components of the automatic analysis are GRILL (grammar of illocutions), TEL (text lexicon) and TEF (sequence of propositions of the text).",
        "INT (schema of interpretation for the structure of states of affairs and communicative tasks) and HAS (action structure of the text) are preconditions in order to formulate the rules of GRILL.",
        "'text' represents the input structure.",
        "This means that the sentences are syntactically analyzedand ordered according to a propositional listing.",
        "'text representation' is output in the form of Fig. 1.",
        "In the following we will sketch the structure of the components.",
        "INT represents the structure in which knowledge of states of affairs is embedded into knowledge of linguistic action.",
        "It consists of 4 parts which can be combined.",
        "States of affairs (see Fig. 3): (a) actions (a (x, (y), (z)) ) states of affairs occur as actions/interactions (a) of/between participants (xl, x2,...) and refer to an concrete object (y) or abstract object (z) or relate the two ones (y,z).",
        "(b) states of affairs occur as events concerning abstract objects: b (z) (c) situation (m,n,o,p,...)",
        "actions are embedded in a situation described by parameters of time, location, personal relationship, domain, procedures, etc.",
        "(d) the verbalization of an action can be seen in the status of condition, norm, purpose, permission,etc.",
        "Linguistic actions: They are interpretations of states of affairs with respect to communicative tasks and can be described as predications on propositions.",
        "Thus we can add several types of illocutions to (a)-(d).",
        "Examples are:",
        "TEL represents the text lexicon.",
        "According to the two tasks of TEXAN TEL includes two sections of information: an identification section concerning the text act structure (TAS) which is described by types of illocution and roles such as REGULATE ( case), SPECIFY (object), etc., and a selection section consisting of lists of repertoires which belong to several single languages (TAE:R(L1,...,Ln).",
        "As a third part a key (K) is established which provides the connection of input data and the TA-information.",
        "On the level of simple illocutions the key represented by the lemma of the head of the respective phrase; on the level of complex illocutions the key is the illocution of a lower level An entry of TEL has the following design: TEL.",

        "It is possible that one key corresponds to several entries of TEL.",
        "This is the case if there are different TAS.",
        "GRILL provides rules which represent the structure of INT and HAS and which transform them into procedures.",
