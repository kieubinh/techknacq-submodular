        "Op) = F: p is a declining (secondary) phase A phase-set P is a pair [P*,q]: P* is a set of intervals p and q is an evaluation function assigning a truth value to each pC P*.",
        "The substitution of propositions R by phase-sets P is not unequivocal, but also not arbitrary.",
        "Some necessary conditions for the relationship between R and its \"surrogate\" P have been introduced and discussed elsewhere (Kunze 1986).",
        "One essential point is that the simple \"moment logic\" becomes an \"interval logic\".",
        "This is also connected with questions as expressed by the different definitions of HOLD, OCCUR and OCCURING in Allen 1984.",
        "Another fact connected with phases is the unsymmetry in the case of a negation: (1) The museum is open today.",
        "The museum is open all day today.",
        "(2) The museum is closed today.",
        "= The museum is closed all day today.",
        "The proposition R is supposed to be fixed and given.",

        "The German sentence",
        "(3) Thomas raucht.",
        "has at least two of them (and consequently two meanings): \"Thomas is a smoker\" and \"Thomas is smoking\".",
        "Furthermore the use of phases enables us to consider some parts of T(R) as unimportant, accidental or exceptional.",
        "These parts form declining phases of R. The affirmative phases of R need not be disjunct, and they need not be contained in T(R).",
        "It is also possible to introduce nested phases, so that rather complicated courses may be represented.",

        "\"... and ...\" and, \"if ..., then ...\"), one defines P1 ° P2 Def [P*, q1 o q2] with P* .",

        "As an example we take the phase-operator OCC:",
        "If one replaces\" p nP2 i 0 \" by \" p g P2\", one gets the definition of P = PER(P1,P2).",
        "P = OCC(P1,P2) means \"P2 happens during P1\", P = PER(P1,P2) \"P2 happens throughout Pl\".",
        "The important point is that these relationships between P1 and P2 are not represented by a Yes-No-decision, but again by a phase-set P: OCC(P1,P2) selects from the T-phases of the first argument those p for which the characteristic condition (= there is a p2",
        "with q2(p2) = T and p n p2 4 0) is fulfilled.",
        "The phase-operator.",
        "OCC is not the same thing as OCCUR or OCCURING in Allen 1984.",
        "There are at least three differences: OCCUR is a Yes-No-predicate, has as first argument an event and as second an interval andthe arguments are no sets as in our case.",
        "It makes at any rate difficulties to generalize such a Yes--No-property for sets as arguments.",
        "This is one reason for our definitions.",
        "More important is that e. g. OCC(131,P2) may be used as argument in another phase-operator.",
        "This enables us to express quite easily the essential time relation in \"In July there are evening-planes on Tuesday and Friday.\".",
        "One needs some other operations: Given P = (P*,q], then alt(P) contains exactly those phases which one gets by joining all phases of P which are not seperated from each other and have the same q-value (inductively understood).",
        "If one designates by U° the phase-set consisting only of U as interval (with q(U) = T), then alt(P) = U° means that the union of all T-phases of P covers the time axis U, e. \"P is always true\".",
        "In sect.",
        "1. we already sketched how to represent propositions R by phase-sets P. We write P = <R>.",
        "Now we have to explain the same for temporal adverbials: <tuesday> is a phase-set P, whose intervals p are the days, and exactly the Tuesdays have the q-value T. In <day> all intervals (= day) have the q--value T. <1982> is a phase-set with years as intervals, but only one (=\"1982\") has the q-value T. Obviously x<tuesday> is a single unspecified Tuesday, x<day> an unspecified day."

        "(11) A Tuesday when John went to see Mary Behind these examples stand some general questions: The two condition alt(...) = U° and alt(...) U° have the status of truth-conditions.",
        "They refer to the two cases, where a phase-set is considered as a Yes-No-property and where it is the basis for a determined (or defined) time, which is again a phase-set.",
        "This becomes clear by (12) As long as John went to see Mary every Tuesday (she believed in his promise of marriage).",
        "These spans (there may be more!)",
        "have to be represented by",
        "(13) alt(<tuesday> OCC(<day>,P)) with truth-condition alt(...) I – 110 (for (12) becomes inacceptable, if there is no such Tuesday at all!).",
        "Is R = \"Mary believes in John's promise of marriage\" and <1-5> =",
        "is the corresponding expression for (12).",
        "If we take (13) as V, (5) becomes",
        "(15) alt(<1982> PER(<year>,P)) = U° and (14) becomes (16) alt(PER(P,P)) = Using the definition of PER one gets (17) alt(<1982> PER(<year>,P)) = 110, which can be paraphrased as (18) During 1982 Mary believed in John's promise of marriage.",
        "This answers a second general question: Time logical inferences may be based on these expressions which represent phase-sets.",
        "Another question concerns quantification.",
        "The expressions avoid the (always troublesome) quantification and render it possible to perform the inferences rather simply.",
        "The quantifications are \"hidden\" in the following sense: The expression (19) VxOy alt(OCC(xP1,yP2)) I U° (for every T-phase p1 of P1 there is a T-phase p2 of P2 such that p2 happens during p1) is equivalent to (20) alt(P1 OCC(P1,P2)) = Uo (an expression without formal quantification!).",
        "It can be proved, that for every expression with (linguistically reasonable) quantification there is an equivalent expression without explicit quantification.",
        "The expressions reflect in fact a structure of texts.",
        "The constituents of this structure belong to two categories: \"propositional\" and \"temporal\", where the second includes some quantifications (every Tuesday, only on Tuesdays), frequencies (three times), measures (for three days), (21) gives a simplified version of this structure for (12): (21) As long as John want to see Mary p..I every Tuesday t..r she believed ...",
        "So we have three types of structures (if we restrict ourselves to the sentence-level): (a) the syntactic structure (e.g. a dependency tree), (b) the macrostructure as in (21), which has some features of a constituent tree, but reminds more of categorial grammar, if one considers the problem thoroughly, (c) the structure of the expression (14) for (12).",
        "They may be used as interface structures for two steps of analysis.",
        "The step from (b) to (c) has to apply rules, which we already used for (5): (22) P every Tuesday * alt(<tuesday> OCC(‹day>,P)) (23) as long as P , P* alt(PER(P,P)) etc.",
        "It should be noted, that the three essential temporal parts in (21) are expressed by totally different means:"
