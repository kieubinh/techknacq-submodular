        "Various aspects of referent identification by hearers have been investigated in the last few years: It has been studied as a process of noun phrase resolution and attribute comparison (Lip-kis 1982), as a planned action (Cohen 1981, 84.",
        "), as a process which depends on focus (Grosz 1981), context (Reichman 1981), the mutual beliefs shared between speaker and hearer (Clark & Marshall 1981) and the modality of linguistic communication (telephone vs. teletype, cf. Cohen 1984), and as a process which is prone to various sorts of conversational failure (Goodman 1985).",
        "In all of these studies, natural language is the only conversational medium.",
        "For identifying objects under discussion, the hearer can therefore only utilize the NL descriptions provided by the speaker, and information about the previous dialog and the task domain at hand.",
        "In face-to-face conversation, however, participants also frequently use extralinguistic means for referent identification, in particular, various sorts of deictic gestures (such as pointing at something by ones hand, finger, pencil, head or eyes).",
        "One This work is part of the SFB 314 Research Program on AI and Knowledge-Based Systems and has been supported by the German Science Foundation (DFG).",
        "The authors would like to thank J. Rink and W. Finkler for their help in preparing the manuscript.",
        "Email address of the authors: surname%obsvax.uuccagermany.csnet may assume that this is done for simplifying and speeding up the identification process for both the hearer and the speaker, as well as avoiding referential failures.",
        "Certain technical in.",
        "novations in the last few years (e.g., high-resolution graphic displays, window systems, touch-sensitive screens, input via a pointing device such as the mouse or the light-pen) have made it possible for computational linguistics to also experiment with and study a certain class of these deictic gestures, namely, tactile gestures for identifying objects on a terminal screen.",
        "From all application-oriented perspective as well, such an ability is certainly a desirable characteristic for natural language dialog systems.",
        "In current systems, referring to visual objects involves the user either to employ unambiguous labels displayed together with the objects (cf. Phillips 1985), or purely linguistic descriptions which sometimes become rather complex (e.g. the \"bright pink flat piece of hippopotamus face shape piece of plas-tic\" in Goodman 1985).",
        "In Woods et al.",
        "(1979), a combination of deictic and natural language input has already been envisaged, but solely with restricted flexibility.",
        "Since an analyzer for pointing gestures is independent of a particular language, one might also consider transferring it to other NL dialog systems.",
        "In this paper, we will present the referent identification component of XTRA, a system for a natural-language access to expert systems currently under development at the University of Saarbrilcken.",
        "In its present application domain, XTRA is intended to assist a user in filling out his/her annual withholding tax adjustment form.",
        "The system will respond to terminological questions of the user, extract from the user's natural-language input the relevant data that is to be entered in the application form, and verbalize the inferences of the tax expert system.",
        "During the dialog, the relevant page of the application form is displayed on one window of the screen (for a simplified example, see Fig. 1; only the tax form is visible to the user).",
        "For referring to single regions in the form, to the entities stored therein, or to larger regions which contain embedded regions, the user can employ linguistic descriptions (which we will call descriptors), pointing gestures with a pointing device (mouse), or both.",
        "From now on, the noun 'deictic' will refer to the use of a pointing device, and the term 'deictic expression' to the use of a descriptor plus a deictic (such as 'these deductibles' + deictic), or of a deictic alone.",
        "In Baler's (1982) terminology, the kind of deixis used in our situation is a demonstratio ad oculos.",
        "The objects on the display are visually observable, upon which the user and the system share a common visual field.",
        "In Clark & Marshall's (1981) terms, they are in a situation of physical copresence.",
        "Therefore, objects on the display need not be introduced by the user, but can immediately be referred to by a descriptor, a deictic, or both.",
        "In many cases, however, neither kind of reference will be precise.",
        "Referential expressions, on the one hand, will often apply to more than one region in our form (as is the case when the user employs the term 'the deductibles' in order to refer to specific deductible sums such as dues for the membership in a professional organization).",
        "Deictic gestures, on the other hand, are also often imprecise in that they are not aimed at the region in which the user actually wants to refer to.",
        "Reasons for this might be inattentiveness, an oversized pointing device, or the user's intention not to hide the data entered in the respective field.",
        "Another factor of uncertainty is the pars pro two deictic.",
        "In this case, the user points at an embedded region when actually intending to refer to a superordinated region.",
        "This is particularly the case when a form region is completely partitioned into a number of embedded subregions.",
        "Therefore, in our model, we utilize several sources of information ibr identifying the region the user probably wants to refer to: the descriptor s/he uses, the location and the type of his/her pointing gesture, intrasentential context (case frames), and the dialog context.",

        "In natural-language dialog systems, deixis analysis can be combined well with standard methods for referent identification.",

        "When a pointing gesture is ambiguous, it appears that regions set off by bold frame or coloring, as well as regions containing important data for the task domain are preferred.",
        "We expect this preference to be taken into account in the evaluation processes of the deixis analyzer.",
        "Another possible extension which we would like to investigate is in replacing the strategy described in section 3.1.1. by a certain form of incremental referent identification.",
        "There is strong empirical evidence (e.g. Goodman 1985) that people begin with referent identification immediately after receiving initial information about it, instead of waiting until the speaker's referential act is terminated.",
        "Since all components described above are strictly separated, it appears basically possible to also use them in an incremental identification process.",
        "In one-processor systems, however, great care must be taken that the knowledge source first adressed does not block the system by generating too many candidates.",
        "Therefore, some process controlling will be necessary, either by ressource limitation or by taking into account the heuristics listed in section 3.1.1."
