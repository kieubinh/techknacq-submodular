        "For example, counting the number of words in text is a difficult task since words are not separated by blanks.",

        "Proofreading (or critiquing, to some extent) [CHER80] [HEIDJ821 has been chosen as our research domain because it involves many text processing techniques and is one of the most important functions currently required and lacking.",
        "In this paper, we introduce CRITAC concepts and facilities including a conceptual representation of Japanese text called \"structured text\" to handle meaningful objects (e.g., sentences and words) and proofreading using heuristic rules for the structured text.",
        "The structured text consists of a set of Prolog [CLOCM81] facts and predicates, each of which represents an object or a class of objects in the text.",
        "Because of this high-level representation, human proofreading knowledge can be easily mapped into Prolog rules.",
        "Two user-friendly representations of text, called \"source\" and \"KWIC\" (Key-Word-In-Context) views, are derived from the structured text.",
        "CRITAC provides users with editing and proofreading functions defined over these views.",
        "The notion of structured text, we believe, is not restricted only to the Japanese language.",
