        "Integrated Machine (aided) Translation (\"M(a)f\") systems include two types of translator aids.",
        "First, there is a sort of translator \"workstation\", relying on a text processing system augmented with special functions and giving access to one or several \"natural\" on-line \"lexical resources\" (4,7), such as dictionaries, terminology lists or data banks, and thesauri.",
        "This constitutes the Machine Aided Human Translation (\"MAHT\") aspect.",
        "Second, there may be a true Machine Translation (\"MT\") system, which \"lingware\" consists of \"coded\" grammars and dictionaries.",
        "This is the (human aided) MT aspect, abbreviated as \"HAMT\", or simply \"MT\", because human revision is necessary even more for machine translations than for human translations.",
        "The term \"coded\" doesn't only mean that MT grammars and dictionaries are written in Specialized Languages for Linguistic Programing (\"SLLP\"), but also that the grammatical and lexical information they contain is of a more \"formal\" nature.",
        "In some systems, the formal lexical information is a reduction (and perhaps an oversimplification) of the information found in usual dictionaries.",
        "But, in all sophisticated systems, it is far more detailed, and relies on some deep analysis of the language.",
        "Moreover, the access keys may be different: classical dictionaries are accessed by lemas, while formal dictionaries may be accessed by morphs (roots, affixes...), lemmas, lexical units, and even other linguistic properties.",
        "In many systems written in ARIANE-78 (1), lemmas are not directly used.",
        "Efforts have been made to devise data base systems for the natural or the formal aspect, separately.",
        "Multilingual terminological data bases, such as TERMIUM (5) or EURODICAUTOM, illustrate the first type.",
        "On the other hand, the Japanese and the French National MT projects have developed specialized lexical data base systems (\"LEXDB\"), in which the (formal) information is entered, and from which MT dictionaries are produced.",
        "More precisely, there is a data base for each language (L), and for each pair of languages (L1,L2) handled by the MT system.",
        "From the first LEXDB, analysis and synthesis MT dictionaries for L are automatically constructed, while transfer dictionaries for (L1,L2) are produced from the second.",
        "In an integrated M(a)T system, it would he useful to maintain the two types of dictionaries in a unique structure, in order to ensure coherency.",
        "This structure would act as a \"pivot\", being the source of the \"natural\" view as well as of the \"formal\" dictionaries.",
        "Moreover, it would he interesting, for the same reasons, to reduce the number of LEXODs.",
        "With the technique mentioned above, there are n552 for n languages.",
        "The authors have begun a research along those lines in 1982 (6).",
        "in 1985, this has led to a tentative (small-scale) implementation of a first prototype, adapted to the aims of a Eurotra contract.",
        "At the time of revision of this paper, work on specification and implementation was being continued by a small team trying to construct a Japanese-French-English LEXDB, for a particular domain.",
        "This is why some details given in this Paper are already obsolete.",
        "However, the spirit has remained the same.",
        "The main idea of the new organization is to integrate both types of dictionaries in a unique structure, called \"fork\" integrated dictionary, or \"FID\".",
        "A given Fin is associated with one natural language and may give access to translations into several other languages.",
        "Hence, there would be only n FIDs for n languages.",
        "The form of the \"natural\" part has been designed to reflect the organization of current modern usual dictionaries.",
        "This is why we have limited ourselves to the \"fork\" architecture\", and have not attempted to construct a unique structure for n languages.",
        "In the first part, we present the \"skeleton\" of a FID item.",
        "Part II shows how to \"graft\" codes onto it, and discusses the nature and place of those codes.",
        "Finally, some problems of organization and implementation are discussed in part III.",
