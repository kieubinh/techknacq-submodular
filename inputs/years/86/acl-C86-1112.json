        "Literature on parsing natural language has recently been concerned with topics which are unfamiliar to traditional Computational Linguistics such as functional similarities of different syntactic constructions (11, reanalysis of 'indelible' structures (9), manipulation of 'indelible' trees (7) Most of the linguistic problems involved are connected with unbounded dependencies and antecedent referent binding.",
        "Grammatical formalisms have been developed, which represent certain linguistic phenomena in terms of discontinuous constituents (10), or generate unboundedly dependent symbols on the basis of specific conventions (4,5) However, the corresponding parsing algorithms are simple modifications of traditional parsers, where the extentions of formalisms are not adequately accounted for on the procedural side Our approach to the problem of parsing Natural Language is to identify a set of processing strategies.",
