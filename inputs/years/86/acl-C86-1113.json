        "The properties of distributed representations and memory systems are explored as a potential basis for non-deterministic parsing mechanisms.",
        "The structure of a distributed chart parsing representation is outlined.",
        "Such a representation encodes both immediate-dominance and terminal projection information on a single composite memory vector.",
        "A parsing architecture is described which uses a permanent store of context-free rule patterns encoded as split composite vectors, and two interacting working memory units.",
        "These latter two units encode vectors which correspond to the active and inactive edges of an active chart parsing scheme.",
        "This type of virtual parsing mechanism is compatible with both a macro-level implementation based on standard sequential processing and a microlevel implementation using a massively parallel architecture.",
        "A lot of recent research has focused on the problem of building psychologically feasible models of natural language comprehension.",
        "Much of this work has been based on the connectionist paradigm of Feldman and Ballard (1982) and other massively parallel architectures (Fahlman, Hinton and Sejnowski, 1983).",
        "For example, Waltz and Pollack (1984) have devised a model of word-sense and syntactic disambiguation, and Cottrell (1985) has proposed a neural network style model of parsing.",
        "Originally, such systems were limited in thier capability to handle tasks involving rule-based processing.",
        "For example, the Waltz and Pollack model uses the output of a conventional chart parser to derive a structure for the syntactic parse of a sentence.",
        "However, more recent connectionist parsing systems (e.g., Selman and Hirst, 1985) are more suited to handling sequential rule-based parsing.",
        "In this type of model grammar rules are represented by means of a small set of connectionist primitives.",
        "The syntactic categories of the grammar are represented in a localist manner, that is, by a computational unit in a network.",
        "The interconnections of the units within the network are determined by the grammar rules.",
        "Such localised representations are obviously useful in the construction of connectionist models of rule-based processing, but they suffer from an inherent capacity limitation and are usually non-adaptive.",
        "The research to be discussed here differs from previous work in that it explores the properties of distributed representations as a basis for constructing parallel parsing architectures.",
        "Rather than being represented by localised networks of processing units, the grammar rules are encoded as patterns which have their effect through simple, yet well-specified forms of interaction.",
        "The aim of the research is to devise a virtual machine for parsing context-free languages based on the mutual interaction of relatively simple memory components."

        "Constraints on space make it impossible to describe distributed memory systems in detail, and this section merely outlines their salient properties.",
        "For a more detailed description of their properties and operation see Slack (1984a, b).",
        "In distributed memory systems items of information are encoded as k-element vectors, where each element ranges over some specified interval, such as [-1,+11.",
        "Such vectors might correspond to the pattern of activity over a set of neurons, or the pattern of activation levels of a collection of processing units within a connectionist model.",
        "Irrespective of the manifest form of vectors, the information they encode can be manipulated by means of three basic operations; association (denoted by *), concatenation (+), and retrieval (#).",
        "The association operator creates a composite memory vector which encodes the association of two items of information (denoting memory vectors by angular brackets, the association of items <A> and <B> is denoted <A>\"<B>).",
        "The concatenation operator creates a composite memory vector encoding individual items or vectors (<A>+<B>).",
        "Thus, a single composite vector can encode large numbers of items, and associations between items.",
        "The individual elements encoded on a composite vector are accessible through the retrieval operator.",
        "When a retrieval key vector is input to a composite vector the retrieval operator produces a new composite vector which encodes those items of information which were associated with the key vector on the original composite trace.",
        "An important property of the retrieval and assocaition operators is that they are both distributive over concatenation.",
        "However, only the association operator is associative.",
        "These basic properties enable distributive memory systems to encode large amounts of knowledge on a single composite memory vector.",
        "The capacity limitations of such systems are determined by the noise levels implicit in the output of the retrieval operation.",
        "The generated noise is a function of the number of traces encoded on a vector and the size of the vector.",
        "Two classes of distributive memory can be distinguished, permanent and working.",
        "The former provide permanent storage of information, while the latter have no permanent contents but are used to build temporary representations of inputs.",
        "An important feature of working distributed memories is that the traces encoded on them decay.",
        "Associated with each vector encoded on a working memory is a decay, or strength, index.",
        "The decay function is event dependent, rather than time dependent, in that the indices are adjusted on the occurence of a new input.",
        "This property provides a useful form of event indexing which is crucial to the chart parsing scheme."

        "The mein hit the boy Figure This structure incorporates features of different notations used to describe chart parsing schemes (Earley, 1970; Kay, 1980).",
        "The structure represents a passive lattice consisting of one cell, or an equivalent edge, per constituent.",
        "It embodies structural information relating to the immediate-dominance of constituents, as well as information about the range of terminals spanned by each constituent.",
        "This structure can be collapsed under the operations of association and concatenation to derive a composite memory vector representation which preserves both types of structural information.",
        "Each constituent category is encoded as a random memory vector; <S>, <NP>, <DET> and so on.",
        "The vertices of the chart (1-6 in figure 1) are mapped onto the set of decay indices registered by the working memory systems at each input point.",
        "Moving from left to right through the table shown in figure 1 the vectors are combined by the concatenation operator.",
        "The dominance structure exhibited within the table is preserved by the association operator going from bottom to top.",
        "These procedures produce the following composite vector which encodes the information represented in figure 1: <S>*<1-6>I<NP>*<1-3>*(<DET>*<1-2>Â±<N><2-3>} <VP>*<3-6>I<V>1.<3-4> <NP>1<4-6>*{<DET>*<4-5>+<N>*<5-6>}} Each component of the pattern consists of a vector encoding a constituent label associated with the input indices defining the left and right edges of the constituent.",
        "This form of representation is similar to the idea of assertion sets which have been shown to have useful properties as parsing representations (Barton and Berwick, 1985).",
        "One of the major advantages of the representation is that the two types of structural information are jointly accessible using the appropriate retrieval vector, that is category label vector.",
