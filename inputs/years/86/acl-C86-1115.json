        "The derivation process of sentences in LFG as defined in [2] is very complex, because an additional filter has to be applied to derived c-structures.",

        "A parser/generator that works in accordance with this deri-vational process is not very efficient, because usually many strings are parsed completely or many c-structures are generated completely, although the strings themselves are not wellformed and therefore rejected by the filter (ii.-iv.).",
        "b.",
        "The process is formally not very transparent and complicates a comparison with other formalisms.",
        "c. The grammar is multistratal.",
        "It has two levels of representation (c-structures, f-structures), although it can be shown that the c-structure information, which goes beyond the linear order of the derived symbols is not exploited in the present version of the theory ([2],[3]) at all.",
        "2) In the following it will be demonstrated that for each LFG a mono-stratal version can be constructed, which describes the same language with the monostratal concept of derivation.",
        "The entities of these derivations are augmented f-structures which are constructed along the following lines: In the KB version the c-structure derivation of a wellformed terminal string is a sequence of annotated c-structures, where each c-structure results from the application of an annotated cf rule to a terminal node of the preceding c-structure.",
        "If one applies the KB-algorithm to each annotated c-structure then it constructs a minimal f-structure and a mapping from the c-structure nodes to the substructures of the f-structure.",
