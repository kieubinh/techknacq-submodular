        "One of the most characteristic features of German word order seems to be a contrast between fixed ordering rules concerning the order of verbal elements and a much more variable ordering of their corresponding nominal arguments.",
        "As a consequence German word order seems to yield a large number of phenomena that may be classified as 'unbounded' or 'long-distance dependencies', without necessarily involving wh-constituents or 'movement' across sentence boundaries.",
        "Whereas in traditional LFG long distance dependencies are treated by means of constituent control, we will follow a recent proposal by KAPLAN and ZAENEN (1986) to give up the constraint known as 'functional locality' and instead allow regular expressions to appear as functional schemata annotated to c-structure rules.",
        "Exploiting the principles of completeness and coherence we will thus be able to cope even with absolutely free word order without the need of generating empty terminal nodes at all.",
        "The empirical assumption, underlying the proposed analysis in its most radical form, is the hypothesis that (with very few exceptions) the nominal arguments have to appear to the left of the verb by which they are assigned case.",
        "We will restrict the discussion to sentences with one finite verb as well as to subcategorized nominal arguments, largely ignoring ADJuncts.",

        "To demonstrate the mechanism of 'functional incertainty' as well as some basic assumption in the proposed fragment of German grammar we will start with a relatively simple problem involving the treatment of embedded and extraposed infinitival constructions.",
        "Consider the following data: 3)",
        "(I) dass [der Mann [[ das Buch gelesen ] haben] wird].",
        "that the man the book read have will (2) dass [der Mann [ [das Buch zu lesen] versucht] hat].",

        "in (3) and (5) represents a raising verb.",
        "(2) is the same structure as (4) with the infinitival clause extraposed in the latter.",
        "The contrast between (2)/(4) and (3)/(5) or ( I )/(6) illustrates two points: on the one hand extraposition is permitted iff the governing verb governs the 'zu' infinitive and is not a raising verb; on the other hand even with these conditions met extraposition is not obligatory.",
        "Informally extraposition can thus be characterised as an optional right-adjunction of an embedded constituent to a self-embedding structure.",
        "Sentence (7) is to show that this rule can be applied recursively.",
        "In the treatment of equi- and raising-verbs, including (in our approach) auxiliary and any kind of modal verbs, we will follow the traditional LFG approach; these verbs are subcategorized for the 'open' grammatical function XCOMP and are correspondingly assigned a functional control equation that identifies the verb's own subject or object with the subject of this XCOMP.",
        "Raising verbs are distinguished from equi verbs by denoting that the 'raised' function will not be interpreted in the raising verb's semantic form.",
        "Beyond this it will have to be specified for each equi or raising verb what type of infinitive the verbal head of the governed XCOMP has to be (The feature referring to extraposition in (L3) will be attached only to the appropriate verbs).",
        "4)",
        "Given a lexicon of the above format we could use the following rules to generate the embedded infinitival constructions (1)-(3):",
        "To cover the extraposition cases we can make efficient use of the notion of 'functional incertainty'.",
        "What we want to express is that the extraposed infinitival construction appears as the rightmost daughter of the governing S-node, that it fulfills the function of an XCOMP and that it should be embedded in the resulting f-structure at an unpredictably deep level which is determined by the number of XCOMPs that have been generated by the self-embedding VP in (R3).",
        "To do this we will expand the rule (R2) by introducing a special VP' category that is annotated by a functional schema containing a regular expression involving the Kleene star on the grammatical function XCOMP (The constraining equation attached to the VP' nodes serves to make sure that only those XCOMPs will be dominated by this node that are governed by an appropriate verb satisfying this constraint through the corresponding defining equation in its lexical entry; see above (L3).",
        "):",
        "These rules will produce the following c and f structures with the metavariables appropriately instantiated.",
        "Although the VP'-node appears in the c-structure as an immediate daughter of S it's corresponding f-structure (f4) is pushed down to the",
        "deepest level of embedding in the global f-structure.",
        "(si) S f1",
        "that no governable function will appear in this position that is not subcategorized for by a verbal predicate that can be reached along an f-structure path consisting of XCOMPs only.",
        "Restricting the f-structure path to XCOMPs will make sure that no governable function be 'extracted' from inside a complex NP or some node annotated as ADJUNCT.",
        "7)",
        "das Buch zu boson Another important modification concerns our S rule: In order to avoid constituent control as well as a VP rule expanding to an optional V constituent, we 'flatten' the S rule, making all its immediately dominated constituents optional.",
        "The principle of consistency will then make sure that one and only one position for the verb will be selected.",
        "The existential constraint requiring tense will hold for both the final and the front position.",
        "That the number of iterations implied by the Kleene-star operator on the XCOMP in (122.1) and (R4) will always be the correct one is guaranteed by principles that are central to traditional FM: The principle of coherence requiring that any governable function must be governed by a local predicate in its f-structure will make sure that the number of iterations will not exceed the number of XCOMPs generated by the left sister VP structure plus one; the requirement for a minimal solution and the restriction that any predicate introduced by a lexical entry must not be unified with any other predicate entry will snake sure that the number of iterations will not be smaller than the appropriate number of XCOMPs."

        "Until now we have considered only clauses with the finite verb in a final position, and a strict order of nominal arguments.",

        "5) The rule determining the position of the finite verb in German can be informally expressed by the following generalization: The finite verb appears in a clause final position iff the first position of the sentence is taken by a conjunction, or by a relative or (subordinative) interrogative pronoun.",
