        "cohesion for immediate connectivity among adjacent text items (due to anaphora, lexical cohesion, co-ordination, etc.",
        "; see HALLIDAY/HASAN 76) and the thematic organization in terms of text coherence which primarily concerns the global structuring of texts according to pragmatic well-formedness constraints.",
        "Instances of global text structuring through text coherence phenomena are given by regular patterns of thematic progression in a text [DANES 74], or by various additional functional coherence relations, such as contrast, generalization, explanation, compatibility [REICHMAN 78, HOBBS 83].",
        "Disregarding textual cohesion and coherence structures will inevitably result in invalid (text cohesion) and understructured (text coherence) text knowledge comparable to mere sentence level accumulations of knowledge structures which completely lack indicators of text structure.",

        "Unfortunately, the overwhelming majority of grammar/parser specifications currently available is unable to provide broad coverage of textual phenomena on the level of text cohesion and coherence, so that the format of text grammars and corresponding parsing devices is still far from being settled.",
        "A Lexically Distributed Semantic Text Grammar Since major linguistic processes provide textual cohesion by immediate reference to conceptual structures of the world knowledge, and since many of the text coherence relations can be attributed to these semantic sources, a semantic approach to text parsing has been adopted which primarily incorporates the conceptual constraints inherent to the domain of discourse as well as structural properties of the text class considered (for an opposite view of text parsing, primarily based on syntactic considerations, cf. POLANYI/SCHA 84).",

        "Both serve as basic text cohesion preserving mechanisms on the local level of textuality.",
        "Their repeated application yields global text coherence patterns which either follow the principle of constant theme, linear thematization of rhemes, or derived themes (see DANES 74).",
        "In Fig _l we give a fairly abstracted presentation of these coherence patterns which should be considered together with the linguistic examples provided in Fig_2 and their graphical reinterpretation in Fig_3.",

Fig_10), experts for conjunctions trigger them, and experts referring to negation particles provide appropriately modified assignments of properties to frames.",
        "This kind of selective parsing is based on strategic considerations which, however, do not affect the linguistic generality of the approach at all.",
        "On the contrary, due to the high degree of modularization inherent to word expert specifications a word expert grammar can easily be extended to incrementally cover more and more linguistic phenomena.",
        "Moreover, the partial specifications of grammatical knowledge in the format of word experts lead to a highly robust parsing system, while full-fledged text grammars accounting for the whole range of propositional and pragmatic implications of a comprehensive understanding of texts are simply not available (not even in sublanguage domains).",

        "), or which indicate functional coherence relations (e.g. contrast, classificatory relations) and demand overlaying the knowledge base by the corresponding textual macro structure.",

        "In a subsequent step the dominant concepts are related to each other with respect to concept specialization as well as the frame/slot relationship.",
