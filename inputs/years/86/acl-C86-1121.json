        "It broke.\" (T. Winograd) It is quite clear that the disambiguation of the pronominal lexical reference of \"it\" (table or plate) involves, in addition to the syntactic and semantic constraints (where \"semantics\" is taken in a narrow sense of \"formal semantics\") a certain understanding of the natural structure of the described events.",
        "This understanding, shared by all members of the linguistic community, we can name it \"Commonsense\".",
        "In the case at hand, commonsense informs us that: i) a plate dropped on a table will in all likelihood collide with the table.",
        "ii) when such a collision happens, it is not unlikely for the plate to break, but quite abnormal for the table to break.",
        "This shared Commonsense knowledge is taken into account at the pragmatical discourse level both by the speaker and the hearer, and allow the speaker to reconstruct, with the help of Gricean-type conventions of communication, the meaning intended by the speaker and therefore the correct pronominal reference: \"it\" refers to the plate."

      "text": [
        "The previous examples showed already a relatively limited form of implicit information reconstitution in a piece of discourse: the text fragment was acceptable if it was possible for the listener to restore an implicit causal link in the text at hand.",
        "Ilere is now a more impressive example of implicit information reconstitution by the listener of a piece of discourse (fig.",
        "1).",
        "Here, the reconstitution of the informations implicitely contained in the original text makes use of at least 3 different domains of commonsense: - commonsense in the physico/biological domain: to fall, to collide, disruptive consequences of collision, to be hurt, to die.",
        "- commonsense in the psychological domain: a murder consists in an intentional killing, i.e. with a plan the goal of which is the death of somebody.",
        "- commonsense in the social domain: the way in which society treats crime.",
        "\"John was condemned to death by the court.",
        "He had pushed his wife out of the window of their 10th floor apartment.\" Implicit modelization reconstructed by the listener: - John pushes his wife out of the 10th floor window - she falls from the 10th floor to the ground, gathering speed all the while - she collides violently with the ground - she is severely hurt - she dies an Inquiry is made - the inquiry demonstrates the intentionality of John's act court meets and renders Its verdict, John is condemned to death for the murder of his wife.",
        "This example may serve to remind us of the easiness and the swiftness with which we are able to reconstruct a complex set of informations implicit in a piece of discourse from our mastery of Commonsense in a variety of domains simultaneously.",
        "However, in the previously given examples, only the \"physical\" domain (\"natural phenomena\") was made use of, and in the remainder of this paper, we will essentially restrict ourselves to this domain of Commonsense.",
        "2.",
        "The dominant model for Commonsense Inferencing in the physical domain.",
        "A considerable interest has arosen recently in A.I.",
        "for Commonsense modelizations of natural phenomena.",
        "The articles of Pat Hayes <Hayes 1978> seem to have set the tone for the philosophy presently predominant in the domain, of which the collections of papers <Hobbs, Moore (eds) 1985> and <Hobbs et al.",
        "1985> can provide recent examples.",
        "The outlines of this attitude - which we call the Direct Interpretation approach (DI approach ) - towards Commonsense arc the following: The relation between theory and predictions is conceived as similar to what it is in \"scientific\" physics, but the natural laws which are encoded in the theory are different: essentially they are of a more \"qualitative\" and less \"numerical\" kind.",
        "-The inferential procedure is made in the deductive mode (in the sense of \"deductive logic\", opposed to \"inductive\").",
        "-Like \"scientific\" physics, \"naive\" physics should be able to predict - in a deductive manner - the greatest possible number of phenomena from the smallest possible number of general \"natural laws\", -\"Naive\" physics is a strictly objectivist physics: it describes reality \"as it is\": to be valuable, the laws and the consequences of the laws must be \"true\".",
        "-The description of the physical world is done through an axiomatization, typically in first-order logic, which respects the \"tarskian\" schema of semantical adequation of a logical theory to its model.",
        "In this schema, borrowed from mathematical logic (fig.",
        "2.a), the real world is supposed to provide a model for the axiomatization, which is a set of axioms representing physical laws which are verified in the model (fig.",

        "3.1.1.",
        "The linguistic examples given in section 1 demonstrate how difficult it is to consider the commonsense inferences which appear there as a process of purely deductive type.",
        "Thus, to take example 1.3, there is no logical necessity to the sequence of implicit events reconstructed by the listener: these informations are not deducible from the explicit informations \"John was condemned by the court\" and \"John had pushed his wife out of the window\": Maybe there was a safety net in place, and maybe John murdered a policeman 3 days later, and so on and so forth... Actually, the analysis of the type of inferencing which are involved in the reconstitution of implicit informations in the examples of section 1 is complicated by the fact that Commonsense is not alone in the picture here: pragmatical conventions of communication come also into play and exploit the elements of pure commonsense knowledge which are the common beliefs of the speaker and the hearer; place is lacking here for full discussion of this problem, but let's be satisfied with the following brief comments: At the level of discourse pragmatics, several types of intersentential \"syntactical\" relations between two contiguous declarative statements are possible: Cause, Parallel, Exemplification, Explanation,... <Hobbs 1984>.",
        "In the case at hand, it is the syntactical relation of Explanation which is realized between the first statement \"John was condemned by the court\" and the second statement \"John had pushed his wife out of the window\".",
        "This relation of Explanation can only be validated because Commonsense Inferencing is capable to provide a \"natural\" explicative chain between the first statement and the second statement.",
        "Finally, the speaker and the hearer share conventions (in the sense of Grice's \"conventional implicature\" <Levinson 1983> which allow them to \"agree\" about which of the admissible reconstructions is the intended one, perhaps with the help of a common evaluation of the degree of \"naturalness\" of the different admissible evenemential chains.",
        "At any rate, the commonsense inferencing level per se - which is exploited by the pragmatic level - seems difficult to reconcile with a purely deductive process.",
        "In fact, the type of commonsense inferencing used in the examples of 1.3 presents certain striking similarities with the two following inductive/recognitive processes (by order of increasing complexity): If I observe a bike leaning behind a tree trunk hiding its central parts from me, I will have no difficulty to induce the existence of a unique bike, and not of 2 bike-halves placed in this exact position by a malevolent aesthete.",
        "In a movie, a sequence of two shots, the first one showing a woman writing a letter, the second one showing a man reading a letter will be interpreted as having a certain structural unity: it is the same letter, it has been sent by the woman and received by the man, etc... (Here again, as cinema is a communication medium, one must take into account not only the commonsense level, but also pragmatical conventions).",
        "3.1.2.",
        "Several attempts have been made recently to extend the standard deduction mechanisms of logic into \"non-monotonic logics\".",
        "These attempts have been relatively successfull in accounting for several types of \"default reasoning\", but I am not aware of any application of these techniques to the extended \"gestalt-type\" reasoning exemplified in 3.1.1.",
        "3.1.3.",
        "One of the other problems with the deductive approach of figure 2 is due to the difficulty there is to maintain the coherence of the thousands of axioms likely to be involved in any serious attempt to axiomatize any commonsense domain, at least if one supposes as direct a relation of interpretation as the one in figure 2.",
        "The coherence of such an axiomatization is easy to guarantee in planar geometry for instance -, thanks to the fact that the structure of the IR xR model is mathematically limpid, and that the correctness of the axiomatization is assured by its adequation to its model.",
        "Quite other is the situation when we endeavour to use \"reality\" as our model, for we have no clear idea of the structure of this model prior to our attempt at an axiomatization."

        "However, numerous psychological studies have unambiguously shown that our intuitive comprehension of physical phenomena differs considerably from the objective (scientific) physical state of affairs.",
        "Thus, the following experiment has been reported <Mc.",
        "Closkey 1983>: a sample of \"naive\" subjects were asked what they believed is the trajectory followed by a ball thrown horizontally.",

        "30% of the subjects believed that it begins to curve down immediately but eventually falls straight down.",
        "(The scientific answer is that the ball follows a downward-oriented curve (close to a parabola) all the while).",

        "This attitude might be admissible - at least theoretically -, if one were attempting to give robots some understanding of the external world, but not if one seeks to modelize the processes which are at the root of linguistic communication, for these constantly make use of commonsense abilities actually present in Man."

        "It is difficult to imagine that there exist universal qualitative \"naive\" postulates from which one might deduce at the same time both on one hand the unstability of a pencil set up on its point, and on the other hand the stability of a spinning-top or of a bicycle in movement.",
        "Also, many phenomena which Commonsense has no trouble giving an a posteriori account for are impossible to deduce from general laws, not only Commonsense, laws, but often scientific, laws too (in this instance, they are impossible or very difficult to deduce in practice, but more rarely in principle): for instance, the fact that a stone dropped into water will produce such-and-such a splash (a complex physico-mathematical fact); or, more dramatically, the fact that a cherry kernel planted into the ground will produce a cherry-tree, or even the fact that a moving bicycle is highly stable (even the experts do not seem to agree on the exact reason why it is so), etc...",

        "Several points should be noted: The structure of Fig.3 has only a remote connection to the actual mechanical structure of the phenomenon: there is no physical sense in speaking about a \"tendency to stay vertical\", and it is very problematical from the physics point of view to divide the phenomenon into causes and consequences.",
        "The spinning-top category has been structured with the help of a process of metaphorical importation <Lakoff, Johnson 1980> of preexisting conceptual structures (which are categories too, but of a more abstract type, see section 5), most notably the structure of \"two antagonist tendencies fighting against each other\".",
        "This type of structure seems to be of wide use in language and thought and has been extensively studied by Len Talmy <Talmy 1985>.",

        "The structure of the spinning-top category is, in an essential way, post-experimental: for an observer without experience of gyroscopic-type behaviour, the top should have \"fallen\" and it would not have constituted a priori a special category.",

        "What happens when the first actual spinning-tops experiments are observed is the fact that the observer becomes aware that this possible structuring of the experiments has to be rejected - it obviously does not fit the observed facts - and that a new \"reading\" of the experiments has to be built: a new category must be created, which integrates in a novel manner, on the one hand the rotational movement and on the other hand the natural tendency of the top to fall, by rendering these two factors causally dependent in the way given in fig. 3.",
