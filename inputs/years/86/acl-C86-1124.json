        "The two-level grammar is investigated as a notation for giving formal specification of the context-free and context-sensitive aspects of natural language syntax.",
        "In this paper, a large class of English declarative sentences, including post-noun-modification by relative clauses, is formalized using a two-level grammar.",
        "The principal advantages of two-level grammar are: I) it is very easy to understand and may be used to give a formal description using a structured form of natural language; 2) it is formal with many well-known mathematical properties; and 3) it is directly implementable by interpretation.",
        "The significance of the latter fact is that once we have written a two-level grammar for natural language syntax, we can derive a parser automatically without writing any additional specialized computer programs.",
        "Because of the ease with which two-level grammars may express logic and their Turing computability we expect that they will also be very suitable for future extensions to semantics and knowledge representation."

        "Formal specifications of natural language syntax should serve as a standard definition for the syntax of the subject language.",
        "The specification must be complete, concise, consistent, precise, unambiguous, understandable, and useful to language scholars, users, and implementors who wish to develop a parser for the language to run on a computer.",
        "Furthermore the specification should be mathematically rigorous to the degree that an implementation of the language can be automatically derived from the specification [10].",
        "Unfortunately many of these aims are difficult to accomplish primarily because of the dynamic and informal nature of natural language.",
        "Formal specification is still a worthy goal to the degree allowed by present knowledge about natural language and in this paper we propose a metalanguage for specifying both syntax and semantics of natural language that has potential for satisfying these goals.",
        "The metalanguage we propose is the two-level grammar [10] (also called W-grammars and tlgs).",
        "Two-level grammars have been used extensively for specifying the syntax and semantics of programming languages [2] but their use in specifying natural language was first introduced by the authors [7, 8, 9].",
        "Existing formal specification methods for natural language syntax take many forms.",
        "Of these, some of the more common are augmented transition network grammars [18], transformational grammars [1], and generalized phrase-structure grammars [5].",
        "These methods and others are also surveyed in [17].",
        "The degree to which any formal specification method satisfies the above stated goals is sometimes difficult to evaluate and relies on subjectivity.",
        "The authors do not intend to evaluate these existing methods with respect to the requirements of formal specification languages but will instead concentrate on why two-level grammars satisfy the necessary goals in a mathematically rigorous but readable and easy to understand way.",
        "In this paper, the two-level grammar metalanguage will be used to define a large classification of English declarative sentences, extending work described in [8] and [9].",
        "We will emphasize the method of using two-level grammars for this purpose and the advantages gained rather than any particular characteristics of the given grammar."

        "If each hyperrule has only one hyperalternative and all hypernotions in production left-hand sides are distinct from one another then the tIg is deterministic.",
        "A hyperrule is actually a production rule \"pattern\" since each hyperrule can possibly represent an infinite number of production rules in a context-free grammar.",
        "This is because each occurrence of a metanotion in the hyperrule represents all sequences of protonotions that can be derived from that metanotion.",
        "That is, a hyperrule may be viewed as a set of production rules (called strict production rules) in which all metanotions are replaced by the protonotions they derive.",
        "The only restriction here is that if there are more than one occurrence of a single metanotion, then each is replaced by the same protonotion sequence in deriving the strict production rules.",

      "text": [
        "We have shown that two-level grammars may be used very elegantly to give a formal specification of English context-free and context-sensitive syntax.",
        "In addition to the subset we have defined in this paper, many other types of English declarative sentences have been formally specified using two-level grammars [7].",
        "There seems to be no obstacle to using tlg specifications for any type of natural language syntactic specification.",
        "The principal advantages of the two-level grammar metalanguage are: 1) it is very readable and may be used to give a formal description using a structured form of natural language; 2) it is formal with many well-known mathematical properties; and 3) it is directly implementable by interpretation.",
        "The significance of the latter fact is that once we have written a two-level grammar for natural language syntax, we can derive a parser automatically without writing any additional specialized computer programs.",
        "The combination of readability and implementability is unique in grammar theory for natural languages.",
        "To give a complete specification of natural language, semantics and knowledge representation must be specified in addition to syntax.",
        "Our future goals are the investigation of two-level grammar for semantic specification.",
        "Because of the ease with which two-level grammars may express logic [6] and their Turing computability [12], we expect that tlgs will also be very suitable for these goals."
