        "The task of natural language generation is that of producing linguistic output to satisfy the communicative requirements of a computer system.",
        "The principal limitation of existing programs which perform this function is that they fail to realize a sufficiently broad range of requirements to demonstrate a convincing linguistic capability.",
        "This drawback seems founded in aspects of the systems which hinder the development of a large base of knowledge about language.",
        "A great deal of knowledge is required to produce any given utterance, yet much of this knowledge cannot easily be exploited across a range of utterances.",
        "Partial success in generation systems is often achieved by applying linguistic knowledge to particular domains.",
        "Exemplary of this success are text generation programs such as PROTEUS [6], and Ana [15,14]; as well as generation components of on-line systems; for example, in HAM-ANS [5], UC [9,11], and VIE-LANG [4].",
        "These systems, while embodying a variety of generation techniques, serve to illustrate the importance of the command of specialized constructs and the ability to utilize specialized knowledge in generation.",
        "A close examination of the knowledge used in such programs, however, reveals that a great deal of linguistic information seems to be encoded redundantly, thus impeding the use of generalizations in \"scaling up\" the systems.",
        "The UNIX 2 Consultant system [22] is a program which answers questions from naive users about the UNIX operating system.",

        "The PHRED generator initially used by UC [11] produced output such as the above by treating each verb use as an independent specialized construct.",
        "This allowed no benefit to the system of abstract knowledge about the use of the verbs, nor of applying its knowledge about one specialized construct to another.",
        "This difficulty proves to be a major handicap in building large-scale generation systems: A key element is to facilitate the exploitation of generalizations while still providing for specialized uses.",
        "In order for the UC system to have this capacity, the linguistic knowledge representation used had to be redesigned.",
        "This knowledge-based approach has led to the design and implementation of the Ace knowledge representation framework [12].",
        "Ace is a uniform, hierarchical representation system, which facilitates the use of abstractions in the encoding of specialized knowledge as well as the representation of referential and metaphorical relationships among concepts.",
        "A general-purpose natural language generator, KING (Knowledge INtensive Generator)[101, has been implemented to apply knowledge in the Ace form.",
        "The generator works by applying structured associations, or mappings, from conceptual to linguistic structures, and combining these structures into grammatical utterances.",
        "This has proven to be a simple but powerful mechanism, easy to adapt and extend, and has provided strong support for the use of Ace knowledge structures in generation.",
        "While this presentation describes the Ace knowledge structures from the point of view of language production, the representation framework is designed to be unbiased with respect to language analysis or generation.",
        "The discussion which follows focuses on the representation of linguistic and conceptual knowledge in Ace, using as an example knowledge about the verbs \"give\", \"take\", \"buy\" and \"sell\".",
        "The examples show briefly how information is encoded in Ace which enables the generator to produce dative constructs such as \"John sold Mary a book\" and specialized forms such as \"John gave Mary a kiss\", making use of abstract knowledge about events such as giving.",
        "These verbs provide a good testing ground for a representational framework, as they may be characterized by certain linguistic generalizations while appearing in a variety of specialized constructs.",

        "® Principle I. Inheritance of Conceptual Relations.",
        "Concepts in memory are organized into a hierarchy of categories, in which more specific concepts inherit \"features\" from more general concepts.",
        "This inheritance is a representational tool which has been employed throughout the history of Artificial Intelligence (cf.[18,19,2,3]).",
        "The question of what exactly is inherited, however, can be answered in a variety of ways.",
        "Ace takes advantage of structured inheritance, (cf. [3]), in which concepts linked to a particular structure may inherit from super-categories of that structure.",
        "For example, knowledge about the seller of a selling action may be inherited from knowledge about the giver of a giving action.",
        "• Principle 2.",
        "Proliferation of Conceptual Categories.",
        "Individual concepts are themselves categories, and any concept about which there is particular knowledge is considered to form a category.",
        "Thus categories proliferate: Probably, there are far more conceptual categories than there are lexical items in the system.",
        "For example, it will be shown later in this section that it is reasonable to postulate a concept specifically for the action of paying money in exchange for merchandise, although there is no lexical item corresponding to this concept.",
        "The lexical term \"pay\" is associated with a more general concept, that of providing money in exchange for virtually anything.",
        "The lexical term \"give\" may be associated with a general giving concept, but giving to charity, giving an idea, and giving a chance are distinct concepts with distinct linguistic manifestations.",
        "For example, the use of the verb \"give\" without object or indirect object as in \"Bill gave\" and \"I gave at the office\" is a linguistic phenomenon which appears almost exclusively when referring to charitable giving.",
        "• Principle 3.",
        "Explicit Referential Relationships.",
        "There are a range of conceptual relationships important in language use which are not easily described as factual or ontological relationships.",
        "The one which is considered here is the view relationship, which helps to determine how concepts may be used in expressing other concepts.",
        "The concepts of giving and taking may be related to the concept of a transfer-event, but the instantiation of the abstract giving and taking concepts cannot be factually inferred from the instantiation of transfer-event.",
        "For example, \"John gave five dollars to charity\" does not imply that a charitable organization took the five dollars from John.",
        "\"Mary took the money from John\" does not imply that John gave Mary the money.",
        "In many circumstances, however, the same event may be described using \"give\" or \"take\".",
        "For example, (1) \"John gave Mary five dollars for the book\" may imply (2) \"Mary took five dollars from John for the book\".",
        "Representing giving and taking as views of transfer-event permits the encoding of knowledge about describing transfer-events without requiring, a given event to be classified as giving or tak-sng.",
        "These views may thus represent the knowledge that \"John took <x> from Mary\" and \"Mary gave John <x>\" might be used to describe the same event.",

        "The view2,8' association is DOMINATEd by both view2 and view3 and thus inherits their ROLE-PLAYs.",
