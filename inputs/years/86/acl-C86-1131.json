Yokoyama Electrotechnical Laboratory Urnezono, Sakuramura, Niihari Ibaraki 305 Japan Abstract Project SEMSYN*** achieved a state where a prototype system generates German texts on the basis of the semantic representation produced from Japanese texts by ATLAS/II of Fujitsu Laboratory.",
        "This paper describes some problems that are specific to our semantic based approach and some results of the evaluation study that has been made by the Germanist group.",
        "I.",
        "Generation procedure in SEMSYN This section summarizes the SEMSYN genration procedure.",
        "Those readers who are more interested in the SEMSYN system are recommended to read our previous COLING84[l] paper or the paper submitted to this conference[2].",
        "The generation process begins with the conversion of the semantic networks, each represents one sentence, into a so-called IKBS (Instantiated Knowledge Base Schema.)",
        "The IKBS is an instantiation of case or concept schemata denoted by semantic symbols as nodes in the semantic network.",
        "A case schema contains three main description slots; a) roles of eases associated with the semantic symbol, b) transformation rules of schemata, c) choice of German syntactic realization schemata.",
        "Being triggered by the semantic symbols of the given network, IKBS specifies the best basic syntactic structure associated with a German word by checking fillers of roles and converts them into functional roles within each German syntactic category.",
        "A German syntacto-morphological component called SUTRA-S[3] a extended version of SUTRA [4] generates German surface texts from the instantiated syntactic structure called IRS (lust-antiaed, Realization Schemata.)",
        "Though English-like terms are used for semantic symbols, the choice of a German word associated with each semantic symbol and its syntactic structure very differ from the English corresponding one.",
        "II.",
        "Some problems of semanitc based translation approach There are some advantages as well as disadvantages of the semantic based approach, which we anticipated at the beginning of the project.",
        "Theoretically speaking, a reason why we adopted a semantic based approach againt the syntactic transfer approach is founded on the cultural difference and communication barriers between the two project groups that cooperate with each other to build up a translation system.",
        "Understanding the content of the origenal sentence from the given semantic representation the generation group could express it in a way that is common in its mother tangue, relatively free from the syntactic restriction and lexical corresponding terminology.",
        "It is a well known fact that one language of a culture can only be interpreted and not literally be translated into the other languages of different cultures, as it would be possible within the same cultural sphere.",
        "As the matter of fact we often took this advantage in our generation system.",
        "On the other hand, exactly this freedom turned out frequently to be a disadvantage on the generation side.",
        "Dealing with real data (titles of sientific papers in the field of information technology from the Japanese data base JOIS) we encountered new problems we didn't expect before and recognized the limit of our approach.",
        "In the following we describe some of these problems: (I) Lack of information in Japanese original text We had also to come up with this well known problem such as lack of articles (definite or indefinite) and of distinction between numbers (singular or plural) for nouns as well as verbs.",
        "We embedded some heuristic rules in KBS and dictionary to add these syntactic features, if they must not be missed in the German text.",
        "There still exists deeper semantics which rules the decisions, but cannot be represented in general, except for very limited cases.",
        "Heuristic rules are based on our ambiguity conservation principle, i.e. we keep the ambiguity of input text as much as possible to avoid any active selection of one alternative, that might lead to a wrong expression from the view point of the author of the titles.",
        "Following examples show typical errors of numbers and articles generated by the present SEMSYN heuristics.",
        "They also illustrate how difficult it is to find a trade off between the ambiguity conservation and an active decision infered from the content: E.g. 1.:'J'El1411Pkill6r(0,11#1177 471:1\"---40)*?--i SEMSYN generation: Die Verwendung von kleinen Computern zur Durchfuehrung von gfossen graphischen Programmen (The application of small computers for the execution of large graphic programms) Comment: The author of the paper will discuss how to use a small computer to execute a very large graphic package, so readers may naturally assume one small computer instead of many small computers, though it is possible to assume the latter.",
        "On the other hand, it is generally assumed that a computer processes many programms.",
        "For this reason the latter plural case is more natural than the former case.",
        "However, it is a bad German to have neither a number feature nor an article as it is in the original text.",
        "E.g. 2: SIM/1110)711.",

        "(The development of the kernel in the operating system of the distributed type for real-time applications) Comment: It is assumed that the author developed the kernel of one distributed OS, instead of many distributed OS, for many applications.",
        "2) Ambiguity of conjunctions One of the hard problems we expected in our semantic",
        "representation was the ambiguity in the coordinating conjunctions in an attributive context such as: <AP> A, B and C <PP>.",
        "E.g.3 high speed bus, memory and switching in bit slice technology The scope of context could be made unique, if the semantic network could allow such a node which denotes a subnetwork.",
        "The following conjunctive subnetwork is classified into three basic cases:",
        "In practice, however, we found that 90% of about 380 titles which contain conjunctions among 2000 titles we so far generated from the given semantic networks belong to the case (i); only about 8% are the case (ii), and the rest is the case (iii).",
        "This statistic results may be spesific for the titles, but this indicates that authors of titles are aware of the syntactic structural ambiguity and consequently try to avoid the above straightforward sequence of conjunctions except for the case (i).",
        "Beside this statistic sample-based facts, the conjunctive ambiguity is further weakened by the fact that the generation system produces ambiguous titles according to our ambiguity conservation principle to let expert readers naturally infer which is meant by the author.",
        "At the moment we deal with the both cases (ii) and (iii) by exploiting this possibility to convey the ambiguity so as if it were the case (i).",
        "Though this conjunctive ambiguity in semantic networks seemed to be a serious factor at our first glance on them, it fortunately turned out to be a very minor problem as the evaluation study indicates."

        "Generally speaking, however it sounds better in German if a expression explicates the meaning in a more resolved form, while ambiguous expressions or even fuzzy expressions are prefered in Japanese.",
        "In this example the purpose arc expressed as \"zur\" implies the application of the semantics.",

        "This is because at the time when the evaluation study started we had only 2000 semantic networks available.",
        "The evaluation results are summarizes",
        "1: Exactly the same meaning as the original text 2: Almost same content 3: Still acceptable and informative 4: Only partially acceptable 5: Nothing to do with the content of the original text Grade Fidelity 1: Correct style, syntax and morphology 2: Correct syntax and morphology, but stylistic defect and vice versa 3: Still readable, but substantial mistakes in syntax, morphology and style 4: Almost unreadable as German text 5: Not German",

        "Following results show the error classification from which the readers can figure out the development",
        "The above classification indicates that dictionary problem cannot be solved in a short term.",
        "Especially in our approach, a semantic symbol generally corresponds to an upper concept, under which an appropriate German term is registered as a specialization.",
        "Therefore the terminology selection within a lexical entry is indirectly done through its context.",
        "Again, this very advantage of expression freedom causes a bad selection of a target word.",
        "We need time to polish our semantic German terminology data base so that system can select right German words in general.",
        "The noun compound is a specific problem in German.",
        "By constructing a noun compound a stylistic problem may elegantly be solved (cf. e.g.9, 10), because otherwise using a modifier (possessive attributes, qualifiers and quantifiers, etc) results in an awful expressions that can not be compared with an alignment of English terms.",
        "We also found a conflict situation in connection with the selection of technical ttms.",
        "While we prefered common English technical terms in the field of information processing as CS experts for the reason of easy understanding, evaluators emphasize the authority of national standard technical terms (DIN), e.g. CRT (Datensichtgeraet), real-time (echtzeit), etc.",
        "The reason why the German ideom \"unter Verwendung von\" was frequently used can be attributed to the semantic symbol \"USE.ACT\", often infered (about 10%) by the analysis system.",
        "(Note: USE.A.CT covers \"verwenden (use)\", \"anwenden (apply)\", \"Gebrauch machen (make use of)\", but also <instrument> arc for \"mit (with)\", 'knit Mlle von (with the help of)\", etc).",
        "This means that the explication of USE.ACT of an implied meaning in the original Japanese text may either elucidate the situation in German (this is often the case) or make expression harder.",
        "By the same token a postpositional phrase or adjective phrase of an original text may awkwardly be expressed in a German relative clause.",
