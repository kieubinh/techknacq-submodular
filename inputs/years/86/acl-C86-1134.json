        "In NAOS the generation of a description of the underlying image sequence aims at diminishing the discrepancy between the system's knowledge of the scene and the hearer's knowledge (the same motivation is used in Davey's program ffip.",
        "Concernig the hearer we make the following assumptions:",
        "I. S/he knows the static background of the scene, i.e. the streets, houses, traffic lights, etc.",
        "2.",
        "S/he did not utter specific interests except: Describe the scene!",
        "A description may be the result of such diverse speech acts as INFORM, PROMISE, PERSUADE, or CONVINCE.",
        "NAOS only generates the speech act INFORM.",
        "To inform a hearer about something means to tell her/hinn something s/he has riot known before, somel ring that is true and new.",
        "In NAOS the definition of true utterances builds on the situational semantics of Barwise and Perry 131.",
        "They understand the meaning of an utterance as a relation between the utterance and the described situation.",
        "The interpretation of an utterance by a hearer usually consists of a set of possible situations with a meaning relation to the utterance.",
        "We now define an utterance to be true if the set of possible situations contains the actually occurred situation.",
        "The requirement to generate true utterances has two consequences for our verbalization component.",
        "First, the verbalization process must take the hearer's meaning relations into account.",
        "This coincides with the communication rule to tune one's utterances to the hearer's comprehension ability.",
        "Second, assuming that the speaker has the sarne meaning relations as the hearer, the speaker can imticipate the hearer's interpretation of an utterance, i.e. the possible situations implied solely by the utterance can be generated without knowledge of the actual situation.",
        "In the case of scene descriptions these situations are equivalent to the hearer's visualization of an unknown scene.",
        "An utterance must be new to the hearer in order to inform him.",
        "In the context of situational semantics we define an utterance to be new if its interpretation restricts the set of possible situations implied by previous utterances.",
        "Thus new information additionally specifies described situations.",
        "The task of a verbalization component is to choose utterances such that they inform in the above sense.",
        "Therefore it is necessary to anticipate the hearer's understanding for judging whether a planned utterance carries new information.",
        "The general principle for hearer simulation is depicted in figure",
        "On the side of the speaker the event recognition process leads by use of event models to instantiated it models (called events in the figure).",
        "A first selection i process chooses among the instantiations those which are to be verbalized.",
        "As event models are associated with verbs the appropriate case frame of the verb is invadable.",
        "A second selection process now chooses among the optional deep cases of the verb.",
        "This is where the deep case semantics comes into play.",
        "If, for instance, it is decided that a locative expression should be generated it is necessary to know how the location of an object may be expressed in natural language as in the geometric scene description the location of an object is given by its x, y, and z coordinates.",
        "Tile deep case semantics also contains information about the prepositions which may be used for expressing a specific deep case.",
        "Assuming that the hearer has the same meaning relations as the speaker he basically can use the speaker's processes it) reverse order and reconstruct the underlying case frame from the utterance and dints build a visualized scene description.",
        "Note, however, that we agree with Olson 121i that the verbalization of a visual event, always leads to a loss of' information.",
        "In our case, for instance, we cannot trisume that the hearer knows the x, y, and z coordinates of an object when he hears the phrase in front of the department of computer science.",
        "Such a phrase generates it set of coordinates defining the region which corresponds to the preposition in-front-of The tudual location of the object which gave rise to the generation of the phrase lies somewhere within that region.",
        "Presently, hearer modeling stops at the level of case frames turd the visualized scene is anticipated (see section 4.2).",
        "As shown in figure I the case frame of a verb plays a central role in our verbalization component.",
        "We adopt the view of Fillmore expressed in his scenes-and-frames semantic [7] that case frames relate scenes to natural language expressions."
