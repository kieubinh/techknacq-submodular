        "Several problem domains can be named where the task of automatic generation of natural language texts, not sentences, has become the\"hot topic\", e.g. machine translation, dialog between the user and the computer in a dialog system, etc.",
        "Given the two central problems of natural language generation, that of what to say and that of how to say it, we discuss shortly the main components of a dialog system which should enable the system to solve the problem of how to decide what to say, and then proceed to a more detailed treatment of the second task.",
        "The present approach draws heavily from the dialog system TARLUS being developed at Tartu State University, Estonia, USSR.",
        "Several modules of the system have been working independently for some time already, and experiments are under way in merging these modules into a unified dialog system.",
        "Though the surface generation is carried out in the Estonian language the authors hope that a number of ideas which have found their way into this system will be of more general interest.",
        "2.",
        "Main Components of the Dialog System",
        "The dialog system consists of the following modules: Linguistic Processor, Turns' Interpreter, Turns' Generator, Planner, Dialog Monitor, Solver.",
        "In addition to this the dialog system includes several knowledge bases for long-term knowledge: goals' knowledge base, problem domain knowledge base, linguistic knowledge base, dialog knowledge base, partner's knowledge base and self-knowledge bass.",
        "To store short-term knowledge the system contains a number of models: of activated goals of the system, of the text of preceding dialog turns, of the communicative situation, of the partner, of the system itself.",
        "Dialog partners always follow certain goals in their interaction.",
        "The goals of the",
        "dialog system may be thought of as implicit questions the system is seeking answers to during the dialog.",
        "The long-term goals of the system are kept in goals knowledge base where they have attached to them priority assessments.",
        "In the course of interaction these goals (or subgoals) may rise or lower.",
        "For every new goal the system must set a priority assessment.",
        "There can be three types of questions in the dialog system: user questions to the system, the questions of the system to itself, and the questions of the system to its user.",
        "Every question in its turn may concern either the problem domain or the process of interaction.",
        "The central notion of the dialog is a \"turn\".",
        "In natural dialog both interlocutors generate their turns in certain order and thus we may represent a dialog as a sequence of interchanging turns",
        "where ta ta etc.",
        "are the turns of the first 1' 2, Interlocutor, and tâ€žb t7b, etc.",
        "are the turns of the second interlocutor.",
        "Every turn may consist-of one or several communicative steps, e.g. the turn refusal may consist of the communicative steps REFUSAL + MOTIVATION, where REFUSAL dominates MOTIVATION.",
        "The dialog system functions as follows.",
        "The Linguistic Processor carries out morphological and syntactic analysis of the input turn with the help of linguistic knowledge base.",
        "A later task of the Linguistic Processor is the generation of the surface answer from its semantic representation.",
        "The Turns' Interpreter fulfills several tasks:",
        "i) it constructs the semantic representation of the turn with the help of problem domain knowledge base.",
        "For the interpretation of the following turns it may be necessary to take into account the preceding turns of the partners.",
        "To this end the Turns' Interpreter simultaneously constructs the semnatic interpretation of the dialog text already ans4 lysed.",
        "ii) the Turns' Interpreter should recognize in a turn the corresponding communicative step(s).",
        "For this task it uses the dialog knowledge base.",
        "At the same time the Turns' Interpreter forms the model of communicative situation, by supplementing it with typical structures of recognized communicative steps and combining them into bigger units on the basis of recognized turns and turn cycles.",
        "iii) it establishes the activated goals of the dialog system during a dialog proceeding from the turn under interpretation.",
        "The questions which the user poses to the system and the questions that the system formulates",
        "on the basis of recognized communicative steps with the help of \"interest rules\" are carried into the model of goals and supplied with priority assessments.",
        "When the Turns' Interpreter has finished its job the Planner scans the goals in the goals knowledge base and the model of activated goals.",
        "It also tries to find answers to the remaining questions by addressing the Solver when the question concerns the problem domain, or the Dialog Monitor when the problem is about communication.",
        "The Turns' Generator selects the type of answer turn on the basis of the set of questions chosen by Planner and the communicatisve steps which will form the prospective turn.",
        "For instance, the question may be cone veyed as communicative steps ANSWER, EXPRESSION OF DOUBT, etc.",
        "The question that has not yet been answered may be conveyed as communicative steps QUESTIONS REQUEST, ORDER, etc.",
        "Secondly, the Turns Generator constructs the semantic representation of the future turn and adds it to the model of text of preceding dialog turns.",
        "The generation of an answer turn is finished by the Linguistic Processor which transforms semantic representation of a turn into a text.",
        "To organize cooperation between the different modules is a very complicated process.",
        "We share the opinion that it cannot proceed linearly but is rather organized as cooperation between experts permanently exchanging information among themselves (Dim et al., 1984).",

        "Knowledge Used in Text Generation 3.1.",
        "Dialog knowledge base",
        "Dialog knowledge base contains type structures of communicative steps and rules which the dialog system uses in interpreting the replies of its partner and generating its own turns.",
        "The main structural components of a communicative step are: SETTING - facts describing the situation where the given communicative step takes place: preconditions which hold about the author of that step or, in the author's mind, about the partner as well as about the objective reality PLOT - contents/theme of the given communicative step GOAL - communicative goal of the author of the step CONSEQ - the outcome of the communicative step, i.e. the changes in the cones municative situation which take place as a result of that communicative step.",
        "For the cooperation with the dialog system to be natural the dialog knowledge base should also contain certain rules of communication which the system should follow when carrying out the dialog.",
        "Among them the most important are the principle of cooperation (Leech 1975) and the principle of politeness (Leech 1983).",
        "In dialog knowledge base these principles are contained as fixed types of rules.",
        "In the following we exemplify some of these rules together with some examples of using them in live dialogs.",
        "1.",
        "The general form of rules of behavior is as follows: IF (situation?",
        "THEN <action> For instance, IF interlocutors A and B have a common goal G and A thinks that there exists an obstacle on the way of achieving G THEN A has the right to demand from B the discussion of that obstacle and discovering of the possible ways of over coming it These rules, on the one hand, limit the activity of the author of a turn in constructing his turns and, on the other hand, help the addressee understand these turns by drawing implicatures.",
        "Implicatures are inferences drawn if two conditions are met.",
        "First, the turn of the partner violates a principle of communication and, secondly, the communicative situation does not contain any clues that it is done intentionally.",
        "Therefore the addressee starts making hypotheses, i.e. drawing inferences which help him construct such an ins terpretation for the input turn which satis4 Pies the principle of cooperation.",
        "If there are no counterarguments to this hypothesis the addressee supposes this to be the intended meaning of the input turn.",
        "Drawing of implicatures in the dialog system proceeds according to special procedures eased on rules of behavior.",
        "2.",
        "A special case of rules of behavior are pragmatic inference rules:",
        "IF <type of communicative step?",
        "THEN <default GOAL!)",
        "Where GOAL' is a goal inferred by default from the GOAL of the author of the turn.",
        "For instance, when A asks B how to reach a goal (e.g. How can I get to the railway station?)",
        "then his goal may be to achieve that result (i.e. to be at the station).",
        "3.",
        "Rules of interest have the form",
        "<interest source>----se<question/problem> They determine from the type of a communicative step the questions, or \"interests\", which the interlocutor must find answers to.",
        "They typically concern such problems, as - what does the author suppose about the addressee when asking a question or making a proposal",
        "- does the claim of the author hold - are there any obstacles to the plan put forward in a communicative step, etc.",
        "As interestsources may function various communicative situations with wide difference in their complexity.",
        "The questions they trigger are typically related to the structural parts SETTING and GOAL of the communicative step.",
        "Here are some examples of the rules (A.. author, B= addressee): A: REFUSAL H: Why A refused (What is the MOTIVE of REFUSAL)?",
        "A: CLAIM P B: Does P hold?",
        "4.",
        "Rules of logical inference use data within one communicative step only.",
        "We have treated that type of rules in detail in (Oim, Saluveer, 1985) and will therefore not discuss them here.",
        "5.",
        "Rules of turn,compilation;are used in constructing and interpreting a turn which",
        "consists of more then one communicative steps.",
        "For example, a turn expressing a refusal may consist of only one communicative step REFUSAL, but more common are such combinations as REFUSAL plus MOTIVE, only MOTIVE, REFUSAL plus ALTERNATIVES, etc.",
        "The rules of turn compilation fix the possible combinations of communicative steps and their possible sequence in a turn (the sequence of turns is important , because the steps are not simply linearly ordered but there exist fixed subordination relations between the communicative steps within a turn).",
        "These rules have the general form type of turn C1, C2, Ck (k?1),where Ck are types of communicative steps.",
        "6.",
        "To rules of dialoa coherence belong first and foremost rules which determine from the components SETTING and CDNSEQ of a partner's turn the contents of the component SETTING in the other partner's turn.",
        "There are several subgroups within this general group: (i) default rules are used in such situations in a dialog where the turn of a partner is \"blank\", i.e. when the partner does not answer to a remark.",
        "E.G., when somebody asks \"Don't you belive me?\" then a silence from his partner is equal to a negative turn (the partner does not.",
        "belive the author).",
        "(ii) rules determining cycles of turns in coherent dialog.",
