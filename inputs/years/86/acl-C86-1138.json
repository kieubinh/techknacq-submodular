        "For a computer to understand and respond to a wide range of spoken natural language, it is not sufficient merely to recognize which words were spoken.",
        "As in the case of typed natural language input, it is necessary to determine the meaning of the input utterance taken as a whole.",
        "The field of natural language processing is devoted to determining the meanings of word sequences typed into a computer.",
        "It seems, therefore, natural to apply the techniques already developed in processing typed language to determining the meaning of spoken input.",
        "Unfortunately, it is not possible to apply techniques for parsing typed natural language to spoken input in a straightforward manner.",
        "We list acme problems below.",
        "We assume the existence of a speech recognizer that transforms a spoken input into a word lattice – a set of hypothesized words that may be present, together with their starting and ending times and the probability of each word being correct.",
        "In general, there will be several competing word hypotheses for each point in the input signal.",
        "This assumption is somewhat simplistic in that it does not provide any way for a parser to influence the lower levels of speech processing.",
        "However, the separation assumption helps to illustrate the following problems in adapting parsing techniques for typed input to spoken input: e lexical ambiguity: More than one word may he produced by the speech recognizer for a given segment of speech.",
        "If the ambiguities were simply between different word choices, this could be handled by the natural language processing techniques used for word sense ambiguity (e.g. \"bank\" may be a place to put money, the side of a river, an action of placing trust, tilting a vehicle sideways, etc.).",
        "However, not only can multiple words be hypothesized, but the competing hypotheses can occur at overlapping, adjoining, or separate segments of the input signal, without a consistent set of word boundaries.",
        "There is no parallel phenomenon for typed natural language.",
        "probability measures: Speech processing systems typically provide a relative likelihood of the correctness of each word hypothesis.",
        "These probabilities or scores are based on criteria such as the quality of the match between speech signal and phonemic dictionary expectations.",
        "Since a Speech recognition system may hypothesize many words for the same segment of speech, and since these word scores may differ considerably, they are important in limiting the search.",
        "However, there is no natural.",
        "way to make use of such likelihood scores in most natural language processing techniques.",
        "4 unrecognized words: Because of hurried pronunciation or co-articulation effects, a speech recognizer may completely fail to recognize some words in an utterance.",
        "The missed words are usually (though riot always) short, unstressed, \"function\" words rather than longer \"content\" words.",
        "This omission is not handled by standard natural language processing techniques.",
        "However, new techniques for processing typed, but grammatically imperfect, input may be adaptable to this purpose since they are also designed to deal with missing words, e ungrammatical input: In addition to the word omissions from imperfect word hypothesization, spoken input tends to contain more real grammatical deficiencies than typed input.",
        "Once stoken, words cannot be easily retracted, but typed utterances can be corrected it the user notices the error in time.",
        "Thus, fail-soft techniques for recovery from grammatical errors in natural language processing are particularly pertinent when m:tendad to the interpretation of spoken input.",
        "The.se difficulties argue against the simplistic approach of attaching a speech recognition module to a traditional natural language analyzer designed for words entered as unambiguous ASC.il characters.",
        "No matter how good each may be in isolation, the two will not integrate successfully if the latter cannot provide semantic expectations to the former, cannot handle massive lexical arrit,tigirity, or cannot tolerate errors of recognition and grammatical deviation.",
        "Moreover, with adequate integration, feedback from a notorl language analysis component can sut)stan tinily improve the performance of a connected speech recognizer.",
        "This performance enhancement is badly needed since no present connected speech recognition method comes close to human abiiities.",
        "And even hutriL,r,s often fail to recognize function words extracted from their surrounding context.",
        "The application of linguistic knowledge and semantic expectatIons through natural language analysis techniques is thus needed to complement acoustic recognition methods by com.tritining the set of possible (and sensible) protat;ons of the words in an input utterance."

      "text": [
        "The case for substantial integration of natural language processing with speech recognition is clear.",
        "The issue is how to adapt natural language parsing techniques to cope with the special problems of spoken input as described above.",
        "Most such adaptation efforts until now have been based on transition network parsing.",
        "Essentially, they encode the expectations of the parser in a transition network whose arcs are labelled by syntactic or semantic categories of words or constituents.",
        "An input is analyzed by Priding a path through the network that corresponds to the sequence of words in the input.",
        "Constituent labels on arcs are associated with their own subnetworks, and traversing the arc in the top-level network is accomplished by traversing the corresponding subnetwork.",
        "Typically, transition net parsers operate by traversing the network from left to right in step with the input, exploring subnetworks in a top-down manner as they go.",
        "Well known examples of transition-net parsers include ATN [14] parsers (as used in the LUNAR system [15j), the RUS parser [1], and the parser used in LIFER [8].",
        "The HARPY system [9] used an integrated network encoding for linguistic and acoustic information.",
        "A major problem with transition-net parsers for speech recognition lies in the difficulty they have in handling input that does not meet their grammatical expectations.",
        "Frequently a word may be missing due to acoustic misrecognitien or actual omission.",
        "Ii a network is being explored left to right, finding the correct path through the network would then involve skipping over the arc that corresponded to the missing word.",
        "If simple skipping were all that was involved, the problem might well be tractable, but the problem is compounded by the typical multiplicity of possible parses, especially if the word lattice contains many alternative words for the same speech segment.",
        "The method used to detect a non-viable parse in the search is inability to follow any arc from the current node precisely the situation most likely with a missing word, Thus, network parses can no longer use the standard halting criteria for non-productive (constraint violating) searches.",
        "A further compounding of the problem arises if the word after the missing word allows a spurious arc to be followed from the network node at which the missing word should have been recognized.",
        "In this case, it will generally he very hard to find out where the error really occurred.",
        "Other forms of ungrammaticality, either actually spoken or mis-recognition artifacts, result in similar problems.",
        "The absence of consistent word boundaries from the acoustic analysis phase complicates things further.",
        "Various methods have been tried to adapt network parsing to these problems, including on-demand insertion of extra arcs (e.g. [13, 12]).",
        "Perhaps the most promising modification for speech input is the replacement of left-to-right tracing techniques by center-out techniques that work from words with high certainty according to the acoustic component [16].",
        "However, semantic importance has never been combined with acoustic certainty in selecting these islands.",
        "Island growing, attractive in theory, presents serious practical problems for ATN parsers, not the least of which is the requirement of running ATNs from right to left.",
        "This method of interpreting the networks, necessary with center-out techniques, fails when tests depend on registers that have not yet been set.",
        "No modifications to network-based techniques have been totally successful."

      "text": [
        "Our approach is quite different from the transition network approach and is derived from recent work at Carnegie-Mellon University by Carbonell, Hayes, and others [3, 7, 6, 2] on understanding typed, restricted domain natural language, with a particular concentration on handling ill-formed input.",
        "The technique that makes it possible to process sensible but potentially imperfect or incomplete utterances is called semantic caseframe instantiation, Unlike network-based techniques, caseframe methods enable a parser to anchor its interpretation on the most significant input parts, and to grow its islands of interpretation to the less significant segments.",
        "Since the more significant words tend to be longer and therefore more likely to be recognized reliably, the islands of significance are correlated with islands of certainty.",
        "In the process, semantic and syntactic expectations generated from the more meaningful parts of the input can be used to discriminate and hypothesize the meaning of troublesome segments.",
        "The essential difference between caseframe and transition network techniques is the level of encoding of the syntactic and semantic information they both use.",
        "Caseframe techniques encode the information at a more abstract level and thus are able to interpret it in multiple ways.",
        "Network techniques \"compile\" the information into networks at a much lower and more rigid level, and thus do not have nearly us much freedom in interpreting the same knowledge in multiple ways.",
        "As we will show, the ability to apply syntactic and semantic information in an interpretive way is the key to the successful integration of speech and natural language processing.",
        "The central notion behind a caseframe is that of a head concept modified by a set of related concepts or cases, bearing well-defined semantic relations to the head concept.",
        "The original linguistic concept of a caseframe as first described by Fillmore [4], relied on a small set of universally applicable cases.",
        "The recent work at CMU adapts this idea to restricted domain situations by allowing specialized cases for each concept related to a head concept.",
        "Consider, for instance, the caseframe shown in Figure 1.",
        "Figure 1 defines the forward action of an electronic mail system.",
        "The notation is that of the caseframe speech parser described later.",
        "Without going into notational details, the caseframe is identified as a verb or clausal caseframe corresponding to the verbs (HeadForms) \"forward\" or \"resencl\".",
        "It also has four cases: Agent (the person doing the sending), MsgObj (the message being forwarded), MsgRecipientObj (the person the message is being forwarded to), and CCRecipientObj (the people who get a copy of the forwarded message).",
        "The MsgObj case must be tilled (InstanceOf) by a MsgObjDesc (defined by another caseframe, see below), and the other cases must be filled by a MailAdtDosc (the caseframe representing a person or \"mail address\").",
        "All the cases are required, except CCRecipientObj, which is optional.",
        "In addition, to this purely semantic information, the caseframe contains some syntactic information: the Agent case is manifested as die syntactic ;AI hject; MsgObj as the direct object; MsgRecipientObj as either the indirect object or as the object (PrepO) of a prepositional phrase, whose preposition (CaseMarker) is \"to\"; CCRecipientObj as a prepositional",
        "In addition to actions, we also use caseframes to describe objects Figure 2 shows a nominal caseframe for the message object of our electronic mail system.",
        "This has the same form as the verb caseframe, except that its HeadForms correspond to the head nouns of a noun phrase describing an electronic mail message.",
        "In addition, the Descriptors case has a new SyntaxCase, pronominal, which implies that the elements of Pattern (new, recent, etc.)",
        "may appear in the adjective position in this caseframe.",
        "With a suitable caseframe for MailAdrDesc and knowledge of what things like clause, noun phrase, direct object, adjective position, etc.",
        "mean, the above caseframes clearly contain enough information to produce analyses of sentences like: Forward to Jones at CAINA the messages from Smith.",
        "Did Brown resend any new messages to Green at 1313N?",
        "What mail did Jones forward to Smith?",
        "Drown is forwarding the recent messages to Green.",
        "The central question is how to combine the information in the caseframe definitions with syntactic knowledge and thus analyze the sentences into a set of caseframe instances.",
        "The approach taken in earlier caseframe work at CMU has been to embed the syntactic knowledge in the parser code and let the parser interpret the caseframes using that knowledge.",
        "E.g. the algorithms in [3] use semantic caseframes and focus on prepositions as casemarkers as well as the order of subject, verb, indirect object and direct object for parsing.",
        "Unfortunately, prepositions tend to be small function words that are often poorly enunciated and recognized.",
        "Therefore we have adopted the same general approach for our speech parsing work, but modified the parsing algorithms.",
        "The same caseframes are used, but with a somewhat different interpretation process.",
        "The ability to apply multiple recognition methods is a central advantage of caseframe parsing.",
        "Since the restricted•domain language description embodied in the caseframes is at such a high level of abstraction, we are free to interpret it in a way appropriate to the particular situation.",
        "The caseframes tell us what components to look for and constrains where we can look for them.",
        "But exactly how we look for them is adaptable so that it can be driven by the most reliable information we have.",
        "4.",
        "Applying caseframes to speech input We can summarize the previous two sections as follows: caseframes of the kind we have described contain the right amount of information at the right level of abstraction to parse restricted•domain spoken input; o the algorithms that have been developed for using such caseframes in parsing typed natural language input are unsuitable for spoken input because the algorithms rely on the presence of small function words that are recognized at best unreliably by word hypothesizers.",
        "The trial implementation of our approach applies caseframes to the input, but does it in a novel way by:",
        "1. examining the lattice of words hypothesized by the speech recognizer for those that correspond to caseframe headers.",
        "2. combining all the caseframes corresponding to the words found in all semantically and syntactically plausible ways 3. for each caseframe combination thus formed, attempting to account for the gaps between the caseframe header words that were involved in its formation by parsing words from the gaps against empty semantic and syntactic roles in the caseframe combination 4. selecting as the final parse those casefrarne instances that beet account for the input, based on how much input they cover and the acoustic scores of the words in that parse.",
        "This multi-stage approach avoids the problems of the caseframe parsing algorithms for typed input by anchoring the parse on caseframe headers.",
        "Caseframe headers are verbs (for clausal caseframes) and nouns (for nominal caseframes).",
        "These are content bearing words that tend to be stressed in speech and are often multisyllabic.",
        "This improves their chances of recognition above that of short, unstressed function words.",
        "The anchor points are thus correlated to the most acoustically certain words.",
        "The idea of forming one or more parses at a skeleton level and instantiating the one (or ones) that satisfy all constraints down to the lexical level is akin to the ABSTRIPS [10] and NOAH [11] planners that first established a general plan and later worked in all the detail called for in the situation.",
        "That way, the parser does not waste time in hypothesizing local details that cannot possibly fit into a.global parse.",
        "An additional advantage associated with working from caseframe headers is that the resulting caseframe combinations form a ready-made semantic interpretation of the input.",
        "The interpretation is typically incomplete until it is filled out in the subsequent gap-filling stage.",
        "However, if the recognition of some or all of the remaining words is so poor that the semantic interpretation is never fully completed; then the parser still has something to report.",
        "Depending on the application domain, a skeleton interpretation could be sufficient for the application, or would at least form the basis of a focussed request for confirmation or clarification to the user [5].",
        "In the .remainder of this section, we examine in more detail our current implementation of the approach outlined above, starting first with a description of the word lattice that drives our caseframe-based parser for spoken input.",
        "This parser operates in the context of a complete speech understanding system that handles spanker independent continuous speech with a 200 word vocabulary in an electronic mail domain.",
        "4.1.",
        "The word lattice The input to our caseframe speech parser can be viewed as a two-dimensional lattice of words.",
        "Each word has a begin time, an end time, and a likelihood score.",
        "The begin/end times state where the word was detected in the utterance.",
        "The score indicates how certain we are that the word is correct, based on acoustic-phonetic information.",
        "In the sample lattice below, the horizontal dimension is time, and the vertical dimension corresponds to certainty of recognition of individual words by the speech recognizes generating the lattice.",
        "This word lattice was constructed by hand for demonstration purposes.",
        "To start its processing, the parser selects from the word lattice all header words above a recognition likelihood threshold.",
        "These headers correspond to caseframes, but only some combinations of the hypothesized caseframes are possible in the domain.",
        "To calculate the legal caseframe combinations, a set of phrase structure rules were derived that apply at the frame level (rather than at the more detailed word level).",
        "To make matters more concrete, let us refer to the sample lattice above.",
        "In this lattice, the underlined header words would be combined to form the nuclei of sentences like: \"Forward message Smith CMUA\" and \"Print message lineprinter.\" Casefremes can combine in this way if one is of the right type (as defined by the InstanceOf attribute for the case) to fill a case of another.",
        "When combining caseframes associated with header words, the parser also uses knowledge about word order to limit the possible combinations.",
        "In our example, the forward caseframe (as defined in Figure 1) has a slot for a MsgObjDesc as a DirectObject.",
        "The order restrictions built into the parser only allow for the direct object after the verb.",
        "The message caseframe (Figure 2) fulfills these requirements.",
        "It is a MsgObjDesc, whose HeadForm \"message\" occurs after the forward caseframe HeadForm \"forward\" in the lattice.",
        "Thus the two can be combined, as long as the constraint of the required MsgRecipientObj can be satisfied (by \"Smith\").",
        "Each time a valid sequence of headers is found, it is given an overall likelihood score and merged with the previous ones.",
        "At the end of the header combination phase, we have a list of ordered partial phrases, containing all the legal sequences of header words that can be found in the word lattice.",
        "Each partial phrase is represented as a set of nested caseframe Instances.",
        "For instance, three combinations would be formed from the header words:",
        "where square brackets indicate caseframe instances and the nesting is conveyed by textual inclusion.",
        "A routine .to check word junctures is used during the header combination phase.",
        "Whenever two header words are combined for a partial phrase, the juncture between these words is checked to ascertain whether they overlap (indicating an illegal combination), abut, or have a gap between them (indicating significant intervening speech events).",
        "This check also enables the parser to deal efficiently with co-articulated phonemes as in \"some messages\".",
        "These phonemes are merged in pronunciation, resulting in a pair of overlapping but valid word candidates.",
        "These word juncture checks comprise a tap-down feedback mechanism to improve the speech recognition."
