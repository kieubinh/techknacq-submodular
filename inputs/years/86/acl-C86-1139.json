        "A parsing scheme for spoken utterances is proposed that deviates from traditional 'one go' left to right sentence parsing in that it devides the parsing process first into two seperate parallel processes.",
        "Verbal constituents and nominal phrases (including prepositonal phrases) are treated seperately and only brought together in an utterance parser.",
        "This allows especially the utterance parser to draw on valency information right from beginning when amalgamating the nominal constituents to the verbal core by means of binary sentence rules.",
        "The paper also discusses problems of representing the valency information in case-frames arising in a spoken language environment.",

        "The whole system is designed as an interface for spoken language in German and Dutch to a relational database, that contains office information on the project itself like letters, publications, dates, and persons involved, etc.",
        "It should be able to answer all kind of questions and imperatives concerning the subject matter.",
        "The vocabulary comprises about 1000 word-formes."

        "Whether or not one argues in favour of an interface between the acoustic and linguistic modules that allows for passing information in both directions is to be kept seperate of the discussion on what kind of knowledge is available to the linguistic analysis.",
        "Only if it is able to reduce the number of possible sentences to a considerable extent it makes sense to organize this knowledge most effectively.",
        "In order to reduce the flood of hypotheses one has to make sure that the linguistic module uses as much knowledge as can be made available at the most early time of processing.",
        "Whether this knowledge is then used to make predictions for the acoustic modules or if the whole process works sequentially is rather a question of efficiency than of principle.",

        "The acoustic module delivers a list of word hypotheses with begin, end, and score.",
        "But not every word, that starts physically at the same point of time where the previous hypothesis ends, is a possible successor.",
        "One can limit the number of successors to those which are phonetically justified.",
        "The consequences of this are that the interface is a network of nodes and edges, where the nodes represent the words, rather than a list with beginnings and ends, which a chart-parser normally expects.",

        "Since our semantic representation is a kind of predicate calculus formalism (see Bunt 1985 and v.Deemter 1985) at this level almost every constituent (exept for focused PP's) can become arguments of the predicate.",
        "For this reason there is no point whatsoever in generating nodes that combine constituents into any other than S(sentence)-nodes, as it is quite common in traditional grammars.It does not contribute any additional meaning to a syntax-tree that has to be transformed into a predicate-argument structure.",

        "Although the algorithm is not based on pattern-matching like some other frame based approaches (Hayes 1981 and Hayes 1985), the entries in the case-frame lexicon sometimes do have to come very close to it, in order to be of a power that not only describes case indicators and fillers that may occur, but at the same time excludes the wrong ones; a feature that is generally referred to as strong generative power.",
        "As one can see from the rules, each constituent carries an index, that is passed on to the test procedure as one of its parameters.",
        "It tells which function this constituent has in the surface structure.",
        "This function is also an entry in the caseframes since some case-roles behave differently depending on the function they have to fullfill in the surface structure.",

        "In order to prevent doubling of easeroles in a sentence, which with this kind of input can easily happen, it is checked whether this case-role is not yet a member of a set of case-roles, already accumulated.",

        "If not, it is made a new member of this set and passed on to the next level node.",

        "There are frames for verbs as well as for nouns.",
        "The noun frames become crucial when attatching the proper PP's to NP's. The caseframes are, unlike in other systems ( Brietzmann 1984, Hayes 1985), static data structures that are not instantiated, nor do they trigger any actions.",
        "Since it is very unclear as to the criterion of whether roles, especially prepositional objects and the like are obligatory, no distinction is made in the caseframes.",
        "The fact that certain NP's are obligatory for a verb is taken care of by the argument-number of the verb.",
        "There is also no distinction made between immediately verb dependent and free prepositional complements.",
        "First one does not really know where to draw the borderline between the two, (see Vater 1978, Jacobs 1985) and second, from the point of view of semantic interpretation, they all have to be treated in the same way, namely as arguments of the verb.",
        "Because of the requested power of the caseframes the information given in the slots has to be as general as possible but also as explicit as necessary to prevent the attachment of those hypotheses which are produced but we rather would not want to fit.",
        "In fact each slot represents a combination of casemarkers and categories or particular strings of casefillers.",
        "The latter are usually to be found as head of the noun phrase.",
        "Taking a closer look at the heads of the phrases one will notice that they can play very different roles with respect to their function in realising a certain case-role.",
        "They are either explicit designators of the role in cases like: 'Brief mit Datum 17.1.86' (\"letter with date ....) where 'mit' works as an empty rolemarker, i.e it is not role-specific, and the head 'datum' takes the role of the preposition.",
        "Those strings we call role-attributes.",
        "They can also be descriptions of the value, that is ment to fill the slot.",
        "On the syntactic surface however they appear very much the same, namely as : Prep Nom + Propername like in: 'von Monet Mai' (from (the month of) May) In these cases one can use the semantic categories of the heads in order to identify them as proper fillers.",
        "There are also cases where there are specific value descriptions, whose status is usually somewhat inbetween the two mentioned above.",
        "They demand a particular preposition, like 'jahr'.-in the slots above.",
        "For example using 'Jahr' as a value description demands 'aus' as a preposition, which in turn cannot be used with a possible value of 'Jahr', which would for instance be '1985'.",
        "If the head of the constituent is only a value like in: 'der Brief von 1985' The semantic category of this value has to appear in the slot restrictions.",
        "That this is heavily application dependent is clear enough.",
        "This kind of information can be kept in a seperate network.",
        "Leaving it to the database to decide whether a value is appropriate means that the database can never decide whether this value has not been stored or whether it looked for a non-existent relation.",
        "This again clearly influences the possible response of the system.",
        "With this information stored in the case-frames the system can answer maybe that it has no letters from this year, whereas in the alternative case it could just answer 'no result retrieved'.",
        "They also behave differently in terms of case-role restrictions, as in the above example you could say: 'aus dem jahr 1985' (from the year 1985) but not: * 'aus 1985' (from 1985) Therefore we have decided to demand semantic categories in the caseframes for values too.",
        "7.Conclusion We have introduced a parsing strategy that heavily relies on case-frame and therefore also on semantic labelling information.",
        "In order to detect the verbs, that set up the appropriate case-frames has caused us to split the parsing process first into two parallel processes.",
        "One parses the nominals and the prepositional phrases, the other one the verb groups.",
        "The two processes are brought together and a sentence-parse is tried on the basis of the hypothesised verb-frame.",
        "The parsers work with augmented context-free grammars, that also perculate features to the higher nodes.",
        "The nodes do not have to convey any additonal information.",
        "The also trigger tests to check case-role restrictions."
