        "Since the early 1970s, a variety of approaches to language understanding have been proposed.",
        "In particular, the importance of knowledge organization has been emphasized, and linguistically structured knowledge such as Script [1] and knowledge representation frameworks such as Frame [2] and Semantic Network [3] have been proposed.",
        "At the same time, the linguistic approach has been adopted to reveal the discourse structure, the cognitive approach has attempted to explain phenomena such as focus, topic and intention, and the formal semantic approach has been used to establish semantics based on the logical model theory.",
        "We propose an interactive model between the memory structure and the text (or utterance) as a language understanding model.",
        "In the model, knowledge stored in the memory structure plays the principal role such that the text invokes knowledge and the understanding system interprets the text using that knowledge.",
        "The knowledge consists of linguistic knowledge and non-linguistic knowledge.",
        "They are closely related each other and incorporated into the memory structure simultaneously.",
        "As a result of understanding, the system assimilates the meaning structure of the text into its memory structure.",
        "The bases for representing the knowledge are structure, relation and concept which are the fundamental components for constructing and representing the memory structure including the meaning structure of a sentence.",
        "For the purpose of clear definition of linguistic information, a linguistic model, called the Extended Case Structure model (ECS), which is capable of treating the structures of complex sentences, is provided.",
        "• These principles have been applied to the design of a new version of the experimental machine translation system called LUTE (Language Understander, Translator and Editor) [4].",
        "This paper deals mainly with the current Japanese-English version of LUTE (LUTE-JE version-1) [5].",
        "LUTE has following processing characteristics: 1) Not only syntactic but also semantic relations (dependencies) between modifiers and modificants are analyzed simultaneously.",
        "2) All kinds of information such as syntactic patterns, meaning structures, lexical items, and knowledge are represented in a uniform framework, called a Frame-Network.",
        "3) Analysis produces a 'most plausible meaning structure' based on the prediction of syntactic structures and the integration of semantic structures.",
        "4) Transfer is realized as a general framework for manipulationg the frame network."
