        "Interactive modules will be plugged into the system pending the development of automatic modules for performing the various tasks as well as more powerful inference engines and representation schemata.",
        "This is a device that facilitates early testing of a system even before all the modules are actually built.",
        "Another advantage of this strategy is that the system becomes 'dynamic', in the sense that its knowledge is growing with use.",
        "This strategy is an extension of one of the approaches discussed, for example, in Carbonell and Tomita (1985) since it implies knowledge acquisition during the exploitation stage and also involves a broader class of texts as its input.",

        "Therefore, if one aims at fully automatic, one has to prepare the system for the treatment of even very semantically involved text.",

        "This would have slowed down the process of dictionary compilation.",
        "The dictionary writers must do their best not to mix the semantics of an IL dictionary entry with that of an English word whose graphical form coincides with that of the IL dictionary entry head.",
        "There are two kinds of entities in DIL: concepts and properties.",
        "Concepts are IL 'nouns' (objects) and IL 'verbs' (events).",
        "IL 'adjectives', 'adverbs' and 'numerals' are represented by properties.",
        "These are organized as sets of property values indexed both by the name of the property set (e.g., 'color', 'time' or 'attitude') and by the individual values, to facilitate retrieval.",
        "Property values are applicable to specific concept types.",
        "Their tokens do not appear on their own in IL texts, but only as fillers of slots in the frames for concept tokens.",

        "By representing sets of entries, thereby providing a link among a number of (related) concepts, they serve as the basis for a variety of inference-making procedures.",
        "Even more importantly, these `nonterminal entries' constitute, together with the sets of various property values, the schema of the dictionary, the set of terms that are used to describe the semantics of the rest of the dictionary entries.",
        "Just as all other nodes in the hierarchy, nonterminal nodes represent dictionary entries, which means that they can also have tokens.",
        "This device comes handy when, on analyzing a segment of input, we conclude that a certain slot filler is unavailable in the text.",
        "At the same time, if we know the identities of other slot fillers in the frame, we can come to certain conclusions about the nature of an absentee.",

        "This knowledge helps in finding referents for anaphoric phenomena.",
        "The dictionary entries represent IL concept and property types; IL texts consist of IL concept tokens (as well as IL clause and sentence tokens).",

        "One must note, however, that even in this case the semantics of the slots in the dictionary frames is different from that of the corresponding slots in the text frame.",
        "Some of the slot names in the type frames refer to the paradigmatic relationships of this concept type with other concept types.",
        "These are the type parameters of an IL dictionary entry.",
        "The rest of the information in an entry describes syntagmatic relationships that tokens of this particular type have with tokens of other types on an IL text.",
