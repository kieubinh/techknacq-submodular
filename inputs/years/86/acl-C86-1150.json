        "The English to Malay Translation System Background Computer Aided Translation (CAT) research at Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) began in 1976 as an individual research effort.",
        "However, at that time, the work is more appropriately classified under natural language data processing, including topics such as 'istilah' (terminology) information retrieval, Malay rootform extraction, parsing of Malay sentences using context-free grammars and Malay language teaching tools [Tong 78, Chang 78].",
        "In 1978, research into CAT was initiated, and by 1979, the researchers at USM began to develop granites models for English to Malay translation using the software tool ARIAKE [OEM 78].",
        "In 1980, a national workshop was conducted in USM, where a pilot English to Malay translation system was demonstrated.",
        "Financial support became available, and further development on the basic translation model was carried out [Tong 82, van Elinken 84, Zakarin 84].",
        "In 1984, a permanent C,arnputer-Aided-Translation Project unit was set up at USM, and full-time research staff were assigned to this project.",

        "The ARCANE system is an integrated software environment for computer-aided-translation, including tools for compiling grammars and dictionaries, and for processing corpus of the source and target texts.",
        "The CAT concepts behind this system is well-known and well-documented [Boitet and Vauguois 1985].",
        "This software has been programed using different levels of computer languages, from IBM assembly (PL360) to PL/I, and malting extensive use of system tools of the IBM 17M/CMS system - XEDIT and SKIS.",
        "One of its advantages is efficiency (as compared to other similar systems), which means that it can execute with reasonable speed even on a comparatively small computer system.",
        "USM's experience with the ARIAKE system has been very satisfactory, and we doubt very much if another system could have been migrated and utilised at this University with similar success.",
        "Although there bad been some criticises about ARCANE in the literature, our experience has shown that inspite of its recognised weaknesses and drawbacks, it remains an extremely powerful and practical set of tools for the development of CAT systems.",
        "Of course, the methodology pioneered at GEIA [Vauquola 75] has been incorporated into many 'new' systems today.",
        "On the physical side, the ARIAKE system itself occupies about 8 Mbyte of secondary storage, while the user machine requires another 5 Mbyte for storing the linguistic data (gramnar models and dictionaries, but not including the source and target texts and their intermediate results).",
        "A virtual memory size of 2 Mbytes is used for the execution of all the translations from English to Malay described in this report.",
        "Translation Model and Execution Time The English to Malay translation system consists of three main dictionaries - source English, English-Malay transfer, target Malay - and five grammar models.",
        "The size of these various components are as follows: Dictionaries: Source lexicals: 5,000 (11,000 words) Target lexica's: 4,000 (_ 9,000 words) Grammar models: lines rules morphological analysis 600 90 structural analysis 5600 300 structural transfer 800 47 structural generation 1700 120 morphological generation 91)0 120 The execution time for translation is estimated at 1.0097 MUM (million of instructions per word).",
        "This is consistent with times measured at GETA, Grenoble [Boitet and Vauquois 84].",
        "In practical terns, this means that on USA's IBM 4381 system (estimated at 2.1 MOPS), the translation time is approximately 0.48 second of virtual CPU time per word.",
        "This figure is based on the translation time Da.",
        "about 3,000 words taken from the selected text.",
        "The proportionate time for each phase of the translation process is as percent morphological analysis 0.33 structural analysis 55.21 lexical transfer 0.44 structural transfer 11.34 structural generation 31.47 morphological generation 1.21 From the above, it can be seen that the three dictionary retrieval phases together account for only 2 % of the time, while the structural analysis phase used up more than half the total time, with the rest taken up by the structural generation (about one-third) and the structural transfer phases.",

        "Some method of evaluating the ease of understanding of the source text and some definition of a neutral evaluator are prerequisites to any standardised evaluation scheme.",
        "The grading scheme proposed in this report is a measure of the time required to edit sentences translated by the computer, ranging from fast (as in grade A where no post-editing is required) to slow (as in grade F where a sentence has to be retranslated manually).",
        "There has been no attempt to categorise the source sentences into different degrees of difficulty or length.",
        "Hence, the typology of text used in this evaluation must be borne in mind when assessing the overall results.",
        "Although grades are assigned to individual sentences, the source texts were extracted by paragraphs, and hence, the continuity of the text is maintained.",
        "The actual grading itself wag carried out by more than one individual in order to reduce (as much as possible) the effect of individual 'Wan'.",
        "After careful scrutiny, it was concluded that variation in the results obtained is within expected limits, thus allowing broad conclusions to be drawn on the effectiveness/usefulness of the translation system.",
        "The grades assigned to translated sentences are as follows: A: correct translation, no modification required.",
        "B: list of alternative words selected by post-editor.",
