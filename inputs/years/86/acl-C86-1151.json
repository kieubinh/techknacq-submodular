        "The prototype aims to provide a diagnostic study that lays the foundations for further development rather than immediately producing an accurate but limited realisation.",
        "By way of experiment, the corpus for translation was based on selected extracts from computer systems manuals.",
        "After studying the basic material, as well as assessing the various decision criteria, it was decided to construct a prototype made up of three components : analysis, transfer and generation.",
        "Although the prototype was designed with multilingual applications in mind, it anpea-red preferable at this stage not to set un a system with interlingua since the elaboration of the interlingua alone would have taken up a disproportionate amount of time (King, Perschke, 1984), thus handicapping the development of the prototype itself.",

        "Moreover, all the capital letters placed at the beginning of sentences are converted to the lower case before analysis and are reintroduced during generation.",

        "The Augmented Transition Network (ATN) was selected for the analysis : it had successfully been used in many previous systems : LUNAR, SHRDLU, INTELLECT and, more recently, ENCSPAN (Leon, 1984).",

        "These were taken as the basis for the four (Sentence, Noun Phrase, Prepositional Phrase and Adjectival Phrase) of the prototype, thus making it Possible to speed tin the development of a parser which had already proved itself in other respects.",
        "The majority of the modifications made to the Winograd's ATN were aimed at increasing its performance (especially by dealing with the most common cases of coordination) as well as its determinist canacities thereby ensuring the accuracy of the initial analysis supplied by the system (it is in fact on this analysis that the transfer operates because the micro-commuter's memory was satura",
        "ted before it had managed to supply all possible analysis).",
        "2.4.",
        "Disambiguation Within the prototype framework, the creation of a disambiguation subcomponent would have taken up too much time and would not have been useful particularly that this research is deliberately designed to apply to only a limited corpus in which most of the ambiguities concern the Prepositional Phrase attachment and need not he solved for the translation if English into French.",

        "Source-Language dictionary For the various reasons explained above, the dictionary includes only complete forms.",

        "At present, the only compounds that the prototype dictionary accepts are locutions with a maximum of two consecutive words.",
        "Longer locutions, compound verbs and other discontinuous compounds, quite rare in the corpus, will be treated as follows at a later stage: all words liable to appear in compounds will be tagged with a pointer to this effect, to enable the preprocessing subcomponent to determine whether a compound or simple form is present in a given text.",

        "It should be noted that only third Person forms appear in the corpus studied.",
        "The verb phrase rewrites itself extensively in the following manner :",

        "Besides, one word in English may have several possible translations in French.",
        "For these reasons, it seemed convenient to create a transfer dictionary situated in between source and target language dictionaries in order to avoid excessive multiplication of relationships and also to facilitate the extension of the system to other language pairs.",

        "Others directly concern the morphology of the words, and are outlined briefly later on.",
        "In accordance with the theory of generative and transformational grammar, transformations occur in an orderly manner in an ascending cycle, that is to say from the inside, outwards, starting with the most subordinate clauses.",
        "Passive Transformation : e.g. : The entire field of booleans can be treated - active deep structure - Le champ entier de booleens pent etre traite.",

        "Transformation of Subordination, which correctly inserts the subordinate clauses : e.g. : Each bit may he used to store a logical value - Chaque bit peut etre employe pour memoriser une valour logique.",
        "Auxiliary Transformation : - if, in the rewrite of the verbal phrase, Avoir/Etre occur, the appropriate auxiliary is chosen depending on the feature specified in the target-language dictionary.",
        "Transformation Movement of the Adverb : e.g. : A virtual field item always occupies an inteeral number of 4-bit digits - Un article virtuel du charm occune toujours un nom-bre entier de chiffres de auatre hits.",
        "4.3.",
        "Morphological generation The morphological generation is made up of the following transformations : subject-verb agreement, conjugation, noun qualifier (which inserts 'de le' between a noun and its corn-element), insertion of determiner, noun agreement, determiner agreement, adjective agreement, placement of adjective, elision and contraction.",
        "5.",
