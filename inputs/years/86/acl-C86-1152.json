        "This paper describes a prototype English-Japanese machine translation (MT) system developed at the Science Institute of IBM Japan, Ltd.",
        "This MT system currently aims at the translation of IBM computer manuals.",
        "It is based on a transfer approach in which the transfer phase is divided into two sub-phases: English transformation and English-Japanese conversion.",
        "An outline of the system and a detailed description of the English-Japanese transfer method are presented.",
        "1.",
        "Introduction",
        "The Science Institute of IBM Japan, Ltd. has been involved in English-Japanese machine translation for four years (1).",
        "We have developed a prototype capable of translating IBM computer manuals into Japanese.",
        "This system is based on a transfer approach in which the transfer process consists of English transformation and English-Japanese conversion.",
        "This MT system aims at 1) high-quality translation; 2) an easily maintained transfer component; and 3) a smaller English-Japanese terminology dictionary.",
        "The transformation rules and the conversion rules are presently being constrpcted through tests using the IBM manual \"VM/SP General Information\" (60P).",
        "We are focusing on translation of IBM computer manuals for 3 reasons: 1) high-quality translation is expected in a limited area; 2) English IBM manuals are presumably written as clearly as possible according to an IBM internal standard; 3) we already had a practical English-Japanese terminology dictionary for human translators.",
        "Most MT systems developed in Europe and the U.S. deal with language pairs in the Indo-European language group (2).",
        "In the case of English-Japanese translation, since both languages are categorized in different language groups, a more powerful linguistic mechanism must be implemented.",
        "For instance, word order and sentence style are different and moreover an English word sometimes corresponds to more than one Japanese equivalent.",
        "To overcome these difficulties, an English-Japanese or Japanese-English MT system might be based on a transfer or interlingua approach with a wide range of tree-transducing capabilities and a semantic processing mechanism.",
        "2.",
        "Overview of the system",
        "Fig.",
        "1 shows the overall translation process.",
        "First of all, an English sentence is syntactically analysed in the English analysis phase.",
        "The output of this analysis is one or more English parse trees.",
        "Second, in the English-Japanese transfer phase, an English parse tree, or an English intermediate representation, is transferred to a corresponding Japanese tree, or a Japanese intermediate representation.",
        "During this transfer, an English parse tree is at first transformed by the transformation component to an English tree in Japanese-like style, and this result is converted to a Japanese tree by the English-Japanese conversion component.",
        "Finally, in the Japanese generation phase, one or more Japanese sentences are produced by operations such as generating Japanese auxiliary verbs, determining Japanese case particles, and rearranging word order.",
        "At present, the components shown in Fig. 1 are all implemented in LISP."

        "For analysing English, we are making use of the English parser, the English analysis grammar, and the English analysis dictionary developed by G.Heidorn et al.",
        "at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center (3).",
        "The English analysis is based on an augmented phrase structure grammar and is syntactically performed in a bottom-up and parallel manner.",
        "This English analysis aims at area-independent, high-performance and fail-soft analysis.",
        "The area-independent feature means portability of this analysis component to other application areas.",
        "The fail-soft feature is important for a practical MT system which should provide some Japanese segments for a human translator even if the parser fails to analyze the input sentence as a complete sentence.",
        "As the syntactic analysis of English sometimes produces more than one parse tree, the English parser computes metric values which indicate plausibility of the parse trees based on the characteristics of the modifications between phrases (4).",
        "When more than one parse tree is obtained by analysis, semantically incorrect parse trees are discarded during the English-Japanese transfer.",
        "If more than one Japanese tree remains after the transfer, the metric values copied from these English parse trees to corresponding Japanese trees are used to rank these Japanese trees in terms of plausibility.",
        "The Japanese tree which has the least value, namely the most plausible one, is chosen by the MT system."

        "Generally, the transfer process of a transfer approach including semantic processing tends to become complicated and then difficult to maintain.",
        "But a transfer approach seems to be the most straightforward for implementing human translators' knowledge which includes various types of linguistic information such as specific words, syntactic structures, and semantic information.",
        "There are many English-proper expressions, such as 'It-that', 'too-to', and 'there-be'.",
        "Their styles are very different from Japanese ones and have no simple contrast expressions in Japanese.",
        "The English-Japanese transfer component of our system is divided into two separate components: an English transformation component and an English-Japanese conversion component.",
        "We call.",
        "our approach a two-pass transfer method.",
        "By using English transformation rules, the English transformation component rewrites an English parse tree and produces a new style of English tree which is close to Japanese syntax.",
        "This can then easily be converted to a corresponding Japanese tree.",
        "When we expect different English expressions to be translated to the same Japanese expcession, we only have to write English transformation rules instead of E-J.",
        "transfer rules of a conventional transfer approach.",
        "Moreover, when we have a MT system change a Japanese expression, we are required only to modify some E-J conversion rules instead of modifying a larger number of relating E-J transfer rules.",
        "Consequently, the two-pass transfer method provides us with modularity and maintainability sf the transfer component."

        "English transformation is performed by using English transformation rules and a transformation dictionary.",
        "The transformation sometimes requires a derivative form of an English word, such as a verbal form of a noun and an adverbial form of an adjective.",
        "The transformation dictionary contains this sort of derivational data.",
        "The transformation rules are categorized into groups according to syntactic categories of nodes of parse trees.",
        "Each group is also classified into several subgroups.",
        "For example, the rule group for a sentence consists of 22 sub-groups, such as an inversion-rule sub-group, an insertion-rule sub-group, and an ellipsis-rule subgroup.",

        "At each node of a tree, a corresponding rule group is retrieved according to the syntactic type of the node and this rule group is applied to the sub-tree only once.",
        "In this application of the rule group, each subgroup is sequentially applied to the sub-tree only once.",
        "If a matching pattern of a transformation rule matches the sub-tree and a target pattern produces a new tree, the rest of the rules in the subgroup are no longer used and processing of the next subgroup begins.",
        "We have designed the rule groups and their subgroups to avoid backtracking and repetitive application of the same rule."

        "One of the basic approaches to semantic processing in MT is to use semantic markers of nouns.",
        "We have defined 24 semantic markers specific to computer manuals, which will be effective in translating IBM computer manuals.",
        "Table 1 lists all of the semantic markers and their meanings.",
        "Nouns in computer manuals have one or more semantic markers.",
        "For example, \"file\" has \"LC\" and \"LE\", \"program\" has \"LE\", and \"operator\" has \"LE\" and \"HM\".",

        "Fig.",
        "2 shows an example of an entry of the verb-dictionary in the case of \"provide\".",
        "The upper half of the description in Fig. 2 specifies that if the subject of a sentence has semantic marker \"LE\" or \"UD\" and the first object has marker \"FA\" or \"AT\", then choose the Japanese case particle \"ga\" for the first Japanese noun phrase, the Japanese case particle \"wo\" for the second one, and the Japanese verb \"sonae\" as the proper, equivalent for the English verb \"provide\".",
        "\"Yl\" and \"PY1\" in Fig. 2 specify types of corresponding Japanese sub-trees to be generated.",
        "The lower half of the description gives a similar rule to the previous one except for an additional condition on a prepositional phrase.",
        "This part specifies that if the conditions are met, then use Japanese case particles \"ga\", \"ni\", and \"wo\" in this order and select \"teikyo\" as the appropriate Japanese verb.",

        "This conversion must be more efficient than in the case where deep cases are introduced so as to pursue similar semantic processing.",
        "This conversion determines an appropriate Japanese verb, Japanese case particles, and Japanese syntax of a simple sentence at the same time.",
        "In some cases, an appropriate Japanese equivalent for an English noun phrase is successfully selected based on these conditions when the English noun phrase has more than one Japanese equivalent.",
        "Moreover, application of these entries also means a semantic check of the input from the computer area's point of view.",
        "Consequently, if there is no entry applicable to the input simple sentence, it is deemed inappropriate for computer manuals and is rejected by the system.",
        "This contributes to disambiguation of English analysis trees.",

        "Our MT system facilitates a component for translating SNPs.",
        "Even if the terminology dictionary does not have the entry in whole, a long SNP which is composed of many words is successfully translated by appropriately assembling the dictionary data of all elements of the SNP.",
        "This is mainly due to the similarity of syntax of SNPs between English and Japanese.",
        "The functions of the SNP translation component are to choose appropriate Japanese equivalents for various parts-of-speech(e.g. noun, adjective, adverb); to insert \"no\" between noun phrases; to reorder Japanese equivalents; to process conjunctions within a simple noun phrase; and to handle hyphenated words.",
        "These are achieved by using a special dictionary for translating SNPs and co-occurrence frequency data of words or semantic markers in IBM computer manuals.",
        "The English-Japanese conversion component subsequently converts a transformed English tree to a Japanese tree in a bottom-up and parallel manner along the English tree.",
        "First of all, the English-Japanese conversion dictionary is searched for all English words which are terminal symbols of the English parse tree.",
        "This is part of English-Japanese conversion of the lowest level sub-trees of the English tree.",
