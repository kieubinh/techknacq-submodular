        "BBN's responsibility is to conduct research and development in natural language interface technology.",
        "This responsibility has three aspects: o to demonstrate state – of – the – art technology in a Strategic Computing application, collecting data regarding the effectiveness of the demonstrated heuristics, o to conduct research in natural language interface technology, as itemized in the description of JANUS later in this note, and o to integrate technology from other natural language interface contractors, including USC/Information Sciences Institute, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Massachusetts.",
        "Of the three initial applications described in the overview, the Fleet Command Center Battle Management Program (FCCBMP) has been the application providing the domain in which our work is being carried out.",
        "The FCCBMP encompasses the development of expert system capabilities at the Pacific Fleet Command Center in Hawaii, and the development of an integrated natural language interface to these new capabilities as well as to the existing data bases and graphic display facilities.",
        "BBN is developing a series of increasingly sophisticated natural language understanding systems which will serve as an integrated interface to several facilities at the Pacific Fleet Command Center: the Integrated Data Base (IDB), which contains information about ships, their readiness states, their capabilities, etc.",
        "; the Operations Support Group Prototype (OSGP), a graphics system which can display locations and itineraries of ships on maps; and the Force Requirements Expert System (FRESH) which is being built by Texas Instruments.",

        "Currently they do not access the data base or OSGP application programs themselves; instead, on a round – the – clock basis, two operators act as intermediaries between the Navy staff and the computers.",
        "The utility of a natural language interface in such an environment is clear.",
        "The starting point for development of the natural language interface system at the Pacific Fleet Command Center was the IRUS system, which has been under development at BBN for a number of years.",
        "A new version of this system, IRUS-86, has been installed in the FCCBMP testbed area at the Pacific Fleet Command Center for demonstration.",
        "Further basic research on the problems of natural language interfacing is continuing, and the results of this and future research will be incorporated into a next generation natural language interface system called JANUS, to be delivered to the Pacific Fleet Command Center at a later date.",
        "JANUS will share most of its domain – dependent data with IRUS-86, and it will share other modules as well; IRUS-86 will therefore be able to evolve gradually into the final version of JANUS.",
        "2 IRUS-86: The Initial Test Bed System The architecture of IRUS [Bates 83] is a cascade consisting of a sequence of translation modules: o An ATN parser which produces a syntactic tree.",
        "o A semantic interpreter which produces a formula of the meaning representation language MRL.",
        "o A postprocessor for resolving anaphora and ellipsis.",
        "o A translation module which produces a formula of the relational data base language ERL (\"Extended Relational Language\").",
        "o A translation module which produces a sequence of commands for the underlying data base access system.",
        "IRUS-86, the version of IRUS which is now installed at the Pacific Fleet Command Center, is a version of IRUS which is extended in several ways.",
        "Two of these extensions are especially worth mentioning: o IRUS-86 uses the NIKL system [Moser 83] to represent its domain model, i.e., the relationships between the predicates and relations of the meaning representation language MRL.",
        "The NIKL domain model supports the system's treatment of semantic anomaly, anaphora, and nominal compounds."

        "o IRUS-86 contains a new module which exploits this NIKL domain model to simplify MRL expressions; this makes it possible to translate complex MRL-expressions into ERL constants, thus allowing for significant divergences between the input English and the structure of the underlying data base [Stallard 86].",
        "In addition to accessing the NIKL domain model, the parser, semantic interpreter and MRL – to – ERL translator access other knowledge sources which contain domain – dependent information: o the lexicon, o the semantic interpretation rules for individual concepts, o the MRL – to – ERL mapping rules for individual MRL constants, which introduce the details of underlying system structure, such as file and field names.",
        "To port IRUS to the navy domain, the relevant domain – dependent data had to be supplied to the system.",
        "This task is being accomplished by personnel at the Naval Ocean Systems Center (NOSC).",
        "In August, 1985, BBN provided NOSC with an initial prototype system containing small example sets of lexical entries, semantic interpretation rules, and MRL – to – ERL rules; using acquisition tools provided by BBN, NOSC personnel have been entering the rest of the data.",
        "IRUS-86 was delivered to the FRESH developers at Texas Instruments in January 1986, was installed in a test bed area of the Pacific Fleet Command Center in April 1986, and will be demonstrated in June 1986.",
        "Currently, the lexicon and the domain – dependent rules of the system only cover a relatively small part of the OSGP capabilities and the files and attributes of the Integrated Data Base.",
        "Once enough data have been entered so that the system covers a sufficiently large part of the data base, it will be tried out in actual use by Navy personnel.",
        "This will enable us to gather data about the way the system performs in a real environment, and to fine – tune the system in various respects.",
        "For instance, IRUS-86 makes use of shallow heuristic methods to address some aspects of natural language understanding such as anaphora and ellipsis for which general solutions are still research issues.",
        "The FCCBMP application provides a test bed in which such heuristic methods can be evaluated, and enhancements to them developed and tested, as part of the evolutionary technological growth intended to continue throughout the Natural Language Technology effort of the Strategic Computing Program."

        "The IRUS-86 system excels by its clean, modular structure, its broad syntactic/semantic coverage, its sophisticated domain model, and its systematic treatment of discrepancies between the English lexicon and the data base structure.",
        "We thus expect that it will demonstrate considerable utility as an interface component in the FCCBMP application.",
        "Nevertheless, IRUS-86 shares with other current systems several limitations which should be overcome if natural language interfaces are to become truly \"natural\".",
        "In developing JANUS, the successor of IRUS-86, we shall attempt to overcome some of those limitations.",
        "The areas of increased functionality we are considering are: semantics and knowledge representation, ill – formedness, discourse, cooperativeness, multiple underlying systems, and knowledge acquisition."
      ]
    },
    {
      "heading": "3.1 Semantics and Knowledge Representation",
      "text": [
        "IRUS-86, like most other current systems, represents sentence meanings as formulas of a logical language which is a slight extension of first – order logic.",
        "As a consequence, many important phenomena in English have no equivalent in the meaning representation language, and cannot be dealt with correctly, e.g., modalities, propositional attitudes, generics, collective quantification, and context – dependence.",
        "Thus, one foregoes one of the most important potential assets of a natural language interface: the capacity of expressing complex semantic structures in a succinct and comfortable way.",
        "In JANUS, we will therefore adopt a new meaning representation language which combines features from PHILIQA1's enriched lambda – calculus [Scha 76] with ideas underlying Montague's Intensional Logic [Montague 70], and possibly a distributed quote – operator [Haas 86].",
        "It will have sufficient expressive power to incorporate a version of Carlson's treatment of generics [Carlson 79], a version of Scha's treatment of quantification [Scha 81], Montague's treatment of modality, and various possible approaches to propositional attitudes and context – dependence.",
        "In adopting a higher order logic as proposed, one confronts problems of formula simplification and the need to apply meaning postulates to reduce the semantic representation of an input sentence to an expression appropriate to the underlying system, e.g., a relational algebra expression in the case that the underlying system is a data base.",
        "To do this, we will investigate the limited inference mechanisms of KL-TWO [Moser 83, Vilain 85], following up on our previous work [Stallard 86].",
        "The advantage of these inference mechanisms is their tractability; discovering their power and limitations in this complex problem domain should be an interesting result."

        "A substantial amount of work has been done already on several of these issues, much of it by BBN researchers [Sidner 85, Hinrichs 81, Polanyi 84, Grosz 861 Research in this area continues under a separate DARPA – funded contract.",
        "We .expect to be able to integrate some of the results of that research in the JANUS system.",
        "3.3 III – formedness A natural interface system should be forgiving of a user's deviations from its expectations, be they misspellings, typographical errors, unknown words, poor syntax, incorrect presuppositions, fragmentary forms, or violated selection restrictions.",
        "Empirical studies show that as much as 25% of the input to data base query systems is ill – formed.",
        "IRUS currently handles some classes of ill – formedness by using a combinfition of shallow heuristics and user interaction.",
        "It can correct for typographical misspellings, for omitted determiners or prepositions, and for some ungrammaticalities, like determiner – noun and subject – verb disagreement.",
        "The JANUS system will employ a more general approach to ill – formedness that will handle a larger class of ungrammatical constructions and a larger class of word selection problems, and that will also explore correcting several types of semantic ill – formedness.",
        "These capabilites have major implications for the control of the understanding process, since considering such possibilities can exponentially expand the search space.",
        "Maintaining control will require care in integrating the ill – formedness capability into the rest of the system, and also making maximal use of the guidance that can be derived from a model of the discourse and user's goals to constrain the search."
