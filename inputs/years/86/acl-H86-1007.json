        "At the beginning of the effort, a set of domain – independent software components, developed through fundamental research efforts dating back as much as seven years, existed.",
        "The IRUS software [1] consists of two subsystems: one for linguistic processing and one for adding specifics of the back end.",
        "The first subsystem is linguistic in nature, while the second subsystem is not.",
        "Linguistic processing includes morphological, syntactic, semantic, and discourse analysis to generate a formula in logic corresponding to the meaning of an English input.",
        "The linguistic subsystem is application – independent and also independent of data base interfaces.",
        "(This is achieved by factoring all application specifics into the back end processor or into knowledge bases such as dictionary entries and case frame rules, that are domain – specific.)",
        "The non – linguistic components convert the logical form to the code necessary for a given underlying system, such as a relational data base.",
        "The IRUS system, or its components, had been used extensively in the laboratory, not just at BBN, but also in research projects at USC/Information Sciences Institute, the University of Delaware, GTE Research, and General Motors Research.",
        "However, it had not been exercised thoroughly outside of a research environment.",
        "Our goals in participating in the Strategic Computing Program are manifold: o To test the collection of state – of – the – art heuristics for natural language processing with a user community trying to solve their problems on a daily basis.",
        "o To test the heuristics on a broad, extensive domain.",
        "o To incorporate research ideas (which are often developed in relative isolation in the laboratory) into a complete system so that effective evaluation and refinement can occur.",
        "o To continue the feedback loop of incorporating new research ideas, testing them in a complete system with real users, evaluating the results, and refining the research accordingly on a repeated basis for several years.",
        "There are several accomplishments in the first year and a half of this work.",
        "First, the IRUS software has been delivered to the Naval Ocean Systems Center (NOSC) so that their team may encode the dictionary information, case frame rules, and transformation rules for generating queries appropriate for the underlying systems.",
        "The NOSC staff involves a linguist plus individuals trained in computer science, but",
        "does not involve experts in natural language processing nor in artificial intelligence.",
        "Second, the natural language interface software has been delivered to Texas Instruments (TI), which has integrated it into the Force Requirements Expert System (FRESH).",
        "Demonstrations of the natural language interface are being given at several conferences this year as well as to the navy personnel at the Pacific Fleet Command Center.",
        "Testing and evaluation of IRUS, both its software and the knowledge bases defined by NOSC for the FCCBMP, will be carried out in the spring of 1986, by the Navy Personnel Research and Development Center.",
        "In this section and section two we present evidence that this is one of the most ambitious applications and tests of natural language processing ever attempted.",
        "Section two provides more background regarding the technical challenges inherent in the application environment and in the goals of the Strategic Computing Program.",

        "Examples are clearing a window and aborting a request.",

        "In addition to the enhancements we have mentioned earlier regarding the semantic interpreter, linguistic knowledge acquisition tools, and discourse processing, there are three substantial areas of research and development possible.",
        "First, research in ill – formed input is necessary in order to allow for additional grammatical problems in the input and for relaxation of semantic constraints, e.g., to allow for figures of speech.",
        "The problem with an ill – formed input is that there is no interpretation which satisfies all linguistic constraints.",
        "Therefore, the very constraints that limit search must be relaxed, thereby opening Pandora's Box in terms of the number of alternatives in the search space.",
        "Not only IRUS, but apparently all systems that process any ill – formed input attain the success they do by considering very few kinds of ill – formed input and by assuming that semantic constraints can never be violated.4 Consequently, determining what the user meant in an ill – formed input is a substantial problem requiring research.",
        "Second, we propose exploring parallel architectures to add functional capability.",
        "Run time performance of IRUS on a Symbolics machine is quite acceptable.",
        "Typical inputs are fully processed to give the target language input to the underlying system within a few seconds; naturally, the relational data base and underlying expert systems are not expected to be able to perform at comparable speeds.",
        "There are three areas where functional performance could be improved by parallelism.",
        "1.",
        "The current system ranks the partial parses using both semantic and syntactic information, and it explores those partial parses based on following up the most promising one first.",
        "The technique is relatively effective, but clearly not infallible.",
        "Finding all interpretations and then",
        "ranking them based not only on local syntactic and semantic tests but also on global semantic,.",
        "pragmatic, and discourse information is critical to improving the identification of what the user intended.",
        "2.",
        "A second area related to the first, is greater coverage of ill – formed input.",
        "As mentioned earlier, ill – formedness requires relaxing the rules that constrain search; therefore the search space grows dramatically in processing an ill – formed input.",
        "3.",
        "Real – time, large vocabulary, large branching factor, continuous speech recognition is beyond the state of the art, and requires highly parallel machines to support speech signal processing.",
        "While this is highly desirable, it is not part of our current effort.",
        "Within the next two years we intend to replace the ATN grammar with a declarative, side – effect free grammar and a parallel parsing algorithm, following work reported in [16].",
        "Third, our evolving system is being interfaced to the Penman generation component from USC/Information Sciences Institute (USC/ISI) [8].",
        "Penman is based upon systemic linguistics.",
        "The ultimate goal of the effort with USC/ISI is twofold: to have systems that can understand whatever they generate and to achieve this by having common knowledge sources for the lexicon, for the NIKL model of domain predicates, and for discourse information."

        "Though the project will be ongoing for several years yet, there are several preliminary conclusions from the first year and a half of effort, given the constraints and goals mentioned in section two.",
        "1.",
        "Providing language coverage for this broad application with multiple underlying systems has not been a problem.",
        "However, since determining what system(s) must be accessed for a given input is a research problem that has been little addressed, only simple linguistic clues are used in the current version.",
        "The problem in general involves not only reasoning about the capabilities of the underlying systems [7] but also significant linguistic issues.",
        "For instance, if one says Show me the carriers whose condition code changed in the last 24 hours, either a list (from the data base) or a map (from OSGP) is appropriate.",
        "If one says Show me a display of the carriers whose condition code changed in the last 24 hours, only OSGP is appropriate.",
        "The linguistic cue is display.",
        "Furthermore, some contexts favor one underlying system over the other, requiring the system to maintain a dialogue context model, including the user's inferred goals in the dialogue, in order to integrate cues from dialogue context with the linguistic cues.",
        "2.",
        "The architecture has supported transportability well.",
        "For instance, this new application required only minor changes to the grammar and morphological analyzer.",
        "As FRESH has been further defined and as the data base structure has evolved, only small local changes have been required to the content of the knowledge bases.",
        "Should a data base machine replace the",
        "current data base management system in Hawaii, only two to three person weeks should be needed to generate the new target language.",
        "However, more sophisticated linguistic knowledge acquisition tools not dependent on the type of the underlying application system are a critical goal for NLI both for far greater applicability of the technology and for far broader availability of NLIs.",
        "3.",
        "The success of this effort as a technology testbed depends on evaluation after installation at the Pacific Fleet Command Center and on the success of the architecture to support substantial enhancements, such as the planned semantic interpreter based on compositional semantics and the planned parallel parser.",
        "However, it already has supported massive changes well, such as the change in underlying knowledge representation when NIKL was introduced.",
        "The potential of the testbed is great because it offers empirical research of a realistic kind unfortunately largely lacking heretofore; the placement of TQA in the hands of users to solve their daily problems for a year [4] is a notable exception.",
        "The results of research on heuristics for definite reference; semantic ambiguity; ellipsis; syntactically or semantically ill – formed input; and inference from world knowledge and context, to name a few studied in isolation, must be tested in a complete system.",
        "The opportunity in the FCCBMP will help to determine the effectiveness of such heuristics in a large diverse application domain where combinatorial issues cannot be ignored.",
        "Collecting corpora in an experiment can be highly instructive, as shown in [20].",
        "However, corpus collection using people solving their own problems provides an uncommon degree of realism and legitimacy to the empirical process."
