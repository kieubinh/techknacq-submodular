        "Considerable progress has been made in developing systems which understand short passages of technical text.",
        "Several prototypes have been developed, for such domains as patient medical records [Sager 1978], equipment failure reports [Marsh 1984], and intelligence messages [Montgomery 1983].",
        "Except for very narrow domains such as weather reports, however, none of these systems seem to be robust enough for operational use.",
        "Typical success rates - where any are reported - are in the range of 70 to 80% of sentences correctly analyzed; substantially better rates are very hard to obtain, even with careful system tuning t .",
        "Our objective in developing PROTEUS (the PROtotype TExt Understanding System) is to see if this rate can be substantially improved for a domain of moderate complexity.",
        "In order to achieve this improvement, we must bring to bear on the language analysis task the various syntactic, semantic, and discourse constraints, along with a fairly detailed knowledge of the domain of discourse.",
        "Our system is initially being applied to equipment failure reports (\"CASREPs\") for selected equipment on board Navy ships (initially, the equipment in the starting air system); a sample message is shown in Figure 1.",
        "In this case, the domain knowledge is the knowledge of the structure and function of these pieces of equipment.",
        "In this paper we first present an overview of the PROTEUS system.",
        "We then focus on the domain information: how it is represented, how it is integrated with the language processing, and how it serves to resolve ambiguities in the input text."

        "These systems used domain-specific frame-like target structures, and employed selectional constraints to weed out bad parses, but did not incorporate detailed domain models.",
        "Our experience with these systems - in particular, the difficulty of obtaining success rates (% of sentences correctly analyzed) much above 75% led us to our work on PROTEUS.",

        "The PROTEUS system has three major components: a syntactic analyzer, a semantic analyzer, and a discourse analyzer.",
        "The syntactic analyzer parses the input and regularizes the clausal syntactic structure.",
        "The semantic analyzer converts this to a \"logical form\" specifying states and actions with reference to specific components of the equipment.",
        "The discourse component establishes temporal and causal links between these states and actions.",
        "Initial implementations have been completed of the syntactic and semantic components, so that we are able to generate semantic representations of individual sentences.",
        "The discourse component is still under development, and so will not be discussed further here.",
        "The syntactic analyzer uses an augmented-context-free grammar and an active chart parser.",
        "The grammar is generally based on linguistic string theory and the Linguistic String Project English Grammar [Sager 1981] and includes extensions to handle the various sentence fragment forms found in these messages [Marsh 1983]; it is written in a modified form of the Restriction Language used by the NYU Linguistic String Parser [Sager 1975].",
        "Syntactic regularization maps the various forms of clauses (active, passive, relative, reduced relative, fragmentary) into a canonical form (verb operand), operand2...) The regularization is performed by a set of interpretation rules which are associated with the individual productions and which build the regularized syntactic structure compositionally.2 2 The parser and syntactic regularization procedures were developed by Jean Mark Gawron.",
        "The regularization procedures were modeled after those developed for a GPSG parser [Gawron 1982], although the generated structures are quite different.",
        "The semantic analysis component consists of two parts: clause semantics and noun phrase semantics.",
        "The clause semantics maps a clause (a verb plus operands which include syntactic case labels) into a predicate with arguments representing a state or action.",
        "Each verb and operand belongs to one or more semantic classes.",
        "Clause semantics relys on a set of pattern-action rules to perform the translation, with one pattern for each valid combination of verb and operand classes.",
        "Noun phrase semantics maps a noun phrase into the identifier of the equipment component specified by that phrase.",
        "Noun phrase semantics depends heavily on the equipment model, and so will be discussed further in a later section.",
        "(The division between the two parts of semantic analysis is not quite so neat as the foregoing would suggest.",
        "Some noun phrases are nominalizations representing states or actions; these are processed by clause semantics.",
        "In many noun phrases, some modifiers identify the object and the remainder describe its state.",
        "For example, in \"broken hub ring gear\", hub and ring identify the gear, broken describes its state.",
        "We return to this problem in our description of noun phrase semantics below.)",
        "Our long-term objective is to dynamically schedule among the three analysis components (syntax, semantics, and discourse), as is done in some blackboard models.",
        "For program development, however, we have found it better to use a sequential organization (first syntax, then semantics, then discourse).",
        "In order to have syntactic choices influenced by semantics and discourse, and semantic choices influenced by discourse, each component may generate multiple analyses, some of which are rejected by later stages.",
        "Sometime these multiple analyses are transmitted explicitly, as a list of alternatives.",
        "More often, however, they are transmitted using a representation neutral with respect to particular features.",
        "The output of syntactic analysis is neutral with respect to quantifier scope.",
        "It is also neutral with respect to the distribution of modifiers in conjoined noun phrases (for example, in ''filter change and adjustment of pressure regulator,\" whether filter modifies adjustment and of pressure regulator modifies change).",
        "Furthermore, it does not assign structure to prenominal adjectives and nouns (so for example, in the phrase \"low lube oil pressure alarm\" it does not decide whether low modifies lube, oil, pressure, or alarm).",
        "This system development has been conducted in close cooperation with a group at the System Development Corp., Paoli, PA. Their system, PUNDIT [Palmer 1986], is written in PROLOG but has many points of commonality with PROTEUS in terms of overall structure, grammar, and semantic representation.",

        "The leaves of the part-whole hierarchy are called basic parts; the internal nodes (composite objects) are called systems.",
        "We record for each system the primary medium which it provides, conveys, or transforms; in our starting air system, the three media are compressed air, lubricating oil, and mechanical rotation.",
        "We have organized our part-whole hierarchy in part along functional lines (rather than purely on physical proximity), grouping together parts which are connected together and operate on the same medium.",
        "Since some parts are identified by their physical location, we provide a location field in both basic part and system nodes.",
        "Both types of nodes also have a function field, which indicates the effect of this part on the media or other parts.",
        "Nodes of specific types may have additional fields; for example, some mechanical components have a speed field.",
        "All of the fields just mentioned record permanent characteristics of the parts.",
        "In addition, each node has an operational-status field, which holds information about a part which is reported in a message.",
        "The model contains a lot of information about equipment structure which is specific to a particular piece of equipment.",
        "Some information, however, is more general: for example, that gears have teeth,or that impellors have blades.",

        "Instead we create an instance of the teeth for a specific gear when it is referenced in the text.",

        "The syntactic analysis component analyzes the clause structure and delimits the noun phrases, but does not assign any structure to the pre-nominal modifiers.",
        "The noun phrase analyzer within the semantic component therefore has a dual role: to determine the structure of the pre-nominal modifiers and to identify the instance in the equipment model named by the noun phrase (or the set of instances, if this phrase could be applied to any of several parts).",
        "(Although there are a limited number of instances, it is not possible to record a single name for each part and then interpret noun phrases by simply looking the name up in a table.",
        "A single part can be named in many different ways -- depending in part on prior context -- so a full-fledged interpretation procedure is required.)",
        "The noun phrase is analyzed bottom-up using a set of reduction rules.",
        "Each reduction rule combines the head of a phrase with some of its modifiers to form a larger constituent.",
        "By reference to the model, each rule also determines the set of instances which can be named by the constituent; if the set is empty, the application of the rule is rejected.",
        "Reductions are performed repeatedly until the entire phrase is reduced to a single constituent.",
        "If no such reduction is possible, the syntactic analysis is rejected; in this way noun phrase semantics can weed out some incorrect syntactic analyses.",

        "The model class indicates how the word can be related to some entity in the domain model.",
        "One value of model class is instance, specifying that the word names a set of instances in the model; this set is also included in the dictionary entry.",
        "Examples are \"pump\", \"shaft\", \"gear\", etc.",
        "Larger constituents built while analyzing the noun phrase are also considered to be of type instance.",
        "One reduction rule allows us to combine two instances: instance + instance â€“ instance for example, \"LO\" + \"PUMP\" â€“ \"LO PUMP\", \"SAC\" + (\"LO PUMP\") â€“ \"SAC LO PUMP\".",
        "The set of model instances for the result consists of those instances of the second constituent which can be linked through some path in the model to some instance of the first constituent.",
        "The types of links traversed in the search are a function of the semantic class of the first constituent; for example, \"SAC\" has the semantic class machinery, so we search the part/whole links, the location links, and the from/to links (which tie together components of the same system).",
        "There are several other model classes and corresponding reduction rules.",
        "The class slot filler is used for words which are values of features of instances, but are not themselves instances (for example, \"LUBE\" in the phrase \"LUBE OIL\").",
        "The class slot-name is used for words which correspond to feature names, such as \"SPEED\" in \"HIGH SPEED ASSEMBLY\".",
        "The class component is used for parts which (as explained in the previous section) are not instantiated in the permanent equipment model but can be instantiated dynamically as needed.",
        "Modifiers describing the state of a part, such as \"cracked\" or \"sheared\", are handled differently.",
        "If noun phrase semantics gets the input \"sheared ring gear\" it will look for an instance of ring gear with the operational-state \"sheared\".",
        "Such an instance would be present if a previous sentence had mentioned that a gear was sheared.",
        "If such an instance is found, it is identified as the correct referent; noun phrase semantics has in effect done anaphora resolution.",
        "If no instance is found, noun phrase semantics returns the instances of \"ring gear\" and the leftover modifier \"sheared\".",
        "Clause semantics (which invokes noun phrase semantics) then treats this like a clause \"ring gear was sheared\"; later in the processing of this sentence, this will cause \"sheared\" to be assigned as the operational-state of ring gear.",
        "A related technique can be used to handle some of the ambiguities in cojoined noun phrases.",
        "For example, in the sentence !INVESTIGATION REVEALED STRIPPED LO PUMP DRIVE AND HUB RING GEAR\", syntax alone cannot determine which of the modifiers \"STRIPPED\", \"LO\", \"PUMP\", or \"DRIVE\" also modify \"HUB RING GEAR\".",
        "So syntax marks these as possibly applicable to \"HUB RING GEAR\" and passes the phrase to semantics.",

        "This process is part of semantic analysis but also plays a role in syntactic analysis and discourse analysis.",
        "In addition to the elaboration of the existing components, substantial work will be required in at least two areas before we can hope to obtain a robust text processing system.",
        "First, we are developing a discourse component to identify temporal and plausible causal links between sentences.",
        "This information is needed not only for some of the applications (e.g., message summarization) but also to resolve some of the syntactic and semantic ambiguities in the messages.",
        "Second, we will need to move from a pass/fail strategy for enforcing our constraints to a best-fit strategy.",
        "Because of imperfections in the input, and the",
        "inevitable omissions in a model as complex as ours, we must expect that many messages will violate one or another constraint; by employing a rich set of constraints, however, and selecting the analysis which violates the fewest constraints, we beleive that we will be able to identify the intended reading for most sentences.",
        "The initial motivation for the system has been the conversion of a stream of messages to a data base for subsequent querying, summarization, and trend analysis.",
        "However, the use of a detailed equipment model, similar to that employed in simulation and diagnostic systems, suggests that it may be equally useful as an interface for such systems.",
        "A diagnostic system, for example, would then be able to accept initial observations in the form of a brief textual summary rather than force the user to go through an elaborate questionnaire; this may be a substantial advantage for broad-coverage diagnostic systems, which must be able to accept a wide variety of â€¢different symptoms."
