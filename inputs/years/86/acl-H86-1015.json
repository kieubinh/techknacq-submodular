        "Tree Adjoining Grammars, or wl'AG's\", (Joshi, Levy & Takahashi 1975; Joshi 1983; Kroch & Joshi 1985) were developed as an alternative to the standard syntactic formalisms that are used in theoretical analyses of language.",
        "They are attractive because they may provide just the aspects of context sensitive expressive power that actually appear in human languages while otherwise remaining context free.",
        "This paper describes how we have applied the theory of Tree Adjoining Grammars to natural language generation.",
        "We have been attracted to TAG's because their central operation – the extension of an 'initial\" phrase structure tree through the inclusion, at very specifically constrained locations, of one or more \"auxiliary\" trees – corresponds directly to certain central operations of our own, performance-oriented theory.",
        "We begin by briefly describing TAG's as a formalism for phrase structure in a competence theory, and summarize the points in the theory of TAG'S that are germaine to our own theory.",
        "We then consider generally the position of a grammar within the generation process, introducing our use of TAG's through a contrast with how others have used systemic grammars.",
        "This takes us to the core results of our paper: using examples from our research with well-written texts from newspapers, we walk through our TAG inspired treatments of raising and wh-movement, and show the correspondence of the TAG \"adjunction\" operation and our \"attachment\" process.",
        "In the final section we discuss extensions to the theory, motivated by the way we use the operation corresponding to TAG'S' adjunction in performance.",
        "This suggests that the competence theory of TAG's can be profitably projected to structures at the morphological level as well as the present syntactic level."

        "The theoretical apparatus of a TAG consists of a primitively defined set of \"elementary\" phrase structure trees, a \"linking\" relation that can be used to define dependency relations between two nodes within an elementary tree, and an \"adjunction\" operation that combines trees under specifiable constraints.",
        "The elementary trees are divided into two sets: initial and auxiliary.",
        "Initial trees have only terminals at their leaves.",
        "Auxiliary trees are distinguished by having one non-terminal among their leaves; the category of this node must be the same as the category of the root.",
        "All elemental trees are \"minimal\" in the sense that they do not recurse on any non-terminal.",
        "A node NI in an elementary tree may be linked (co-indexed) to a second node N2 in the same tree provided NI c-commands N2.",
        "Linking is used to indicate grammatically defined dependencies between nodes such as subcategorization relationships or filler-gap dependencies.",
        "Links are preserved (though \"stretched out\") when their tree is extended through adjunction; this is the mechanism TAG's use to represent unbounded dependencies.",
        "Sentence derivations start with an initial tree, and continue via the adjunction of an arbitrary number of auxiliary trees.",
        "To adjoin an auxiliary tree A with root category X to a initial (or derived) tree T, we first select some node of category X within T to be the point at which the adjunction is to occur.",
        "Then (1) the subtree of T dominated by that instance of X (call it X') is removed from T, (2) the auxiliary tree A is knit into T at the position where X' had been located, and (3) the subtree dominated by X' is knit into A to replace the second occurence of the category X 'at T's frontier.",
        "The two trees have now been merged by \"splicing\" A into T, displacing the subtree of T at the point of the adjunction to the frontier of A.",
        "For example we could take the initial tree: Es Whoi does [s John like ei I (the subscript \"i\" indicates that the \"who\" and the trace \"e\" are linked) and adjoin to it the auxiliary tree: Es Bill believes S ] to produce the derived tree: [s- Whoi does Es Bill believe Es John likes ei 1] I"

        "A TAG specifies surface structure.",
        "There is no notion of derivation from deep structure in the theory of TAG'S – the primitive trees are not transformed or otherwise changed once they are introduced into a text, only combined with other primitive trees.",
        "As Kroch and Joshi point out, this means that a TAG is incomplete as an account of the structure of a natural language, e.g. a TAG grammar will contain both an active and a passive form of the same verbal subcategorization pattern, without an theory-mediated description of the very close relationship between them.",
        "To our minds this is by no means a deficit.",
        "The procedural machinery that generative grammars have traditionally carried with them to characterize relations like that of active to passive has only gotten in the way of employing those characterizations in processing models of generation.",
        "This is because a generation model, like any theory of performance, has a procedural structure of its own and cannot coexist with an incompatible one, at least not while still operating efficiently or while retaining a simple mapping from its actual machine to the virtual machine that its authors put forward as their account of psycholinguistic data.",
        "Our own generator uses surface structure as its only explicitly represented linguistic level.",
        "Thus grammatical formalisms that dwell on the rules governing surface form are more useful to us than those that hide those rules in a deep to surface transformational process.",
        "A TAG involves the manipulation of very small elementary structures.",
        "This is because of the stipulation that elementary trees may not include recursive nodes.",
        "It implies that the sentences one sees in everyday usage, e.g. newpaper texts, are the result of many sucessive adjunctions.",
        "This melds nicely with a move that we have made in recent years to view the conceptual representation from which generation proceeds as consisting of a heap of very small, redundantly related information units that have been deliberately selected by a text planning process from the total state of the knowledge base at the time of utterance; each such unit will correspond in the final text to a head lexical item plus selected thematic arguments – a linguistic entity that is easily projected onto the elementary trees of a TAG.",
        "TAG theory includes only one operation, adjunction, and otherwise makes no changes to the elementary trees that go into a text.",
        "This comports well with the indelibility stipulation in our model of generation, since selected text fragments can be used directly as specified by the grammar without the need for any later transformation.",
        "The composition options delimited by the constraints on adjunction given with a TAG define a space of alternative text forms which can correspond directly in generation to alternative conceptual relations among information units, alternatives in rhetorical intent, and alternatives in prose style."

        "To understand why we are looking at TAG'S rather than some other formalism, one must first understand the role of grammar within our processing model.",
        "The following is a brief summary of the model; a more complete description can be found in McDonald & Pustejovsky [1985b].",
        "We have always had two complementary goals in our research: on the one hand our generation program has had to be of practical utility to the knowedge based expert systems that use it as part of a natural language interface.",
        "This means that architecturally our generator has always been designed to produce text from conceptual specifications, \"plans\", developed by another program and consequently has had to be sensitive to the limitations and varying approaches of the present state of the art in conceptual representation.",
        "At the same time, we want the architecture of the virtual machine that we abstract out of our program to be effective as a source of psycholinguistic hypotheses about the actual generation process that humans use; it should, for example, provide the basis for predictive accounts of human speech error behavior and apparent planning limitations.",
        "To achieve this, we have restricted ourselves to a highly constrained set of representations and operations, and have adopted strong and suggestive stipulations on our design such as high locality, information encapsulation, online quasi-realtime runtime performance, and indelibility.3 This restricts us as programmers, but disciplines us as theorists.",
        "We see the process of generation as involving three temporally intermingled activities: (1) determining what goals the utterance is to achieve, (2) planning what information content and rhetorical force will best meet those goals given the context, and (3) realizing the specified information and rhetorical intent as a grammatical text.",
        "Our linguistic component (henceforth LC), the Zetalisp program MUMBLE, handles the third of these activities, taking a \"realization specification': as input, and producing a stream of morphologically specialized words as output.",
        "As described in [McDonald 1984], our LC is a \"description-directed\" process: it uses the structure of the realization specification it is given, plus the syntactic surface structure of the text in progress (which it extends incrementally as the specification is realized) to directly control its actions, interpreting them as though they were sequential computer programs.",
        "This technique imposes strong demands on the descriptive formalism used for representing surface structure.",
        "For example, nodes and category labels now designate actions the generator is to take (e.g. imposing scoping relations or constraining embedded decisions) and dictate the inclusion of function words and morphological specializations.",
        "3Indelibility\" in a computation requires that no action of a process (making decisions, constructing representations, changing state, etc.)",
        "can be transparently undone once it has been performed.",
        "Many nonbacktraeldng, nonparallel program designs have this property; it is our term for what Marcus [19801 referred to as the property of being 'strictly deterministic\".",
        "4 A realization specification can informally be taken to correspond to what many researchers, particularly psychologists, think of as the 'message level\" representation of a text.",
        "5 Which is to say that it presently produces written rather than spoken texts.",

        "Of the established linguistic formalisms, systemic grammar [Halliday 1976] has always been the most important to AI researchers on generation.",
        "Two of the most important generation systems that have been developed, PROTEUS [Davey 1974] and NIGEL [Mann & Matthieuen 1983], use systemic grammar, and others, including our own, have been strongly influenced by it.",
        "The reasons for this enthusiasm are central to the special concerns of generation.",
        "Systemic grammars employ a functional vocabulary: they emphasize the uses to which language can be put – how languages achieve their speakers goals – rather than its formal structure.",
        "Since the generation process begins with goals, unlike the comprehension process which begins with structure, this orientation makes systemic grammars more immediately useful than, for example, transformational generative grammars or even procedurally oriented AI formalisms for language such as ATN's. The generation researcher's primary question is why use one construction rather than another – active instead of passive, \"the\" instead of \"a\".",
        "The principle device of a systemic grammar, the \"choice system\", supports this question by highlighting how the constructions of the language are grouped into sets of alternatives.",
        "Choice systems provide an anchoring point for the rules of a theory of language use since it is natural to associate the various semantic, discourse, or rhetorical criteria that bear on the selection of a given construction or feature with the choice system to which the construction belongs, thus providing the basis of a decision-procedure for selecting from its listed alternatives; the NIGEL system does precisely this in its \"chooser\" procedures.",
        "In our formalism we make use of the same information as a systemic grammar captures, however we have choosen to bundle it quite differently.",
        "The underlying reason for this is that our concern for psycholinguistic modeling and efficient processing takes precedence in our design decisions about how the facts of language and language use should be represented in a generator.",
        "It is thus instructive to look at the different kinds of linguistic information that a network of choice systems carry.",
        "In our system we distribute these to separate computational devices.",
        "o Dependencies among structural features: A generator must respect the constraints that dependencies impose and appreciate the impact they have on its realization options: for example that some subordinate clauses can not express tense or modality while main clauses are required to; or that a pronominal direct object forces particle movement while a lexical object leaves it optional.",
        "o Usage criteria.",
        "The decision procedures associated with each choice system are not a part of the grammar per se, although they are naturally associated with it and organized by it.",
        "Also most systemic grammars include very abstract features such as \"generic reference\" or \"completed action\", which cross-correlate the language's surface features, and thus are more controllers of why a construct is used rather than constructs themselves.",
        "o Coordinated structural alternatives.",
        "A sentence may be either active or passive, either a question or a statement.",
        "By grouping these alternatives into systems and using these systems exclusively when constructing a text, one is guaranteed not to combine inconsistent structural features.",
        "o Efficient ordering of choices.",
        "The network that connects choice systems provides a natural path between decisions, which if followed strictly guarentees that a choice will not be made unless it is required, and that it will not be made before any of the choices that it is itself dependent upon, insuring that it can",
        "be made indelibly.",
        "o Typology of surface structure.",
        "Almost by accident (since its specification is distributed throughout all of the systems implicitly), the grammar determines the pattern of dominance and constituency relationships of the text.",

        "in systemic grammars tend to be shallow and broad.",
        "We believe, but have not yet established, that equivalence transformations can be defined that would take a systemic grammar as a specification to construct the alternative devices that we use in our generator (or augment devices that derive from other sources, e.g. a TAG) by decomposing the information in the systemic grammar along the lines just listed and redistributing it."

        "We have adopted this domain because the news reporting task, with its requirement of communicating what is new and significant in an event as well as the event itself, appears to impose exceptionally rich constraints on the selection of what conceptual information to report and on what syntactic constructions to use in reporting it (see discussion in Clippinger & McDonald [1983D.",

        "One cannot produce the cited text simply by traversing and \"reading out\" the elements of the specification as though one were doing direct production.",

        "In this case the \"content\" of the reporting event is the two damage-reports which have already been planned for inclusion in the utterance as part of the \"particulars\" part of the specification.",
        "Let us look closely at how that reportiing event unit is folded into surface structure.",
        "When not itself the focus of attention, a reporting event is typically realized as \"so-and-so said X\", that is, the content of the report is more important than the report itself; whatever significance the report or its source has as news will be indicated subtly through which of the alternative realizations below is selected for it?",
        "6 We will not discuss the mechanism by which features in the specification influence realization.",
        "Realization specifications of the complexity of this example are still very new in our research and we arc unsure whether the process is better organized at the conceptual level directing a composition process within the planning component (during one of the recursive invocations) or within the LC mediating a selection between anticipated alternatives.",
        "At this point our design experiments are inconclusive.",
        "7 These sentences are artificial; actual ones would be considerably longer.",
        "Interestingly, certain other syntactically pezmissable versions such as it was reported that\" do not occur in any of the texts we have examined.",
        "Perhaps the lead NP\" position is too important to waste on a pronoun.",
        "In our LC, these alternative \"choices\" are grouped together into a \"realization class\" as shown in Figure 3.",
        "Our realization classes have their historic origins in the choice systems of systemic grammar, though they are very different in almost every concrete detail.",
        "The most important difference of interest theoretically is that while systemic choice systems select among single alternative features (e.g. passive, gerundive), realization classes select among entire surface structure fragments at a time (which might be seen as prespecifted realizations of bundles of features).",
        "That is, our approach to generation calls for us to organize our decision procedures so as to select the values for a number of linguistic features simultaneously in one choice where a systemic grammar would make the selection incrementally .8 8 The standard technique of using choice systems to control the active selection of utterance features is employed by the most well-known applications of systemic grammars to generation (i.e. the work of Davey [1974] and Mann and Matthiessen [1983]).",
        "However very recent work with systemic grammars at Edinburgh by Patten [1985] departs from this technique.",
        "Patten uses a semantic-level planning component to directly select groups of features at the rightward, 'output\", side of a systemic network, and then works backwards through the network to determine what other, not sematically specified features must be added to the text for it to be grammatical; control is thus outside the grammar proper, with grammar rules relegated to constraint specification only.",
        "We are intrigued by this technique and look forward to its further development.",
        "Returning to our example, we are now faced now with the need to incorporate a unit denoting the report of the Iraqi attacks into the utterance to act as a certification of the 10<Ni-by-missiles> events.",
        "This will be done using the realization class believe-verbs; the class is applicable to any information unit of the form report(source, info) (and others).",
        "It determines the realization of such units both when they appear in issolation and, as in the present case, when they are to augment an utterance corresponding to one of their arguments.",
        "From this realization class the choice raise-VERB-Into-PROP will be selected since (1) the fact that two ships were hit is most significant, meaning that the focus will be on the information and not the source (n.b.",
        "when the class executes the source Iraq will be bound to the agent parameter and the information about the missile hits to the proposition parameter); (2) there is no rhetorical motivation for us to occupy space in the first sentence with the sources of the report since they have already been planned to follow.",

        "Earlier we illustrated the TAG concept of linking\" by showing how one would start with an initial tree consisting of the innermost clause of a question plus the fronted wh-phrase and then build outward by successively adjoining the desired auxiliary phrases to the S node that intervenes between the wh-phrase and the clause.",
        "Wh-questions are thus built from the bottom up, as in fact is my sentence involving verbs taking sentential complements.",
        "This analysis has the desirable property of allowing one to state the dependencies between the Wh-phrase and the gap as a local relation on a single elementary tree, eliminating the need to Include any machinery for movement in the theory.",
        "All unbounded dependencies now derive from adjunctions (which, as far as the grammar is concerned, can be made without limit), rather than to the explicit migration of a constituent across clauses.",
        "We also find this locality property to be desirable, and use an analogous procedure in our production of questions and other kinds of Whquestions and unbounded dependency constructions.",
        "This \"bottom-up\" design has consequences for how the realization specifications for these constructions must be organized.",
        "In particular, the logician's usual representation of sentential complement verbs as higher operators is not tenable in that role.",
        "For example we cannot have the source of, say, How many ships did Reuters report that Iraq had said it attacked?",
        "be the expression: Lambda(quantity-of -ships) .",
        "report(Reuters, say(Iraq, attack(Iraq, quantity-of-ships))) Such an expression defines a natural sequence of exposure when used as realization specification, namely that one realize the Lambda operator first, the report operator second, the say third, and so on.",
        "A local TAG analysis of Wh-movement requires us to have the Lambda and the expression containing its matrix trace, attach, be present in a single layer\" of the specification, otherwise we would be forced to violate one of the strong principles of our theory of generation, namely that the characteristics in a realization class may \"see\" only the immediate arguments of the unit being realized; they may not look \"inside\" those arguments to subsequent levels of conceptual structure.",
        "This principle has served us well, and we are disinclined to give it up without a very compelling reason.",
        "We elected instead to give up the internal representation of sentential complement verb texts as single expressions.",
        "This move was easy for us to make since such expressions are awkward to manipulate in the \"East Coast\" style frame knowledge bases that we use in our own reasoning programs, and we have preferred a representational style with redundant, smaller sized conceptual units for quite some time.",
        "The representation we use instead amounts to breaking up the logical expression into individual units and allowing them to include references to each other.",
        "Given such a network as the realization specification, the LC must have some principle by which to judge where to start: which unit should form the basis of the surface structure to which the others are then attached?",
        "A natural principle to adopt is to begin with the \"basis\" unit, i.e. the one that does not mention any other units in its definition.",
        "We are considering adopting the policy that such units should be allowed only realizations as initial trees while units whose definition involves \"pointing to\" (naming) other units should be allowed only realizations as auxiliary trees.",
        "We have not, however, worked through all of the ramifications such a policy might have on other parts of our generation model; without yet knowing whether it would improve or degrade the other parts of our theory, we are reluctant to assert it as one of our hypotheses relating our generation model to TAG's. Given that three part source, the realization of the question is fairly straightforward (See Figure 9).",
        "The Lambda expression is assigned a realization class for clausal Wh constructions, whereupon the extracted argument quantity-61414s is placed in COMP, and the body of the expression is placed in the HEAD position.",
        "At the same time, the two instances of quantlty.of.shlps are specially marked.",
        "The one in COMP is assigned to the realization class for Wh phrases appropriate to quantity (e.g. it will have the choice how many X and possibly related choices such as <quantity> of which and other variants appropriate to relative clauses or other positions where Wh constructions can be used).",
        "Simultaneously the instance of quantity-of-ships in the argument position of the head frame attack is assigned to the realization class for Wh-trace.",
        "These two specializations are the equivalent, in our model, of the TAG linking relation."

        "Because of this it may be better to view units such as U4 as being associated directly with a lexical compounded form, i.e. oil tanker.",
        "This partial solution, however, would not speak to the problem of active word formation in the language.",
        "Furthermore, it would be interesting to compare the strategic decisions made by a generation system with those planning mistakes made by humans when speaking.",
