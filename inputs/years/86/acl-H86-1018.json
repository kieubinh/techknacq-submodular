        "As a user interacts with a database or an expert system, s/he may attribute a property or property value to an object that that object does not have.",
        "For instance, imagine the following query to a database.",
        "U.",
        "Give me the HULL-NO of all DESTROYERS whose MAST-HEIGHT is above 190.",
        "If a system were to evaluate such a query, it might find that there are no such ships in the database.",
        "The reason for this is that the user has queried a value of the property MAST-HEIGHT that it cannot have for the object DESTROYER.",
        "I term this error a property misconception.",
        "Upon encountering such a query, even a very cooperative system could only respond: S. There are no DESTROYERS in the database with a MAST-HEIGHT above 190.",
        "Would you like to try again?",
        "In most cases, however, this is not the way a human would respond.",
        "A study of human/human transcripts reveals that a human conversational partner often tries to get at the cause of the misconception and offer additional information to correct the wrong information.",
        "The additional information often takes the form of a correct query that is a possible alternative to the user's query.",
        "In this paper I describe some of the knowledge and reasoning that are necessary for a natural language interface to a database or expert system to mimic this human behavior.",
        "In the above query, since there is an object similar to a DESTROYER that has the value of HULL-NO given, the user's misconception may result from his/her confusing the two objects.",
        "Hence a reasonable response would be: S. All DESTROYERS in the database have a MAST-HEIGHT between 85 and 90.",
        "Were you thinking of an AIRCRAFT-CARRIER?",
        "Notice the strategy used to correct the misconception is to (1) deny (implicitly) the property/value given, (2) give the corresponding correct information, (3) suggest an alternative query containing the object the user may have confused with the misconception object.",
        "In other situations, a reasonable alternative query might involve the same object the user asked about, with a different property/value pair.",
        "This is the case in the following query.",
        "U.",
        "Give me the HULL-NO of all DESTROYERS whose MAST-HEIGHT is above 3500.",
        "S. All DESTROYERS in the database have a MAST-HEIGHT between 85 and 90.",
        "Were you thinking of the DISPLACEMENT?",
        "This response is similar to the one given above except that the alternative query suggests an attribute rather than an object which may have been confused.",
        "In general, there can be two major reasons why a wrong attribution may occur.",
        "Either (1) the user has the wrong object – that is, s/he has confused the object being discussed with a similar object or has reasoned (falsely) by analogy from a similar object; or (2) the user has the wrong attribute – that is, s/he has confused the attribute being discussed with a similar attribute.",
        "If one of these two can be seen as likely in a given situation, then a revised query can be suggested which mentions the similar object or the similar attribute.",
        "To propose alternative queries, a system must have a method for determining similarity of objects and attributes.",
        "In this paper I will focus on responses involving object confusion; thus I will examine a similarity metric for objects.",
        "In the next section such a similarity metric is introduced.",
        "The following section introduces a new notion of object perspective which is needed to provide the similarity metric with some necessary contextual information, in particular, attribute salience ratings.",
        "Finally, an example of how perspective information and the similarity metric can be used to give reasonable responses to misconceptions involving object properties is given."

        "As was shown above, in order to respond effectively to property misconceptions, we must have a method for determining object similarity.",

        "In the above systems the similarity of two objects is based on the distance between the objects in the generalization hierarchy.",

        "information to be taken into account.",
        "Tversky's similarity rating for two objects a and b, where A is the set of properties associated with object a and B is the set of properties associated with object b, can be expressed as: (a, b) = et (A fl B) - a!",

        "This equation actually defines a family of similarity scales where 9, a, and p are parameters which alter the importance of each piece of the equation, and f maps over the features and yields a salience rating for each.",
        "The equation states that the similarity of two objects is some function of their common features minus some function of their disjoint features.",
        "The importance of each feature involved (determined by the function f) and the importance of each piece of the equation (determined by 9, a, and fi) may change with context.",
        "Previous work [4, 7] has discussed the effect of •focus• on the prominence of objects.",
        "Focusing algorithms can be adapted to set the values of 0, a, and fi.",
        "For instance, if object a is •in focus• and object b is not, then the features of a should be weighted more heavily than the features of b.",
        "Thus we should choose a > fi so that the similarity is reduced more by features of a that are not shared by b than vice versa.",
        "The problem then is to determine f. Other work [3, 9] has hand encoded salience values for the attributes of individual objects in the knowledge base, effectively setting the f function once and for all.",
        "This approach, however, is not sufficient since salience values must change with context.",

        "A Treasury Bill is backed by the U.S. Government: you have to get it from the federal reserve.",
        "A Money Market Certificate, on the other hand, is backed by the individual bank that issues it.",
        "So, one is a Government Security while the other is not.",
        "In the first example the objects are viewed as savings instruments.",
        "This view highlights attributes such as interest-rates and maturity-dates that are common to Treasury Bills and Money Market Certificates.",
        "This highlighting causes the two instruments to be seen as \"identical°.",
        "In contrast, the second example views the objects as instruments issued by a particular company or organization.",
        "In this case attributes such as issuing-company and purchase-place are highlighted.",
        "Since these highlighted attributes are different for the two objects, the objects are seen as being quite different.",
        "As the examples illustrate, a context-free metric of similarity is not sufficient; contextual information is needed.",

        "In other situations, the class •cetacean\" may be central.",
