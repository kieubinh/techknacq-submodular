        "The notation should be of general applicability.",
        "For example, a good notation ought to be acceptable as the output of a natural language parser.",
        "The notation should have a well-defined semantics.",

        "This interpretation has to be efficient.",

        "To summarize, we have developed a first-order predicate-calculus language which can be used to make demands for expressions to the Nigel grammar.",
        "This works by translating the logical forms into two separate structures that are stored in a PENNI database.",
        "Nigel inquiries are evaluated against these structures through the aid of a NIKL knowledge base.",
        "Discourse context is also stored in the data base and lexical entries are obtained from the knowledge base.",
        "Adding this facility to Nigel seems to have added only 10 to 20 percent to Nigel's run time."

        "For the sake of presentation, we have simplified our description of the working system.",
        "Other facilities include an extensive tense, aspect and temporal reference system.",
        "There is also a facility for dynamically constructing logical forms for referring expressions.",
        "This is used when constants are found in other logical forms that cannot be referred to by name or through pronoun.",
        "There are also certain limitations in our approach.",
        "One of which may have occurred to the reader is that the language our system produces is ambiguous in ways formal logic is not.",
        "For example, \"the read statuses of the messages\" has one reading which is different from the logical form we used in our example.",
        "While scope ambiguities are deeply ingrained in language, they are not a problem in most communication situations.",
        "Related to this problem is a potentially important mismatch between logic and functional systemic grammars.",
        "These grammars do not control directly for quantification scope.",
        "They treat it as only one aspect of the decision making process about determiner choice and constituent ordering.",
        "Certainly, there is a great deal of evidence that logical scoping is not often a factor in the interpretation of utterances8.",
        "Another set of problems concern the limits we place on logical connectives in logical forms.",
        "One limit is the the position of negations: we can only negate ProcessOccurrences, e.g., \"John didn't send a message.\".",
        "Negation on other forms, e.g., \"John sent no messages.",
        "\", affects the basic connection with the NIKL model.",
        "Furthermore, certain conjunctions have to be shown with a conjunctive Relation as opposed to logical conjunction.",
        "This includes conjunctions between ProcessOccurrences that lead to compound sentences, as well as all disjunctions.",
        "Furthermore, we impose a condition that a demand for expression must concern a single connected set of structures.",
        "In operation the system actually ignores parts of the logical form that are independent of the main ProcessOccurrences.",
        "Because the underlying grammar can only express one event or state of affair(not counting dependent processes) and its associated circumstances at a time, in order to fit in one sentence all the entities to be mentioned must be somehow connected to one event or state of affair.",
        "We expect that the limitations in the last two paragraphs will be overcome as we develop our text planning system,"

        "A theory of text structure is being developed at USC/ISI that will take less restrained forms and map them into multi-sentence text structures [Mann 84].",
        "The use of this intermediate facility will mediate for logical connectives and connectivity by presenting the sentence generator with normalized and connected structures.",
        "The word choice decisions the system makes also need to be enhanced.",
        "It currently takes as specific a term as possible.",
        "Unfortunately, this term could convey only part of the necessary information.",
        "Or it could convey more information than that conveyed by the process alone, e.g., in our transmit/send example, \"send\", unlike \"transmit\", conveys the existence of a message.",
        "We are currently developing a method of dealing with word choice through descriptions in terms of primitive concepts that will support better matching between demands and lexical resources.",
        "A related limit is the requirement in the current NIKL that all aspects of a concept be present in the logical form in order for the NIKL classifier to have effect.",
        "For example, the logical forms must show all aspects of a Send to identify a Transmit as one.",
        "A_complete model of Send will certainly have more role restrictions than the actee.",
        "However, just having an actee which is a Message should be sufficient to indicate that a particular Transmit is a Send.",
        "We are working with the developers of NIKL to allow for this type of reasoning.",
        "Two other areas of concern relate directly to our most important current activity.",
        "First, it is not clear that first-order logic will be sufficiently expressive for all possible situations.",
        "Second, it is not clear the use of hand-built logical forms is sufficient to test our design to its fullest extent."
