        "In this paper I will review the state of the text generation lexicon.",
        "I have two primary goals: 1) to give the reader an idea of what is currently being done, by setting out some of the alternatives designers of generation lexicons have faced, the choices they have made, and the implications of these choices for the types of lexical phenomena they have been able to represent.",
        "2) to suggest what a generation lexicon could do, i.e. what range of lexical phenomena is relevant to the generation task.",
        "These issues will be addressed more or less in parallel throughout this paper, with more attention to the first goal in the first two sections, and to the second in the last three sections.",
        "The remainder of this Introduction discusses the issue of what kind of linguistic knowledge can be considered lexical knowledge, and what kind of lexical knowledge is most relevent to the generation task.",
        "The text generation systems which I have been able to compare are briefly described in section 1.3.",
        "Section 2 distinguishes between phrasal and word-based lexicons, and draws some finer distinctions within these two groups.",
        "Section 3 sets out the range of cooccurrence phenomena that that a lexicon can treat; section 4 deals with lexical choice and lexical semantics in generation systems.",
        "Section 5 presents a summary of the kinds of information an ideal generation lexicon could cover.",
        "There are many aspects of lexical representation which I have chosen not to cover in this paper.",
        "I haven't given much space to a description of morphological information, because most of the systems I have information on generate English, which isn't very interesting from a morphological point of view.",
        "Since I haven't looked at any systems which generate speech, there is no discussion here of how to represent phonological or phonetic information.",
        "1.1.",
        "What is lexical knowledge?",
        "A brief examination of a few text generation systems reveals what seem to be staggering differences in the content of the component labelled \"lexicon\" or \"dictionary\".",
        "Treatments range from dictionaries which contain only information about the endings of nouns and verbs, to systems which store entire sentences as single units in the lexicon; from systems which insert lexical material as a last stage in the derivation process, to systems with lexicons that do the major part of structure-building work.",
        "However, this apparent diversity is to a large degree illusory: systems represent the same basic kind of information in different ways and in different components.",
        "For instance, information about restrictions on the modifiers a word can take can be treated as part of syntax, as part of semantics, or as a purely idiosyncratic component of a lexical entry.",
        "This diversity has its origin in the diversity of practical goals and theoretical underpinnings of the text generation systems which I studied.",
        "The diversity of approaches to lexical representation in linguistic theory is not just an artifact of notational differences; it in turn stems at least partly from the fact that the appropriate characterization of a \"word\" is different in different subsystems of language.",
        "In other words, \"word\" must be differently defined for the purposes of phonological, orthographic, morphological, syntactic and semantic regularities, although there is a partial overlap (which accounts for the fact that we can frequently get away with using the same term for all these different units).",
        "For most of the systems discussed in this paper, the only crucial mismatches are those between the syntactic word and the semantic word (though the orthographic word and the morphological word do occasionally have to be dealt with as well).",
        "Because of this complexity, for the purposes of this paper I will avoid answering in any absolute way the question posed in the title of this section, simply characterizing as \"lexical knowledge\" that knowledge which at least one of the systems which I review contains in a component called a \"lexicon\" or \"dictionary\", while discussing the connections between the structure of particular systems and the decisions made in those systems about whether and how to represent particular pieces of lexical information."

      "text": [
        "Before I begin, however, I would like to address the issue of the extent to which the directionality of linguistic processing -- i.e. whether it is a matter of understanding or generation -- influences the content of the lexicon.",
        "According to one ideal, in which the language processing system models all of the linguistic knowledge of a human speaker, the relevant information should be the same; and some systems which are bidirectional2 use the same lexicon for both understanding and generation.",
        "However, in practice the two types of lexicon tend to be rather different in the information they encode; even in the bidirectional systems, some of the lexical information is only used in one direction.",
        "This is due to differences in the type of demands that apply to most actual understanding and generation projects.3 A text understanding system has to be able to accept whatever input it gets from the user; this requirement dictates a grammar which is comprehensive at least with respect to a given domain, and a dictionary which is both lexically comprehensive (contains a large number of words) and syntactically comprehensive (supports all the syntactic distinctions that the grammar can make).",
        "However, it can assume a fluent and cooperative interlocuter; it doesn't have to weed out input which is textually non-cohesive, unidiomatic, uncooperative, or otherwise \"awkward\" (with the exception perhaps of gross syntactic ungrammaticality).",
        "A generator, on the other hand, doesn't need a full range of syntactic capabilities (one way of saying whatever it needs to say may be enough); nor does it need a very large lexicon (one word for everything it needs to say, and fewer syntactic distinctions corresponding to a smaller syntactic component).",
        "But it has to know more about the syntax and lexicon it does have: it has to have a basis for choosing between syntactic alternatives and lexical items so as to be not only conceptually appropriate and grammatical, but also cooperative, idiomatic, non-redundant, and otherwise fluent.4 Thus, we can say that the generation task sets different priorities for the lexicon: roughly speaking, a generation lexicon has to put depth before breadth, while the reverse is true for understanding.",
        "In this paper I will naturally concentrate my attention to those aspects of lexical specification which are most particular to the generation task.",
        "1.3.",
        "Systems surveyed In order to make more concrete the comparison between systems which I will present in the body of this paper, I first give a very brief sketch of each of the systems which I have been able to find out about, with particular attention to the structure and function of the lexicon within the system.",
        "More detailed discussion of the interesting features of various of these lexicons will be given in the body of the paper.",
        "Citations for the sources from which I have drawn my information are all given in this section; hereafter I will refer to systems by name without repeating the citations.",
        "(For the convenience of the reader who may not be familiar with all these systems, I will upper-case system names throughout the text of the paper even when this is not the conventional spelling of the system name, so as to distinguish them from the names of the researchers who developed them.",

        "In some cases, I have assigned a name to unnamed systems.)",
        "I should add that in most cases, I have not had an opportunity to examine the actual listings for the lexicons I discuss.5 My statements as to the contents of these listings are inferred from the published descriptions of the systems; frequently only incomplete or suggestive information is provided about the lexicon.",
        "Therefore, my comments should be taken as reflecting potential capabilities of particular lexicon formalisms, which may not be fully exploited in the working versions of each system.",

        "The features include all the feature information required by the Nigel and RUS grammars; thus some features are used only by one of the grammars.",

        "The lexicons used in text generation systems can be roughly grouped into two classes, according to what is represented in a typical lexical entry (unit of the lexicon).",

        "The distinction between these two types isn't always clear-cut.",
        "Some systems, as mentioned above, have both types, in which typically the phrasal lexicon represents syntactic and semantic information, and the word-based lexicon represents morphological information;12others can easily provide either type of representation, and it is a question of practice which alternative is chosen in any given case.",

      "heading": "2.1. Phrasal lexicons",
      "text": [
        "Perhaps the most important factors distinguishing generation lexicons are the size of the lexical item, the amount of structure it contains, and the role of lexical selection in the system.",
        "In text generation, as opposed to understanding, there seems to be a tendency towards a large size, complex structure, and powerful role for the lexical item.",
        "In this section, I will discuss the reasons for each of these tendencies and their implications for text generation; in section 3, I will describe how more traditional word-based lexicons handle the same range of phenomena.",
        "2.1.1.",
        "Size While traditional dictionaries are primarily organized around small linguistic units -- words or even morphemes -- many computational lexicons have entire syntactic constituents stored as their basic unit, all the way up to multi-clausal units.",
        "(These lexicons can conveniently be described as \"phrasal\", although as we will see the kind of unit which counts as a \"phrase\" varies widely.",
        "An argument for this treatment can be found in [Becker 75].)",
        "This has several advantages in text generation: 1) all kinds of subcategorization and selectional restrictions which need to be stated as properties of particular lexical items can easily be handled without any special mechanism: the allowed patterns are listed in the lexicon, and the disallowed patterns aren't.",
        "Any combination of complement types may be represented without the necessity of deciding beforehand on a particular inventory of possibilities.",
        "2) Similarly, all kinds of idioms and collocational restrictions can potentially be handled by specifying the exact wording of the lexical phrase.",
        "3) An indefinitely large syntactic range may be \"simulated\" by treating syntactic constructions which can't be generated by the grammar as idioms, thus adding to the syntactic variety of the output text.",
        "This principle may be extended to the point where the lexicon \"takes over\" most of the grammar, i.e. all or almost all grammatical patterns are represented only in the specification for the lexical items which they apply to.",
        "The disadvantages of this method are merely the flip side of the advantages.",
        "Generally speaking, the more phenomena which are represented as idiosyncratic properties of lexical items, the fewer phenomena are treated in a general way (although some systems have the flexibility to represent the same phenomena as either idiosyncratic or as general).",
        "This has two related consequences: 1) lexicons must be much larger; 2) making additions to the lexicon is a much more lengthy and difficult process, as properties of lexical items which may in fact be predictable (on the basis of either other lexical properties or semantic properties of the item) must be specified anyway.",
        "2.1.2.",
        "Structure Phrasal lexicons differ in the amount of internal structure they can encode within their phrases.",
        "Thus, there is a difference between encoding an idiom like go mad as a verb or predicate with no internal structure indicated and knowing that go is a verb and mad is a resultative adjective phrase.",
        "If there is internal structure indicated, it is possible to store each of these variants as a single lexical item (which may be desirable, since the phenomenon is not generally productive), and yet still do some syntactic variation, e.g., add intervening adverbials (go quietly mad), inflect the verb (/ go mad, he goes mad), or relate it to other syntactically similar expressions (go crazy, run dry).",
        "Another reason one might want information about the internal structure of phrases is for stylistic control, e.g. to allow control of the amount of variation in lexical choice and syntactic structure.13.",
        "The lexicons of TEXT, PHRED, VIE-LANG, and MUMBLE all allow any amount of internal structure to be specified in a lexical item, in contrast to GAT and ANA; while these two systems contain slots for other elements (various arguments in GAT, subjects only in ANA), they cannot indicate any further structural complexity.",
        "2.1.3.",
        "Depth of lexical selection Another important parameter which distinguishes generation lexicons is the amount of influence lexical choice has over other kinds of choices, for example syntactic, rhetorical or stylistic choices, made in the system.",
        "To cite some instances of restrictions imposed by lexical items on clause syntax: some verbs with direct objects can't be passivized (e.g. the candy bar cost a quarter), verbs (and to a lesser degree adjectives and nouns) restrict the syntax of their complement clauses in various ways (e.g.",
        "I insist that he come vs. *1 insist that he comes, but I hope that he comes vs. â€¢/ hope that he come) and some pronouns can be modified by relative clauses while others can't (e.g.",
        "Anyone who wants to can come but *We who want to can come14).",
        "Naturally, the degree of constraint the availability of lexical items can impose on grammatical choice is directly related to the stage in the generation process (or \"depth\", in terms of the metaphor current in transformational grammar) at which lexical choice is made.",
        "If lexical choice is made late in the generation process, it can have little input into other decision-making, unless some kind of backtracking is allowed for.",
        "In many systems, the lexicon acts as the intermediary between semantic and syntactic representations, and the step of \"lexical",
        "insertion\" is actually the step at which syntactic structure is built.",
        "(This is the case for MUMBLE, TEXT, PHRED, VIE-LANG, and GAT.)",
        "This generally works by matching the predicate of the semantic representation with the lexical entry for a verb, and then filling in the argument slots of the verb with arguments from the semantic representation.",
        "(It may also be more complicated than this: in both TEXT and MUMBLE, for instance, the way this matching is done may involve information from contextual information such as focus history or preceding reference; in ANA stylistic factors such as length are considered; etc.)",
        "In these systems, the structure built by the lexicon then undergoes further syntactic realization (e.g. transformations, morphological adjustments).",
        "Since the lexical item has already been chosen when these realizations are performed, properties of the lexical item have the opportunity to constrain the way these realizations occur.",
        "For example, in the TEXT system, routines in the dictionary itself control the choice of syntactic construction (active, passive or existential) as well as the basic sentence structure.",
        "This avoids problems such as a text plan calling for passive syntax when the verb in question can't be passivized.",
        "In KAMP, syntactic processing (including lexical insertion) is alternated with planning in such a way that plans can be modified in response to the set of choices made available by a particular lexical item.",
        "In GAT, all the decisions are made simultaneously by the selection of a particular schema which includes lexical, (clause-level) syntactic and clause-combining specifications.",
        "Of course, if a grammar is sufficiently rich to treat as regular (i.e. as predictable from aspects of the specification of the sentence) a large range of syntactic phenomena, a correspondingly small range needs to be treated as idiosyncratic to a lexical item (i.e., as dependent on a particular lexical choice).",
        "This is another form of the tradeoff between grammar and lexicon: the more complete a grammar is, the less dependent it is on early lexical specification to do its job right.",
        "Thus, in Nigel, most of the the syntactic properties of a lexical item are taken to be predictable from its semantic properties, following Halliday's analysis; so, although a particular lexical item isn't chosen until after syntactic planning has occurred, the syntactic plan is made with reference to the same semantic categories that constrain lexical choice.15 For example, non-subjunctive \"that\" clauses, since they refer to reports about the world, are restricted to verbs of saying and thinking.",
        "2.2.",
        "Word-based lexicons Many of the models of language to come out of linguistics until recently assume a word-based lexicon in which syntactic information is specified in the form of features; word choice is constrained both on the basis of meaning and the fit between the syntactic features of the word and the syntactic environment it is supposed to fit into.",
        "In these models, rather than having the powerful role it has in the systems discussed above, the lexicon is primarily viewed as an appendage to the syntax, where information which can't be predicted by general rules is stored.",
        "The units represented are small (usually morphemes), and the amount of internal structure which can be represented within an item is minimal.",
        "Systems surveyed here which have this traditional type of lexicon are ILIAD, KAMP,16 and Mel'chuk's system.17 In some ways, the difference in practice between a low-level word-based lexicon with features and a highly structured phrasal lexicon is smaller than it appears.",
        "For example, a case-frame representation can be mapped onto a feature representation in which the feature corresponds to a particular case pattern -- e.g. the feature \"transitive\" can be mapped onto a case frame containing a direct object slot.",
        "The major difference is that the case frame representation allows more freedom than is available with a small _set of features (as mentioned above); on the other hand, since features can be thought of as corresponding to classes of lexical items, a single lexical feature may efficiently encode a range of possible case frames that tend to cooccur with a particular type of word.",
        "In the lexical feature specifications referred to by Nigel, all of the subcategorizational possibilities of a particular sense of a verb are taken to be predictable from a single feature representing its wordclass membership.15 Thus, verbs such as \"see\", \"hear\" etc.",
        "have the feature \"perception\"; the grammar knows that these verbs can be generated with either a direct object, with a complement clause in which the verb is in its stem form without \"to\" (e.g. \"I saw you arrive\", \"I heard her come in\"), or with a complement clause in which the verb is in its present participle form (\"I saw you arriving\", \"I heard her coming in\").",
        "This particular configuration of possible complements is restricted to verbs which refer to sense perception, and thus it is redundant to list each of these possibilities separately for all the perception verbs.",
        "Of course, to take advantage of this type of generalization one must have a detailed theory of the wordclasses of a language, 15 This statement, of course, is relative to a particular view of the characterization of both syntax and semantics; for more discussion of this point, see section 4 below.",
        "16 Although the Unification formalism used in KAMP allows for lexical entries containing further structure, just as in Lexical Functional Grammar representations, as far as t know Appelt doesn't exploit this possibility in his system.",
        "such as is available in the systemic framework; and indeed, it's clear that a reasonably complete grammar must make reference to a very large set of such wordclasses.",
        "This is another case of a tradeoff between having a relatively complex rule system and treating few things as \"irregular\" or unpredictable, and having a relatively simple rule system and treating many things as irregular.",
        "In the computational context, the first option implies a large development effort in the area of grammar, while the second implies a large effort in the area of lexicon.",
        "Which option is preferable depends on the goals of the system."

        "We use different words for the same things depending on who we're talking to, what we're talking about, where we are, and what role we're playing.",
        "A simple example is the observation that in more formal contexts English speakers tend to use Latinate words such as \"expunge, remove, infer\" instead of Anglo-Saxon phrasal verbs like \"wipe out, take off, figure out\".",
        "In addition to simply responding to social context in the way we choose words, we can use words in a way which evoke or create a context for our utterances; for instance, we can use borrowings from French in order to sound suave, or surfer slang in order to sound cool.",
        "We use more general or more specific terms for the same thing depending on which of its characteristics we're interested in: if we see a friend careening towards a tree, we're more likely to say \"watch out for that tree!\"",
        "than \"watch out for that eucalyptus!\"",
        "or \"watch out for that plant!\"",
        "And so on.",
        "We're a long way from having natural language generators that have the degree of control over any level of linguistic choice, grammatical or lexical, that a serious treatment of these considerations would entail; but we can design our systems such that such distinctions could be accomodated when we have the analyses to support them.",
        "5.6.",
        "Conclusion Lexicons play a wide varieties of roles in text generation systems, from the very central one of providing the primary link between form and meaning, to the quite peripheral one of finishing up after the grammar is done.",
        "Lexical phenomena such as semantic relationships, syntactic classes, collocation and idioms have received vastly different amounts of attention in different systems, while other phenomena such as metaphor and non-denotational meaning have received virtually none.",
        "Looking at the capabilities of a wide range of generation lexicons provides an exhilirating sense of the potential for future systems, both from the variety of phenomena that existing systems have dealt with, and from the challenges that still remain.",
        "I hope that bringing a few of these phenomena to light in this paper will succeed in sparking the interest necessary to ensure the lexicon the attention it warrants in text generation research."
