        "The solutionhood construct is one type of relational propositions.",

        "Although phenomena resembling relational propositions have been recognized, there is no widely accepted explanation of how they arise from text.",

        "In this Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST), relational propositions arise in direct correspondence to particular elements of the structure of a discourse.",
        "We present Rhetorical Structure Theory progressively during analysis of a published, two-paragraph political advocacy text.",
        "The text involves substructures for informing, giving evidence, conceding, requesting an action, justifying a presentation, asserting conditionally, and others.",
        "The two elements that form the basis for this paper, relational propositions and Rhetorical Structure Theory, have both been described in more detail elsewhere.",
