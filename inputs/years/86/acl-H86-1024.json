        "In this case, going to the Fuji Gardens (partially) solves the hunger problem.",
        "The solutionhood construct is one type of relational propositions.",
        "Note that the proposition about solutionhood is not stated explicitly in the text.",
        "Although phenomena resembling relational propositions have been recognized, there is no widely accepted explanation of how they arise from text.",
        "This paper characterizes relational propositions and presents a theory of discourse structure to explain them.",
        "In this Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST), relational propositions arise in direct correspondence to particular elements of the structure of a discourse.",
        "We present Rhetorical Structure Theory progressively during analysis of a published, two-paragraph political advocacy text.",
        "The text involves substructures for informing, giving evidence, conceding, requesting an action, justifying a presentation, asserting conditionally, and others.",
        "The two elements that form the basis for this paper, relational propositions and Rhetorical Structure Theory, have both been described in more detail elsewhere.",
