        "Lexical ambiguity, and especially part-of-speech ambiguity, is the source of much non-determinism in parsing.",
        "As a result, the resolution of lexical ambiguity presents deterministic parsing (Marcus 1980) with a major test.",
        "If deterministic parsing is to be viable, it should be shown that lexical ambiguity can be resolved deterministically for many situations in which people do not have trouble.",
        "In this paper, it is shown that Marcus's \"diagnostics\" can be handled without any mechanisms beyond what is required to parse grammatical sentences and reject ungrammatical sentences and that many other classes of ambiguity can be easily resolved as well.",
        "This result is possible because of the constraints on English from word order and number agreement.",
        "Although many high-level constituents can be \"moved\" in English, the lower-level structure of some constituents is relatively fixed.",
        "For example, after a determiner, one expects a noun rather than a verb.",
        "In this paper we also wish to ask, \"How might this low-level fixed order assist in the resolution of ambiguity?\" We will not give a definite answer to this question, but will see that it is extremely useful in the resolution of ambiguity.",
        "The examples of ambiguity shown in this paper seem to cause no apparent problems to a person reading them.",
        "That is, all of these examples read easily and certainly do not exhibit the garden path effect, except, of course, the examples that are intended to be difficult.",
        "If a parser is to be psychologically plausible, then it is desirable that it handle these examples in such a way as to explain why people have no apparent difficulty with most sentences, despite the inherent ambiguity in them.",
        "In parsing English, one of the major causes of non-determinism is part-of-speech ambiguity.",
        "If a word can be two parts of speech, then a non-deterministic parser may have to explore both possibilities.",
        "If one claims to be able to parse English deterministically, then the resolution of part-of-speech ambiguity is a very important area.",
        "It should be noted that a non-deterministic parser does not need to tackle the problem of local part-of-speech ambiguity.",
        "If it should make an error, then it can backtrack and correct it.",
        "Alternatively, it could maintain all possible parses at once and throw some of them away.",
        "In deterministic parsing we are not allowed to use either backtracking or parallelism.",
        "Although this problem has been investigated for many non-deterministic parsers, it has not been the critical problem that it is for deterministic parsing.",
        "To handle ambiguity deterministically, we must never make an error.",
        "As a result, our methods of disambiguation must be reliable.",
        "We will see that many cases of ambiguity can be resolved using standard techniques that have been applied to non-deterministic parsers.",
        "If it is possible to handle all the examples of local ambiguity presented here, with no additional mechanism, device or feature than is needed for ordinary sentence parsing, then our goal above can be considered met.",
        "One",
        "possible explanation for the fact that people do not notice local ambiguities may be that there is no special mechanism needed for them, so that nothing differing from normal parsing is necessary.",
        "Conversely, if it is necessary to add special mechanisms and routines to the parser just to handle these examples of ambiguity, then this will not explain how people can understand these examples so well and it can be considered a weakness in the model.",
        "To say part-of-speech ambiguity can be handled deterministically but with the use of special mechanisms would be no surprise and not very important.",
        "To say one can handle part-of-speech ambiguity deterministically with no special mechanisms is a more significant claim.",
        "In this paper it is indeed suggested that many cases of part-of-speech ambiguity can be handled by the parser with no special mechanisms.",
        "This paper is a summary of a section of the author's Ph.D. thesis (Milne 1983) with the same title and describes work done at the University of Edinburgh.",
        "That thesis presents ROBIE, a deterministic parser that is able to resolve lexical ambiguities and that is fully implemented in PROLOG.",
        "ROBIE has two lookahead buffers and does not use Marcus's Attention Shift mechanism.",
        "This means that ROBIE scans the current token and one more of lookahead.",
        "PARSIFAL scanned the current token and two lookahead cells.",
        "In this paper, only local ambiguities are addressed, that is, ambiguities that can be resolved within the sentence.",
        "Global ambiguities, which require context to resolve, are not discussed.",
        "For this paper, it is assumed that the reader is familiar with deterministic parsing and no other understanding of specific parsing mechanisms is assumed.",
        "In the rest of this paper, we look at lexical ambiguity from simple examples to more complex ones.",
        "We start with how words are defined within the parser to be ambiguous and how the morphology can be used to resolve ambiguities.",
        "Next we look at how word order and finally various types of agreement can be used to resolve most remaining ambiguities."

        "The results showed convincingly that they are potential garden paths.",
        "Many naive readers had considerably more difficulty with them than with their more straightforward counterparts.",
        "This was predicted for reasons explained below.",
        "This result seems surprising.",
        "If the subjects used all information available at the time the noun/modal word was encountered, then they should have had no trouble with these sentences.",
        "The fact that these are garden paths indicates that the readers did not use all the information available to them.",
        "Notice also that the ambiguity can be reformulated as: \"Do we have the end of a noun phrase, or a complex headnoun?\" We have already seen a case where people do not seem to use all the information available to them.",
        "In Milne (1983), several end-of-NP problems were presented that could lead to a garden path.",
        "In each of these, it was shown that the ambiguity was resolved on the basis of non-syntactic information, without regard to the following words in the sentence.",
        "In other words, we saw that the reader did not use all the information available.",
        "There is one crucial difference though.",
        "In the previous cases, non-syntactic information was used because the syntactic processor with its limited lookahead was sometimes unable to choose the correct alternative.",
        "In this case, the information necessary has already been absorbed by the parser.",
        "This suggests that the choice of alternatives is made locally inside the NP parsing rules, without regard to information about the type of sentence being parsed.",
        "In other words, the two-buffer pattern applies regardless of the rest of the sentence.",
        "This assumes that a noun/modal word followed by a tenseless verb is being used as a modal.",
        "This is similar to Fodor, Bever, and Garrett's (1974) old canonical sentoid strategy: a bottom-up analysis that took every N-V combination as a new S. Let us look at why this might be true in the parser.",
        "When the parser starts to parse a NP, it creates a new NP node and pushes it to the bottom item of the Active Node Stack.",
        "This operation makes the NP node the Current Active Node and parsing of the old Current Active Node is suspended.",
        "If the parser is parsing an S node, for example at the start of the sentence, then work on this node will be suspended until the NP node has been completed and dropped into the buffer.",
        "In ROBIE, unlike PARSIFAL, the pattern matcher for the grammar rules is allowed only to inspect the grammatical features of the two buffers.",
        "This means that the parser is unable to examine the contents of the Active Node Stack and, hence, the information that a tensed verb has already been found is unavailable to the NP parsing rules.",
        "This then suggests that the ambiguity will be resolved on the basis of local information only.",
        "It should be pointed out that although ROBIE does not examine the Active Node Stack, the current packet reflects its contents.",
        "For example, if the parser is parsing the major S node, the packet SS-VP will be active, but if the parser is parsing an embedded S node, the packet Embedded-S will be active.",
        "This information can be considered to provide local context to the parsing rules.",
        "This is the same as in PARSIFAL.",
        "This ambiguity is an end-of-NP problem and the choice of alternatives is made on the basis of limited and local information.",
        "This suggests that non-syntactic information may be used to resolve the ambiguity.",
        "There is one further possibility.",
        "The semantic choice mechanism is attempting to find the end of an NP.",
        "So far it has asked the question, \"Can this item be part of the NP?\" However, the end-of-NP problem can be reformulated as, \"Is it better to use this as part of the NP, or .as the start of the verb group?\" It is conceivable that the end of NP mechanism uses will as the start of the verb group in the majority of occurrences, hence leading to the apparent modal preference in these examples: (80) The trash can hit the wall.",
        "(81) The paper will hit the table.",
        "Due to lack of data, it is not clear exactly what people do in this situation and this would seem to provide an interesting area for further investigation.",
        "Another problem is the word her, which can be used as a pronoun or as a possessive pronoun.",
        "Note that we can say:",
        "(82) Tom kissed her.",
        "(83) Tom kissed her sister.",
        "Clearly in (82) her is a pronoun and in (83) her is a possessive determiner.",
        "When multiple part-of-speech definitions were added to ROBIE and the simple disambiguation method used, ROBIE always made her a possessive determiner.",
        "This difficulty arose in Marcus's parser because the rule to start a NP was ordered before the rule to parse a pronoun.",
        "These rules were copied directly into ROBIE's grammar.",
        "Since the word her has both the features \"ngstart\" and \"pronoun\", it could match both rules.",
        "Unfortunately, as Marcus's rules were stated, it always matched the NP starting rule, and hence was used as a determiner by the parser.",
        "This indicates one problem that can arise in the writing of a parser grammar.",
        "To handle possessive determiners, PARSIFAL and ROBIE have a rule with the pattern: [poss np] This rule will match a possessive pronoun after it has been made into an NP.",
        "It will also match any possessive NP, such as: the boy's or the boy's mother's.",
        "The rule then adds the feature \"determiner\" to the NP, making it eligible for the NP starting rule.",
        "By degrading the possessive NPs to determiners, both parsers easily handle examples of left branching such as: (84) The boy's mother's brother is his uncle.",
        "Another problem arose in (82) because the possessive NP rule was not sufficiently constrained.",
        "It is possible to use her as a determiner only where the next word can be part of a noun phrase with that determiner.",
        "To enforce this, the second buffer is checked to be certain that its contents will take the determiner.",
        "Using this approach, her in (82) would not be converted to a possessive determiner.",
        "The rule DETERMINER can run only if the next item will \"take a determiner\".",
        "This check is made by the syntactic category of the following word, rather than by a specially marked feature.",
        "This check could be done by having a list of all the possible categories as the pattern of the second buffer.",
        "As an implementation detail, this is in the form of an agreement check, merely to simplify this rule and to show its generality.",
        "The only remaining problem occurs when the verb can take one or more objects and the item after the word her can be either the second object, or an NP with her as a determiner.",
        "For example:",
        "(85) I took her grapes.",
        "(86) He saw her duck.",
        "(87) I gave her food for the dog.",
        "The examples presented above are all examples of global ambiguity, which is discussed in more detail in Milne (1983).",
        "In these cases the check of \"Will-the next word take a determiner?\", may or may not lead to the wrong analysis.",
        "This problem also interacts with the top-down component of verb phrase parsing and the semantic restrictions presented by it.",
        "The conflict between the determiner and possessive usage can be modelled as a conflict of rule priorities.",
        "If the possessive use is preferred, then this rule should match first.",
        "Conversely, if the object use is preferred, then the object rule should match first.",
        "Any error in reading these examples would be due to one rule having priority over the other, when the reverse should be the case.",
        "Finally, notice that with no help from either intonation or context, either analysis is possible.",
        "That is, there is not enough information in the sentence to determine a unique interpretation.",
        "We have now shown how to replace all the diagnostics Marcus used.",
        "In doing this, we enforced number and verb agreement on the rules before they could run.",
        "This was motivated to reject ungrammatical items, rather than for the handling of ambiguity.",
        "While there are still a few problems due to global ambiguity, the approach reported here has the same coverage as Marcus's diagnostics, and provides a better explanation of why people have trouble on certain sentences."
