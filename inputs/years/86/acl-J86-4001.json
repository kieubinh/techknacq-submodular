      "text": [
        "In the search for computational models of language, syntactic analysis of sentences has so far received much greater attention than morphological analysis of word forms.",
        "For example, Winograd (1983) in his thorough book on syntax and parsing methods has allocated six or so pages to the morphological analysis.",
        "That makes about one percent of the whole text.",
        "This does not, of course, mean that the author rates morphology unimportant, but it does, we believe, reflect the general interest of the research community.",
        "Such heavy emphasis on syntax on the one hand and almost total neglect of morphology on the other follows from the idiosyncracies of English.",
        "And due to the dominant role English has in the computational linguistic community, this somewhat unbalanced view permeates the computational linguistic literature.",
        "The neglect of English morphology has obvious reasons.",
        "The basic rules of English word inflection are quite simple.",
        "There are some fusion phenomena that produce portmanteau morphs resistant to inflectional analysis, but their number is small.",
        "For syntactic analysis of sentences, one needs a lexicon anyway.",
        "Why not then take the easy way out and let the lexicon bear the burden of morphology and carry at least the hard word forms if not all word forms as separate lexemes?",
        "For agglutinative inflectional languages, however, the economy of computation may shake hands with theoretical ambitions.",
        "In Finnish, to take an example close to our heart, a nominal may appear in a running text in thousands of different forms, and verbs have an even wider spectrum of forms (Karlsson 1983).",
        "The probability distribution of the word forms of a given lexeme is uneven, to be sure, but even the most conservative estimates render the brute-force method inappropriate in other than naive attempts for extremely limited purposes.",
        "Fortunately Finnish is an agglutinative language; portmanteau morphs are almost nonexistent.",
        "In order to analyze Finnish sentences computationally one must analyze word forms as well.",
        "This paper describes a morphological model for Finnish.",
        "The model has been fully implemented, and our tests rate it efficient.",
        "A synopsis of the model appears in Jappinen et al.",
        "(1983a).",
        "This paper describes the model in more detail.",
        "The functional requirements set for the model were:",
        "1. clean separation between linguistic knowledge and algorithms (we wanted to increment and modify the model without structural changes in the algorithm), 2. general and efficient analysis of inflectional, possessive, and cliticized morphs (all inflectional word forms should be analyzed on the basis of general linguistic knowledge; synthesis of word forms and the analysis of derivational forms were left out), and 3. support of an open lexicon (the model should recognize the occurrence of a new lexeme and support lexical update).",
        "The model we came up with is associative.",
        "It is not generative in the sense that it does not utilize, backwards or forwards, formal rules designed to generate valid and only valid Finnish word forms.",
        "The associative rules connect strings of phonemes directly with morphemes without passing through intermediate syntagmatic categories.",
        "The associative model is composed of two interrelated parts: 1. a collection of independent stimulus-result rules, each associating a (partial) phonemic stimulus with one or more morphemes, and",
        "2. a coherence constraint that determines which of the fragmentary results proposed by the rules make up a coherent whole.",
        "This model is the result of an empirical inquiry guided by pragmatic constraints.",
        "Therefore, the discussion places emphasis on computational issues rather than on theoretical linguistic argumentation.",
        "We first outline the problem, and then describe separately a model for its solution and various algorithms to realize the model.",
        "We also discuss and demonstrate an implementation, and contrast it with other known models."

        "Henceforth we call lexical entry or lexeme the basic word form that serves as a carrier of morpho-syntactic information about a word in a lexicon.",
        "Word form or simply form denotes an inflected lexeme.",
        "The grammatical representation of a word form is called grammatical word or word.",
        "The grammatical word of a lexeme in our model is singular nominative case for nominals and first infinitive for verbs.",
        "This is the practice of printed Finnish mono and bilingual dictionaries and lexicons.",
        "There is a one-to-many (one-to-thousands) mapping between lexemes and their valid forms.",
        "An effective inverse mapping is the analysis problem.",
        "Two distinct lexemes may, and frequently do, produce identical forms, homographs.",
        "Consequently, the analysis of a form is occasionally ambiguous, and it is paramount for the analysis to find all lexemes a given form represents.",
        "Any native Finn is able to produce without effort the proper phonemic (or graphemic) word form of a given lexeme to fit a given context.",
        "When various dialects are reduced into standard written orthographic Finnish, the lexeme takki (`coat'), to take a random example, may appear in text in any of the following forms: takki,takit,takin,takkien,takkiesi,takkina,takkeihin, takeissasi,takeittako,takeissannehan,takkeinensakohan,...1 Similarly, we can take any verb lexeme, say jakaa (`deliver'), and list all its distinct forms: jakaajaan, jaatjakavat, jaoin, jakanevat, jakakoot, jakaisimmejaetaankohan, jaettaisiinkohan,...1 A native speaker, when browsing lists such as (1) or (2), would accept the elements as valid forms and, furthermore, easily assign each its basic form, its lexeme.",
        "For the ninth element in (1), for instance, an average adult Finn would spontaneously recognize it as a properly inflected form of takki.",
        "But if asked to interpret the form, he after some hesitation would probably not be able to extract and identify affixes attached.",
        "The basic meaning-bearing unit in a word is a morpheme.",
        "The linear arrangements of morpheme classes in Finnish word forms are (Ikola 1977):",
        "(3) Nominals:",
        "Brackets are used to distinguish optional morpheme classes.",
        "VERBNOM (verb nominal) comprises two participle and four infinitive morphemes.",
        "Some of the classes are cross-categorial.",
        "COMPAR (comparison) may appear only with adjectival stems or with participial forms.",
        "Past tense can be joined only with the indicative mood; tense and mood are therefore expressed in a common class.",
        "Two clitics may be attached in a row, on rare occasions even three.",
        "In speech a < b means b follows a in time; in writing b is to the right of a.",
        "Once the morpheme classes and their ordering are made explicit, it is then easy for any given word form to isolate the representatives of the morpheme classes.",
        "A noun, say takkeinensakohan from (1), when matched against (3) is analyzed as takke+i+ne+nsa+ko+han corresponding to a stem, plural, comitative case, third person possessive, and two clitic morphemes.",
        "Similarly, a randomly picked complex verb form such as jaettaisiinkohan from (2) reads as jae+tta+isi+:n+ko+han, representing a stem, passive, conditional (and hence present tense) passive suffix (serving as a kind of \"fourth\" person), and two clitic morphemes.",
        "Each class has a small number of elements, and each morpheme has at most a few allomorphs, phonemic realizations.",
        "From the strategic point of view the morpheme classes fall into two categories.",
        "Other morphemes than the stems have a closed set of allomorphs.",
        "They can be recognized with a finite set of rules.",
        "Stems constitute a large and unbounded set of morphemes as new lexemes may develop and enter in the vocabulary.",
        "Hence the allo-morphic variants of stems cannot be directly used in a closed set of rules.",
        "To bound a set of rules, the rules for stems must recognize invariant parts of phoneme strings, not entire stem alternants.",
        "The original problem was thus decomposed into two parts: The Morphotactic Problem segments word forms and solves the allomorph relation for morphemes other than stems; The Stem Alternation Problem solves the residual allomorph relation for stems."
