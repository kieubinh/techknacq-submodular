        "For instance, the issue of habitual readings of verbs was not examined.",
        "The meanings of verbs with temporal aspects (such as plan ) were also not considered.",
        "In addition, we did not consider how to relate (in time) events from different sentences.",
        "The only events from different sentences that can be related are the utterance events.",
        "If two sentences occur in sequence, one can conclude only that the utterance event of the first ends before the utterance event of the second.",
        "The model developed here can, however, temporally order events within a sentence.",
        "Five criteria were suggested at the beginning of the paper for the representation of temporal information found in an English sentence.",
        "These criteria guided the development of our model.",
        "All criteria were met, except the compositional parse criterion in a few cases.",
        "There seem to be unavoidable special cases which can not be captured in compositional tense, adverb, and temporal connective rules.",
        "For instance, the meanings of some adverbs require tense information to determine their correct representations (e.g. just)."
