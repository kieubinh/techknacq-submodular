        "Initial trees have essentially the structure of simple sentences; auxiliary trees correspond to minimal recursive constructions and generally constitute structures that act as modifiers of the category appearing at their root and foot nodes.",

        "Since in string-rewriting systems, dependent lexical items can not always appear in the same production, the formalism does not prevent the possibility that it may be necessary to perform an unbounded amount of computation in order to check that two dependent lexical items agree in certain features.",
        "However, since in TAG's dependencies are captured by bounded structures, we expect that the complexity of this computation does not depend on the derivation.",

        "Some checking is necessary between an elementary tree and an auxiliary tree adjoined to it at some node, but this checking is still local and unbounded.",
        "Similarly, elementary trees, being minimal linguistic structures, should capture all of the sub-categorization information, simplifying the processing required during parsing.",

        "This paper focusses on the linguistic aspects of the relationship between Head Grammars and Tree Adjoining Grammars.",
        "With the use of examples, we not only illustrate cases where the two formalisms make similar analyses, but also discuss differences in their descriptive power.",
        "Further empirical study is required before we can determine the significance of these differences.",
        "We have also briefly studied the consequences of the notational differences between the formalisms.",
        "A more detailed analysis of the linguistic and computational aspects of these differences is currently being pursued."
