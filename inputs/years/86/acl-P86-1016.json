        "In doing so the system sheds light not only on the process of correcting misconceptions, but also on issues in natural-language generation, user models, and modeling certain contextual effects by a \"filtering\" of the knowledge representation.",
        "The ROMPER system functions as a part of a natural-language interface to a database or expert system.",
        "Input to ROMPER is a specification that a misconception has been detected.",
        "In this work a misconception is defined to be some discrepancy between what the system believes (i.e., what is contained in the system knowledge base) and what the user believes (as exhibited through the conversation).",

        "Several factors may influence the structure and content of responses to queries that reveal misconceptions.",

        "If the misconception is not important to these goals, the response may not address the misconception or may address it only minimally.",

        "This means that the system must not only give the user the correct information, but must present it in such a way so as to have the user adopt that information.",
        "ROMPER has a user model available to aid in this task.",
        "The user model constitutes what the system believes the user believes about the domain.",
        "It contains the same kind of information as is contained in the system's knowledge base â€“ an object taxonomy and information about objects' attributes and their values.",
        "The content of the user model, however, may be very different from the content of the system's knowledge base.",
        "For instance, it may contain less information than is contained in the system knowledge base, or it may contain some information that is inconsistent with the system knowledge base.",
        "The user model will not, however, contain more information than is contained in the system knowledge base since the system is assumed to be an expert in the domain.",
        "In an attempt to respond to a misconception in a natural way, the system operates on the model of the user attempting to find certain structural configurations which might indicate support for the misconception.",
        "If one of the configurations is found, then a response is generated that refutes the found support.",
        "ROMPER is specifically concerned with responding to two kinds of misconceptions: those involving an object's classification (which I call misclassifications) and those involving an objects attributes (which I call misattributions).",
        "Certain structural configurations have been identified indicating possible support for both kinds of misconceptions.",
        "Each identified configuration has a response strategy associated with it which may be instantiated to respond to the misconception.",

        "The view of natural-language generation taken in this system is the same as that taken in [McK82].",
        "The generation process is seen as consisting of two parts: (1) determining the content and structure of the response and producing a formal message specification, and (2) transforming that specification into actual English text.",
        "My work has concentrated on determining the content and structure of a response to a misconception.",
        "It attempts to automate the process of deciding what information to include in a response to a misconception by giving the system the ability to reason about certain classes of misconceptions and typical ways of correcting misconceptions in one of the identified classes.",
        "This should be contrasted with the a priori listing of misconceptions and responses found in most existing systems that handle misconceptions ([SC80], [BB78], and [Woo84]).2 The form of the responses generated by ROMPER derived from an analysis of transcripts of human conversational partners.",
        "These transcripts revealed that responses to statements containing misconceptions often include more than a simple denial of the wrong information.",
        "This is particularly true in circumstances where the misconception is about something important to the current goals of the participants.",
        "In addition to denying the information involved in the misconception, many misconception responses include both the corresponding correct information, and additional justification for the denial and correction given.",
        "The justification often involves refuting faulty reasoning that may have led the user to the misconception.",
        "While it may seem that the kinds of faulty reasoning that the user may be using to arrive at a misconception are limitless, the transcript analysis revealed a surprisingly small number of misconception support relations that are refuted by the human experts.",
        "In addition, these few misconception support relations can be couched in terms of a knowledge base (KB) structure rather than its content.",
        "Thus a system reasoning on a model of the user might look for such relations in a domain independent fashion.",
        "If one is found, information refuting the misconception support might be included in the corrective response.",
        "To see this, let us examine the number of ways that a human expert was found to correct one of the misconception types handled by ROMPER: misclassifications.",
        "The strategies used by the human experts to respond to a misclassification can be exemplified by the number of possible responses to the following misconception: U. I thought whales were fish.",

        "No, they are mammals.",
        "You may have thought they were fish because they are fin-bearing and live in the water.",

        "No, they are mammals.",
        "You may have thought they were fish since they are like the fish, sharks, in that both are large aquatic creatures and both scare people.",
        "However, whales are mammals since, (while fish have gills) whales breathe through lungs and feed their young with milk.",
        "R3.",
        "No, they are mammals.",
        "Before analyzing each one of these in detail, let us first note their similarities.",
        "Each of the above strategies can be seen as consisting of three parts: (1) a denial of the incorrect classification, (2) a statement of the correct classification, and (3) an offering of justification for the denial/correction pair.",
        "This three part strategy is, in fact, typical of all of the responses found in the transcript analysis.",
        "Notice that the denial of the incorrect information and the offering of the corresponding correct information is the same in each of the sample responses given.",
        "What distinguishes one kind of response strategy from another is the kind of justification given in each case.",
        "Responses R1 and R2 offer two different kinds of justification while R3 offers no justification.",
        "Given that examples of each of the above three kinds of responses were found in the transcripts, we must ask what causes one to be used in preference to another in a particular situation.",
        "One explanation is that different beliefs about what the user believes trigger the use of each strategy.",
        "Notice that each strategy can be seen as refuting a different kind of support for the misconception.",

        "The use of this strategy by an expert might be explained by the expert believing that the user believes that whales and fish are similar, and that that similarity may have led to the misclassification.",
        "An expert having these beliefs might very well find it reasonable to concede that the similarity between whales and fish does indeed exist, but then go on to show that that similarity is not enough to classify whales as fish.",
        "S/he may do this, as above, by offering properties that make whales mammals instead of fish.",

        "The schema captures a response like RI by specifying a denial of the incorrect classification, a statement of the correct classification, and then an offering of justification.",
        "The justification is in the form of conceding the similarity that may have led to the misclassification (e.g., the shared attributes), but overriding that conceded information with attributes that are not shP-ed by the OBJECT and the POSITED superordinate but instead distinguish the two.",
        "It should be pointed out that this schema encodes two kinds of information: a domain-independent specification of the content of each proposition included in the response (e.g., an object classification or shared attributes between objects), as well as information about the rhetorical force or communicative role played by each proposition (e.g., a denial or statement or conceded information).",
        "The content specification is derived from the transcript analysis.",
        "The rhetorical force is derived from both the transcript analysis and from work done by [McK82], [MT83j, and [Man841 who have developed theories about the role that a proposition can play in a discourse.",
        "The goal in using such a schema is to have a specification of a response that may be filled in with information from the user model and that, when instantiated, contains enough rhetorical information to be turned into a cohesive English text by a tactical component.",
        "The schema above meets both of these requirements.",
        "The justification included in R2 is also in the form of a concede/override pair.",
        "However, in the case of R2, rather than concede a similarity between whales and all fish, a similarity between whales and some subset of fish (i.e., the sharks) is conceded.",
        "The use of this response might be explained by the expert believing that the user believes whales and sharks to be similar and salient at this point in the discourse.",
        "The expert might imagine the user to have reasoned: \"I don't know how to classify whales, but I do know that they are similar to sharks and I know that sharks are fish.",
        "Perhaps whales are fish as well.\" This analysis was used in developing ROMPER by associating a schema based on responses like R2 with a user model configuration showing a similarity between the misclassified object and some descendent of the posited superordinate.",

        "What needs to be captured is the feeling that each view calls to mind a \"precompiled\" set of attributes that seem to be important while that view is in effect.",
        "An attempt to explain this effect has been made by defining object perspective as viewing an object as a member of one superordinate when, in fact, it may have many superordi-notes ([Cro77], [BW77], and [TWF*82]).",
        "The highlighting is achieved through a limited inheritance mechanism.",
        "An object inherits only those attributes contributed by the one superordinate deemed \"in perspective\".",

        "What seems to be happening is that the conversational partners are viewing an entire group of objects from the same perspective.",

        "Perhaps one of the most influential pieces of information useful in choosing a perspective is the user's current goal.",

        "In their work each perspective which can be taken on the domain objects is indexed by potential goals.",

        "The mentioned attributes are obviously thought to be important and one would therefore expect them to be given a fairly high salience rating in the active perspective.",
        "Thus, the choice of active perspective can be narrowed down to those in which the mentioned attributes appear with high salience.",
        "By the same token, the objects mentioned so far in the dialogue can also give a clue concerning the active perspective.",
        "One would expect that the active perspective would deem these objects important.",
        "Therefore the system might look for perspectives that give high salience ratings to many of the attributes associated with objects that have been mentioned in the discourse.",

        "This choice, however, is a question which remains as an open research topic.",

        "If one was found, the associated schema could be instantiated to generate a corrective response.",
        "The context-dependent nature of responses to misconceptions is accounted for not by having the process of correcting misconceptions change with context, but rather by having what the process works on change with context.",
        "A new notion of object perspective was introduced as an augmentation to a flat semantic network representation of the user.",
        "Object perspective provides a highlighting of the user model as a result of previous discourse.",
