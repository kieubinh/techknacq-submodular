        "The phrasal approach to language processing [13ecker75, Pawley83, Fillmore86] emphasizes the role of the lexicon as a knowledge source.",
        "Rather than maintaining a single generic lexical entry for each word, e.g.: take, the lexicon contains many phrases, e.g.: take over, take it or leave it, take it up with, take it for granted, etc.",
        "Although this approach proves effective in parsing and in generation [Wilensky84], there are three problems which require further investigation.",
        "First, phrase interaction: the lexicon provides representation for single phrases, such as take to task and make up one's mind.",
        "Yet it is required to analyze complex clauses such as he made up his mind to take her to task.",
        "The problem lies with the way the meanings of the two phrases interact to form the compound meaning.",
        "Second, phrase ambiguity: [Zernik86] phrasal parsing shifts the task from single-word selection to the selection of entire lexical phrases.",
        "When a set of lexical phrases appear syntactically equivalent, i.e.: he ran into a friend, he ran into an 1986 Mercedes, he ran into the store, and he ran into trouble again, disambiguation must be performed by semantic means.",
        "The conditions which facilitate phrase discrimination reside within each lexical entry itself.",
        "Third, phrase idiosyncracy: the meaning representation of phrases such as: lay down the law VS. put one's foot down, must distinguish the special use of each phrase.",
        "This paper is concerned in the representation of phrase meanings and the process of acquiring these meanings from examples in context.",

        "** S2: The famous mobster evaded prosecution for years.",
        "Finally, they threw the book at him for tax evasion.",
        "Depending on the contents of the given lexicon, the program may interpret these sentences in one of two ways.",
        "On the one hand, assuming that the meaning of a phrase exists in the lexicon, the program applies that meaning in the comprehension of the sentence.",
        "In Si, the program understands that the Democratic representatives did the \"dirty\" work in passing the bill for Reagan.",
        "On the other hand, if the figurative phrase does not exist in the lexicon, an additional task is performed: the program must figure out the meaning of the new phrase, using existing knowledge: First, the meanings given for the single words carry and water are processed literally.",
        "Second, the context which exists prior to the application of the phrase, provides a hypothesis for the formation of the phrase meaning.",

        "The phrase carry the water, for example, requires two kinds of knowledge:",

        "Unless the program maintains knowledge about resentment, the phrase have a chip on the should er, for example, cannot be represented.",
        "Thus, a variety of knowledge structures take place in encoding figurative phrases.",
        "Representing Phrase Meanings and Connotations The appearance of each phrase carries certain implications.",
        "For example, John put his foot down implies that John refused a request, and on the other hand, John read the riot act implies that he reacted angrily about a certain event in the past.",
        "John gave Mary a hard time implies that he refused to cooperate, and argued with Mary since he was annoyed, while John laid down the law implies that John imposed his authority in a discussion.",
        "The representation of each phrase must account for such implications.",
        "Three different phrases in sentences S3-S5 are applied in the same context.",
        "However, not any phrase may be applied in every context.",
        "For example, consider the context established by this paragraph: S6: Usually, Mary put up with her husband's cooking, but when he served her cold potatoes for breakfast, sheputherfootdomm.",
        "Could the phrase in this sentence be replaced by the other two phrases: 00 lay down the law,Or(b) read the riot act?",
        "While understandable, these two phrases are not appropriate in that context.",
        "The sentence she read him the riot act does not make sense in the context of debating food taste.",
        "The sentence she laid down the law does not make as much sense since there is no argument between individuals with non-equal authority.",
        "Thus, there are conditions for the applicability of each lexical phrase in various contexts.",
