        "Their dream has now been realized in a full-scale dictionary of Russian (Mel'cuk and Zholkovsky, 1985) and in example entries for French (Mel'cuk et al., 1984).",
        "Computer programs need still more explicit and detailed information.",
        "We have discussed elsewhere the kind of lexical information needed in a question answering system (Evens and Smith, 1978) and by a system to generate medical case reports (Li et al., 1985).",
        "This research was supported by the National Science Foundation under IST-8510069.",
        "A number of experiments have shown that relational thesauri can significantly improve the effectiveness of an information retrieval system (Fox, 1980; Evens et al., 1985; Wang et al., 1985).",
        "A relational thesaurus is used to add further terms to the query, terms I that are related to the griginal by lexical relations like sYnonymy, taxonomy, set-membership, or the part-whole relation, among others.",
        "The addition of these related terms enables the system to identify more relevant documents.",
        "The development of such relational thesauri would be comparatively simple if we had a large lexicon containing relational information.",
        "(A comparative study of lexical relations can be found in Evens et al., 1980).",
        "The work involved in developing a lexicon for a large subset of English is so overwhelming, that it seems appropriate to try to build a lexicon automatically by analyzing information in a machine-readable dictionary.",
        "A collegiate level dictionary contains an enormous amount of information about thousands of words in the natural language it describes.",
        "This information is presented in a form intended to be easily understood and used by a human being with at least some command of the language.",
        "Unfortunately, even when the dictionary has been transcribed into machine-readable form, the knowledge which a human user can acquire from the dictionary is not readily available to the computer.",
        "There have been a number of efforts to extract information from machine-readable dictionaries.",
        "Amsler (1980, 1981, 1982) and Amsler and John White (1979) mapped out the taxonomic hierarchies of nouns and verbs in the Merriam-Webster Pocket Dictionary.",
        "Michiels (1981, 1983) analyzed the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE), taking advantage of the fact that that dictionary was designed to some extent to facilitate computer manipulation.",
        "Smith (1981) studied the",
        "\"defining formulae\" - significant recurring phrases - in a selection of adjective definitions from Webster's Seventh Collegiate Dictionary (W7).",
        "Carolyn White (1983) has developed a program to create entries for Sager's Linguistic String Parser (1981) from W7.",
        "Chodorow and Byrd (1985) have extracted taxonomic hierarchies, associated with feature information, from LDOCE and W7.",
        "We have parsed W7 adjective definitions (Ahlswede, 1985b) using Sager's Linguistic String Parser (Sager, 1981) in order to automatically identify lexical-semantic relations associated with defining formulae.",
        "We have also (Ahlswede and Evens, 1983) identified defining formulae in noun, verb and adverb definitions from W7.",
        "At present we are working on three interrelated projects: identiication and analysis of lexical-semantic .elations in or out of W7; generation of computed definitions for words which are used or referred to but not defined in W7; and parsing of the entire dictionary (or as much of it as possible) to generate from it a large general lexical knowledge base.",
        "This paper represents a continuation of our work on defining formulae in dictionary definitions, in particular definitions from W7.",
        "The patterns we deal with are limited to recurring phrases, such as '\"any of a\" or \"a quality or state of\" (common in noun definitions) and \"of or relating to\" (common in adjective definitions).",
        "From such phrases, we gain information not only about the words being defined but also about the words used in the definitions and other words in the lexicon.",
        "Specifically, we can extract selectional information, co-occurrence relations, and lexical-semantic relations.",
        "These methods of extracting information from W7 were designed for use in the lexicon builder described earlier by Ahlswede (1985a).",
        "The computational steps involved in this study were relatively simple.",
        "First W7 definitions were divided by part of speech into separate files for nouns, verbs, adjectives, and others.",
        "Then a separate Keyword In Context (KWIC) Index was made for each part of speech.",
        "Hypotheses were tried out initially on a subset of the dictionary containing only those words which appeared eight or more times in the Kucera and Francis corpus (1968) of a million words of running English text.",
        "Those that proved valid for this subset were then tested on the full dictionary.",

        "2a.",
        "week any seven consecutive days b. couple any two persons paired together In each of these cases there is an implicit taxonomic superordinate \"set.\"",
        "The second frequently occurring subset of noun definitions containing \"Any\" begins with the following pattern: \"Any of\"-NP.",
        "This pattern has two principal realizations depending upon what immediately follows \"Any of.\"",
        "In one sub-pattern a quantifier, numeric expression, or \"the\" follows the initial \"Any of\" and begins an NP which contains the superordinate of the noun being defined.",

        "The other sub-pattern expresses a biological taxonomic relationship and has the following definition structure: \"Any of a/an\" <optional> modifier taxonomic level \"(\"scientific name\")\" \"of\" taxonomic superordinate either attributes or taxonomic subordinate The modifier is optional and modifies the taxonomic level of the noun being defined; the capitalized scientific name of the level follows in parenthesis; the taxonomic superordinate can be a noun or a complex NP and is the object of the second \"of\" in the formula; and the information following the superordinate is generally a coordinated structure, frequently coordinated NPs.",
        "Of the 901 instances of the definition-initial \"Any of a/an\" sequence 853, or 95 per cent, were biological definitions.",

        "f. archaeornis any of a genus (Archaeornis) of upper Jurassic toothed birds.",
        "The only sequences which break from the pattern described above are non-biological definitions, which do not have parenthetical information following the head noun of the NP following \"Any of a/an\" and biological definitions where that head noun is \"breed.\"",

        "c. poland china any of an American breed of large white-marked black swine of the lard type.",
        "The definition for \"globulin\" illustrates that even when a non-biological definition has a parenthesis, that parenthetical information does not immediately follow the NP following \"Any of a/an.\"",
        "The other definitions in (5) are instances of \"breed\" following \"Any of a/an.\"",
        "In general, when a definition begins with \"Any of a/an\" it is almost certainly a biological definition and that certainty is increased if the \"Any of a/an noun\" is immediately followed by parenthesis unless the noun of the pattern is \"breed.\"",
        "THE MEMBER-SET RELATION Another defining formula with an interesting resemblance to taxonomy also occurs in noun definitions.",
        "The pattern \"A member of\"-NP is similar to the basic organization of the \"Any\" definitions in that the immediate superordinate of the noun being defined is the object of the preposition \"of\" except in this pattern the relationship is, of course, member-set.",

        "g. friar a member of a mendicant order What we have here is a generic term for any member of the specified set.",
        "It is perhaps best thought of as similar to the part-whole relation -- a hand is part of a crew, a Frank is part of a tribe, an earl is (somewhat inelegantly) part of a peerage.",
        "In our data the nouns being defined with this formula are invariably human.",
