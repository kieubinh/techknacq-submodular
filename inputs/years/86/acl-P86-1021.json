        "Linguistic pragmaticists have noted that types of information status (such as given/new, topic/comment, focus/presupposition) can be intonationally 'marked' [1,2,3,4], that reference resolution may depend critically on intonation [5,6], that intonation can be used to disambiguate among potentially ambiguous utterances [7,8], and that indirect speech acts may be signalled by intonational means [9,10,11].",
        "Conversational analysis of naturally occurring data has found that speakers may signal topic shift, digression, and interruption, as well as turn-taking, intonationally [12,13,14].",
        "And the fact that intonational contours contribute in some way to utterance interpretation is itself unexceptionable [8].",
        "To date, however, identification of the prosodic phenomena involved -- and the proper mapping between these phenomena and their semantico-pragmatic effects -- has been largely intuitive, and the intonational phenomena involved have not been precisely described.",
        "Here, we describe how certain of the resources of the intonational system are employed in discourse.",
        "In particular, we discuss how speakers' choice of pitch range, accent, and tune contribute to the intentional and attentional structuring of discourse -- the way speakers communicate the relationships among their discourse goals and the relative salience of entities, attributes, and relationships mentioned in the discourse.1 Our findings emerge from an intensive study of a simple example of speech synthesis: the script of a computer-aided instruction system, TNT (Tutor 'n' Trainer) [16], which employs synthetic speech to tutor computer novices in the text editor vi.",

        "Previous research [12,14] has observed that 'topic jiamp' can be signalled by raised pitch, as well as increased amplitude and markers of self-editing, hesitation, and discontinuity – and that pauses and changes in rate characterize segment boundaries.",
        "In our work with the TNT script, we found that a hierarchical segmentation of discourse can be marked by systematic variation in pitch range, which can signal movement betweeen levels in the segment hierarchy.",
        "In addition, by varying the amount of final raiding or lowering at the end of phrases, we can indicate the degree of conceptual continuity between one phrase and the next.",

        "6.",
        "Note that 1 and 2 are treated as a unit here, although they are synthesized as separate phrases, since it seemed semantically correct.",
        "To illustrate the algorithms, we relate the TNT introduction presented in Figure 1 to its segmentation in Table 1.",
        "When the introduction is synthesized using the TTS default pitch range of 75-114 Hz, the topline for each utterance will remain around 115 Hz.",
        "However, the hierarchical relationship schematized above among the various segments may be signalled more clearly if the pitch range is varied.",
        "In our version of the script, each segment boundary is marked by a variation in pitch range which correlates with the segment's position in the overall discourse.",
        "So, major boundaries are denoted by the largest increases, with smaller increases marking subsegment boundaries, and so on.",
        "The segment beginning at 1, for example, is marked by raising the f0 topline to 150 Hz; that beginning at 14, by raising the topline to 136 Hz; and that beginning at 15, by raising the topline to 125 Hz.7 Human speakers do seem to employ a wider spectrum of pitch range variation than we have been able to use in synthesis, however.",
        "We would claim that the appropriateness of changes in pitch range is a function of the segmentation hierarchy -- and is not inherent in the utterance in isolation.",
        "Our algorithm for pitch range assignment can in fact enforce one segmentation of a given discourse over another and, in so doing, can disambiguate among potentially ambiguous reference resolutions.",
        "For example, It in line 7 of Figure 1 coindexes mistake, while it in line 8 coindexes word processing.",
        "A simple linear approach to reference resolution (such as [26] ) would have the second coindexical with the previous noun-phrase (np), mistake, but a hierarchical approach to discourse structure holds out the possibility that a referent in a segment dominating the current segment may also provide a referent [18], as, in fact, is the case here.",
        "While a little thought will make the appropriate referent clear, it is clearer when line 8 is produced with a larger pitch range to signal the beginning of a new subsegment of the segment headed by 4.",
        "By so doing, we lessen the possibility that a referent for this it will be sought in lines, 5-7.",
        "•The most likely candidate, found in 4, is now both intonationally and conceptually 8's superordinate discourse segment.",
        "While an increase in the pitch range indicates segment boundaries, a decrease in the final lowering effects can indicate the absence of such boundaries, and thus indicate that a given utterance and one which follows it are part of the same segment.",
        "So, manipulation of final lowering can also serve to indicate discourse structure, by identifying the internal structure of segments.",
        "For example, at one point in the TNT script, the following utterance constitutes an entire discourse segment, so it has the default final lowering (F=0.87); in consequence, the L% tone at the end of had will be only 87% as high as it would have been if final lowering had not applied.",
        "Here, the same utterance is synthesized with less final lowering the L% tone at the end of had, in particular, will attain 93% of its target height.",
        "In this segment, the first line does not end the segment.",
        "We further propose that the degree of final lowering may correlate with the utterance's position in the discourse hierarchy.",
        "Specifically, we suggest that minimal final lowering may indicate a 'push' onto the segment stack and greater degrees of final lowering 7 Our choice of ranges was determined in part by the TTS synthesizer, which tends to sound best when its topline ranges between 115-150 Hz.",
        "Preliminary investigation of pitch range changes in human speech indicates that, for male speakers, these choices are reasonable.",
        "Note also that it is the relationship among different range levels, not the actual values in Hz, which is important here.",
        "may be associated with 'pops' of this stack.",
        "In our synthesis of the TNT text, we have varied degree of final lowering for such 'pops' based upon the level of the segment which this utterance 'completes' (or, equivalently, the level of the segment the next utterance begins).",
        "So, to determine the amount of final lowering to assign when synthesizing line 7 in the TNT introduction, we first determine whether it completes a segment (representing a pop) or not (representing a push).",
        "If the former, we may note either that it completes the segment begun at line 5 (with a topline of 136 Hz), or that the subsequent segment is begun (by line 8) with a topline of 136 Hz.",
        "We assign final lowering of 0.90 when synthesizing line 7 based on either observation; this rather large amount (close to the synthesizer's default maximum of 0,87) conveys a relatively important change of subtopic within the larger discourse segment by indicating rather more disjunction than we would want, for example, between lines 9 and 10.",
        "We are currently testing the associations between pitch range/ final lowering variation and discourse structure proposed above in several ways: by pitch-tracking a large corpus of natural speech,8 by recording and analyzing subjects reading structured texts, and by asking subjects to perform tasks such as reference resolution from texts synthesized with varying pitch ranges."

        "We have particularly noted that the decision to accent or deaccent some item is sensitive to the position of that item in the discourse structure – that is, just as salience is always determined relative to some particular context, accent placement must be determined with respect to the segment in which the accentable item appears.",

        "This tune seems to indicate the speaker's belief that the speech act s/he is performing is superfluous.",
        "For example, a speaker may employ it to convey that the propositional content of his/her utterance is already known or would be obvious to the hearer (who, of course, may or may not be attending to it).",
        "Note that the speaker may or may not believe that this information is known, in order to wish to convey this meaning.",

        "Here tune choice may reflect attentional as well as intentional aspects of the discourse structure.",
        "Like the deaccenting of references to given items, 11*-FL sequence contours seem to convey `givenness' at a more general level.",
        "Second, we believe that tune can convey the speaker's commitment to some semantico-pragmatic structural relationship holding between the propositional content of utterances (as, that one 'completes' another or is subordinate to another).",
        "Many such relations have been proposed in textual analysis [36,37,15].",
        "In the phonological literature, continuation rise has been commonly associated with some sense of 'continuation' or 'more to come' [34].",
        "We have found, howe-rer, that this contour can be characterized more precisely as conveying a subordination relationship between the phrase uttered with continuation rise and other utterances in the discourse segment.",
        "For example, if the second phrase of line 1 is uttered with continuation rise, then this utterance appears to be subordinated to 2.",
        "That is, 2 'completes' 1.",
        "Without continuation rise on 1, all three utterances will appear to have equal status in the-seginent.",
        "Furthermore, continuation rise is not felicitous in all Contexts in which the simple sense that 'there is more to come' clearly should be appropriate; for example, continuation rise over 3 -- at the end of the tutorial introduction -- seems quite odd, even though more will clearly follow.",

        "Analysis of the 'meaning' of additional tunes is part of our future research.",
        "More generally, we must examine how structural relationships conveyed by tunes such as H*-1-L sequence are associated with those conveyed by pitch range.",
        "We have described certain mappings between intonational features and discourse phenomena, associating pitch range variation with the identification of discourse segments and with their internal coherence; accent with types of information status such as topic (focus) and the given/new distinction, with reference resolution and with contrastiveness; and tune choice with gthe,relationships among propositions in the discourse as well as -w4h,some propositional attitude the speaker wishes to associate with Ithose propositions.",
        "It appears that pitch range and accent placement are most closely associated with a discourse's attentional structure, while tune choice is more closely associated with its intentional structure.",
        "However, clearly this picture is too simple.",
        "Several intonational features may be used together to create some discourse effect; moreover, in some cases two distinct intonational phenomena seem to produce discourse effects that seem intuitively to be closely related.",
        "And sometimes several discourse phenomena may indicate conflicting intonational strategies.",
        "These problems are the subject of our future research."

        "We are currently testing and refining our hypotheses by 1) pitch tracking recorded natural discourse to determine pitch range manipulation, and 2) conducting pilot empirical studies of how principled manipulation of pitch range can affect reference resolution.",
