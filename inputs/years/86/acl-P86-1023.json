        "It has long been recognized that \"stress-shifting\" morphology (e.g., divin+ity) differs in quite a number of respects from \"stress neutral\" morphology (e.g., divine#ness).",
        "It is a well-established convention to mark the \"stress-shifting\" morpheme boundary with a \"+\" symbol and to mark the \"stress-neutral\" boundary with a \"#\" symbol.",
        "(Scare quotes are placed around \"stress-shifting\" and \"stress-neutral\" because these terms are probably not quite right.)",
        "This paper will also use the terms Level 1 and Level 2 to refer to the two types of morphological combination, respectively.",
        "This terminology is taken from the literature on Level Ordered Morphology and Phonology (e.g., [Mohanan]) which argues that \"+\" boundary (level 1) morphology is ordered before \"#\" boundary (level 2) morphology and that this ordering dependency has important theoretical implications.",
        "It is worthwhile to review some of the well-known differences between \"+\" boundaries and \"#\" boundaries.",

        "It is very easy, for example, for a decomposition program to decide erroneously that acclamation is derived from clam, meaning roughly the result of having been clammed up.",
        "If the program could somehow split the Latinate and non-Latinate vocabularies, then the program could know that -ation cannot be attached to clam because clam is not Latinate.",
        "The program accomplishes this by maintaining a short list of words marked with an ad hoc feature [ – Latinate].",
        "The program might perform even better if the Latinate vocabulary were split still further.",
        "Consider, for example, the split between words ending with -ent and those ending with -ant.",
        "The first class are likely to have variants ending with -ence and -ency and the second are likely to have variants ending with -ance and -ancy.",
        "It seems extremely implausible for an -ent word such as president to take an ant suffix: *presidant, *presidance, *presidancy.",
        "Thus, it would be desirable to partition the Latinate vocabulary into quite a number of subsets, each with different possibilities for suffixation.",
        "But how do we do this without assigning ad hoc features such as [+Latinate], [-Fent], [+ant], [+Declension 1], [+Declension 2], etc.?",
        "Not only is the feature approach ad hoc, but it also missing an important asymmetry.",
        "Note that most words ending with -ency (e.g., presidency) are derived from words ending with -ent (e.g., president), and crucially not the other way around.",
        "The intuition that the relation \"derived from\" is asymmetric has some distributional support: notice that the percentage of words ending in -ency which are morphologically related to words ending in -ent is much larger than the percentage of words ending in -ent which are related to words ending in -ency.",
        "(The program estimates these percentages to be 73% (36/49) and 5% (36/710), respectively, using a procedure described below.)",
        "This asymmetry is problematic for a concatenation model like MITalk's Decomp, which would place presidency and president on equal footing, deriving both from preside.",
        "Aronoff-style [Aronoff] truncation rules provide an attractive mechanism for accounting for the asymmetry.",
        "Recall that Aronoff proposed that nominee be derived from nominate by truncating the ate suffix and attaching -ee in a single step.",
        "These truncation rules were necessary for him so that he could maintain his Word Based Hypothesis.",
        "The Word Based Hypothesis claims that words are formed from other words (possibly via truncation) and not from bound morphemes.",
        "Thus, in Aronoff's theory, there is no bound morpheme nomin-; there are only words (e.g., nominate and nominee).",
        "The generalizations that would be attributed to nomin- in other",
        "theories are captured in Aronoff's system by his truncation rules.",
        "The program uses truncation rules to capture the symmetry in the 'derived from' relation by permitting -ent to be truncated before -ency, but not the other way around.",
        "Thus, presidency is derived from president - -ent + -ency, and president is not derived from presidency because does not truncate -ency before -ent.",
        "Truncation rules are subject to a number of constraints.",
        "In particular, truncation is only found at level 1; truncation cannot apply at level 2 because, as mentioned above, level 2 affixes attach to words, not bound (•° truncated) morphemes.",
        "How does the program decide which suffixes can be truncated and when?",
        "Let me introduce the notation -ency > -ent to mean (roughly) that words ending with -ency are likely to be derived from words ending with -ent.",
        "The precise status of the '>' relation should be to be explored more fully.",
        "In some cases, the relation is a necessary condition; if presidency is derived from an English word then it must be derived from president.",
        "In other cases, the relationship expresses a possibility but not a necessity.",
        "For example, words ending in -ation may be related to words ending in -ate, but not necessarily.",
        "Marchand describes the relation as follows: \"The English vocabulary has been greatly enriched by borrowings, chiefly from Latin and French.",
        "In course of time, many related words which had come in as separate loans developed a derivational relation to each other, giving rise to derivative alternations.",
        "Such derivative alternations fall into three main groups.",

        "Originally deriving from sbs in -ation, the type is now equally connected with the unextended radical, i.e. flirt (the older derivation ostentatious 1658 has not entered this latter derivational connection).\"",

        "Level 1 prefixes are processed through an analogous procedure, so that effect, for example, is derived from defect by truncating the ef- prefix and adding the prefix de.",
        "The truncation mechanism is not generally employed by most authors for prefixing, and it may be a mistake to do so, but I used it anyways, mostly because it was available and filled a practical need.",
        "The resulting decomposition program has been used to construct a forest of related words as illustrated below:",
        "The forest was constructed by applying the decomposition procedure to every word in the dictionary and then indexing the results to show which forms were derived from which stems.",
        "Thus 38 words were found to be related to the stem port and 36 words were found to be related to infect.",
        "These results seems extremely promising; most of the relations appear to agree very closely with intuition.",
        "Now that we have a fairly accurate method of decomposing words at level 1, how can this be put to practical use?",
        "For assigning stress, it would be useful to know the weight of the syllables in the stem.",
        "This is particularly necessary before so-called weak retraction suffixes (e.g., -ent, -ant, -ence, -able, ance, al, ous, ary).",
        "General principles of stress retraction (e.g., [Liberman and Prince]), predict strong retractors (e.g., -ate, -ation) always back the stress up regardless of syllable weight (degrade I degradation), whereas weak retractors do so only if the preceding syllable is light (refer I referent with a light syllable before -ent, as opposed to (cohere I coherent with a heavy syllable before -ent).",
        "Given syllable weight, it is relatively well-understood how to assign stress.",
        "A large number of phonological studies (e.g., [Chomsky and Halle], [Liberman and Prince], [Hayes]) outline a deterministic procedure for assigning stress from the weight representation and the number of extrametrical syllables (1 for nouns, 0 for verbs).",
        "A version of this procedure was implemented by Richard Sproat last summer, and was discussed at the last ACL meeting [Church].",
        "It it generally believed that syllable weight is derivable from underlying vowel length and the number of consonants, but if one is trying to assign stress from the spelling, it can be difficult to know the vowel length and the number of consonants.",
        "The fact that inhence has a heavy penultimate syllable and that inference has a light penultimate syllable is extremely difficult to determine from the spelling.",
        "It would be considerably easier if syllable weight (or some correlate thereof such as vowel length) were marked in a lexicon of stems, so that the program could determine syllable weight by decomposing a word into its peices, look them up in a morpheme lexicon, and then recombine the results appropriately.",
