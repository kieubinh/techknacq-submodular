      "text": [
        "It is widely acknowledged that DonneIlan's distinction [7] between referential and attributive uses of definite descriptions must be taken into account in any theory of reference.",
        "There is not yet agreement, however, as to where the distinction fits in a theoretical model of definite noun phrases.",
        "For Cohen [4], the intention that the hearer identify a referent constitutes a crucial difference between the referential and the attributive.",
        "Barwise and Perry [3], on the other hand, treat their value-loaded/value-free distinction as the central feature of the referential versus the attributive.",
        "However, as pointed out by Grosz et al.",
        "[9], this analysis ignores an essential aspect of DonneIlan's distinction, namely, the speaker's ability, when using a description referentially, to refer to an object that is independent of the semantic denotation.",
        "The problem of determining the correct interpretation of DonneIlan's distinction is of considerable importance.",
        "First, DonneIlan's distinction seems to violate the principle that reference to physical objects is achieved by virtue of the descriptive content of referring expressions.",
        "This principle can be found practically everywhere – for example, in Frege's sense and reference, Rusell's theory of descriptions, and Searle's speech acts.",
        "In the referential use of definite descriptions, however, reference seems to be established independently of descriptive content.",
        "If I say \"The man over there with a glass of white wine is...,\" I may be successful in my act of referring – regardless of whether the person over there is a man or a woman, the glass is full of wine or grape juice, the color of the beverage is white or red, and so on.",
        "This, if accepted, has far-reaching consequences for the meaning of referring expressions, for the logical structure of propositions, and for the theory of propositional attitudes.",
        "Second, the referential/attributive distinction forces us to reconsider the division between semantics and pragmatics.",
        "It seems that a speaker's intentions in using a referring expression do make a semantic difference.",
        "If I say \"Smith's murderer is insane,\" meaning that whoever murdered Smith is insane (the attributive case), what I say is true if and only if the one and only murderer is insane.",
        "If, on the other hand, my intention is to use the definite description referentially (referring to, say, Tom, who is accused of being the culprit), what I say is true if and only if Tom is indeed insane – whether he is the murderer or not.",
        "Unless we understand the interaction between conventional meaning and a speaker's intentions in such cases, we cannot hope to construct an adequate model of referring and language use in general.",
        "Finally, DonneIlan's distinction brings to the fore the role of identification in the speech act of referring.",
        "Both Strawson and Searle ([17,16]) attempted to analyze referring in terms of identification and identifying descriptions.",
        "But DonneIlan has pointed to what seems to be a clear distinction between cases in which identification is required (referential use) and those in which it is not (attributive use).",
        "This calls for a new analysis of the speech act of referring, one that does not rely on identification as a central concept.I In this paper, I present a general framework for treating Donnellan's distinction.",
        "In particular, I contend the following:",
        "1.",
        "The apparent simplicity of the referential/attributive distinction masks three aspects of the problem of reference.",
        "In a sense, it is not one distinction but three: the first has to do with representations of objects, the second – with referring intentions, the third – with the choice of referring expressions.",
        "2.",
        "These three distinctions are independent of one another, and should be handled separately.",
        "Each is relevant to a different component of a plan-based model of reference: the data base, the planner, and the utterance generator, respectively.",
        "3.",
        "Although the three distinctions are mutually independent,",
        "• Using a definite description \"the 0\" to refer to whoever or whatever the 0 may be, versus using \"the (0” to refer to an object x, whether or not x is indeed the 0 (the speech act distinction)."

        "How is the referential to be distinguished from the attributive?",
        "Two criteria are usually offered:",
        "1.",
        "Even though, when used attributively, the description must denote the intended referent, in the referential use this is not necessary.",
        "2.",
        "In the referential use, the speaker has a particular object in mind, whereas in the attributive he does not.",
        "These criteria have been taken to be equivalent: any use of a definite description that is referential according to one criterion should also be classified as referential according to the other (and similarly for the attributive use).",
        "However, the equivalence of the two criteria is really an illusion: some uses of definite descriptions are referential according to one criterion, but attributive according to the other.",
        "For example, let us suppose that John, a police investigator, finds Smith's murdered body, and that there are clear fingerprints on the murder weapon.",
        "Now consider John's utterance: \"The man whose fingerprints these are, whoever he is, is insane.\" Note that John intended to speak of Smith's murderer, and he may very well have been successful in conveying his intended referent, whether or not the fingerprints indeed belonged to the murderer.",
        "Hence, according to the first criterion, the description, \"The man whose fingerprints these are,\" was used referentially.",
        "On the other hand, John did not have any particular person in mind.",
        "Hence, according to the second criterion, the description must have been used attributively.",
        "Many, including DonneIlan, regard the second criterion as the more significant one.",
        "But even this criterion is given two conflicting interpretations.",
        "On the one hand, \"having a particular object in mind\" is taken as an epistemic concept: this view holds that one can have a particular object in mind while referring only if one knows who or what the referent is.",
        "On the other hand, the criterion also receives what I call the modal interpretation.",
        "According to this reading, the referential use of a definite description is simply tantamount to employing the description as a rigid designator.",
        "Obviously, the two interpretations are not equivalent.",
        "As Kaplan demonstrates (111, one can use a description as a rigid designator without having any idea who the referent is.",
        "Thus, there are three aspects of DonneIlan's distinction that should be carefully separated.",
        "These aspects can be represented in terms of three dichotomies:",
        "• Having knowledge of an object versus not having such knowledge (the epistemic distinction).",
        "• Using a description as a rigid designator versus using it as a nonrigid one (the modal distinction).",
        "The epistemic, modal, and speech act distinctions correspond to three components that a plan-based model of reference must possess.2 Any such model must contain the following:",
        "1.",
        "A database that includes representations of objects 2.",
        "A planner that constructs strategies for carrying out referring intentions 3.",
