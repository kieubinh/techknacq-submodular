      "text": [
        "The application of techniques from the domain of Automated Reasoning to the problem of natural language correctness offers solutions to at least some of the deficiencies of traditional approaches to computer assisted language learning.",
        "By supplying a specialized inference mechanism with knowledge about what is correct within fragments of natural language utterances, a flexible training device can be designed.",
        "It prompts the student with e. g. randomly generated sentence frames, where slots have to be filled in.",
        "The system then accomplishes two main tasks:",
        "(1) It tries to diagnose possible errors in the students response in order to build up an internal model of the current capabilities of the student in terms of strictly linguistic categories.",
        "(2) It gives an explanation of the diagnostic results to guide the student in his search for a correct solution.",
        "In contrast to other approaches (c.f.",
        "Barchan et al.",
        "1985, Pulman 1984, Schwind 1987) we concentrate our efforts more on the handling of fragmentary utterances, instead of trying to analyse the correctness of complete sentences.",
        "The enormous difficulties connected with the design of a universal error diagnosis for natural language sentences may only partially be seen as a motivation for this restriction.",
        "Other, equally important justifications could be mentioned as well: (1) The handling of only simple sentence fragments seems to be a more natural and transparent limitation compared with an ad hoc exclusion of important parts of the grammar from the rule system.",
        "Promising the student a universal sentence acceptor, the real capabilities of which are rather limited, may easily be misinterpreted as a kind of bluff, since the consequences of such a cut will always remain a mysterious thing to the student.",
        "Severe restrictions on the grammatical knowledge are inevitable at the moment, but probably nobody will ever be able to explain the language competence of a training system to a learner of a second language without totally confusing him.",
        "Hence, minimising the problem of grammatical coverage by accepting only fragments of sentences, drastically improves the prospects of finally achieving something like a \"water-proof\" solution.",
        "Nothing could be considered to be more harmful in a teaching environment than to blame a system's failure on the student.",
        "(2) The concentration on small sub-fields of grammar makes the determination of very precise and detailed diagnostic results possible.",
        "This, of course, is not so much important if seen only for the purpose of direct explanation: An explanation overloaded with details is likely to irritate the student.",
        "Nevertheless, a very precise diagnosis is a sound basis for building up a model of the current capabilities of the student, which advantageously may be used to guide the further course of interaction.",
        "(3) The approach allows a stepwise extension of the degree of sophistication while preserving the same basic principles on all levels.",
        "This enables a rather smooth accomodation to different performance classes of hardware as well as an easy adaptation to different paedagogical objectives.",
        "Indeed, there are good reasons to expect the very simple examples (e.g. the insertion of a correct German determiner) to be well suited for practical",
        "training purposes.",
        "(4) The focus on selected grammatical regularities facilitates a systematic training, which from a didactic viewpoint seems to be more promising than just the unspecified invitation: \"Type in an arbitrary sentence!\"",
        "with the always present risk to catch the system out.",
        "Here we prefer to guide the student in a rather unconstrained way by prompting him with carefully selected sentence frames or questions.",
        "To hide the limitations of the dictionary, as usual, the domain context of a simple exercise environment (a room, a shop, an airport etc.)",
        "is used.",
        "In its diagnostic capabilities the presented approach shows a strong analogy to the basic concepts usually applied within a system of Automated Reasoning: a hypothesis is verified to be in accordance with a set of initial facts and a set of rules, which for our special purpose model the correctness conditions of a specific training exercise.",
        "The initial facts are given as a logical combination of syntactic and semantic features describing the grammatical properties of certain word forms in the system prompt.",
        "The hypothesis results from the the student's response where word forms are internally represented by their associated features as well."

        "To formalize the correctness conditions of natural language constructs in a linguistically adequate manner we adopted two basic operators from a dependency grammar model (Kunze 1975): constraints of the kind: (*** <destination> <condition>) transmitters of the kind: (<source> <destination> <category>) Both of them operate on feature sets.",
        "A constraint reduces the feature set of a word form bound to the variable <destination> to its maximum subset which satisfies the given <condition>.",
        "Transmitters carry features belonging to a specific <category> from a <source> to a <destination>, changing the feature set at the destination according to a predefined agreement relation.",

        "Context variables belong to the sentence frame and receive their value (the feature set of a specific word form) already during the sentence generation process.",
        "The value of a slot variable, however, depends on the students response and is established by a pattern matching procedure based mainly on word class information.",
        "The power of the pattern matcher used determines almost completely the flexibility of the system: A rather simple one, using obligatory slot variables only (hence, restricting the slot to a fixed length) will be sufficient under certain circumstances.",
        "The additional use of optional slot variables allows the implementation of more diversified exercises.",
        "Sometimes even a simple parser for sentence fragments may be required.",

        "Unfortunately, this simplicity doesn't result in a very simple design for the inference engine as well.",
        "Difficulties arise from a peculiarity of the language training task: On the one hand, facts and rules are given to describe the correctness of natural language constructs.",
        "On the other hand, explanations are required about the deficiencies of a students solution.",
        "Probably the system is never asked to point out the reasons why a specific inference can be drawn, but it is expected to explain the reasons why a correctness proof can n o t be established.",
        "This, of course, requires a special diagnosis procedure which in the case of an error in the student's response searches for plausible alternatives which might have been leading to a correct solution.",
        "The diagnosis is carried out in two steps (figure 3).",
        "Using a classical non-deterministic forward chaining algorithm the first step tries to show the correctness by successively applying constraints and transmitters on all the feature sets previously bound to variables.",

        "transmitter waiting for application yet.",
        "This implies that cycles of transmitters are not allowed within the knowledge base, a configuration which actually doesn't occur in a natural language sentence, anyhow.",
        "The application of a constraint or a transmitter fails, if it results in an empty feature set at the destination.",
        "Failures due to the missing of facts in the knowledge base may indicate an error in the students response, and all the categories, variables and values concerned are stored as failure points to be analysed in detail later.",
        "A sentence frame can be considered to be correctly completed by the student, if all the relevant constraints and transmitters have been applied successfully.",
        "If such a solution cannot be found (that is, a mistake of the student has been encountered), the second step resumes the analysis by investigating the consequences of assuming in each case just the complementory feature set at the failure point.",
        "By doing this, the diagnosis procedure in fact tries to simulate the ignoring of the corresponding rule by the student and aims at finding out all the resulting consequences.",
        "To deliver the information needed by the second step of the diagnosis procedure requires to extend the capabilities of the basic routine for feature set comparison beyond the usual unification operations.",
        "In addition to the normal intersection between the relevant features at the <source> and the <destination> the procedure determines the complement of the feature set at the <destination> (see figure 4).",
        "To achieve the desired high resolution of the diagnosis unification is always carried out for a single category.",
        "All the other features are left unchanged.",
        "Given the case of an error in the students response the investigation of both alternatives, the intersection as well as the complement becomes necessary.",
