        "We argue that there are two qualitatively different modes of using a machine-readable dictionary in the context of research in computational linguistics: batch processing of the source with the purpose of collating information for subsequent use by a natural language application, and placing the dictionary on-line in an environment which supports fast interactive access to data selected on the basis of a number of linguistic constraints.",

        "A growing mass of work at present, both within the narrower field of computational linguistics and in the wider context of building knowledge-based systems, is focussed on making use of the lexical resources to be found in a number of (monolingual) dictionaries of the style exemplified by e.g.",
        "The Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English, The Collins English Dictionary, or Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary.",
        "These contain a wealth of information relevant to a wide range of natural language processing functions – a fact which is hardly surprising, given that such sources typically (and almost by definition) contain the results of substantial efforts to collate and analyse data about real language, to elicit collocational and distributional properties of words and to apply common principles of defining their meaning.",
        "The availability of dictionary sources on-line, in the form of machine-readable dictionaries (henceforth MRDs) and encyclopaedias, makes it possible to view these as repositories of large amounts of information, linguistic and extra-linguistic, which can be brought to bear at various points of the natural language understanding process.",
        "Developments in hardware, as well as research in computational linguistics, offer the technology both to process lexical resources and to extract from them what is relevant to computer programs concerned with various natural language processing activities.",
        "A number of recent projects have extracted data from publishers' tapes and subsequently used it to support activities such as syntactic parsing, speech synthesis, lexical disambiguation, semantic interpretation in context, spelling correction and machine translation.",
        "The common denominator in these projects is that the end product incorporates in some form appropriate fragments derived from the machine-readable source.",
        "There are essentially two different modes in which MRDs can be used (see Boguraev, 1987, for more details).",
        "The predominant technique to date involves an arbitrary amount of pre-processing, typically in batch, of the on-line source.",
        "Those parts of the dictionary entries which contain useful data for the task at hand are extracted and suitably represented in a form directly usable by a client program.",
        "Such a model of dictionary use does not in any way rely on the original source being available at the time the language processing application is active, and thus a batch derivation of the appropriate information is a suitable way of transforming the raw data into a usable repository of lexical knowledge.",
        "But the reality of trying to adapt information, originally packaged according to lexicographic and typographic conventions for visual presentation and not at all intended for automated natural language processing, suggests a different model of dictionary use.",
        "The non-trivial task of developing suitable procedures for preprocessing of the machine-readable source typically requires careful analysis of the properties of the particular MRD, and is best aided by having fast interactive access to appropriate fragments of it.",
        "In addition, many research projects of a more experimental nature focus on investigating the ways in which the availability of an MRD can aid the development of particular natural language processing systems.",
        "The assumption is that an analysis of the accumulated data in the dictionary will reveal regularities which can then be exploited for the task at hand.",
        "Just one example, from a number of projects currently under way in Cambridge, illustrating this point is the work of Alshawi (1987), who has analysed definition texts across an entire dictionary to produce a \"definition grammar\" together with an associated technique for parsing the natural language descriptions of words into semantic structures.",
        "Such projects depend critically not only on the availability of a machine-readable equivalent of a published dictionary, but also on a software system capable of providing fast interactive access into the on-line source through various access routes.",
        "Operational natural language processing systems clearly will have well-defined requirements as far as their lexicons are concerned, and once the format of lexical resources has been settled, retrieval of individual entries can be implemented fairly efficiently using standard computational and linguistic techniques (see e.g. Russell et al., 1986).",
        "The placing of a dictionary on-line, however, with the intention of making it available to a number of different research projects which need to locate and",
        "collate dictionary samples satisfying a wide range of constraints, requires an efficient and flexible system for management and retrieval of linguistic data.",
        "This is not the computationally straightforward issue it appears to be, as conventional database management systems (DBMS) are not well suited for on-line dictionary support, particularly when the entire dictionary is viewed as a lexical knowledge base, more complex in structure and facing more taxing demands in a natural language research environment.",
        "This paper addresses the problem in greater detail, by placing it into the wider context of research into computational linguistics and highlighting those issues which pose a challenge for the current DBMS wisdom.",
        "We propose a solution adequate to handle most of the lexical requirements of current systems, which is generalisable to a range of MRDs, and describe a particular implementation for single user workstations used in a number of ongoing research projects at the universities of Cambridge and Lancaster.",
        "2 The nature of the problem Several factors put the task of mounting a machine-readable dictionary as a proper development tool beyond the scope of current DBMS practice and make its conversion into a database of e.g. a standard relational kind quite difficult.",
        "Firstly, there is the nature of the data in a dictionary: typically, it contains far too much free text (definitions, examples, cross-reference pointers, glosses on usage and so forth) to fit easily into the concept of structured data.",
        "On the other hand, the highly structured and formalised encoding of other types of information (found in e.g. the part of speech, syllabification or pronunciation fields) makes a dictionary equally unsuitable for on-line access by information retrieval methods.",
        "The second factor is due to the nature of the only source of machine-readable dictionaries so far available – namely the publishers' typesetting tapes, originally constructed for the production of a printed version.",
        "The organisation of data there, aimed at visual presentation, carries virtually no explicit structure; a tape is simply a character stream containing an arbitrary mixture of typesetting commands and real data.",
        "This not only introduces the difficult problem of \"parsing\" a dictionary entry (addressed in detail by e.g. Kaz-man, 1986), but also raises the issue of devising a suitable representation for the potentially huge amount of linguistic data; one which does not limit in any way the language processing functions that could be supported or constrain the complexity of the computational counterpart of a dictionary entry.",
        "Finally, there is the nature of the data structures themselves.",
        "A text processing application, typically written in Lisp or Prolog, requires that its lexical data is represented in a compatible form, say Lisp s-expressions of arbitrary complexity.",
        "Therefore, even if we choose to remain neutral with respect to representation details, we still face the problem of interfacing to a vast number of symbolic s-expressions, held in secondary storage.",
        "This problem arises from the unsuitability of conventional data models for handling the complex data structures underlying any sophisticated symbolic processing.",
        "Partly, this is due to the inherent restrictions such models impose on the class of data structure they can represent easily – namely records of fixed format.",
        "But more importantly, conventional database systems make strong assumptions about the status and use of data they have to hold: databases are taken to consist of a large number of data records taken from a small number of rigidly-defined classes.",
        "It is not clear that a lexical \"knowledge base\", derived from a dictionary and intended to support a wide range of language processing applications, fits this model well.",
        "Some solutions to these problems will no doubt be offered by dedicated efforts to develop special purpose data models, capable of computationally representing a dictionary and amenable to flexible and efficient DBMS support.",
        "The work, at the University of Waterloo, on computerising the Oxford English Dictionary (Tompa, 1986) is a good example here; similarly, the desire to be able to mount computerised dictionaries on-line for in-house research motivates Byrd's work on a general purpose dictionary access method (Byrd et al., 1986).",
        "In the short run, alternative approaches reduce the complexity of the problem by limiting themselves to applying the machine readable source of a dictionary to a small class of similar tasks, and building customised interfaces offering relatively narrow access channels into the on-line data.",
        "Thus IBM's WordSmith system (Byrd and Chodorow, 1985) is concerned primarily with providing a browsing functionality which supports retrieval of words \"close\" to a given word along the dimensions of spelling, meaning and sound, while a group at Bell Labs has several large dictionaries on-line used only for research on stress assignment (Church, 1985).",
        "Alshawi et al.",
        "(1985) have used a machine-readable source directly for syntactic analysis of texts; however, the approach taken there – namely that of simple pre-indexing by orthography – does not generalise easily for applications which require the rapid locating and retrieval of entries satisfying more than one selection criterion."

        "The motivation for the design described here is divided equally between the diverse nature of MRD-based projects in Cambridge and Lancaster and the unique properties of the particular dictionary that they use.",
        "The suitability of the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) for research into computational linguistics has been discussed at length elsewhere (see, in particular, Michiels, 1982); below we will outline several projects undertaken in Cambridge as a context for highlighting its particularly useful characteristics insofar as they are relevant to this paper.",
        "LDOCE carries special lexical and linguistic information which is useful for a number of natural language processing tasks.",
        "1.",
        "The dictionary is unique in tagging word senses with grammar codes which provide very elaborate syntactic subcategorisation information; a procedure has been developed for mapping the grammar codes into feature clusters (in the style of e.g. Generalised Phrase Structure Grammar), subsequently to be used by a syntactic parser (Boguraev and Briscoe, 1987, describe this in detail).",
        "The transformation program is about to be integrated in a software system for gram",
        "mar support and development, both as a lexicon generator and as a tool for grammar debugging (Boguraev and Ritchie, 1987).",
        "2.",
        "The pronunciation information in LDOCE has provided the basis for a study, in the larger context of speech recognition, of the implications of the phonetic structure of the English lexicon for different methods for lexical access (Carter, 1986).",
        "Again in the context of speech recognition, we intend to tackle the problem of word identification from a lattice of phonemes by constructing a parser that uses information about both phoneme collocations and syntactic predictions derived from independent analyses of the phonetic and grammar coding fields in the dictionary.",
        "3.",
        "Furthermore, LDOCE carries special tags, known as subject and box codes, which encode semantic notions like the overall context in which a word sense is likely to appear (e.g. politics, religion, language) and selectional restrictions on verbs, nouns and compound phrases; we intend to use this information for further guidance during the word recognition process.",
        "Independently, an algorithm has been developed for analysing the semantic content proper of the dictionary entries by converting the definition texts in LDOCE into fragments of semantic networks (Alshawi, 1987); this opens opportunities for building a comprehensive and robust semantic component which could then be incorporated into any of the projects mentioned above.",
        "It is clear that in order to make full use of the computerised LDOCE, we need a dictionary access system with proper DBMS functionality, capable of efficient retrieval of entries satisfying selection criteria applying at various levels of linguistic description.",
        "The design of the system described here allows precisely such heterogeneous requests.",
        "What we offer is a software environment buffering the user from the typically baroque and idiosyncratic format of the raw dictionary source and allowing, via a carefully crafted interface, multiple entry points and arbitrarily complex access paths into the on-line lexical knowledge base."

      "heading": "4 Requirements for the dictionary",
      "text": [
        "database Three main requirements can be identified if the database is to perform the functions intended for it.",
        "Firstly, the source tape of the dictionary must be converted into a format to which fast access can be coupled.",
        "This involves, at the very least, overall segmentation of the original character stream into records corresponding to gross lexical categories such as head word, pronunciation and part of speech.",
        "This may be a highly complex task, as in Kazman's (1986) project to restructure the text of the OED, or it may be conceptually fairly straightforward, as in the case of LDOCE where considerable segmentation is already present.",
        "But in either case, given that the on-line dictionary is intended to support more than one application, a more elaborate structuring of the entries' individual records might turn out to be unsuitable for further unforeseen use.",
        "Fortunately, it is clear from work with computerised dictionaries in general that once an application has located the relevant fragment of a dictionary entry, local \"parsing\" into whatever format is needed can be fast and reliable, and can therefore be done \"on the fly\" by functions which manipulate individual entries on demand and have no permanent effect on the underlying source.",
        "Thus we should aim at incorporating the segmented version of the source intact into the database, to serve directly as its \"bottom layer\" in the sense that all access paths ultimately point to complete dictionary entries, which are then returned as the results of queries.",
        "Secondly, it should be possible to execute queries involving information of as many different types as possible.",
        "Even if the machine-readable source used is a comparatively structured one such as LDOCE, the creation of access paths will involve, for at least some types of information, the non-trivial (but fast) construction of an intermediate and temporary representation by means of the local parsing already mentioned.",
        "For example, subcategorisation information is often specified in a rather elliptical form in LDOCE, for the sake of human readability; this must be made explicit by a parsing process, as described in Boguraev and Briscoe (1987).",
        "Also, it is desirable to impose a phonologically motivated structure on pronunciations, which are typically given as a string of phonemes and stress markers.",
        "This will allow the user to specify a constraint on, say, \"the onset of the second syllable of the word\", whose position in the phoneme string will not be the same for all words.",
        "The straight indexing approach used by e.g. Boguraev and Briscoe (1987) for headword-based access cannot in general provide sufficiently flexible access routes.",
        "Thirdly, the user or client program should be free to specify different types of constraint in any combination.",
        "We cannot assume in advance that information of a given type will always be present in great enough quantities to allow efficient retrieval.",
        "For example, if the system is being used by an automatic speech recogniser, then at one point in the signal significant information on pronunciation may be available, but few syntactic or semantic constraints may be present; at another point, the situation may be reversed, with the speech signal itself yielding little phonological information but with an expectation-driven parser providing quite specific higher-level constraints.",
        "In each case, the stronger, more specific constraints must be used for access, and the weaker ones only for checking the entries retrieved.",
        "To achieve this, the system must clearly be able to estimate in advance what the most efficient search strategy will be.",
        "This ability to perform maximally efficient searches given many different kinds of constraint will also be important if the database is being used interactively to investigate properties of the language.",
        "If the system's claim to be interactive is to be justified, it must be able to tell the user in advance roughly how long a prospective query would take to evaluate, and roughly how many entries would be returned as a result."

        "Entries can also be accessed by spelling patterns.",
        "The codes used for the first three of these types of information have a fairly simple structure, and are hence trivial to extract.",
        "The fourth, subcategorisation, is indicated by a complex and highly discriminatory set of codes; the extraction of these codes from the elliptical form in which they occur in LDOCE is described in Boguraev and Briscoe (1987).",
        "We will therefore discuss here only the structuring of pronunciations and the treatment of definition texts.",
        "Pronunciations are represented in the dictionary as strings of phonemes and primary and secondary stress markers.",
        "Syllable boundaries are not reliably indicated.",
        "Therefore, in order to allow the syllable-based access that a speech recogniser would probably require, pronunciation fields are parsed into syllables and, within a syllable, into onset, peak and coda, using the phonotactic constraints given in Gimson (1980) and employing a maximal onset principle (Selkirk, 1978) where these yield ambiguous syllable boundaries.",
        "Thus for example the internal syllable boundary in the pronunciation of \"constraint\" is placed before the \"s\".",
        "The parser used for analysing pronunciations is a special-purpose one whose (very simple) grammar is incorporated into its code.",
        "This allows pronunciations to be parsed many times faster than by a general-purpose parser with a declarative grammar.",
        "It also allows constraints on relationships between syllable constituents to be relaxed when necessary.",
        "For example, the LDOCE pronunciation of \"bedouin\" is 'beduin, which violates the constraint that a syllable whose peak is u (as in \"put\") cannot have a null coda; this constraint is therefore relaxed to obtain a parse.",
        "The strategy used for indexing entries according to the words their definition texts was designed to reflect the fact that it is the semantic content of these words that is likely to be of interest to the user.",
        "This has two main consequences: (1) It is more appropriate to take root forms of words as keys than to treat inflectional variants differently, because it is the root that holds most of the semantic content.",
        "Indeed, the inflection used with a particular word often depends on the largely arbitrary choice of syntactic constructions used in the definition.",
        "Thus for example, entries whose definitions contain any of the words \"film\", \"films\" and \"filmed\" should all be indexed under \"film\".",
        "(2) Closed class words are unlikely to be useful as keys because their semantic content is limited and often highly context-dependent.",
        "In addition, many of them occur too often to be sufficiently discriminating for efficient lookup.",
        "Therefore only open class words are made available as keys.",
        "The task of deriving root forms of words is made much easier by the fact that LDOCE's definition texts are constructed largely from a set of two thousand basic words.",
        "When other words are used, they (or, in the case of inflectional variants, their root forms) are shown in a special font.",
        "Accurate root extraction for words not so marked can therefore be accomplished simply by stripping off affixes (which are themselves in the basic word list) and applying a few simple rules for spelling changes until a basic word is found.",
        "All irregular forms of basic words are stored explicitly.",
