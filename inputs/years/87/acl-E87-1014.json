        "To find the word sequence which maximizes the third term in the preceding equation, it is sufficient to find the sequence which maximizes the numerator; P(A) is, in fact, clearly not dependent on any W. Then, the recognition task can be decomposed in these problems: 1, perform an acoustic processing able to extract from the speech signal an information A representative of its acoustic features, and, at the same time, adequate for a statistical analysis;",
        "2. create an acoustic model which makes it possible to evaluate P(A 1 W), that is the probability that the acoustic string A will be produced when the speaker pronounces the word string W; 3. create a language model giving the probability P(W) that the speaker will wish to pronounce W; 4. find, among all possible sequences of words, the most probable ore.",
        "Even with small vocabularies it is not feasible to conduct an exhaustive search; so, we need to identify an efficient search strategy."

        "_The acoustic model must compute the probability P(A 1 IV) that the pronunciation of word string W will produce the label string A .",

        "Experts in linguistics usually classify sounds in classes, called phonemes [2].",
        "The same phoneme can be representative of many different sounds, but they are completely equivalent from a linguistic point of view.",
        "The Italian language is usually described with .11 phonemes; in our system we use an extended set composed of 56 phonetic elements, to take into account particular aspects of the process of pronunciation not considered by the usual classification: coarticulation, different behavior in stressed and non-stressed vowels, pronunciation of vowels and fricatives by people from different regions.",
        "Each word in the language can be phonetically described by a sequence of phonemes,",
        "representing the sequence of basic sounds that compose it.",
        "So, it is very useful to build up the acoustic model starting from phonemes.",
        "For each phoneme, a Markov source [5] is defined, which is a model representing the phenomenon of producing acoustic labels during pronunciation of the phoneme itself.",
        "Markov sources can be represented by a set of states and a set of transitions among them.",
        "Every 10 milliseconds a transition takes place and an acoustic label is generated by the source.",
        "Transitions and labels are not predetermined, but are chosen randomly on the basis of a probability distribution.",
        "Starting from phoneme models, we can build models for words, or for word strings, simply by concatenating the Markov sources of the corresponding phonemes.",
        "Figure 1 shows a typical structure for Markov model of a phonetic unit and figure 2 the structure of the Markov model for a word.",
        "The structure of Markov models is completely defined by the number of states and by interconnections among them.",
        "It is unique for all the phonemes and for all the speakers and has been determined on the basis of intuitive considerations and experimental results, because no algorithm is known to find the best structure to describe such a phenomenon.",
        "The different behavior in different phonemes and in the voice of different speakers is taken into account in the evaluation of the model parameters: probability of transition between pair of states and probability of emission of labels.",
        "This evaluation, executed in the training stage, is performed, given the word sequence W of training text and collected the acoustic label string A from the front-end, accordingly to the maximum likelihood criterion [1], maximizing the probability P(A I W).",
        "A speaker, during training, does not have to pronounce all the words in the dictionary; on the other hand, it is necessary that the text to be read contains all the phonemes of the language, each of them well represented in a great variety of phonetic contexts.",
        "In the recognition stage the term P(AI W) is computed on the basis of statistical parameters determined during the training; then it is necessary to evaluate the probability that the Markov source for the word string W will emit the label string A , going from its initial state to its final one.",
        "This must be done summing the probability of all the paths of this kind, but it could be computationally very heavy and impractical to count them all because_ their number depends exponentially on the length of A .",

        "If we ignore the language model (that means considering words as equiprobable), it would be impossible to distinguish omophones, (acoustically equivalent words), and it would be very hard to recognize correctly very similar words on the basis of the acoustic information only.",

        "is then based on the intuitive consideration that recently spoken words in a sentence have more influence than old ones on the continuation of the sentence itself.",

        "On the other hand, its predictive power is very high.",
        "If the information given by the language model were not available, in every context there would be uncertainty about the next word among all the 6500 words in the dictionary.",

        "For a 6500-word dictionary the number of different trigrams is about 270 billions; but from a corpus of 6 millions of words, only 6 millions of trigrams can be extracted, and not all of them are different.",
        "It is clearly evident that, even with the availability of a bigger corpus, it is not possible to estimate probabilities of trigrams by their relative frequencies.",
        "Trigrams never seen in the corpus must be considered allowable, although not very probable, otherwise it could be impossible to recognize a sentence containing one of them.",
        "To overcome this problem, some techniques have been developed, giving a good estimate of probability of never observed events [3].",
        "Sentences in the corpus are taken from economy and finance magazines, and, as a consequence, the model is capable to work well on phrases about this topic, worse on other subjects.",
        "Clearly, the availability of corpus on different topics could be very useful in order to use the language model in different contexts.",
        "Nevertheless, some studies demonstrate that language model could be still fruitfully used for a matter different to the main one, if the collected data are enriched with a small corpus (about 1-2% the dimension of the main one) related to the new subject.",
        "This technique is used to allow the recognition of sentences not on finance and economy.",
