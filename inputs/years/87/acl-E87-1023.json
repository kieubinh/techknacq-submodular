        "Preference strategies have often been used for dealing with the problem of ill-formed input (a particular case of robustness, cf below section 2.2) (AJCL 1983, Charniak 1983).",
        "Following Weischedel and Sondheimer (1983) we distinguish the cases",
        "where preference is part of the particular computation being performed (Wilks 1973, Fass and Wilks 1983, Pereira 1985) from the case where it is a separate process, run after the results of the computation have been obtained (Jensen et al. 1983, Weischedel and Sondheimer 1983).",
        "A frequent approach to preference is scoring.",
        "A numeric score is calculated, independently, for each competing interpretation and is then used to rank the interpretations.",
        "The best interpretations are then chosen.",
        "The score can be the number of constraints satisfied by the interpretation (Wilks 1973, Fass & Wilks 1983), where these constraints might be assigned relative weights by the linguist (Robinson 1982, Charniak 1983, Bennett and Slocum 1985) or calculated by the computer (Papegaaij 1986).",
        "Such techniques have been used extensively for speech recognition (Paxton 1977, Walker et al. 1978) and in the field of expert systems (such as Mycin, Buchanan & Shortliffe 1984), where the calculation of both score and ranking become quite complex with probabilities and thresholds.",
        "The problem with scoring is that it seems quite unnatural for a linguist to associate a score (or weight or probability) to a particular rule or piece of data when the knowledge being encoded is in fact qualitative.",
        "Furthermore, combining the scores based on different types of reasoning to calculate a global score for a representation seems a rather arbitrary procedure.",
        "Such a uniform metric, even if it can model actual linguistic knowledge, forces the grammar writer to juggle with numbers to get the behaviour he wants, thus making the preference process obscure.",
        "A further disadvantage of this approach is that the score is often based on the way interpretations are built, rather than on the properties of the interpretations themselves.",
        "Preference is also mentioned in a linguistic controversy started by Frazier and Fodor (1979) with their principles of right association and minimal attachment (Schubert 1984).",
        "There the problem is to disambiguate many readings (or interpretations) of a sentence in order to find the good (preferred) one(s).",
        "Various contributions on that issue have in common that bad interpretations are abandoned before being finished, during computation (Shieber 1983, Pereira 1985).",
        "Although this method speeds up the computation, there is a risk that a possiblity will be abandoned too early, before the relevant information has been found.",
        "This is shown by Wilks et al. (1985) who claim to have the ideal solution in Preference Semantics, which uses as part of its computation scoring and ranking."

        "In the following we refer to a '1-n translation' for this general phenomenon.",
        "We see two types of solutions to this problem, each of them applicable to specific classes of cases: i Spurious results can be eliminated on the basis of their own individual properties (e.g. well-formedness, completeness); for this we will use the term 'filtering'.",
        "ii Spurious results can be eliminated via comparison of competing representations, where only the best one(s) will have the right to survive; for this we will use the term 'preference'.",

        "The problem of forcing the system to come up with at least 1 translation (i.e. do something about possible 1-0 cases) will not be addressed here.",
        "In order to avoid confusion we will use the term 'robustness' to refer to this type of problem.",
        "We are aware of the fact that we deviate slightly from the standard use of the term preference.",
        "There are two main types of 1-n -ness: i linguistically motivated (i.e. real ambiguity in analysis, or true synonymy in generation).",
        "ii accidental, caused by overgeneration of the descriptive devices that define the resulting (or intermediate) interpretations.",
        "Note that overgeneration and ambiguity or synonymy may hide cases of undergeneration (et the robustness problem).",
        "We define the application of preference as the selection of the best element(s) from a set of competing interpretations of the same object.",
        "According to this definition the scoring and ranking mechanism described in the previous section is a case of preference.",
        "In the rest of this paper we will describe a preference device that is different from the scoring and ranking mechanism in the sense that it is not based on the way interpretations are built, but rather on linguistic properties of the objects themselves.",
        "Its main characteristics are that: i it applies to complete and sound (well formed) interpretations only.",
        "That is, all the other modules of construction, transformation and filtering have been applied (Ex: parsing, Wh-movement, etc).",
        "Thus, for these modules all competing representations are equivalent, and all the information needed for comparing them has been found.",
        "ii it is based on pairwise comparison between alternative (competing) interpretations of the same object.",
        "The problem can then be stated as follows: How do we make use of the linguistic knowledge in order to insure a 1-1 translation?",
        "It is our basic belief that it is impossible for the linguist to know the exact nature of a class of competing interpretations in advance.",
        "This implies that he cannot in general formulate one single rule that picks out the best one."
