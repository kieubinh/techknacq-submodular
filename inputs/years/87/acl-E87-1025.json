        "We noted above that classical DRT defines accessibility restrictions which rule out some perfectly legitimate examples, such as 15.",
        "We think that the accessibility restrictions that really hold, are the result of interactions between the genericness of the sentences involved, and the genericness of a sentence is reflected (among other things) in the type of discourse referents it generates.",
        "Example 14 starts out with a generic statement and suddenly switches over to a non-generic statement whereas the acceptable examples 15 and 16 consist of two generic sentences.",
        "It seems to be this switch of genericness which makes the pronominal reference impossible in example 14, and not the fact that we point into a quantified sentence.",
        "But it is not necessary that the sentences concerned belong to the same genericness category.",
        "The first of the following examples is unacceptable but the second and third examples are acceptable, despite mixed genericness:",
        "This asymmetry finds an explanation in the fact that non-generic sentences, such as the second sentence of example 23, (almost always) speak about individuals.",
        "A pronoun in such a sentence is therefore (in almost all cases) a denotational pronoun, trying to find an extensional value in an antecedent which could be used as its own denotation.",
        "Hence we will have to make sure that a denotational pronoun accepts only representations of individuals (of the form \"c(X)\") in the preceding sentence(s), and that a failure to find them must result in the entire discourse becoming unacceptable.",
        "Thus the \"he\" and \"it\" in the second sentence of example 23 will try to find representations of individuals in the first sentence, but there are only representations of \"stereotypes\", i.e. meta-level names for object level variables (of the form \"v(X)\").",
        "This makes denotational anaphora impossible in this case.",
        "3.",
        "Basically the same idea was developed by Bartsch 1979. though not in the framework of DRT.",
        "She says that pronouns such as those in 15 and 16 refer to stereotypes of objects rather than to the objects themselves.",
        "However, we think she overstretches this idea by claiming that ordinary donkey-sentences must be explained by means of stereotypes, also.",
        "There are, after all, perfectly non-generic donkey-sentences, such as \"Every farmer who bought a donkey slaughtered",
        "The same problem does not arise in example 24.",
        "Here we have an explicitly descriptional pronoun (\"one\"), and it will not care about the type of value that its antecedent has (i.e. whether it is \"c(X)\" or \"v(X)\").",
        "as it will only use the antecedent's intension anyway.",
        "Example 25. finally, is acceptable because generic sentences can talk about either individuals or \"stereotypes\".",
        "Although the third sentence (\"Whenever he spots it he abuses it.\")",
        "is generic, the pronouns in it will first try to find denotations in their antecedents.",
        "In this case, they will succeed: The first sentence of 25 is non-generic and has.",
        "of course, created representations of individuals (i.e. \"c(X)\").",
        "If there had been no suitable extensional antecedents, the pronouns would have started looking for intensional ones.",
        "This was the case in examples 15 and 16.",
        "In examples 19 to 22, finally, there were actually extensional antecedent values, but pragmatic considerations (i.e. world knowledge) forces the hearer in these cases to drop the (formally possible) denotational anaphora in favour of (definite) descriptional anaphora.",
        "Just finding intensional antecedents of descriptional pronouns is.",
        "however, not enough: You have then to decide how much of the intension (often scattered over several discourse referents) has to be copied in the place of the pronoun.",
        "But this is an other question altogether.",
        "often involving inferences over world knowledge, plausible reasoning etc., which cannot be dealt with here."
