        "The paper introduces a grammar formalism for defining the set of sentences in a language, a set of labeled trees (not the derivation trees of the grammar) for the representation of the interpretation of the sentences, and the (possibly non-projective) correspondence between subtrees of each tree and substrings of the related sentence.",
        "The grammar formalism is motivated by the linguistic approach (adopted at GETA) where a multilevel interpretative structure is associated to a sentence.",
        "The topology of the multilevel structure is 'meaning' motivated, and hence its substructures may not correspond projectively to the substrings of the related sentence.",
        "Grammar formalisms have been developed for various purposes.",
        "Generative-Transformational Grammars, General Phrase Structure Grammars, Lexical Functional Grammar.",
        "etc.",
        "were designed to be explanatory models for human language performance, while others like the Definite Clause Grammars were more geared towards direct interpretability by machines.",
        "In this paper, we introduce a declarative grammar formalism for the task of establishing the relation between on one hand a set of strings of terms and on the other a set of structural representations a structural representation being in a form amenable to processing (say for translation into another language), where all and only the relevant contents or 'meaning' (in some sense adequate for the purpose) of the related string are exhibited.",
        "The grammar can also be interpreted to perform analysis (given a string of terms, to produce a structural representation capturing the 'meaning' of the string) or to perform generation (given a structural representation, to produce a string of terms whose meaning is captured by the said structural representation).",
        "It must be emphasised here that the grammar writer is at liberty (within certain constraints)to design the structural representation for a given string of terms (because its topology is independent of the derivation tree of the grammar), as well as the nature of the correspondence between the two (for example, according to certain linguistic criteria).",
        "The grammar formalism is only a tool for expressing the structural representation, the related string, and the correspondence.",
        "The formalism is motivated by the linguistic approach (adopted at GETA) where a multilevel interpretative structure is associated to a sentence.",
        "The multilevel structure is 'meaning' motivated, and hence its substructures may not correspond projectively to the substrings of the related sentence.",
        "The characteristic of the linguistic approach is the design of the multilevel structures, while the grammar formalism is the tool (notation) for expressing these multilevel structures, their related sentences, and the nature of the correspondence between the two.",
        "In this paper, we present only the grammar formalism ; a discussion on the linguistic approach can be found in [Vauquois 78] and [Zaharin 87].",
        "For this grammar formalism, a structural representation is given in the form of a labeled tree, and the relation between a string of terms and a structural representation is defined as a mapping between elements of the set of substrings of the string and elements of the set of subtrees of the tree : such a relation is called a string-tree correspondence.",
        "An example of a string-tree correspondence is given in fig.",
        "I.",
        "The example is taken from [Pullum 84] where he called for a 'simple' grammar which can analyse/ generate the non-context free sublanguage of the African language Bambara given by : L m {2{ o XIX in N* for some set of nouns N, INI>1} and at the same time the grammar must produce a 'linguistically motivated' structural representation for the corresponding string of words.",
        "For instance, the noun phrase \"dog catcher hunter o dog catcher hunter\" means \"any dog catcher hunter\" and so the structural representation should describe precisely that.",
        "In the string-tree correspondence in fig. 1, there are three concepts involved : the TREE which is a labeled tree taking the role of the structural representation, the STRING which is a string of terms, and finally the correspondence which is a mapping (given by the arrows defined between substrings of STRING and subtrees of TREE (a more formal notation using indices would be less readable for demonstrational purposes).",
        "In the TREE, a node is given by an identifier and a label (eg.",
        "I:NP).",
        "To avoid a very messy diagram, in fig. 1 we have omitted the other subcorrespon-dence between substrings and subtrees, for example between the whole TREE and the whole STRING (trivial), between the subtree 4(5(6),7) and the two occurrences of the substring \"dog catcher\" (nontrivial), etc.",
        "We shall do the same in the rest of this paper.",
        "(Then again, this is the string-tree correspondence we wish to express for our examples - recall the remark earlier saying that the grammar writer is at liberty to define the nature of the string-tree correspondence he or she desires, and this is done in the rules, see later).",
        "We also note that the nodes in the TREE are simply concepts in the structural representation and thus the interpretation is independent of any grammar that defines the correspondence (in fact, we have yet to speak of a grammar) : for instance, the TREE in fig. 1 does not necessitate the presence of a rule of the form \"AP NP hunter -â–  NP\" to be in the grammar.",
        "A more complex string-tree correspondence is given in fig. 2 where we choose to define a structural representation of a particular form for each string in the language anbncn.",
        "Here, the case for n=3 is given.",
        "The problem is akin to the 'respectively' problem, where for a sentence like \"Peter, Paul and Mary gave a book, a pen and a pencil to Jane, Elisabeth and John respectively\", we wish to associate a structural representation giving the 'meaning' \"Peter gave a book to Jane, Paul gave a pen to Elisabeth, and Mary gave a pencil to John\".",
        "Fig.",
        "2 - A non-projective string-tree correspondence for anb c At this point, again we repeat our earlier statement that the choice of such structural representations and the need for such string-tree correspondence are not the topics of discussion in this paper.",
        "The aim of this paper is to introduce the tool, in the form of a grammar formalism, which can define such string-tree correspondence as well as be interpretable for analysis and for generation between strings of terms and structural representations.",
        "The grammar formalism for such a purpose is called the String-Tree Correspondence Grammar (STCG).",
        "The STCG is a more formal version of the Static Grammar developed by [Chappuy 83] [Vauquois & Chappuy 85].",
        "The Static Grammar (shortly later renamed the Structural Correspondence Specification Grammar), was designed to be a declarative grammar formalism for defining linguistic structures and their correspondence with strings of utterances in natural languages.",
        "It has been extensively used for specification and documentation,as well as a(manual) reference for writing the linguistic programs (ana-lysers and generators) in the machine translation system ARIANE-78 [Boitet-et-al 82].",
        "Relatively large scale Static Grammars have been written for French in the French national machine translation project [Boitet 86] translating French into English, and for Malay in the Malaysian national project [Tong 86] translating English to Malay ; the two projects share a common Static Grammar for English (naturally).",
        "The STCG derives its formal properties from the Static Grammar, but with more formal definitions of the properties.",
        "In the passage from the Static Grammar to the STCG, the form as well as some other characteristics have undergone certain changes, and hence the change to a more appropriate name.",
        "The STCG first appeared in [Zaharin 86], where the formal definitions of the grammar are given (but under the name of the Tree Correspondence Grammar).",
        "A STCG contains a set of correspondence rules, each of which defines a correspondence between a structural representation (or rather a set or family of) and a string of terms (similarly a set or family of).",
        "Each rule is of the form :",
        "The simplest form of such a rule is when al,...an are terms and B is a tree.",
        "The rule then states that the string of terms (1/,...,a_ corresponds (-1 to the tree while the entry CORRESPONDENCE gives the substring-subtree correspondence between the terms al ..... an and the subtrees $/,...,S of B.",
        "An example is given by rule S1 below which defines fines the 'string-tree correspondence in fig. 3.",
        "Fig.",
        "3 - Correspondence The alternative to the above is to give each a. in terms of a tree (ie.",
        "without reference to any rule), but then there is no guarantee that this 1:S 3:b 1 defined by SI tree will correspond to some string of terms.",
        "Even 4:c if it does, one cannot be certain that it would be the string of terms one wishes to include in the rule - after all, two entirely different strings of terms may correspond to the same tree (a paraphrase) by means of two different rules.",
        "Although in the example in fig. 3 above, the leaves of the TREE are labeled and ordered exactly as the terms in the STRING, this is not obligatory.",
        "For example, it is indeed possible to change the label of node 2 to something else, or to move the node to the right of node 4, or even to exclude the node altogether.",
        "In short, the string-tree correspondence defined by a rule need not be projective.",
        "Such elementary rules al...an-8 (with a/,..,a terms) can be generalised to a form where each ain (i=1,..,n) represents a string of terms, say A..",
        "Here, generalities can be captured if ai specilies the name of a rule which defines astring-tree correspondence Ai^Ti (for some tree Ti given in the said rule, but it is of little significance here), in which case the interpretation of the string-tree correspondence defined by al..an-B is taken to be A1..A 8 (here A1..A means the concatenation of the Vrings The substring-subtree correspondence will still be given by the entry CORRESPONDENCE.",
        "Fig.",
        "4 illustrates this.",
        "We shall discard the alternative and adopt the The generalised rule al,..an-B (with first approach.",
        "each ai being the name of a rule) can be extended further by letting ai be a list of rule names, where this is interpreted as a choice for the string-tree correspondence Ai-Ti to be referred to, and hence the choice for the string of terms Ai represented by ai.",
        "In such a situation, it may also be possible that we wish the topology of the tree B to vary according to the choice of Ai, and this variation to be in terms of the subtrees of the tree T.. For these reasons, we specify each a. as a pairl(REFERENCE, STRUCTURE) where REFERENCElis the said list of rule names and STRUCTURE is a tree schema containing variables, such that the structure represents the tree found on the right hand side of the \"-\" in each rule referred to in the list REFERENCE.",
        "This way, the tree B can be defined in terms of Ti by means of the variables (for example those appearing simultaneously in both ai and B).",
        "See the example later in fig. 5 for an illustration.",
        "RI, ..,Rn are rule names; the correspondence by Rule RA is interpreted as Ti Tn ^, and hence 4i â€¢ â€¢ ZLA 14 la Rules RN1 and RN2 below are examples of STCG rules in the form discussed above, where RN2 refers to RN1 and itself.",
        "Variables in the entry STRUCTURE are given in boxes, eg.",
        "Â©, where each variable can be instantiated to a linear ordered sequence of trees.",
        "For a given element (REFERENCE, STRUCTURE), the instantiations of the variables in STRUCTURE can be obtained only by identifying (an operation intuitively similar to the standard notion of unification - again, see later in fig. 5) the STRUCTURE with the right hand side of a rule given in the entry REFERENCE.",
        "As an immediate consequence to the above, an STCG rule thus defines a correspondence between a set of strings of terms on one hand and a set of trees on the other (by means of a linear sequence of sets of trees).",
        "The rule RN1 describes a correspondence between a single term and a tree containing a node NP dominating a single leaf (for example, it gives the respective structural representations for \"dog\", \"catcher\", etc.).",
        "The rule RN2 describes a correspondence between two or more terms and a single tree - note the recursive REFERENCE in the first element of RN2 (for example, it gives the structural representation for \"catcher hunter\" as well as for \"dog catcher hunter\", see later in fig. 5).",
        "The entry STRUCTURE of an element may also act as a constraint by making explicit certain nodes in the STRUCTURE instead of just a node dominating a forest (we have no examples for this in this paper, but one can easily visualise the idea).",
        "This means that the entry STRUCTURE of an element a.",
        "= (REFERENCE, STRUCTURE) in a rule al..a^8 is also a constraint on the trees in T., and hence on the strings in A.",
        "(as A. and T. are now sets), in a correspondence A.-Ti definea by a rule referred to by ai in its entry REFERENCE.",
        "Whenever it is made use of, such a constraint ensures that only certain subsets of Ti, and hence of A., are referred to and used in the correspondence described by al..an-B.",
        "The string-tree correspondence in fig.",
        "I is defined by rule RN3 below, which refers to rules RN1 and RN2.",
        "We show how this is done in fig. 5.",
        "Note that if two variables in a single rule have the same label, then their instantiations must be identical.",
        "The concept of derivation as well as the derivation tree have been defined for the STCG [Zaharin 86], but it would be too long to explain them here.",
        "Instead, we shall use a diagram like the one in fig. 5, which should be quite self-explanatory.",
        "Going back to fig. 2 where the string-tree correspondence for s3b3c3 is given, each substructure below a node S in the TREE corresponds to a substring \"abc\", but the terms in this substring are distributed over the whole STRING.",
        "In general, in a string-tree correspondence A/..A -.8 defined by a rule a1..a-8, it is possible that we wish to define a substring-subtree correspondence of the form A.",

        "handled by a rule of the form discussed so far because a structural representation (STRUCTURE) found on the left hand side can correspond only to a unit (connected) substring.",
        "We can overcome this problem by allowing a rule to define a subcorrespondence between a substructure in the TREE (in the RHS) and a disjoint substring in the STRING (in the LHS), where this subcorrespondence is described in another rule (ie.",
        "using a reference - SUBREFERENCE - for a substructure in the TREE, rather than uniquely for the elements in the LHS).",
        "One also allows elements in the LHS to be given in terms of variables which can be instantiated to substrings.",

        "The informal discussion in this paper gives the motivation and some idea of the formal definition of the String-Tree Correspondence Grammar.",
        "The grammar stresses not only the fact that one can express string-tree correspondence like the ones we have discussed, but also that it can be done in a 'natural' way using the formalism - meaning the structures and correspondence are explicit in the rule, and not implicit and dependent on the combination of grammar rules applied (as in derivation trees).",
        "The inclusion of the substring-subtree correspondence is also another characteristic of the grammar formalism.",

        "treating trees with each node having a single label.",

        "Furthermore, one can also express constraints on the features in the nodes - on individual nodes or between different nodes.",
