        "In face-to-face interaction, pointing gestures are used frequently and efficiently.",
        "Although their referential power is beyond any doubt, they have, up till now, hardly ever been treated in more detail.",
        "The disciplines concerned with them are mainly semiotics, linguistics and psychology.",
        "Recently, the investigation of natural pointing has also become interesting for the area of Artificial Intelligence.",
        "In dialog systems developed to date, objects could be referred to by more or less complex verbal descriptions or unique artificial identifiers only.",
        "Technical innovations (e.g., high-resolution graphic displays, touch-sensitive screens, pointing devices such as mice or joysticks) have made it possible to simulate pointing gestures to various degrees as well.",
        "Multimodal input is both more comfortable from the user's point of view, and a more natural simulation of interhuman communication.",
        "Therefore, several systems have been developed recently which allow the combination of verbal descriptions and pointing gestures for referent identification (see section 5.2).",
        "One example is the dialog system XTRA (a natural-language access system for expert systems) which is currently under development at the University of Saarbriicken.",
        "Its current application domain is to assist the user in filling out a tax form which is visible on the screen.",
        "In section 5.3, XTRA's deictic component TACTILUS is shortly presented.",
        "The term 'form deixis' shall henceforth denote all those pointing actions which are performed in order to specify regions or entries of a form.",
        "An adequate simulation of pointing gestures presupposes a thorough investigation of the regularities which underlie natural pointing.",
        "Therefore, the next three sections investigate natural pointing in more detail.",
        "Section 2 shows that pointing actions (although functionally similar) are not a uniform phenomenon but differ with respect to various aspects.",
        "Semiotics, linguistics and psychology (study of nonverbal behavior) are concerned with these investigations.",
        "The interdependency of describing and pointing is the topic of section 3.",
        "This relationship is relevant with regard to Ian",
        "guage processing, because natural and simulated dialog have a lot of problems in common.",
        "More details on the issues discussed in section 2 and 3 are to be found in Schrnauks (1986b).",
        "Section 4 treats the peculiarities of form deixis, which is the special type of deixis oc-curing in the XTRA system.",
        "Section 5 tries to clarify the extent to which technical pointing devices already in existence can be regarded as a simulation of natural pointing, or as a functional equivalent.",
        "In section 6, some steps towards even more accurate simulation are briefly mentioned.",

        "Successful reference by pointing requires that the addressee pays attention visually to the person who is pointing.",

        "Furthermore, pointing via mouse-clicks differs from natural tactile pointing, because there is no physical contact between finger and demonstratum.",
        "A better solution would be the use of a touch-sensitive screen on which 'real-world gestures' (see Minsky 1984) are possible.",
        "Touch-sensitive screens allow highly natural pointing gestures (see Pickering 1986), but have some shortcomings.",
        "e.g. a restricted degree of resolution.",
        "A problem just as serious as the aforementioned is the temporal dissociation of a pointing gesture and its corresponding phrase.",
        "This problem would be soluble if the system would accept input via voice.",
        "But this alone wouldn't be sufficient: There is no guarantee that spoken phrases and correlated mouse-clicks occur simultaneously.",
        "Furthermore, current voice-input systems have too small a vocabulary and cannot process fluent speech.",
        "Therefore, the most adequate simulation would be the combination of voice input/output and gestures on a much-sensitive screen.",
        "However, the state of the art with respect to the required devices is not yet sufficient."
