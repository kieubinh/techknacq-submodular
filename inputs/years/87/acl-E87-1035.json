        "This parser represents only one of many possible approaches to deterministic parsing.",
        "Therefore, the conclusion that deterministic parsing, in general, is impractical or psychologically implausible may be premature.",
        "In the next section, we outline the problems for the deterministic analysis of unbounded dependencies.",
        "In the succeeding sections, we present two alternative parsing techniques (and associated grammars) which make differing predictions concerning the onset and location of indeterminacy in the analysis of unbounded dependencies.",
        "We argue that the LR(1) parser is capable of deterministically resolving the local ambiguities which occur in these constructions, whilst the Lexicat parser is not.",
        "In the final section, we evaluate these predictions in the light of the Determinism Hypothesis (Marcus, 1980) and the Interactive Determinism Hypothesis (Briscoe & Boguraev, 1984; Briscoe, in press) and argue that the Lexicat parser in conjunction with the Interactive Determinism Hypothesis provides the most psychologically plausible and unified account of the parsing of unbounded dependencies."

        "Unbounded dependencies are found in English constituent questions, relative clauses and topicalised constructions.",
        "The dependency is between the preposed constituent and its point of attachment.",
        "For example, in (1) Who is preposed and functioning as direct object of the transitive verb like.",
        "(1) Who do you like e",
        "Most current theories of grammar represent the grammatical role of the preposed constituent by associating it with the normal position of a constituent having that grammatical role.",
        "In several theories, this position is occupied by a phonologically null category or trace which is grammatically linked to the preposed constituent.",
        "We will use e to mark this position because each of the grammars associated with the parsers we consider adopts a 'positional' account of the recovery of the grammatical role of the preposed constituent.",
        "However, we use e to mark an unambiguous point of attachment without any commitment to the presence of phonologically null categories or structure in the syntactic representation of unbounded dependencies.",
        "The dependency between preposed constituent and point of attachment is unbounded because an unlimited amount of lexical material can occur between these two points in grammatical English constructions of this type.",
        "For example, it is possible to construct more and more embedded examples like those in (2) which exhibit the same dependency as (1).",
        "Who do you think Kim likes e Who do you expect that Kim hopes Sandy likes e A parser for English capable of producing a syntactic representation adequate to guide semantic interpretation must recover the grammatical role of the preposed constituent.",
        "However, whenever these constructions contain verbs of ambiguous valency the correct point of attachment for the preposed constituent also becomes ambiguous.",
        "For example, in (3) there are two potential attachment points, or doubtful gaps (Fodor, 1979), written e?.",
        "(3) Who do you want e?",
        "to succeed e?",
        "The correct attachment of Who is ambiguous because both want and succeed can take, but do not require, NP objects.",
        "The ambiguity in (3) is global with respect to the sentence; however, identical local ambiguities exist for a parser operating incrementally from left to right.",
        "For example, in (4) the attachment of Who as object of want, although correct, remains doubtful until the end of the sentence.",
        "(4) Who do you want e?",
        "to succeed Bill",
        "Thus, at the point when the parser reaches a potential but ambiguous attachment point in the left-to-right analysis of the input, it cannot be sure that this is the correct attachment point because there may be another further downstream in the input, as in (3).",
        "Moreover, the point of attachment further downstream may be unambiguous and obligatory, resolving the local ambiguity in the other direction, as in (5).",
        "(5) Who do you want e?",
        "to replace e",
        "To resolve the local ambiguities in unbounded dependencies the parser requires access to an unbounded amount of left and right context, measured in terms of lexical material.",
        "Firstly, when a potential attachment point is found, the parser must know whether or not a preposed constituent exists to be attached.",
        "This requires potentially unbounded access to the left context of the analysis since the preposed constituent could have occurred an unbounded distance back from its point of attachment.",
        "Secondly, when a potential but ambiguous attachment point is found, the parser must decide whether it is the correct point of attachment.",
        "However, since this decision cannot be made determinately when the potential attachment point occurs, the parser requires access to the right context of forthcoming material downstream from the current position.",
        "The examples in (6) illustrate that this would require unbounded lookahead.",
        "Who does Kim want e?",

        "to think that the boss expects the directors to replace Sandy (with e) In (6) the correct point of attachment cannot be determined until the end of the sentence which can be arbitrarily far away (in terms of lexical material) in the right context.",
        "Berwick & Weinberg (1984:153f) argue that the Marcus parser can adequately represent an unbounded left context with finite resources if a successive cyclic and trace theoretic analysis (eg.",
        "Chomsky, 1981) of unbounded dependencies is adopted.",
        "However, both Church (1980) and Fodor (1985) demonstrate that the three cell lookahead buffer in the Marcus parser is not powerful enough to provide the required access to the right context in order to choose the correct point of attachment deterministically in many unbounded dependency constructions.",
        "Marcus' (1980) Determinism Hypothesis claims that local ambiguities which are not resolvable in terms of the lookahead buffer are resolved by parsing strategy and that therefore, many unbounded dependency constructions should be psychologically complex, 'garden paths' requiring extensive reanalysis.",
        "There is some evidence for syntactic preferences in the analysis of unbounded dependencies; the oddity of the examples in (7), which all require attachment of the preposed phrase in a doubtful position, suggests that the human parser prefers to ignore doubtful points of attachment and wait for a later one.",

        "b) I gave the boy who you wanted to give the books to three books.",
        "c) Sue wouldn't give the man who was reading the book However, as Fodor (1985) points out, the great majority of unbounded dependency constructions are not complex.",
        "Furthermore, the Marcus parser predicts a sharp distinction between 'short' unbounded dependencies which fall within the buffer and the remainder.",
        "No such distinction seems to be supported by the psychological data.",
        "Finally, unbounded dependencies exhibit an identical kind of ambiguity which can be either local or global.",
        "Therefore, we would expect a unified account of their resolution, but the Determinism Hypothesis offers no account of the resolution of global ambiguities (see eg.",

        "The theory tells us little about the resolution of global ambiguities, but implies that the mechanism employed must be similar to that used to recover from garden paths, involving interaction with other components of the language comprehension system.",
        "Using the Determinism Hypothesis, it is difficult to select between the two models outlined above (or indeed to conclusively rule out the Marcus parser) because the differing predictions concerning the onset of indeterminacy in the face of identical ambiguities are unimportant.",
        "The Determinism Hypothesis concerns only judgements of psychological complexity.",
        "These judgements marginally favour the Lexicat parser, but the data relating to garden paths with unbounded dependencies is hardly overwhelming.",
        "Moreover, the Determinism Hypothesis seems highly suspect in the light of the unbounded dependency examples because it predicts that local and global ambiguities are resolved using completely different mechanisms.",
        "At the very least, this approach is unparsimonious and leaves the resolution of global ambiguity largely unexplained.",

        "By default, the parser will apply a resolution rule or parsing strategy at such a point, but this can be overruled by specific non-syntactic information at the onset of the indeterminacy.",
        "The IDH implies that both local and global ambiguity is resolved at its onset (relative to some parsing technique) either by strategy or interactive blocking of the strategy.",
        "The IDH predicts, in addition, that garden paths will arise when a strategy-violating, local ambiguity is not resolved interactively, as a result of the absence or removal of the relevant non-syntactic information.",
        "Under the IDH, the differing predictions concerning the onset of indeterminacy in ambiguous unbounded dependency constructions become crucial in any comparison of the two parsing models outlined above.",
        "The Lexicat parser makes far stronger predictions because indeterminacy occurs much earlier in the analysis when less of the input is available in the left context.",
        "Since Lexicat prefers late attachment by default, it predicts that when a doubtful point of attachment is reached, which is the correct point of attachment, non-syntactic information in the available left context should block the preference to shift and force early reduction with the preposed constituent.",
        "By contrast, the Shieber/Pereira parser does not meet an indeterminacy except in globally ambiguous cases and then not until all the input is in the left context.",
        "It therefore predicts in conjunction with the IDH that there should be no garden paths involving unbounded dependencies and that there should be some non-syntactic information in the entire input which resolves the global ambiguity.",

        "In unbounded dependency constructions, Danly (reported in Cooper & Paccia-Cooper, 1980:1590 has demonstrated that the final syllable of the verb preceeding a correct attachment point is lengthened relative to an environment without a potential attachment point, or with a potential but incorrect one.",
        "Syllable lengthening is indicative of a phrasal or minor tone group boundary.",
        "Paul Warren and the author have since tested Danly's result by acoustically analysing ten readers' productions of four examples containing doubtful but correct early points of attachment and four similar examples with doubtful and incorrect early attachment points.",
        "The results tend to confirm the original finding since lengthening was found consistently (although the measurements did not achieve statistical significance; see Briscoe, in press).",

        "Nespor & Vogel, 1986) argue that such rules are not blocked syntactically by the presence of the trace/gap, but by an intervening prosodic boundary and that this explains the coincidence of other phonetic effects, such as lengthening, at points where contraction is blocked (Cooper & Paccia-Cooper, 1980:Ch10).",
        "In other words, contraction is the tip of a far more systematic prosodic iceberg which does reliably cue the presence of a correct attachment point.",

        "By contrast, in the Shieber/Pereira parser it is difficult to see how a prosodic boundary in unbounded dependencies could be used to select one of two possible reductions, whilst in an example like (11) it would need to force the parser to shift rather than reduce.",
        "In addition, the relevant non-syntactic information occurs at the onset of the indeterminacy for the Lexicat model but well before this point for the Shieber/Pereira model.",
        "This corroborates the far stronger prediction made by Lexicat, and also makes the mechanism of interaction for this model simpler (see Briscoe, in press).",
        "Finally, we should note that in the garden paths in (7) it is intuitively clear that examples b) and c) would be spoken with prosodic boundaries at the correct attachment point, and probably written with commas otherwise.",
        "Example a) on the other hand, is more subtle, but the experimental results reported above suggest that want would be lengthened in this context signalling the early attachment point.",
        "Thus, the IDH's prediction that garden paths are the result of the removal or distortion of non-syntactic information which functions to prevent the parser's default analysis in the face of indeterminacy is corroborated."

        "The paper has presented two approaches to the deterministic analysis of unbounded dependencies.",
        "The LR(1) technique is capable of resolving the type of local ambiguities which appear to occur in these constructions, suggesting that Church and Johnson-Laird were wrong to reject deterministic parsing on the basis of this data.",
        "However, we have argued that the Lexicat parser provides a better psychological model of the parsing of unbounded dependencies because a) it predicts the garden path data and b), in conjunction with the IDH, it predicts the apparent distribution of prosodic boundaries in these constructions more successfully, and c) it provides a unified account of the resolution of local and global",
        "ambiguities, and d) it is a simpler model of deterministc parsing which does not require preprocessing the grammar or maintaining state information concerning the left context."
