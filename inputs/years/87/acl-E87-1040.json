        "The main problem encountered in natural language (NL) understanding systems is that of the trade-off between depth and extension of the semantic knowledge base.",
        "Processing time and robustness dramatically get worse when the system is required to deeply understand texts in unrestricted domains.",
        "For example, the FRUMP system [DEJ79], based on scripts [SHA77], analyzes texts in a wide domain by performing a superficial analysis.",
        "The idea is to capture only the basic information, much in the same way of a hurried newspaper reader.",
        "A different approach was adopted in the RESEARCHER system [LEB83], whose objective is to answer detailed questions concerning specific texts.",
        "The knowledge domain is based on the description of physical objects (MPs: Memory Pointers), and their mutual relations (RWs: Relation Words).",
        "A further example is provided by BORIS [LEH83], one of the most recent systems in the field of text understanding.",
        "BORIS was designed to understand as deeply as possible a limited number of stories.",
        "A first prototype of BORIS can successfully answer a variety of questions on divorce stories; an extension to different domains appears however extremely complex without structural changes.",
        "The current status of the art on knowledge representation and language processing does not offer readily available solutions at this regard.",
        "The system presented in this paper does not propose a panacea for semantic knowledge representation, but shows the viability of a deep semantic approach even in unrestricted domains.",
        "The features of the Italian Text Understanding system are summarized as follows:",
        "• Text analysis is performed in four steps: morphologic, morphosyntactic, syntactic and semantic analysis.",
        "At each step the results of the preceding steps are used to restrict the current scope of analysis.",
        "Hence for example the semantic analyzer uses the syntactic relations identified by the parser to produce an initial set of possible interpretations of the sentence.",
        "• Semantic knowledge is represented in a very detailed",
        "form (word .sense pragmatics).",
        "Logic is used to implement in a uniform and simple framework the data structure representing semantic knowledge and the programs performing semantic verification.",
        "For a detailed overview of the project and a description of morphological and syntactical analyses refer to [ANT87] In [VE1,87] a text generation system used for NL query answering is also described.",
        "The system is based on VM/PROLOG and analyzes press_agency releases in the economic domain.",
        "Even though the specific application oriented the choice of words to be entered in the semantic data base, no other restrictions where added.",
        "Press agency releases do not present any specific morphologic or syntactic simplification in the sentence structure.",
        "This paper deals with definition of knowledge structures for semantic analysis.",
        "Basically, the semantic processor consists of:",
        "1. a dictionary of word definitions.",
        "2. a parsing algorithm.",
        "We here restrict our attention to the first aspect: the semantic verification algorithm is extensively described in [PAZ871 The representation formalism adopted for word definitions is the conceptual graph model [SOW84], summarized in Section 2.",
        "According to this model, a piece of meaning (syntence or word definition) is represented as a graph of coorry,rs- and conceptual relations",
        "Section 3 states a correspondence between conceptual categories (e.g. concepts and relations) and word-senses.",
        "A dictionary of hierarchically structured conceptual relations is derived from an analysis of grammar cases.",
        "Section 4 deals with concept definitions and type hierarchies.",
        "Finally, Section 5 gives some implementation detail.",
        "The present extention of the knowledge base (about 850 word-sense definitions) is only intended to be an test-bed to demonstrate the validity of the knowledge representation scheme and the semantic analyzer.",
        "The contribution of this paper is hence in the field of computer science and his objective is to provide a tool for linguistic experts."

        "• find a clear correspondence between the words of natural language and conceptual categories (concepts and relations).",

        "), adverbs (until).",
        "In our system, it was decided to derive some clear guidelines for the definition of a conceptual relation lexicon.",
        "As suggested by Fillmore in [FIL68], the existence of semantic links between words seems to be suggested by lexical surface structures, such as word endings, prepositions, syntactic roles (subject, object etc.",
        "), conjunctions etc.",
        "These structures do not convey a meaning per se, but rather are used to relate words to each other in a meaningful pattern.",

        "The problem of concept instantiation is however far more complex; this will be objective of futher study.",
        "Correspondence between lexical surface structures and conceptual relations The role of prepositions, conjunctions, prepositional adverbs (before, under, without etc.",
        "), word endings (nice-st, gold-en) verb endings and auxiliary verbs is to relate words, as in \"I go by bus\", modify the meaning of a name, as in \"she is the nicest\", determine the tenses of verbs as in \"I was going\", etc.",

        "For example, the phrases \"a book about history\" and \"an history book\" both embed the argument (ARG) relation: [BOOK]-- --(ARG)-- > [1-IISTORY] The translation of surface lexical structure into conceptual relations allows to represent in the same way phrases with the same meaning but different syntactic structure, as in the latter example.",
        "Conceptual relations also explicit the meaning of syntactic roles.",
        "For example, the subject relation, which expresses the active role of an entity in some action, corresponds to different semantic relation, like agent (AGNT) as in \"John reads\", initiator (INIT) as in \"John boils potatoes\" (John starts the process of boiling), participant (PART) as in \"John flies to Roma\" (John participates to a flight), instrument (INST) as in '.'the knife cuts\".",
        "The genitive case, expressed explicitly by the preposition \"or' or by the ending \"'s\", indicates a social relation (SOCR FL) as in \"the doctor of John\" or in \"the father of my friend\", part-of (PART-OF) as in \"John's arm\", a real or metaphorical possession (POSS) as in \"John's hook\" and \"Dante's poetry\", etc.",
