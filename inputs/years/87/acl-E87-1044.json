        "In the field of automatic natural language understanding, the problem of connecting syntax and semantics has been faced in three different ways.",
        "Some authors are persuaded that understanding natural language requires no use of syntactic knowledge.",
        "They claim that semantic representation can be built directly from the surface string, without the help of almost any syntactic source (1).",
        "Other authors proposed highly syntactic systems, starting from the idea that the representation of the syntactic structure is preliminary to the understanding process (2).",
        "While the work of this second group of researchers was concerned mainly with the understanding of individual sentences, the work of the partisans of semantics was about the understanding of whole texts.",
        "This shifting of attention substained the idea that syntax and semantics should be used in an integrated way.",
        "Most researchers have thought that semantics and syntax should be integrated with respect to both the representation and the processing (3); others have claimed that it is more efficient to build a full-blooded syntactic representation during the parsing process (4).",
        "(1) See the system IPP [Schank 80].",
        "(2) The LUNAR system [Woods 72] is a classical example.",
        "(3) An example is the Conceptual Analyzer [Birnbaum 81].",
        "(4) See MOPTRANS [Lytinen 85].",
        "Our approach shares some communalities with the last position.",
        "We reckon that semantic and syntactic processes should rely on separate knowledge bodies.",
        "uur effort is mainly focused on the realization of the integration by exploiting the isomorphism between syntactic structures and semantic representations, rather than by making syntactic and semantic processes interact, as it happens in previous integrated parsers (5).",
        "The idea of isomorphism is not carried out through one-to-one correspondence between syntactic rules and semantic ones - as in Montague-inspired parsers (6), but by mapping in a formal way grammatical and conceptual relations.",
        "The use of grammatical relations as intermediate level between syntax and semantics was also adopted in the KING KONG parser (7), but this system is still more near to the position which wants the representation of syntax and semantics as well as their processes to interact, while our choice is to maintain separate these different sources of knowledge.",
        "The subsequent paragraphs describe how this hypothesis works in SHEILA (Syntax Helping Expectations In Language Analysis), a prototype developed at CSELT laboratories (Turin, Italy).",
        "The aim of SHEILA is to analyze and to extract relevant information from news (coming from the Italian news agency \"ANSA\").",
        "The system is initially being applied to texts describing variations in the top-management of commercial societies; it has been fully implemented on a Symbolics Lisp machine.",
        "SHEILA takes advantage both from the use of expectations and from the combination of the results of a non-conventional syntactic analysis with the activity of a surface semantic analysis, based on the formalism of conceptual graphs (8).",
        "In this paper we describe just the principles which guide the integration between syntax and semantics.",

        "(7) See [BAYER 85] (8) See [Sowa 84] and also the fourth paragraph below.",
        "systems are semantic driven and they do only local syntactic checks during analysis.",
        "Doing local syntactic checks only involves little amount of syntactic knowledge and that is misleading in solving problems as anaphoric reference, prepositional attachment, conjunction and so on.",
        "In a different approach the integration has been realized during the syntactic structure representation construction: the syntactic parser makes use of semantic information to handle structural ambiguities.",
        "The questioning done by the syntactic analyzer to the semantic component aims to cut down the number of parse trees, but very many rules are required for this questioning, which has always been the most domain-dependent part of natural language understanding systems.",
        "In designing SHEILA we chose another way of integrating syntax with semantics.",
        "The basic schema may look rather classic: the system produces a syntactic analysis of the text, driven on the basis of purely syntactic knowledge.",
        "The semantic analyzer checks the syntactic output to see if the semantic relations among words are supported by it.",
        "But a classical syntax-first analysis is highly inefficient.",
        "It cannot solve structural ambiguities without the help of any semantic source and that leads to an explosion of the number of syntactic parse trees, some of them representing artificial syntactic ambiguities.",
        "So there are two problems: reducing the explosion of ambiguities and determining how semantic patterns for each word interact with syntax.",
        "Our proposal faces these problems through the original combination of two key ideas, i.e.:",
        "1) a flexible syntactic analysis, which is performed by constructing not all the explicit parse trees but just a graph, representing all the plausible grammatical relations among immediate constituents; 2) a formal way of interaction between syntax and",
        "semantics exploiting the isomorphism between syntactic structures (grammatical relations among immediate constituents) and semantic ones (conceptual relations).",
        "Such flexible syntactic analysis gains a discriminative power (sufficient for aiding semantics in solving ambiguities) and avoids the explosion in the parse trees number.",
        "Furthermore, the mapping between grammatical and conceptual relations can be defined through a limited set of formal rules."

        "Our system has the goal of generating a semantic structure that has to be consistent with the syntactic form used to convey it in the text.",
        "The aim of syntactic analysis is to support semantics.",
        "A first activity performed by the syntactic analyzer is the recognition of constituents of the phrase structure of text.",
        "This is done by applying a set of rewriting phrase structure rules for Italian language.",
        "These rules utilize the output of a previous morphological analysis that assigns to words morphological and lexical features (gender, number, lexical category and so on).",
        "In this analysis phase the application of the syntactic rules is limited to the recognition of the basic constituents of the phrase structure of the sentences.",
        "A basic constituent (BC, henceforth) is a NP, a PP or a VP described at a minimal level of complexity.",
        "At this level the grammar does not include rules of the form \"S --> NP - VP\" or \"NP --> NP - PP\", but it does include all the rules which describe the internal structures of BCs at the lowest level of recursion.",
        "Every BC has a head and may have one (or more) modifier.",
        "The head of a BC is the characteristic word, the word without which a group of words would fail to be an instance of that particular BC.",
        "So the head of a NP is a noun, that of a PP is a preposition, that of a VP is a verb, etc.(9).",
        "The head of a BC carries on all the morphological, syntactical and lexical features of the BC itself (10).",
        "Let us consider the sentence",
        "(1) \"Arturo vide una commedia con Meryl Streep.\".",
        "which may be interpreted both (1.a) Arthur and Meryl Streep saw a play together and (1.b) Arthur saw Meryl Streep while she was working in a play.",
        "At this first level of analysis (1) is rewritten as",
        "(9) The case of PP constitutes a partial exception to this principle.",
        "In fact while for syntax is sufficient to know all the relevant information concerning the preposition, semantics also need to know the information concerning the head of the NP which forms the PP.",
        "(10) This definition of head encompasses all constructions (endocentric and exocentric); it is closer to the traditional notion of governing categories than the definition given by Bloomfield [Bloomfield 35] in terms of distribution.",
        "See [Miller 85].",
        "The output of this first step of syntactic analysis is a structure that includes the syntactic ambiguities which will be properly treated at the second level of analysis (11).",
        "The second level of syntactic analysis has the goal of solving the problems about prepositional phrase attachment, noun phrase modification and conjunction and that of establishing grammatical relations among BCs (12).",
        "In the usual syntactic approach this activity, performed among more complex constituents, leads to the explosion of structural ambiguities.",
        "In our case the problem of handling ambiguity strongly arises: in fact the syntactic analyzer has been designed in order to treat a large variety of real texts which contain words out of their preferred grammatical order or which present elliptical constructions or, finally, which present very complex grammatical constructs.",
        "To reach such an adequacy we relax the grammar constraints, but that may cause the generation of artificial structural ambiguities (13).",
        "In order to solve this problem, we see all the groups of BCs having the same head as belonging to an equivalence class of constituents.",
        "Let us consider an example concerning this important point.",
        "In Italian the phrase \"Il sindaco Rossi di Torino\" (\"The major Rossi of Turin\") may involve some structural ambiguity if it has to be parsed without the help of semantic hints.",
        "In fact, this noun phrase can mean both that Rossi is the major of Turin and that Rossi is a major who comes from Turin.",
        "Performing a classical analysis this ambiguity generates two different structural descriptions.",
        "The first interpretation can be described as:",
        "(11) At this level we have not so many ambiguities because the linguistic phenomena which cause them are still not faced.",
        "In this phase of analysis lexical ambiguity (involving uncertainty about the lexical category of a given word) only arises; this kind of ambiguity is treated by taking into account the syntagmatic relationships of the words in question; the analyzer keeps different interpretations for the ambiguity which can not be solved without semantics.",
        "(12) Grammatical relations are primitive notions such as subject, object, complement and so on.",
        "(13) The constraining power is provided setting up",
