        "Consider the task of designing an \"argument understanding system\", a natural language understanding system (NLUS) where the input is restricted to arguments.",
        "Consider as well arguments constructed in a dialogue situation, where a speaker (S) tries to convince a hearer (H) of a particular point of view.",
        "The hearer patiently listens; hence, the input is \"one-way communication\".",
        "The argument understanding system therefore plays the role of the hearer, and tries to analyze the structure of the argument being presented.",
        "This task is isolated as a necessary first step for a hearer, in order to be a successful participant in a conversation.",
        "In other words, the hearer must have some representation of what it is the speaker wants him to believe, before judging credibility and eventually responding.",
        "Note that this language problem is relatively new and yet feasible.",
        "It is distinct from other NLU endeavors, such as story understanding, which appeal to a stereotype of content in order to reduce processing.",
        "In arguments, one is never sure what points the speaker will address; content can't be stereotyped.",
        "However, arguments have a defining characteristic – they are necessarily goal-oriented.",
        "The speaker wants to convince the hearer of some overall point.",
        "Thus, there is an overall logical structure to the input and this fact may be used by a hearer to control analysis.",
        "For our model, the representation for the structure of the argument is restricted to an indication of the claim and evidence relations between the propositions.",
        "The notion of evidence is discussed in more detail in section 4.",
        "A useful starting definition is: \"A proposition E is evidence for a proposition C if there is some rule of inference such that E is premise to C's conclusion – in other words, there is some logical connection between E and C\".",
        "In order to design an argument understanding system, what is then required is a computational model for the analysis of arguments.",
        "This in turn necessitates a theory of argument understanding, as a basis for the model.",
        "We suggest the following three components for the model:",
        "• a theory of expected coherent structure, used to drive a restricted processing strategy.",
        "Analysis is kept to a computationally reasonable task, by limiting the input to be recognized to a characterization of expected coherent forms of transmission.",
        "• a theory of linguistic clue interpretation, including insight into both the occurrence of clue words and their possible function in overall discourse.",
        "Clue words are those words and phrases used by the speaker to directly indicate the structure of the argument to the hearer (e.g. connectives).",
        "Detecting clues can thus also serve to constrain the processing for the hearer.",
        "Moreover, it is important to have some facility for recognizing and interpreting clue words, to build a model that is robust enough to process a wide variety of input.",
        "• a theory of evidence relationships.",
        "The most important",
        "observation is that pragmatic analysis is mandatory for an analysis model in order to recognize beliefs of the speaker, not currently held by the hearer.",
        "Evidence connections between propositions often appeal to unstated information not currently in the hearer's set of beliefs, but recognizable as an intended support relation on the part of the speaker."

        "• Connective clues can be assigned common interpretation rules according to the semantics of the clue.",
        "• To distinguish helpful versus necessary clues, the preference will always be to recognize the hybrid transmission; if clue rules or semantics force an exceptional reading, only certain exceptional structures should be accepted.",
        "• In all cases, a reading that can be derived with less computational effort will always be taken as the intended reading.",
        "• The cases where clues are necessary to force a certain interpretation provide insight into the function of clues; their use in conjunction with acceptable transmissions suggests a function of additional processing reductions.",
        "In order to recognize clues and incorporate their interpretation into a larger model that derives argument structure, we propose a separate clue interpretation module, interacting with the basic reception algorithm and the calls to the evidence oracle.",
        "Exactly how this module would function is left as future work.",
        "We do have a few initial insights, to suggest that clue interpretation is not only quite useful (argued previously in this section) but feasible.",
        "For connectives, the clue can be recognized from a classification.",
        "Then, determining whether a related proposition available from the list of eligibles is in fact related can be tested, according to the restrictions of the interpretation rule (as suggested in EX7).",
        "Further, the required semantic relation to the prior proposition can be passed as additional information to the oracle.",
        "The problem is that this oracle must do some kind of search for connections between facts and axioms of a knowledge base.",
        "How this semantic analysis is achieved depends on the underlying representation, but additional semantic constraints should help to restrict operations.",
        "For redirection clues, a processor would first have to recognize the appropriate phrase used.",
        "Some standard list (e.g., returning to, on the topic of) may be specified as a start.",
        "Then, the phrase should suggest some particular semantic content to the prior proposition (e.g., returning to the parks mentions parks as central).",
        "Now it is the form of representation of the propositions which may influence what is acceptable on a list of eligibles.",
        "If this semantic processing can be done very broadly, some calls to the oracle may be avoided, and this would be an improvement, assuming the oracle's operations encompass a more extensive search.",
        "An initial definition for evidence offered in Section 1 is: \"A proposition P is evidence for a proposition Q if there is some logical connection from P to Q – i.e., some rule of inference such that P is premise to Q's conclusion\".",

        "Since our characterization of input provides for all these forms, it strengthens our case for having a robust model.",

        "The computational model for the analysis of arguments, as described in the previous sections, is built on a theory of argument understanding; it, in turn, can be used as the basis for an implementation of an argument understanding system.",
        "One suggested real-life application area is a complaint bureau for department stores.",
        "Future work could include a full implementation of the model, and fine-tuning the design by selecting a particular application area for arguments.",
        "Although there is no complete implementation of the model to date, an overview of a possible design is presented here, to indicate how the various components of the model could come together into one integrated \"system\".",
        "(Note that an initial implementation of the model does exist nOw, written in Prolog (Smedley 1986).",
        "But this program merely tests the various reception algorithms described in section 2.",
        "The evidence oracle is replaced by a \"query the user\" facility.",
        "Nonetheless, the groundwork is in place for a future implementation that tests the other components of the model).",
        "In Figure 1, there are three main modules: the Proposition Analyzer, Clue Interpreter, and Evidence Oracle.",
        "The Proposition Analyzer takes as input the argument itself and produces a representation of its underlying structure.",
        "For each proposition of the argument the Proposition Analyzer attempts to assign it a location in the representation tree, indicating to which other proposition it relates (provides evidence for or receives evidence from).",
        "The Proposition Analyzer may call on the Clue Interpreter in the presence of clues, to assist in the interpretation.",
        "In addition, once an eligible relative to the current proposition is selected, the decision of whether an evidence relation exists is made by the Evidence Oracle, which is passed the two propositions and responds with a yes or no answer.",
        "The Evidence Oracle has available, a knowledge base of shared facts and, if .possible a model of the speaker.",
        "Moreover, if certain beliefs of the speaker can be extracted during the tests for unstated premises, the model of the speaker may even be updated by the Evidence Oracle, to aid in the processing of later propositions.",
        "In the absence of an implementation, the model can still be defended as a useful prescription of analysis of arguments.",
        "This is accomplished in Cohen (1983) by hand simulations of a variety of examples, to demonstrate robustness, and analysis of the complexity of the processing algorithms, to demonstrate efficiency.",
        "Another argument for the usefulness of the argument analysis model is that the theories developed for the model may be applied to the solution of other language understanding problems.",
        "As a result, the study of arguments may be viewed as a worthwhile exercise in the study of language.",
        "Some examples of the wider applicability of the model are: • It has been shown that extracting the underlying structure of discourse is useful to study the complexity of",
        "analysis.",
        "In the model, the separation of where and how propositions relate has provided a means of monitoring the number of calls to an inference engine, apart from the more difficult measurement of the process of actually filling in missing inferences.",
        "Hopefully, some characterization of structures for language problems other than arguments would be extremely beneficial.",
        "• It has been shown that certain linguistic constructions serve a function in facilitating the analysis process for the hearer.",
        "Developing common interpretation rules for various \"linguistic clues\" should continue for several language understanding tasks.",
        "• Some insight has been offered into how communication can proceed despite differing beliefs of speaker and hearer.",
        "The ideas outlined for recognizing beliefs similar to one's own, for judging plausible generalizations, should extend to other problems where reasoning beyond one's current beliefs is required.",
        "In addition, very few researchers seem concerned with truly \"low-level\" operations, determining not just \"what's a good representation for discourse\" but also how this representation can be derived, the specification of some algorithm for processing.",
        "It is in this domain that we feel our research is making a contribution.",
        "For future work, we are currently developing a model for discourse analysis in general, based on the principles of this model's design.",
        "A hypothesis worth investigating from the existing model is that the resulting representation serves to outline both the linguistic structure of the discourse and the intentional structure (the speaker's intentions behind utterances).",
        "The idea is that determining evidence relations in an argumentative discourse may best be described as uncovering the intended uses of utterances (e.g., speaker utters P in order to get hearer to believe Q), hence reflecting the plan of the speaker.",
        "But this main function of deriving intentional structure must be performed in conjunction with testing \"logical\" connections between propositions, and recognizing clues, thus isolating linguistic structure (or grouping into segments).",
        "We are interested in specifying a processing model for discourse understanding that operates at the level of individual utterances, in the manner of the argument model, to gain insight into how to derive linguistic and intentional structure simultaneously.",
        "This research is of significance to the current work of Grosz and Sidner (1986)."
