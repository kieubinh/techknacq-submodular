RoundsSimultaneous-Distributive Coordination and Context-Freeness context-freeness of particular natural languages has turned out to be considerably more difficult than anyone had expected it to be, and that solutions to difficult problems are likely to bear fruit outside the parochial confines of the original problem area and to call attention to hitherto unnoticed facts, an exercise such as this goes well beyond lily gilding or dead horse beating.",

      "text": [
        "We shall rely here on a number of established mathematical results which, taken together, give us a way of establishing trans-context-freeness for a language with certain syntactic properties.",
        "Theorem 1 (Bar-Hillel et al.",
        "1961) The set of context-free languages is closed under homomorphism.",
        "Theorem 2 (Interchange Lemma, Ogden et al.",
        "1985) Let L be a CFL, and let L, be the set of length n strings in L. Then there is a constant CL such that for any n, any nonempty subset Q,, of L,,, and any integer m such that n > m > 2, the following holds: Let k = 1-11 0, /(CO2)1 , where rx1 denotes x rounded up to the nearest integer, and II Q, II is the cardinality of Q.",
        "Then there are k distinct strings z1, zk in Q,, such that z, can be written w, xyi for 1 < i < k, and:",
        "Since this result is likely to be unfamiliar to some readers, we shall provide some commentary that should prove helpful in following the remainder of the presentation.",
        "Less forbiddingly stated, the Interchange Lemma says (in part) that in a CFL it is possible, for any n, to find at least two strings of length n with internal parts of the same length that can be exchanged for each other to produce strings that are also in L, providing that there are at least two distinct strings of length n. This makes it possible to prove the trans-context-freeness of a certain kind of language (what kind will be stated in a moment) by showing that once n become sufficiently large, the possibility of interchange no longer exists.",
        "For this strategy to work, it is required that the cardinality of L,, grow very rapidly as a function of n, which we can illustrate with the case of the copying language over the vocabulary {a, b} (call this language CP): For every n < 2, II CPn = 202, thus growing exponentially, while Ccpn2 grows only polynomially; the necessary conditions for use of the Interchange Lemma to prove trans-contextfreeness are thus satisfied by this case.",
        "Making use of the Interchange Lemma, we have proved the following further result:",
        "It includes H. It excludes every string not in H that is nonetheless divisible into two equal parts, the first over fa, bi and the second over {c, c/}.",
        "(This is the set K.) In order to apply these results, we sill actually need to consider not quite the sets G through N as defined above but the corresponding sets G' through N', where the latter differ from the former in including only strings whose x and y parts are of at least length 2.",
        "The subtraction of a finite subset obviously changes nothing essential, and Theorems 3 and 4 will hold, mutatis mutandis, of sets G' through N'.",
        "Hence: Theorem 5.",
        "Let H' and K' be as defined above.",
        "Then any set L' containing H' and disjoint from K' is trans-CF. Our strategy in applying these results to English will be to show that there is a subset F of English that can be homomorphically mapped to some L', and that F is the intersection of English with a regular language.",

        "must be considered ungrammatical rather than merely semantically ill-formed by virtue of the impossibility (because of number incompatibility) of supplying an intraclausal antecedent for the reflexive pronoun.",
        "The reason that this is so has to do with a fact about grammatical number in English that has not been generally recognized; namely, that it is, like grammatical gender in languages such as French and German, partly arbitrary.",

        "Note further that there is dialect variation regarding the grammatical number of certain collective nouns (such as government and company), which are strictly singular in American English, but which can be used as plurals in British English.",

RoundsSimultaneous-Distributive Coordination and Context-Freeness In case the number of occurrences of members of {this land, these woods} is equal to the number of occurrences of members of {itself, themselves}, then for all i > 1, if the ith noun in the string is land, then the ith pronoun is itself and if the ith noun is woods, then the ith pronoun is themselves (i.e., number agreement obtains between the nouns and the reflexive pronouns).",
        "Now let C = A B.",
        "Every string in C contains exactly as many pronouns as it does nouns, but for some i > 1, the ith pronoun fails to agree in number with the ith noun.",
        "Finally, let D be the subset of B consisting of just those strings that contain exactly as many nouns as pronouns.",
        "It is clear that D is part of English, and that C is disjoint from English, inasmuch as D exhibits the required number agreement and C does not.",
        "If D were the intersection of English with the regular set A, then the result that English is trans-CF would follow immediately.4 However, things are not that simple, and it is conceivable that the intersection of English with A is some proper superset F of D that is a subset of B (possibly B itself).",
        "The point of uncertainty here is the status of strings of A with unequal numbers of occurrences of nouns and pronouns, such as the following:",
        "(5) This land, these woods, and this land can be expected to rent itself and sell themselves respectively.",
        "(6) This land and these woods can be expected to rent itself, sell themselves, and rent itself respectively.",
        "While it might seem that such strings are ungrammatical, this assumption is called into question by Pullum and Gazdar's (1982) observation that there is no syntactic constraint in English governing the number of conjuncts in SD-coordinations.",
        "Thus, contrary to conventional wisdom, there are perfectly well-formed SD-co-ordinations with mismatched numbers of conjuncts; for example, The last two people in this picture live in Columbus and Chicago respectively.",
        "This undermines a number of older arguments that English is trans-CF that crucially assume that grammatical SD-coordinations must have equal numbers of conjuncts.",
        "In light of this, it may be that strings like (5-6) are to be considered syntactically well-formed, albeit lacking sensible interpretations, and so an argument presupposing the contrary cannot be used to show that English is trans-CF. We now show that Theorems 3, 4, and 5 allow us to get around this obstacle by, in effect, ignoring the strings with mismatched numbers of conjuncts in constructing our argument.",
        "If strings like (5-6) are grammatical, then the intersection of English with the regular language A is not the trans-CF language D but some proper superset F thereof.",
        "Theorem 5 tells us in effect that, no matter what its exact identity, if there is a sublanguage of English homomorphic to H' but none homomorphic to K', then English is trans-CF.",
        "This \"separation\" strategy yields the conclusion that so long as English contains D and excludes C, it is trans-CF. Recall now that, according to our definition, B includes strings like (5-6), along with sentences like (3) but, crucially, excludes (4) and all strings like it.",
        "To be precise, B includes all strings of A which, like (3) have exactly as many nouns as pronouns and cross-serial number agreement, but also all strings in A that, like (5) and (6), have more pronouns than nouns or vice versa.",
        "In virtue of Theorem 5, we will be able to show that English is trans-CF no matter what position we take on the grammaticality of strings like (5-6), so long as there are no English sentences in the subset C of A consisting of strings in which there are as many nouns as pronouns but at least one of the pronouns fails to agree with the corresponding noun in the first part of the string.",
        "Thus, the intersection of English with A is some subset F of B that is disjoint from C; it is of no consequence whether F is equal to all of B, or only to D, or to some proper subset of B that is a proper superset of D. We now define the homomorphism h such that h (this land) = a h (these woods) b h (itself) = c h (themselves) d For all z e {can be expected to, sell, rent, and, respectively}, h(z) This homomorphism maps F to L'.",
        "Since the CFLs are closed under homomorphism, and L' is trans-CF, F is trans-CF. And since the CFLs are also closed under intersection with regular sets, and the intersection of English with the regular set A has turned out to be trans-CF, it follows that English is also trans-CF.",
        "It should be immediately apparent that a similar strategy can be applied in instances such as the one mentioned in Section 1, where grammatical gender agreement is involved, providing that the language in question has instances of arbitrary gender.",
        "So, for example, we can construct for French a sublanguage parallel to D consisting of sentences like (7) Cette nation et ce pays sont respectivement une alliee et un associe des Etats-Unis.",
