      "text": [
        "The naive algorithm for generating quantifier scopings is to generate all permutations of the quantifiers.",
        "For a sentence with n quantified noun phrases this will generate n!",
        "different readings.",
        "But for the sentence",
        "(1) Every representative of a company saw most samples.",
        "there are not six different readings, but only five.",
        "The reading that is missing is the one in which most samples is outscoped by every representative but outscopes a company.",
        "A model for the disallowed reading could include a different company not only for each representative but also for each sample.",
        "The reduction in number of readings for a given sentence is not significant for sentence (1), but in the sentence (2) Some representative of every department in most companies saw a few samples of each product.",
        "there are only 42 valid readings, as opposed to the 120 readings the naive algorithm would generate, and this",
        "constitutes a significant difference indeed.",
        "The recent trend in computational linguistics has been to view more and more noun phrases, as well as other constituents, as introducing quantifiers, so that sentences with this much quantificational complexity are not at all unusual.",
        "(The immediately preceding sentence, for example, has six or seven quantifiers.)",
        "This observation of \"illegitimate readings\" is not intended as a new or controversial claim about an idiosyncrasy of English.",
        "It accords well with semantic judgments about the possibility of such readings.",
        "For instance, we find it impossible to view sentence (1) as expressing that for each representative there was a group of most samples which he saw, and furthermore, for each sample he saw, there was a company he was a representative of.",
        "We can find the same problem of illegitimate readings in the standard account of the \"Cooper storage\" mechanism for generating quantifier scopings (Cooper 1983).",
        "Cooper's method generates an expression in intensional logic for the illegitimate readings, but the expression contains an unbound variable and a vacuous quantifier.' Finally, the observation follows merely syntactically from the ill-formedness of certain logical form expressions.",
        "Let us examine why this is so.",
        "The propositional content of a sentence can be seen as combining specifications that restrict the range of quantified entities, together with assertions about the entities so specified.",
        "This intuition is often made formal in the use of logical languages that syntactically separate the notion of the range of a quantified expression from its scope by placing the information about the range in a part of the expression we call the restriction and the assertions in a part called the body.",
        "(Henceforth, we will uniformly use the terms restriction and body.)",
        "The separation of these two semantic roles of range and scope into restriction and body as an important fact of the logical structure of English can be seen, for example, in Woods's four-part quantifier structures (Woods 1977), in the recommendations of Moore (1981), and in the generalized quantifier research of Barwise and Cooper and others.",
        "The latter have demonstrated the necessity of such a separation for quantifiers other than the standard first-order ones (Barwise and Cooper, 1981; Cushing, 1976).",
        "But under this understanding of English logical structure, it follows that no sixth reading exists for sentence (1) above.",
        "Consider the reading in which the universal outscopes the most which outscopes the existential in the logical form for this sentence.",
        "Then, using the notation of Moore (1981) for four-part quantifier structures, the logical form must have the following structure: all(r, representative(r) , ...) since the universal is outermost.",
        "Now the existential is within the scope of the universal by hypothesis, and since it provides a restriction on the range of the variable r, it must occur in the restriction of the quantifier.",
        "Thus, we have: all(r, representative(r) & some(c, company(c), of(c,r)), ...saw(r,․)...) But where can the quantifier most be put to bind the variable s corresponding to the samples seen?",
        "It must outscope its occurrence in the body of the universal, but it must also by hypothesis outscope the existential in the restriction of the universal.",
        "To outscope both, it must outscope the universal itself, but this violates the assumed scope relations.",
        "Thus, no such reading is possible.",
        "By a similar argument, it follows from the logical structure of English that in general a quantifier from elsewhere in a sentence cannot come after the quantifier associated with a head noun and before the quantifier associated with a noun phrase in the head noun's complement.",
        "Most research in linguistic semantics, e.g., Montague (1973) and Cooper (1983), has concentrated on explicitly defining the range of possible scope relationships that can be manifested in sentences.",
        "But, to our knowledge, all fall prey to the profligacy of generation just outlined.",
        "We are concerned here only with suppressing readings that are spurious for purely structural reasons, that is, for reasons that follow from the general relationship between the structure of sentences and the structure of their logical forms and independent of the meanings of the particular sentences.",
        "For instance, we are not concerned with logical redundancies, such as those due to the commutativity of successive universal quantifiers.",
        "When we move beyond the two first-order logical quantifiers to deal with the so-called generalized quantifiers such as most, these logical redundancies become quite rare.",
        "Similarly, we are not concerned with the infelicity of certain readings due to lexical semantic or world knowledge, such as the fact that a child cannot outscope every man in the sentence I've met a child of every man in this room.",
        "Computational research on quantifier scoping has emphasized generating a single scoping, which can be thought of as heuristically primary, as discussed by, for example, Woods (1977), Pereira (1983), and Grosz et al.",
        "(1985).",
        "We are concerned not with generating the best reading but with generating all readings.",
        "The reader may object that it is inappropriate in a practical natural language system to generate scopings one by one for testing against semantic and pragmatic criteria.",
        "Instead, one should appeal to various heuristics to generate only the most likely reading, or at least to generate readings in order of their plausibility.",
        "These include the following:",
        "• lexical heuristics, e.g., each usually outscopes some; • syntactic heuristics, e.g., a noun phrase in a relative clause is usually outscoped by the head noun, and a noun phrase in a prepositional phrase complement of a",
        "relational head noun usually outscopes the head noun; and • ordering heuristics, such as the principle that left-to-right order at the same syntactic level is generally preserved in the quantifier order.2 We are sympathetic with this view.",
        "Nevertheless, there are several reasons that codifying a complete algorithm remains useful.",
        "First, a complete and sound algorithm provides a benchmark against which other approaches can be tested.",
        "Second, one may actually wish to use a generate-and-test mechanism in simpler implementations, and it should be correct and as efficient as possible.",
        "It should not generate scopings that can be ruled out on purely structural grounds.",
        "Finally, the algorithm we present might be modified to incorporate heuristics to generate scopings in a certain order or only certain of the scopings.",
        "The soundness and correctness of the underlying algorithm.",
        "provide a guarantee of soundness for a heuristically guided version.",
        "We include a few comments below about incorporating ordering heuristics into our scoping generation algorithm, although we should point out that the possibilities are somewhat limited due to the local nature of where the heuristics can be applied.",
        "A full discussion of heuristically-guided scoping generation is, of course, beyond the scope of this paper."

        "An argument can be a constant or variable, another wff, or what we will call a complex term.",
        "A complex term is an ordered triple consisting of a quantifier, a variable, and a wff (called the restriction), which represents the predication that is grammatically subordinated to the variable.",
        "The input representation for sentence (2) is, then, the following (ignoring tense):",
        "A complex term can be read \"quantifier variable such that restriction\", e.g., \"most c such that c is a company\".",
        "The output language is identical to the input language, except that it does not contain complex terms.",
        "Quantifiers are expressed in the output language as operators that take three arguments: the variable bound by the quantifier, a wff restricting the range of the quantified variable, and the body scoped by the quantification, schematically quantifier(variable, restriction, body) This encoding of quantification is the same as that found in Woods (1977) and Moore (1981).",

        "We present both nondeterministic and deterministic versions of the algorithm3 in an ALGOL-like language.",
        "Both algorithms, however, have the same underlying structure, based on the primitive operation of \"applying\" a complex term to a wff in which it occurs: a complex term in a wff is replaced by the variable it restricts, and that variable is then bound by wrapping the entire form in the appropriate quantifier.",
        "Thus, applying the term < q x r(x) > to a wff containing that complex term, say, p( < q x r(x) > ), yields the quantified wff q(x, r(x), p(x)).",
        "This is the primitive operation by which complex terms are removed from a wff and quantified wffs are introduced.",
        "It is implemented by the function apply.",
        "The generation of a scoping from a wff proceeds in two stages.",
        "First, the opaque argument positions within the wff are scoped.",
        "The function pull-opaque-args performs this task by replacing wffs in opaque argument positions by a (full or partial) scoping of the original wff.",
        "For instance, if p were a predicate opaque in its only argument, then, for the wff p(s( < q x r(x) > )), pull-opaque-args would generate the wff p(q(x, r(x), s(x))) or the unchanged wff p(s( < q x r(x) > )).",
        "In the former, the opaque predicate p outscopes the quantifier q.",
        "In the latter, the quantifier q has not been applied yet and the wff will subsequently yield readings in which q has wider scope than p. Second, some or all of the remaining terms are applied to the entire wff.",
        "The function apply-terms iteratively (through a tail recursion) chooses a complex term in the wff and applies it.",
        "Thus apply-terms acting upon the wff p( < 91 x ri(x) > < q2 y r2(y) >) will yield one of the five wffs",
        "depending on how many quantifiers are applied and in what order.",
        "The choice of a complex term is restricted to a subset of the terms in the wff, the so-called applicable terms.",
        "The principal restriction on applicable terms is that they not be embedded in any other complex term in the wff.",
        "Section 4.1 discusses a further restriction.",
        "The function applicable-term returns an applicable term in a given wff.",
        "These two stages are manifested in the function pull which generates all partial or full scopings of a wff by invoking pull-opaque-args and apply-terms.",
        "Since ultimately only full scopings are desired, an additional argument to pull and apply-terms controls whether partial scopings are to be returned.",
        "When this flag, complete?, is true, apply-terms, and hence pull, will return only expressions in which no more complex terms remain to be applied, for example, only the last two of the five readings above.",
        "Finally, the restrictions of the complex terms may themselves contain complex terms and must be scoped themselves.",
        "The apply function therefore recursively generates the scopings for the restriction by calling pull on that restriction, and a quantified wff is generated for each possible partial or complete scoping of the restriction.",
        "Schematically, in the simplest case, for the",
        "A subsequent application of the remaining complex term will yield the \"wide scope\" reading q2(y, r2(y), qi(x, ri(xty), p(x)) The disallowed readings produced by the \"all per-mutations\" algorithm are never produced by this algorithm, because it is everywhere sensitive to the four-part quantifier structure of the target logical form.",
