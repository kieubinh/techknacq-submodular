        "It has become clear that the construction of computer systems that process natural language requires the creation of large computerized lexicons with extensive and accurate syntactic and semantic information about words (see Byrd(1986a), Ingria(1986)).",
        "It is also clear that it will be impossible to build these lexicons in the number and sizes required with only the manual labor of individual computer scientists, linguists, or lexicographers.",
        "There are too many systems requiring too much information about too many words for the manual approach to succeed.",
        "Fortunately, researchers are beginning to realize that the wealth of information in published dictionaries can be tapped by semi-automatic and fully-automatic meth",
        "The present paper is intended to contribute to that literature by describing the tools and methods used by the Lexical Systems project at IBM Research.",
        "Individual tools and their use in that project have been described elsewhere (Chodorow, et al.",
        "(1985), Byrd and Chodorow(1985), Byrd, et al.",
        "(1986b), Chodorow and Ravin(1987), Neff and Byrd(1987)).",
        "This paper differs from previous descriptions of our own and others' work, however, by presenting a framework and a set of general tools and methods that can be reapplied for a variety of lexicological and lexicographical applications.",
        "Furthermore, it addresses problems involved in coherently combining information from different MRDs.",
        "In particular, we show how we can transfer information from one dictionary to another – even",
        "across languages – and correctly associate that information with the word senses to which it applies.",
        "The plan of this paper roughly parallels the logical sequence of problems that face any project in computational lexicology.",
        "Section 2 on acquisition and storage describes the initial stages of capturing and organizing dictionary data.",
        "Section 3 outlines the tools and methods we use to exploit the contents of machine readable dictionaries.",

        "Once machine readable dictionary tapes are acquired from the publishers, they usually have to be cleaned up and/or normalized.",
        "We have encountered three basic types of publisher tapes: one type, represented by Longman and Webster's Seventh, has some information segmented into separate records labelled with an identifying code and other information implicit in font change codes.",
        "A second type, represented by Collins, consists of unsegmented text interspersed with font-change codes.",
        "A third type will be the new computerized OED (Tompa (1985)), where each type of information is specifically delimited at the beginning and end, and where there are any number of nesting levels.",
        "Much of the work described here was done with data of the second type; however, it is applicable also to the first type, and of course to the third.",
        "In the simplest sense, cleaning up usually means the removal of typesetting codes and other formatting information, or possibly removal of errors (usually done by hand).",
        "However, since the typesetting codes (e.g. begin-italic, begin-roman) are clues to the kind of information that follows the codes (for example, part-of-speech information appears in italics in the Collins dictionaries), they cannot simply be washed out.",
        "Instead, the raw data undergoes a process of normalization, the goal of which is to identify and label all of the information in the dictionary tapes in such a way that it can be easily accessed without detailed knowledge of the formatting conventions.",
        "This is our rationale for the creation of lexical data bases.",
        "We have carried out this normalization process in two stages.",
        "The goal of the first stage is to segment the information on the tapes into separate entries, storing the results in a direct access file, where the key is the dictionary headword and the data is simply the body of the entry.",
        "Dictionary data is stored in a Dictionary Access Method (DAM) file, from which it can be conveniently retrieved, by headword, for subsequent processing.",
        "DAM is completely described in Byrd, et al.(1986b).",
        "For this discussion, we note that DAM allows the efficient storage and retrieval of entries for words in alphabetical order and in random order by headword.",
        "Having the dictionary in a DAM file allows its entries to be accessed through the WordSmith on-line dictionary system, to be described later.",
        "The goal of the second stage of the normalization process is to segment and identify the data in the entry, creating a second DAM file in lexical data base format.",
        "Both stages involve some rather idiosyncratic procedures that are tied to the various ways different publishers code the information on the tapes, particularly since the tapes were not prepared with any consideration of later computational use.",
        "However, as will be apparent later, our second-stage normalization is a more general approach that we envision using with a variety of machine-readable dictionary resources.",
        "In what follows, we discuss the normalization of the Collins bilingual dictionaries.",
        "The first stage of normalization, picking out the headwords and the associated information, was mostly straightforward: the headwords are preceded by a unique font code.",
        "Exceptions to this straightforward process were driven by the principle that the end result of the process should be a direct access dictionary usable by both people and other systems.",
        "This involves definition of a file keyword which differs from that of the dictionary headword in two important ways: (1) each keyword must be unique, and (2) there should be a keyword for each spelling of a word, with the important exception of inflected forms predictable by morphological rules, as explained below.",
        "The first constraint assures that dictionary lookup for a word will get all of the information associated with that word.",
        "The second assures that a lookup operation will find a word where it first expects to find it, and not inside of some other entry.",
        "Three examples will suffice.",
        "In adherence to the first constraint, we combined the entries for the noun quack' and the verb quack2 in the English-Italian Collins dictionary.",
        "In adherence to the second constraint, we created new entries for alternate spellings of words: the German-English headord Abtak(e)lung was made into two entries, Abtaklung and Abtakelung, the associated information was stored with just one of them, and cross-references to the other spelling were stored with both.",
        "Since the notation used for alternate spellings of this sort does not indicate which one is the more common usage, we stored the entry arbitrarily with the shorter form.",
        "A third example: where the German-English dictionary stores a number of compound words with the first element of the compound (e.g. Abend-: has -essen, -friede(n) -gesellschaft, etc.",
        "), we created full entries for all of them (e.g. Abendessen, Abendfriede, Abendgesellschaft, etc).",
        "In the process of reconstituting the compounds, however, we retained information on the location of the break to support possible later work on German noun compounds and to conform to another principle: \"do not throw away anything.\" An exception to the constraint that there should be separate entries for each spelling of a word, noted",
        "before, is that we do not require creation of separate entries for those words which can be derived by morphological rules.",
        "For example, from German Lehrer(inf), which is shorthand for Lehrer and Lehrerin ffernalej, we created only an entry for Lehrer, leaving the (in f) part for later segmentation.",
        "Identification of these exceptions is possible using heuristics and does not depend on having a system of morphological rules for the language of the dictionary.",
        "These heuristics are different for each dictionary.",
        "The program which accomplished stage one segmentation was written in a variant of PL/I using recursion to handle the interaction of morphological variants, alternate spellings, and reconstruction of compounds.",
        "The results have been used directly for several WordSmith applications.",
        "Once we had the dictionary entries segmented into DAM files, they were ready for the second stage of normalization: identifying and labelling the different types of data in the entries in a standard and consistent way.",
        "As we set out to create data bases from the first set of DAM files, it quickly became apparent that the usual data base architecture, characterized by a fixed number of fields for each entry and a fixed amount of space for each, would never work for dictionary entries, because there might be one value for some fields (like spelling), but multiple values for others (like part-of-speech, translation, etc.",
        "), or no value at all for still others (e.g. alternate spelling).",
        "Moreover, some information, like translation, is associated with values for other information, like part-of-speech.",
        "These facts lead to the observation that dictionary entries are best represented as shallow hierarchies of attribute-value pairs.",
        "We will return to this observation in the section on \"lexical data bases\".",
        "We have developed a parser, the goal of which is to convert each dictionary entry into a tree structure where at each node there is an attribute name and a value, which can be a simple value, a list of attribute-value pairs, or an entire subtree.",
        "Figure 1 contains the result of applying the parser to the entry for alert in the Collins English-Italian dictionary.",
        "The attributes in the figure should be familiar to users of bilingual dictionaries; they include hyphenation code (\"hyph\"), undecoded pronunciations (\"pron\"), homograph numbers (\"hnum\"), part-of-speech (\"pos\"), translations (\"spel\" under \"xlat\"), collocations and examples in the source language (\"gloss\" under \"xmp\"), and translations of collocations and examples (\"tran\" under \"xmp\").",
        "Figure 2 shows how the above-mentioned combination of the multiple entries for quack and other words brings about the creation of a \"superhom\" node.",
        "The superhom (\"superscript homograph\") node serves to separate the multiple entries and preserve the original sense numbers.",
        "This is important because cross references in other entries may contain superhomograph numbers as well as sense numbers.",
        "Even in entries where there is only one sense, homograph, or superho",
        "mograph, these attributes are retained to make access logic consistent with other entries.",
        "The design of the dictionary entry parser began with a familiar model for parsers of English sentences: a set of rules supported by a parsing engine.",
        "Two such models were available to us: a bottom-up, all-paths strategy offered by PLNLP (Langendoen and Barnett(to appear)), and a top-down depth-first approach offered by logic grammars written in Prolog (McCord(1987)).",
        "We have versions in PLNLP and VM/Prolog, both of which are basically adequate.",
        "The version which supported the work reported here is the Prolog version; however, we are concerned about future problems with the top-down approach when we have to process input that is corrupt.",
        "Usually for lexicographical processing, one should not have to worry about large amounts of ill-formed input, but the complex history of some of our tapes forces us to consider possible recovery strategies for text with missing or corrupt font-codes.",
        "At that point, it may be necessary to use the bottom-up approach and some recovery strategy analogous to parse-fitting (cf. Jensen, et al.(1983)).",
        "Computational Linguistics, Volume 13, Numbers 3-4, July-December 1987 221",
        "Grammars for dictionary entries and grammars for natural language sentences differ in three important ways: (1) entries can be huge: some are longer than 5000 bytes; (2) there is a different definition of a token, and (3) a dictionary grammar can be to a large extent deterministic.",
        "A consequence of (1) is that it takes a large amount of storage to parse an entry.",
        "The Prolog version now runs on a 4-megabyte virtual machine under VM/CMS.",
        "The motivation for (2) comes from the fact that the entries consist of text interspersed with font-change codes, which are not required to be delimited with blanks.",
        "Whereas for ordinary language, the tokens are strings between blanks, for dictionary entries they are the strings of characters between a defined set of delimiters, usually font-change codes, but occasionally also semicolons, periods, and complex character strings.",
        "The delimiters are tokens as well.",
        "In view of (3), one might well ask why anyone would use a powerful tool like PLNLP or a logic grammar to accomplish something that does not need such powerful support.",
        "The answer is that we now have a dictionary parsing engine, a formalism for rules, and an easily modifiable set of rules, all achieved in a shorter development time than would have been accomplished with a conventional programming language.",
        "Furthermore, stage two of the acquisition of new dictionaries now requires only writing, testing, and running a new set of grammar rules.",
        "The parsing engine and support code are written in VM/Prolog.",
        "The rules, which may be different for each dictionary, are written using a formalism in the spirit of the \"definite clause grammars\" (DCG's) of Pereira and Warren (1980) and \"modular logic grammars\" (MLG's) of McCord (1986).",
        "A rule compiler translates the rules into Prolog code; this compiler owes much to the groundwork laid by McCord.",
        "Significant to McCord's work and necessary for ours here is the distinction between two different kinds of rules, one which produces a structural node (strong non-terminal), and one which produces an intermediate list of nodes (weak non-terminal).",
        "The dictionary entry rule compiler sports several new features required by dictionary entry parsing.",
        "These include an 'ignore' operator, which causes tokens in the input to be ignored by the automatic structure builder, an 'insert' operator which causes new elements to be inserted, and the efficient implementation of rules consisting entirely of optional elements.",
        "This generalized rule-driven parsing engine will be used to help develop entry grammars for all our dictionary resources; a small tool kit for this is already available, and other tools will be added as development progresses.",
        "We illustrate the rule formalism with the following two rules from the grammar for the Collins Italian-English dictionary:",
        "The first rule says that an unnumbered homograph consists of a number of optional elements, of which at least one must be present: pronunciation; choice of part-of-speech or verb-reflexive or none; morphological information; selection of perfect tense auxiliary; a certain kind of cross reference (marked with `v'); a gloss; or a list of senses.",
        "The horn constituent is declared elsewhere as a strong nonterminal; a node is created for it, with daughter nodes as defined to the right of the arrow.",
        "Prolog backtracking conventions apply; the first successful parse of an entry is used, even if there might be more than one possibility.",
        "In the case of most optional constituents, the existence of the constituent is tried before its absence.",
        "In the case of the gloss in the first rule, however, the correct result is obtained if the absence of the gloss is tried first.",
        "The second rule says that a list of numbered senses consists of a numbered sense and a numbered sense list (or nothing).",
        "The recursive property of this rule allows the assembling of any number of numbered senses.",
        "The senslist constituent is declared as a weak non-terminal, so that all the sub-constituents defined by the rule will appear as sister nodes at the same level, immediately dominated not by senslist, but by its parent, horn.",
        "The present version of the grammar has been run on parts of the Collins Italian-English and English-Italian dictionaries with a success rate of about 95%.",
        "Some of the entries were quite large.",
        "The high success rate is partly due to the consistency and discipline in the formatting of the Collins Italian dictionaries.",
        "The rules are still being improved.",
        "There are several reasons for the remaining 5% – and, indeed, also for some of the ad hoc devices we have used to successfully parse some entries.",
        "Sometimes the primary clues to parsing, the font change codes, can be missing because two discrete data segments are contiguous and appear in the same font.",
        "Alternatively, the font changes can actually occur in the middle of a coherent data segment.",
        "For example, the translation for English queen bee is given as \"ape f regina inv\".",
        "Here, \"f\" is the feminine gender marking for ape, and \"inv\" (i.e., \"invariable\") indicates that the word regina remains invariable in the plural form.",
        "In this case, there is grammatical information about each of the pieces of the collocation.",
        "In other cases, the first piece of grammatical information attaches to the first word, and the second to the entire collocation.",
        "To take a second example, the locution \"x or y\" is often used for phrases in all languages.",
        "The problem is that both \"x\" and \"y\" can be gapped, or otherwise abbreviated, by deletion of words identical to those found on the other side of the \"or\".",
        "An example is in the translation given for Italian si sta facendo buio: \"it is growing o getting dark\" (shorthand for \"it is growing dark o it is getting dark\").",
        "For cases like these, we would ideally like to identify and extract all the information immediately.",
        "It would be nice to separate the grammatical information from ape regina, in the first case, and to reconstitute the translations it is growing dark and it is getting dark, in the second.",
        "However, we recognize that solving all such problems is a never-ending process and would indefinitely delay the time that any information is available for lexicological analysis.",
        "Consequently, we make a practical distinction between the acquisition and analysis phases of our work: information that is not easily decipherable using our entry parsing tools is left in its undeciphered form in the initial lexical data base that we create.",
        "Thus, for our examples, we should have the following attributes.",
        "[xmp= [gloss= queen bee] [tran= ape .f.",
        "regina .inv .]]",
        "[xlat= [spel= it is growing .o.",
        "getting dark] .. . ]",
        "Later work can be devoted to the detailed analysis of such complex attributes.",
        "The results of such analysis will be used to create more refined versions of the initial lexical data bases."

        "This reduces the task to that of finding the heads of verb phrases and noun phrases.",
        "The syntax of the verb phrase used in verb definitions makes it possible to always locate its head with a simple heuristic: the head is the single verb following the word to, or if there is a conjunction of verbs following to, then they are all heads.",
        "Head finding is much more complex for noun definitions because of their greater variety, but we have taken advantage of the fact that dictionary definitions are written in a special and predictable style to develop a heuristic procedure for finding the head.",

        "The accuracy of head-finding for nouns was approximately 98 percent, based on a random sample of the output.",
        "The word defined and the head of its definition are the raw materials for two semi-automatic processes which make explicit an important part of the lexical organization and featural information that are held implicit in dictionaries.",
        "The first of these is sprouting.",
        "Sprouting, which derives its name from the action of growing a semantic tree from a specified root, uses the results of head-finding organized into a \"hyponym index\", in which each word that was used as a genus term is associated with all of its hyponyms.",

        "The issue of sense discrimination plays a important role in marking words in the lexicon.",

        "As described above, sense mapping between dictionaries is one of the most important and challenging problems facing computational lexicography.",
        "A related problem is sense disambiguation within a single dictionary.",
        "Webster's Seventh Collegiate Dictionary (W7) defines car as a kind of 'vehicle' but does not indicate that it is sense 4 of vehicle which is intended and not senses 1, 2, or 3.",
        "This lack of an explicit indication of the hypernym's intended sense limits the usefulness of the hypernym relation as we have currently extracted it because hypernymy is actually a relation between word senses, not a relation between words.",
        "As a consequence, our sprouts from hypernyms require human intervention to insure that the proper sense of each node is followed.",
        "Without automatic sense disambiguation, taxonomic sprouting is thus relegated to the status of a semi-automatic (rather than a fully automatic) processing tool.",
        "It has been suggested (Lesk(1986)) that sense disambiguation of hypernyms might be achieved by comparing the differentia (the words which appear with the hypernym, e.g., \"moving on wheels\" in the definition of car as a \"vehicle moving on wheels\") to the words that appear in the definitions of the hypernym's senses.",
        "The sense definition which most closely matches the differentia would then be selected as the intended sense of the hypernym.",

        "This omission is more serious than simply omitting a word, for here an entire sense seems to have been left out.",

        "For example, book lists manual as a synonym, but manual does not list book; instead special types of books such as handbook are given.",

        "The clearest and most successful attempt at this is reported in the first section below on the semantic feature [+ human].",
        "Other more speculative attempts with synonyms and with the syntactic feature thatcomp] resulted in partial successes and are reported in later sections.",
        "Using sprouting and filtering, we extracted a set of English nouns with the feature [+Human] in all senses.",
        "Next, we obtained the set of Italian translations for those nouns from the Collins English-Italian dictionary.",
        "Finally, we re-translated the Italian nouns back into English, using the Collins Italian-English dictionary.",
        "Our results were very positive.",
        "Of the 321 original English words, 296 Italian words were obtained in the forward (E-I) direction; 63 multi-word translations were also found.",
        "Re-translating these 296 Italian words in the backward (I-E) direction yielded 373 English words plus 45 English multi-word translations.",
        "Examining the two lists of English words showed that out of the 321 original, 157 were not among the final re-translations.",
        "Furthermore, out of the 373 re-translations, 167 were new words not in the original.",
        "An analysis of the words obtained gave two clear results.",
        "First, only six out of the 296 Italian words obtained in the forward (E-I) direction did not have the feature [+Human] in all of their senses.",
        "This feature can therefore be very well transferred (given our constraint on the polysemy of the source data) to the other monolingual dictionary.",
        "Second, well over 90% of the 167 new English re-translations were also [+ Human].",
        "This demonstrates the effectiveness of this procedure in the task of enlarging the set of words having a given feature.",
        "The procedures used for transferring the [+ human] feature from English to Italian can be viewed as instances of a special kind of sprouting called \"bilingual sprouting\".",
        "In this case, the binary relation through which we propagate features is the translation relation, rather than synonymy, hypernymy, or hyponymy.",
        "As with other forms of sprouting, we can view the translation relation as transitive, and therefore we are able to propagate lexical information not only from one language to another, but also back to the original language.",
        "Of course, again as with normal sprouting, we must take care to control for the effects of polysemy.",
        "These considerations lead to the definition of two types of bilingual sprouting: unconstrained and constrained.",
        "Unconstrained bilingual sprouting.",
        "This form of bilingual sprouting assumes that if a word has a particular feature in all of its senses, then any translations of that word that are monosemous will also bear that feature.",
        "This, of course, excepts grammatical features which only apply in one of the two languages involved.",
        "So, for example, we could not propagate grammatical gender from Italian to English.",
        "A reasonable procedure that implements this kind of sprouting would begin with a list of words in the first language (L1) bearing the feature to be propagated.",
        "For each word, assign the feature to any of its monosemous translations, given by the bilingual dictionary.",
        "This accomplishes the transfer of the feature to the second language (L2).",
        "We can continue by inspecting the bilingual dictionary for the other direction (from L2 to L1).",
        "Since the words in L2 are all monosemous, any translations from them back into L1 are also likely candidates for the feature.",
        "Despite the care taken by this procedure to deal only with monosemous words in L2, polysemy in LI and in the bilingual dictionary causes the procedure to yield lists which must be manually checked.",
        "However, the labor involved is much less than would be required to do the work entirely by hand.",
        "As reported above, when the procedure was used to propagate the [+ Human] feature from English to Italian, we obtained a list of Italian words which were correctly marked in much more than 95 percent of the cases.",
        "Furthermore, when we reflected the feature back onto English (with the Italian-English dictionary) we obtained a new set of English words not on our original list.",
        "More than 90 percent of those were indeed [+ Human] words.",
        "Constrained bilingual sprouting.",
        "This type of sprouting allows the assignment of features to word senses in L1, rather than to an entire word.",
        "It is based on the observation that if a single sense of a word in Ll has a monosemous translation in L2, then both words can be assigned any transferable features that either of them bears.",
        "This assumes that the lexicographers who created the dictionaries being used had comparable ideas about what constitutes a word sense.",
        "If we can maintain this assumption, then a sprouting procedure based on our observation should run automatically and yield quite reliable results.",
        "However, we still imagine that a manual check of the results for validity would be in order.",
        "A further observation is that if the word sense has multiple monosemous translations into L2, then each of the L2 words can receive the union of their transferable features.",
        "A possible algorithm based on this observation would use three dictionaries.",
        "First, a monolingual dictionary for Ll would contain features to be transferred.",
        "Second, a bilingual dictionary from LI to L2 would serve as the conduit for the lexical information and the pointer to words in L2.",
        "Third, a monolingual dictionary for L2 would be the target for the information to be propagated.",
        "The algorithm would scan the words on the L1 side of the bilingual dictionary.",
        "For any word sense (in the monolingual dictionary for L1) with multiple monosemous translations into L2, we can assign the union of the transferable features (from the LI word sense and all L2 translations) to to all of the words in the L2 monolingual dictionary.",
        "The two flavors of constrained bilingual sprouting (one for transferring information from Ll to L2, and the other for reflecting it back to L2) would both be strengthened if we could drop the requirement that the words in L2 be monosemous, and map to word senses instead.",
        "In the section 5.2.1, we discuss an enhancement to bilingual dictionaries which will have precisely this effect.",
        "Two important points must be made about bilingual sprouting.",
        "First, it is only feasible and useful when the lexical information available and desired in the two languages' monolingual dictionaries are the same.",
        "As reported above, for Italian and English we have established lists of features and attributes of interest for both languages, and we are confident that these lists match the requirements of prospective users of the monolingual dictionaries.",
        "Second, constrained bilingual sprouting obviously requires the prior establishment of the binary mapping relationships between both monolingual dictionaries and the respective sides of the bilingual dictionary."
