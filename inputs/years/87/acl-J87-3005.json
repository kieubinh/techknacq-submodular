        "Problems should be expected, of course: reference works are arbitrary and inconsistent; just having the information does not guarantee being able to use it.",
        "It is nevertheless possible to think of on-line reference books as knowledge bases.",
        "In this paper we propose techniques for processing the definitions of an on-line standard dictionary, and for extracting from them the semantic information necessary to resolve the ambiguities inherent in the attachment of English prepositional phrases.",
        "We consult the on-line dictionary as if it were a semantic expert, and we find in it the kind of information that has previously been supplied by means of scripts, frames, templates, and similar hand-crafted devices.",

        "But there are also independent reasons for postponing the use of semantics as long as possible.",
        "And the development of PEG has shown that a syntax-only stage of parsing is not computationally expensive, and is both efficient and useful (Jensen 1986).",
        "There is an enduring notion that allowing ambiguities to persist in a syntactic parser must cause a disastrous combinatorial explosion in the number of parses produced.",

        "One of the key factors for achieving robustness is the recognition that every single rule that we might want to write for processing dictionary entries is bound to fail at least once in a while.",

        "The cumulative effect of many heuristics, and not the perfection of each one taken separately, has to do the job.",
        "As in a typical \"approximate reasoning\" paradigm, all heuristics should only yield weighted preferences, or certainty factors, and no categorical acceptance or rejection of an interpretation.",
        "Thus different heuristics can interact in an additive way, and unforeseen examples will be more easily processed.",
        "In that way also, the whole system will be incremental: we can start modestly and progressively augment its capabilities.",
        "The process should be fail-proof in the sense that it should always give an answer: at one extreme, this answer should be to state that no better ordering can be made, and that things should be left as they are.",
        "As a first step, we have started to study the heuristics that will be necessary to disambiguate the attachments in sentences using the preposition with, and the relationships signaled by this preposition.",
        "According to a standard handbook on prepositions, with can signal: place, time, agency or instrument, cooperation, opposition, possession or characteristic, separation or alienation, association, and more (Funk and Wagnalls 1953, pp.",
        "34-35).",
        "Heuristics will eventually be necessary for all of these relationships.",
        "For present purposes however, we are particularly interested in the relationships of INSTRUMENT and PARTOF.",
        "PARTOF involves what has been called \"inalienable possession\" – possession by nature, not by accident.",
        "In these terms, a hand would be PARTOF a body, but a label would not be PARTOF a dress.",
        "(Other heuristics will be developed to handle other types of possession.)",
        "The relationships in which we are interested can be illustrated by the following sentences (Binot 1985):",
        "(1) I ate a fish with a fork.",
        "(2) I ate a fish with bones.",
        "(3) I ate a fish with my fingers.",
        "In all cases, the ambiguity resides in the placement of the with prepositional phrase, which can modify fish or ate.",
        "And in all cases, PEG has the PP attached to the closest possible head, fish, with a question mark showing where the PP would be placed if it modified the main verb ate (see Figure 1).",
        "The rest of this section presents, in an informal way, our strategy for solving such ambiguities, and the motivations behind some particular heuristics that we are using.",
        "The remaining sections provide more details about the implementation of the system, and about difficulties that still have to be resolved.",
        "Focussing on (1) and following the \"approximate\" approach stated above, another way to phrase the key question is \"Is it more likely that a fork is associated with a fish or with an act of eating?\" To answer that question, the system evaluates separately the plausibility of the two proposed constructs: (4a) eat with fork (4b) fish with fork then orders the solutions, and picks the one with the highest rating.",
        "In the heuristics we are currently using, one construct is rated higher than another if the words that it contains, and their relationship to each other, can be more easily validated in dictionary definitions.",
        "For example, we look up the noun fork in W7.",
        "If, by chance, its definition were to include the phrase eat with a fork, then (4a) would be immediately validated.",
        "Most likely, however, these exact same words will not occur.",
        "But, as we will see, the definition of fork contains the phrase used for taking up, and eating is defined as a kind of taking in the dictionary.",
        "If we can provide a way to establish these relationships, then (4a) is validated, although somewhat less easily.",
        "Ease (or certainty) of validation becomes progressively less, the harder it is to establish these inter-word relationships.",
        "And the relationships are established: (a) by identifying equivalent function-word patterns in the definitions, such as the equivalence of used for and the instrumental with; (b) by linking important definition words (i.e., central terms in definitional phrases, such as heads of phrases, or else synonyms).",
        "This can be done by parsing the definitions, identifying the central word(s), and then following hierarchical chains of definitions through the dictionary.",
        "The two main heuristics that will be used to evaluate the plausability of (4a) against (4b) can be described in natural language as follows (for more details on the formalization and implementation of the heuristics, see section 6): HI for checking for an INSTRUMENT relation between a head and a with complement:",
        "1. if the head is not a verb, the relation doesn't hold (certainty factor = -1); 2. if some \"instrument pattern\" (see below) exists in the dictionary definition of the complement, and if this pattern points to a defining term that can be linked with the head, then the relation probably holds (certainty factor 0.7); 3. else assume that there is more chance that the relation doesn't hold (certainty factor = -0.3).",
        "H2- for checking for a PARTOF relation between a head and a with complement: 1. if the head is not a noun, the relation doesn't hold (certainty factor = -1); 2. if some \"part-of pattern\" (see below) exists in the",
        "dictionary definition of the complement, and if this pattern points to a defining term that can be linked with the head, then the PARTOF relation probably holds (certainty factor = 0.7); 3. else assume that there is more chance that the relation doesn't hold (certainty factor = -0.3).",
        "Heuristic answers are expressed in terms of certainty factors which, as in the MYCIN system (Shortliffe 1976), take their values in the range (-1, + 1): 1 expresses absolute disbelief; 0 expresses complete uncertainty; 1 expresses absolute belief.",
        "Intermediate values express varying degrees of belief or disbelief.",
        "It must be understood that each certainty factor refers to the specific proposition (or goal) to which the heuristic is applied.",
        "Thus, if clause 3 of heuristic H2 is used when applied to the proposition (4b), the resulting certainty factor -0.3 will indicate a relatively moderate disbelief in this proposition, stemming from the fact that the system has not been able to find any positive evidence in the dictionary to sustain it.",
        "The above heuristics are possible because there are specific words and/or phrases in dictionary definitions, forming what we shall call here patterns, which are almost systematically used to express specific semantic relations (Markowitz et al.",
        "1986).",
        "For the two relations considered here, some of these patterns are: INSTRUMENT: for, used for, used to, a means for, etc.",
        "PARTOF: part of, arises from, end of, member of, etc.",
        "These prepositional patterns generally take, as their objects, some central term (or terms) in the definition of the complement word.",
        "An attempt can then be made to link that term with the head of the construct that is being studied.",
        "Focussing again on example sentence (1), the system starts by examining the first construct, (4a).",
        "It parses the definition of the complement fork, and discovers at least one INSTRUMENT pattern, used for: fork: 1.",
        "An implement with two or more prongs used esp for taking up (as in eating), pitching or digging.",
        "Taking the conjunction into account, the system finds three possible terms: taking up, pitching, and digging, which it tries to link with eat.",
        "(For the present, we deliberately avoid the phrase as in eating which offers a direct match – in order to show that our approach does not rely on such lucky coincidences.)",
        "Following hierarchical chains of definitions by parsing one definition and then extracting, for example, its head word, the system is able to establish that eat is a direct hyponym of take according to W7; the link is thus probably established.",
        "The system then moves on to consider (4b).",
        "Since no PARTOF pattern can be found in the definitions of fork, this second possible construct will be ranked as much less likely – (4a) receives a certainty factor of +0.7, but (4b) gets a certainty factor of only -0.3.",
        "Therefore the system recommends attaching the prepositional phrase to the main verb in sentence (1).",
        "For sentence (2), the constructs to be compared are eat with bones and fish with bones.",
        "In the definition of bone, no useful INSTRUMENT pattern is found; so eat with bones cannot be easily validated.",
        "On the other hand, the first definition of bone gives the following PARTOF pattern: bone: 1.",
        "One of the hard parts of the skeleton of a vertebrate.",
        "This yields two possible links for fish: skeleton and vertebrate.",
        "Fish can be identified as a direct hyponym of vertebrate according to W7.",
        "Therefore, fish with bones receives a higher certainty factor than eat with bones, and the system recommends attaching the prepositional phrase to the direct object NP in sentence (2).",
        "The word-linking operation, which is used in heuristics H1 and H2, will presumably be used in many more heuristics as we extend the system.",
        "Such often-used operations can be made into subgoals, for which we can design specific heuristics.",
        "The heuristic currently used for establishing links between words is:",
        "H3- for checking if one word (typically the head of a construct to be tested) is linked to some other word (typically a term pointed to by a pattern in a dictionary definition): 1. if head and term have the same base, the link is certainly established (certainty factor = 1); 2. if the term appears as an hyponym or hypernym of the head by following hierarchical patterns in the dictionary, the link is probably established (certainty factor = 0.7); 3. if term and head appear as common hyponyms of the same genus word by following hierarchical patterns in the dictionary, the link is (less) probably established (certainty factor = 0.5); 4. else, the link is probably not established (certainty factor = -0.7).",
        "The link-checking operation embodied in H3 can be likened to the preference-checking operation proposed by Wilks (1975).",
        "An established link will validate a kind of semantic restriction which can fail, but which, if satisfied, will increase our confidence in the likelihood of the proposed relation.",
        "However, in our case, the information used to check the satisfaction of the preference is not obtained from any handmade semantic classification, frame, script, or other such structure, but from the W7 dictionary itself.",
        "Moreover, it should be pointed out here that we want to take the notion of \"preference satisfaction\" in a very loose sense.",
        "Although the sentences discussed above exemplified only cases of simple inclusion, what we propose to do in the long term is to check if some connection can be established between the two terms – the word being defined and the preference indication – by using hyponym, hypernym and synonym information extracted from the dictionary.",
        "Many useful disambiguations can be performed by",
        "using the kind of link checking outlined above.",
        "The heuristic approach, however, does not limit us to this mechanism; and it would indeed be a mistake to accept such a limit.",
        "Sentence (3) is a case in point.",
        "Here, no useful INSTRUMENT or PARTOF pattern can be found in the definitions of finger.",
        "However our strong intuition is that the presence of a possessive my, which disagrees in person with the possible head fish, precludes any PARTOF relation.",
        "This intuition can be formulated in the following heuristic: H4- for checking for a PARTOF relationship between a head and a with complement:",
        "1. if a. the head is a noun, and b. the complement is qualified by a possessive, and c. this possessive doesn't agree in person with the head, then the PARTOF relation certainly doesn't hold (certainty factor = -1), 2. else this heuristic doesn't give any indication (certainty factor = 0).",
        "The effect of H4 on sentence (3) will be to give to PARTOF such a bad score that the interpretation eat with my fingers will be preferred despite the absence of any positive evidence in its favor.",
        "When a possessive does not appear, H4 does not alter, in any way, the results provided by previous heuristics.",
        "This is achieved, in the second clause of H4, through the use of the zero certainty factor, which expresses total uncertainty and will not modify any other certainty factor proposed by another heuristic for the same problem.",
        "(See Appendix 2 for details on the combining of certainty factors.)",
        "Another interesting point illustrated by H4 is the ease with which syntactic and semantic clues can be integrated in this kind of approach.",
        "Different heuristics can cover different types of clues, and the resulting certainty factors will be combined to yield a unique, weighted answer to the stated problem."
