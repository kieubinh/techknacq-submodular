        "A natural language lexicon is a necessary part of any natural language processing (NLP) system.",
        "Building such a lexicon is an important knowledge acquisition task.",
        "The format of the lexicon has been the subject of substantial number of research projects, both in linguistics and in artificial intelligence (AI).",
        "In linguistic semantics, the efforts have focused on the formal notation for representing semantic knowledge with a special emphasis on the involved categories and rules.",
        "The projects have ranged from simple feature notations (Katz, Fodor 1963; Bendix 1966) to script-based contextual analysis (Raskin 1986).",
        "In AI, this type of work belongs to the area of knowledge representation.",
        "A number of methods of representing knowledge have been developed, ranging from first-order predicate calculus notation to quite sophisticated frame-based and advanced logical formalisms.",
        "(Brachman and Levesque 1985 summarizes the state of the art in knowledge representation.)",
        "By comparison, the number of projects devoted to the design of procedures for compiling and maintaining",
        "a large lexicon has been relatively small.",
        "The usual practice in AI has been to suggest a relatively well-developed knowledge representation language and then use it to represent a miniature world or a very restricted sublanguage.",
        "It is clear, however, that for an NLP system to be really useful, one needs not only to provide a language in which to record the meanings of linguistic units, but also, in fact, to record those meanings for a non-miniature world (and its corresponding sublanguage).",
        "The crux of this problem is generating linguistic heuristics to support the growth of the representation of the subworld/sublanguage.",
        "Indeed, there can be no deterministic solution to the problem of knowledge acquisition; therefore, weaker, heuristic methods should be applied to (a) discovering the categories in terms of which to account for the morphological, syntactical, and semantical properties of words and phrases of natural language and (b) developing guidelines for compiling the lexicon for a natural language.",
        "It follows from the above that new, sophisticated ways of human-computer interaction must be devised in order to support the tasks of linguistic description in terms of AI-style knowledge representation.",
        "The implication of many workers in knowledge representation that once the notation is developed it will be easy to use it for actually describing the world, is clearly anti-intuitive and anti-experiential, as anybody who has ever developed an NLP system knows only too well.",
        "Quite frequently, the lack of any reference to the procedures of lexical description spells out the difference between a system conceived and a system executed.",
        "Thus, decisions to assign a word to a postulated category, for instance, are far from straightforward many borderline cases have to be routinely considered and resolved.",
        "In any large application, lexicon building is typically done by a large number of relatively untrained people who are certain to make non-uniform decisions in many cases.",
        "The instructions these people obtain at the beginning of their work cannot be very precise, unambiguous, or designed to provide in advance for any contingency.",
        "As a result, even a good knowledge representation language cannot guarantee a quality lexicon.",
        "One can in principle think of avoiding these difficulties through automation.",
        "Fully automated lexicon building procedures would definitely ensure the uniformity of description.",
        "There was a considerable enthusiasm about the possibility of a complete automation of lexicology some 15-20 years ago (see, for instance, Collin 1960; Grimes 1970; Kucera 1969; Venezky 1973).",
        "A more feasible scenario, however, is partial computational assistance for lexicology, probably along the lines suggested in this paper, as well as utilizing such new and promising resources as on-line dictionaries.",
        "Recent work on machine-readable dictionaries offers new and interesting possibilities both for the computer-assisted lexicology (see Walker 1984) and for constructing lexical databases derived from the definitions in machine-readable dictionaries and utilized in NLP along with other fields (see Amsler 1982, 1984a; Walker, Amsler 1986, Calzolari 1984a,b).",
        "The premises and goals of these efforts are fully compatible with our belief, first, that no AI system is ready to make the kind of decisions that lexicon building requires and, second, that 'simply having an online version of an encyclopedia [or a dictionary] would be of little use, as there is practically nothing that current AI could draw from the raw text.",
        "Rather, we must carefully re-represent the encyclopedia's knowledge – by hand – into some more structured form' (Lenat et al.",
        "1986:75).",
        "Such re-representation would be necessary for Amsler's (1984a:458) 'lexical knowledge base [which] is a repository of computational information about concepts' and which contains information derived from machine-readable dictionaries, the full text of reference books, the results of statistical analysis of text usages, and data manually obtained from human world knowledge.'",
        "This paper deals primarily with the last item on Amsler's agenda.",
        "It is based on the following approach to the problem of lexicon building.",
        "The work is done by humans assisted by an interactive aid which enhances productivity and ensures uniformity.",
        "It is important to recognize that lexicon building in NLP involves the acquisition of not one entity but rather of three interrelated but distinct lexicons, namely a) the world concept lexicon which structures our knowledge of the world b) the analysis lexicon which is indexed by natural language words and phrases connected with concepts from the world concept lexicon, and c) the generation lexicon, which is indexed by concepts in the world concept lexicon connected with natural language words and phrases.",
        "In reality, AI systems deal not with the entire world but typically with a well-specified subworld of it.",
        "In other words, in any practical application, the world concept lexicon will, in fact, be a subworld concept lexicon.",
        "In the area of machine translation the analysis and generation lexicons involve two different natural languages, which creates the task of building such resources as, say, an English subworld and subworld – Russian lexicons, as is the case, for example, in TRANSLATOR, the knowledge-based machine translation project for the computer subworld (see Nirenburg et al.",

        "The availability of such a lexicon is a sine qua non for any subsequent lexical work in NLP.",
        "The recognized necessity to describe the concept lexicon prior to dealing with natural languages is a feature which clearly distinguishes our approach from Computational Linguistics, Volume 13, Numbers 3-4, July-December 1987 277 Sergei Nirenburg and Victor Raskin The Subworld Concept Lexicon and the Lexicon Management System other work on lexical aids (e.g., Ahlswede 1985) and brings us closer to some non-NL work on knowledge acquisition (e.g., Lenat et al.",
        "1986).",

        "The subworld is that of stroke medicine.",
        "The interactive aid is designed for the analysis lexicon, in our terminology.",
        "The concept realm is not discussed at all, though the four major semantic features used in this lexicon are obviously underlain by subworld concepts.",
        "As a result, the structure and interrelations of concepts cannot be conveniently reasoned about.",
        "Thus, for instance, the distinction between 'general' and 'specific' features is not supported by the ontology and is not really used, since only one subworld is chosen.",
        "We agree with those who believe that each subworld must be described fully and uniformly prior to the introduction of any semantic feature.",
        "This may not be feasible or practical for some very rich domains – it is definitely beyond reach as far as the whole world served by the whole language is concerned.",
        "However, most NLP systems are designed for constrained domains, and it will probably remain this way for some time.",
        "The description of a subworld is a matter of distinguishing all the relevant concepts in it and arranging them in a logical, consistent, and meaningful way.",
        "We agree entirely with Lenat et al.",
        "(1986:75) that to create a knowledge acquisition system, 'we must encode all the world's knowledge down to some level of detail; there is no way to finesse this.'",
        "We differ from them by our overt, theoretically built-in emphasis on limited subworlds.",
        "More importantly, we want to assist the `knowledge enterers' with an interactive aid it is not at all clear how the CYC system of knowledge acquisition which Lenat et al.",
        "describe can ensure the quality and uniformity of the descriptions without such a device.",
        "Another reason why it is important as well as convenient to precede the lexical work with the description of the subworld is that such a description is natural language-independent.",
        "In other words, the same subworld may correspond to sublanguages of different natural languages.",
        "In MT, the representation of the subworld functions as – and is – the interlingua.",
        "Beginning directly with the lexicon of a natural language would make the implied subworld biased toward this language, and this is known to have an adverse affect on the description of other natural sublanguages corresponding to the same subworld.",
        "The subworld concept lexicon determines the structure of the associated analysis and generation lexicons.",
        "Thus, the constrained nature of the subworld (see Raskin 1985 and references therein as well as Kittredge and Lehrberger 1982 and Grishman and Kittredge 1986) always severely limits polysemy/homonymy so rampant in the language as a whole.",
        "Thus, the concept lexicon for the computer subworld will make it clear that there is a need to accommodate only meanings (5) and (7) in the lexical entry for operator in the corresponding sublanguage of English, even though the English language possesses all of the meanings listed in Figure 1 (cf. SOED 1973:1453).",
        "(1) one who does something, an agent (2) one who is professionally engaged to perform a certain operation (3) a surgeon (4) one who carries on financial operations (5) one who works a machine (6) one who works a business (7) a symbol",
        "In fact, (5) will be narrowed down even further in the sublanguage, to 'one who works a computer' and this is what the English (or any other natural language) lexical entry should be limited to.",
        "The subworld concept lexicon also determines, to a large extent, the inventory of semantic features used in the entries of the analysis and generation lexicons, the values of those features, and their status.",
        "Thus, a binary semantic feature is usually induced by a branching in the `isa' hierarchy underlying the concept lexicon.",
        "Frame slots are suggested by a perceived link between some two hierarchically unrelated concepts in the concept lexicon.",
        "The relative importance and scope of features used in analysis and generation lexicons depends on the status of the corresponding concepts in the concept lexicon.",
        "We now rest our case for the priority of the concept lexicon over the analysis and generation lexicons and proceed to describe a system for facilitating lexicon acquisition and maintenance."

        "Historically, relatively less attention has been devoted to the lexicons in this context than to either the grammars or the actual processing modules – parsers, inference engines, and generators.",
        "The importance of an LMS grows proportionally to the size of the lexicons necessary for an application and also to the depth of coverage.",
        "Thus, for instance, it is extremely important to use a principled LMS in a knowledge-based machine translation system where the lexicons must cover not only the usual morphological and syntactic knowledge but also the semantic and pragmatic knowledge about the translation area and where the typical number of concepts in such an area is large.",
        "An LMS is a collection of programs that help create, augment, modify, and test the various lexicons in an NLP application.",

        "The lexicon component of TRANSLATOR (Figure 2) contains four types of lexicons: 1. the subworld concept lexicons, which contain representations, in the DRL knowledge representation language (Nirenburg, Raskin, Tucker 1986), of concepts that belong to a particular subworld, such as, for instance, the subworld of weather reports or of research papers in computer science;",
        "2. the world concept lexicon, in which the information from all the available subworld concept lexicons is merged; 3. the analysis lexicons, whose entries are indexed by lexical units in a natural language and which contain a) syntactic information about these units; b) a pointer to a corresponding concept in the concept lexicon (this link essentially assigns semantic meaning to the lexical unit; note that some lexical units do not correspond to concepts); and/or c) additional control and constraint information for the use of the analysis module of the underlying NLP system.",

        "LMS maintains all four types of lexicons.",
        "In this paper we will concentrate on describing that part of the LMS which is devoted to the maintenance of one subworld concept lexicon (that of computer science research).",
        "The primary purpose of an LMS at the first stage of the project is to support knowledge acquisition.",
        "At later stages in the life of the LMS, testing and modification will become the primary types of work it supports.",
        "An ordinary LMS user, i.e., an enterer, will obtain at this stage a list of concepts to enter in the concept lexicon and will code the information about them in DRL.",

        "The task of the enterer essentially involves the following operations: Insert: finding the appropriate slot in the isa hierarchy to which the new concept will be attached as a leaf child Fill: describing all the properties of this concept by modifying, wherever necessary, the slot fillers of the inherited frame Check: checking whether the property values chosen distinguish it from its parent and siblings.",
        "The LMS helps the enterer with all three of these activities.",
        "To decide on the position of the concept in the hierarchy, the enterer can browse through its graphical representation and view the frames corresponding to any node (concept) in it.",
        "If the enterer has to consider more than one possibility, the frames for several candidate parents for the node to be inserted, can be displayed – in the current implementation up to three candidate frames can be displayed simultaneously.",
        "In the case of computer-user the enterer does not have a difficulty in selecting person as the only candidate parent node.",
        "When the place for a concept is found, a menu containing all slots pertinent for the parent node frame which incorporates all the slots and slot fillers it inherited from its ancestors, appears on the screen.",
        "The enterer scans the menu and modifies, wherever necessary, the values in these slots.",
        "Figure 41 shows the state of the process for entering computer-user when the values for the agent-of slot are being considered.",
        "Note that the system provides additional help by listing candidate 'values for this slot.",
        "The set of candidates is produced automatically by determining the common",
        "ancestor of the inherited slot values (in this case, `action') and suggesting to the enterer all the descendants of this ancestor node that are not currently listed as the slot values.",
        "For slots whose value domains are not concepts but rather property values, the help mechanism simply lists the complete list of values for discrete domains and the appropriate ranges for the continuous ones.",
        "In our example, the enterer adds operate to the values of the agent-of slot.",
        "Another important ability (not illustrated in the example) is adding new slots to various frames and then supplying fillers for them.",
        "When the slot filling stage is completed (this stage of the process is illustrated in Figure 5), it is necessary to check whether the new node is distinct from its parent and siblings.",
        "In our example, the new concept does not have siblings, therefore only the former distinction is tested.",
        "The parent distinction check is performed automatically – the system will alert the enterer if there has been no changes (except for the `isa' slot filler) to the frame displayed for modification at the Fill stage.",
        "If this happens, the new concept is discarded as a duplicate of the parent node.",
        "In our example, an additional value has been added to the agent-of slot.",
        "The sibling distinction check is facilitated in the LMS by allowing the enterer to view the frames for the concept and its siblings alongside one another.",
        "In case no distinction can be found between the new concept and one of its siblings, the new concept is deleted as a duplicate.",
        "In general, before deleting a new concept because of duplication, the enterer makes an effort to save it by changing at least one slot value in either of the two duplicate frames.",
        "This may involve adding an existing concept or a property value from the current domain.",
        "However, in some cases, a new concept or a modification of a property domain may be required.",
        "Each such case is reported to the manager."

      "heading": "3.2 THE MANAGER MODE: ADDING THE CONCEPT",
      "text": [
        "MANAGE(-DATABASE) The enterer first decides to insert the new concept manage(-database) as a sibling of operate and, therefore, selects physical-action as the parent node.",
        "When the frame menu is displayed, however, he discovers a major discrepancy – manage(-database) requires the `mental-object' filler for the object slot.",
        "The enterer then makes an attempt to attach the new concept as a child of the mental-action node but cannot accept reaction, cognition, and perception as the siblings of manage(-database) for reasons of significant conceptual dissimilarity.",
        "At this point, the enterer decides to refer the matter to the manager.",
        "This is accomplished by writing a report about the situation and sending it through the mail system.",
        "At this point the responsibility for processing this",
        "concept passes to the manager.",
        "In addition to the enterer's message the manager also has access to the enterer's attempts to insert manage(-database) into the hierarchy.",
        "The manager is, naturally, capable of handling all the enterer's tasks; but the LMS manager mode has additional functionality.",
        "The enterer is allowed to perform only one operation on the `isa' hierarchy adding leaves to it.",
        "The manager can perform all the operations on this tree – insert new nodes anywhere in it; delete nodes (either with their subtrees or without, in which case the children of the deleted node become children of the latter's parent); and move subtrees to a different position.",
        "The manager is also entitled to create additional property sets (domains) and add and delete values in the existing ones.",
        "Finally, the manager's authority also covers adding, deleting and modifying the value domains of all slots in all concept frames.",
        "Each of these capabilities is supported by LMS routines.",
        "In our example, the manager has to reorganize the subtree whose root is mental-action.",
        "First, he finds the necessary node and calls a menu of operations on a node (Figure 6).",
        "Clicking on 'delete-child', he obtains another menu, in which he indicates that he wants to detach the children of the node.",
        "The result of this operation is illustrated in Figure 7.",
        "At this point the insertion of the two intermediate concepts: computer-mental-action and non-computer-mental-action can be performed (which is supported in the manner illustrated in 3.1 above).",
        "During the insertion process the manager acts exactly in the same manner as an enterer.",
        "Temporarily disregarding the detached children, he inserts the intermediate concepts one by one.",
        "At the next stage, the former children of mental-action are reconnected to the hierarchy as children of non-computer-mental-action.",
        "Once again, the manager acts here as an enterer, filling the frame slots and running the sibling and parent distinction checks.",
        "Next, manage(-database) is attached as a child of the computer-mental-action node.",
        "Again, all the insert-time checks are run.",
        "At this point the manager decides to develop the computer-mental-action node further deductively, that is, without waiting for empirical evidence for this to accumulate.",
        "He decides to enter the nodes write-code and use-interactive-system as siblings of manage(-database).",
        "This operation is entirely at the manager's discretion and expresses the manager's understanding of the computer world and his expectations concerning the concepts that will have to be added to the ontology in the future.",
        "After these concepts have been added to the world, the subtree with the root mental-action will look as in Figure 8."

      "text": [
        "The TRANSLATOR LMS has been implemented only in its initial stage, so that its functionality at present is more constrained than it will be when the LMS attains full capacity.",
        "We would like to discuss here the functionality upgrades under development at the present time.",
        "First, the manager's ability to maintain integrity and consistency in the lexicons must be further supported.",
        "This capability includes modifications of the existing concept lexicon entries which are affected by the insertion of a new concept by an enterer or the manager or by the manager's revision of the domain of a frame slot.",
        "At present, the LMS can automatically find and modify the values in slots complementary to the ones modified.",
        "For example, in our first sample session, after the enterer adds 'operate' to the agent-of slot of computer-user, the system automatically adds computer-user to the agent slot of 'operate.'",
        "But more should be expected.",
        "Thus, in our second sample session, after the manager inserts the computer-mental-action and non-computer-mental-action as the children of mental-action,' the LMS should be able to generate a suggestion that he consider a symmetrical modification in the sibling branch (physical-action), which would make operate a child of computer-physical-action.'",
        "In general, we feel that the LMS should provide more heuristic support for the manager's thought processes concerning ontology modifications.",
        "This latter modification, along with the one the manager actually executed in the sample session, would be a step in the transition from the world ontology in Figure 3 to the computer subworld ontology.",
        "Some of these changes accurately reflect the differences between the world and the subworld, i.e., in this case, the distinction between concepts of computer-related and non-computer-related is central for the subworld but not for the world.",
        "Other changes in the ontology include the correction of mistakes and the refining of the hierarchies suggested by the accumulation of data and experience.",
        "Thus, we will not be surprised if additional data will provide evidence for making speech-action a descendant of mental-action instead of action.",
        "An additional source of insight into the improvement of the LMS will be provided by its use.",
        "Thus, it is difficult to know a priori how many enterers a single manager will be able to supervise; what forms of the interaction between the enterers and the manager are most effective; whether it is possible to support a concurrent mode of operation in which more than one enterers work on one hierarchy simultaneously; or should there be levels of priority assigned to the messages from enterers to the manager or mechanisms for clustering similar messages (if the messages are forced",
        "into a certain format).",
        "A separate concern is a detailed set of on-line instructions for quick reference both by the enterers and the manager.",
        "It should be added to the LMS in the tutorial, reference-manual and keyword-based help mode format.",
        "So far in this section, we have been discussing the depth-wise improvements to the TRANSLATOR LMS.",
        "The breadth-wise development concerns the analysis and generation lexicons.",
        "The work on those can be completed only after the subworld concept lexicon is already reasonably complete.",
        "In the analysis lexicons, indexed by the words or word equivalents, the entries will contain conceptual information from the subworld concept lexicon.",
        "Many words, however, will not have a concept-based lexicon entry but will contain information triggering certain parsing procedures.",
        "Some other entries will include both of these types of information.",
        "Every entry in an analysis lexicon contains syntactic information, and the current LMS already includes an interactive aid for acquiring it for English.",
        "It appears that generation lexicons are, in fact, indexed not only by subworld concepts but also by rhetorical and pragmatic markers in the representation of a text obtained after analysis because both typically have lexical – as well as grammatical – expression in natural language.",
