        "Semantically, tenses should have scope only over verb meanings, but not over any larger elements in a sentence, and 2. verb meanings as well as noun meanings are indexi-cal in the sense their interpretations depend on the context of the utterance in the same way that demonstrative pronouns such as that and anaphoric pronouns such as she and they do.",
        "As the formula in (27) shows, which represents the translation for (24) in my analysis, I adopt Enc's first assumption and assign tense scope only over the main verb of the sentence.",

        "However, the formula in (27) also shows that I do not follow Enc in her second assumption, namely her treatment of nouns as indexi-cals.",
        "In contrast to true indexicals, whose denotation depends solely on the context of utterance, I treat the denotation of predicates corresponding to nouns as being time-dependent in an absolute sense, since predicates such as admiral do carry a time-denoting argument position as part of their function-argument structure.",
        "Without such an argument, it seems impossible to give a satisfactory account of temporal adjectives such as former and previous or last, whose function it is to shift the temporal evaluation of the predicate that they combine with.",
        "However, I do recognize an element of context dependency inherent in the interpretation of noun phrases such as every admiral, since I interpret such noun phrases with respect to some contextually salient property R. This predicate makes it possible to account for the well-known phenomenon of restricted quantification, namely that in sentences such as (28) the interpretation of everyone does not involve the set of all students in the world, but rather the set of all individuals in a given context; for example everyone at a certain party.4 (28) Everyone is having a good time.",
        "Temporal evaluation of the verbal predicate is, thus, kept separate from the temporal evaluation of predicates corresponding to other constituents in the sentence.",
        "As first pointed out by Enc, this strategy makes it possible to account for sentences such as",
        "(29) and (30) whose translations require that the predicates secretary and fugitive be evaluated relative to a time which is distinct from the evaluation time of the predicate corresponding to the verb.5 (29) Oliver North's secretary testified before the committee.",
        "(30) Every fugitive is now in jail.",
        "In contrast to an analysis which interprets the past tense in terms of a Priorean P operator, the narrow scope analysis of tense also avoids the dilemma of inducing a simultaneity reading for sentence (31), if the tense operator P has scope over the entire formula as in the translation (32) of (31).",
