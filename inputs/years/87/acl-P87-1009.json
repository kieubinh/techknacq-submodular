        "The phrasal approach to language analysis, as implemented in PHRAN (PHRasal ANalyzer), has been extended to handle the recognition and partial analysis of such constructions.",
        "The phrasal analysis of a noun sequence is performed to an extent sufficient for continued analysis of the sentence in which it appears.",

        "In everyday language we routinely encounter noun phrases consisting of an article and a head noun, possibly modified by one or more adjectives.",
        "Noun-noun pairs, e. g., park bench, atom bomb, and computer programmer, are also common.",
        "It is rare, however, to encounter noun phrases consisting of three or more nouns in sequence.",
        "Consequently, research in natural language analysis has not concentrated on parsing such constructions.",
        "The situation in many technical fields is quite different.",
        "For example, when describing the specifications of electronic systems, designers commonly use expressions such as: bus request cycle transfer block size segment trap request interrupt vector transfer phase arithmetic register transfer instruction.",
        "During design specification such phrases are often constructed by the specifier in order to reference a particular entity: a piece of hardware, an activity, or a range of time.",
        "In most cases • the nouns preceding the last one are used as modifiers, and idiomatic expressions are very rare.",
        "In almost all cases the meaning of noun sequences can therefore be inferred largely based on the last noun in the sequence*.",
        "(But see Finin (1980) for in-depth treatment of the meaning of such constructions).",
        "The process of recognizing the presence of these expressions is, however, complicated by the fact that many of the words used are syntactically ambiguous.",
        "Almost every single word used in the examples above belongs to both the syntactic categories of noun and verb.",
        "As a result, bus request cycle may conceivably be understood either as a corn",
        "mand (to bus the request cycle) or as a noun phrase.",
        "Considerable knowledge of the semantics of the domain is necessary to decide the correct interpretation of a nominal compound and the natural language analyzer must ultimately have access to it.",
        "But before complete semantic interpretation of such a noun phrase can even be attempted the analyzer must have a method of recognizing its presence in a sentence and determining its boundaries."

        "The knowledge PHRAN has of the language is stored in the form of pattern-concept pairs (PCPs).",
        "The linguistic component of a pattern-concept pair is called a phrasal pattern and describes an utterance at one of various different levels of abstraction.",
        "It may be a single word, or a literal string like",

        "Associated with each phrasal pattern is a conceptual template, which describes the meaning of the phrasal pattern, usually with references to the constituents of the associated phrase.",
        "Each PCP encodes a single piece of knowledge about the language the database is describing.",
        "For the purpose of describing design specifications and requirements a declarative representation language was devised, called SRL (Specification and Requirements Language).",
        "In SRL the conceptual template associated with phrasal pattern (1) above is a form of unidirectional value transfer.",
        "In this specific case it denotes the transfer of the data described by the third constituent of the pattern by the controlling agent described by the first constituent to the component described by the fifth.",
        "For further details of the representation language used see (Granacld et al., 1987).",
        "PHRAN analyzes input by searching for phrasal patterns that match fragments of it and replacing such fragments with the conceptual template associated with the pattern.",
        "The result of matching a pattern may in turn be present as a constituent in a larger pattern.",
        "Finally, the conceptual template associated with a pattern that accounts for all the input is used to generate a structure denoting the meaning of the complete utterance.",

        "• Determination of their length.",
        "One must",
        "make sure that the first few nouns are not taken to constitute the first noun phrase, ignoring the words that follow.",
        "For example, upon reading bus request cycle we do not",
        "want the analyzer to conclude that the first noun phrase is simply bus, or bus request.",
        "• Interpretation of ambiguous noun/verbs.",
        "A large portion of the vocabulary used in digital system specification consists of words which are both nouns and verbs.",
        "Consequently the phrase interrupt vector transfer",
        "phase, for example, might be interpreted as a command to interrupt the vector transfer phase, or (unless we are careful about number agreement) as the claim that phase is transferred by interrupt vectors.",
        "In spoken language stress is sometimes used to \"adjective-ize\" nouns used as modifiers.",
        "For example, the spoken form would be \"arithmetic register transfer\" rather than \"arithmetic register transfer\".",

        "• Determination of enough about their meaning to permit further analysis of the input.",
        "Full understanding of such expressions requires more domain knowledge than one would wish to employ at this point in the analysis process (Cf. Finin (1980)).",
        "However, at least a minimal understanding of the semantics of the noun phrase is necessary for testing selectional restrictions of higher level phrasal patterns.",
        "This is required, in turn, in order to provide a correct representation of the meaning of the complete input.",
        "The phrasal approach utilizes the phrasal pattern as the primary means of recognizing expressions, and in particular noun sequences.",
        "In effect, a phrasal pattern is a sequence of restrictions that constituents must satisfy in order to match the pattern.",
        "The most common restrictions on a constituent in a PHRAN phrasal pattern, and the ones relevant in our case, are of the following three types:",
        "1.",
        "The constituent must be a particular word; 2.",
        "It must belong to a particular semantic category; or, 3.",

        "category.",
        "In addition, simple lookahead restrictions may be attached to any constituent of the pattern.",

        "Simple phrasal patterns are clearly not capable of solving the problem of recognizing multiple noun sequences.",
        "It is not possible to anticipate all such sequences and specify them literally, word for word, since they are often generated on the fly by the system specifier.",
        "For a similar reason phrasal patterns describing the sequence of semantic categories that the nouns belong to are, as a rule, inadequate.",
        "Finally, from the syntactic point of view all these constructions are just sequences of nouns.",

        "Number agreement is found, and it is also the case that a signal may act as an agent in an action of interruption, so rules 1. and 2. provide no information.",
