        "Steedman (1985, 1987) and others have proposed that Categorial Grammar, a theory of syntax in which grammatical categories are viewed as functions, be augmented with operators such as functional composition and type raising in order to analyze • noncanonical\" syntactic constructions such as wh- extraction and node raising.",

        "In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in Categorial Grammar (Adjukeiwicz 1935; Bar-Hillel 1953).",
        "The work of Steedman (1985, 1987) and Dowty (1987) is representative of one recent direction in which Categorial Grammar (CG) has been taken, in which the operations of functional composition and type raising have figured in analyses of •noncanonical\" structures such as wh- dependencies and nonconstituent conjunction.",
        "Based on the fact that such operations have their roots in the combinatory calculus (Curry and Feys 1958), this line of Categorial Grammar has come to be known as Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG).",
        "While such an approach to syntax has been demonstrated to be suitable for computer implementation with unification-based grammar formalisms (Wittenburg 1986a), doubts have arisen over the efficiency with which such grammars can be processed.",
        "Karttunen (1986), for instance, argues for an alternative to rules of functional composition and type raising in CGs on such grounds.'",
        "Other 1Karttunen suggests that these operations, at least in their most general form, are computationally intractable.",
        "However, it should be noted that neither Steedman nor Dowty has suggested that a fully general form of type raising, in particular, should be included as a productive rule of the syntax.",
        "And, as Friedman, Dai, and Wang (1986) have shown, certain constrained forms of these grammars that nevertheless include functional composition are weakly context-free.",
        "Aravind Joshi (personal communication) strongly suspects that the generative capacity of the grammars that Steedman assumes, say, for Dutch, is in the same class with Tree Adjoining Grammars (Joshi 1985) and Head Grammars (Pollard 1984).",
        "Thus, computational tractability is, I believe, not at issue for the particular CCGs assumed here.",
        "researchers working with Categorial Unification Grammars consider the question of what method to use for long-distance dependencies an open one (Uszkoreit 1986; Zeevat, Klein, and Calder 1986).",
        "The property of Combinatory Categorial Grammars that has occasioned concerns about processing is spurious ambiguity: CCGs that directly use functional composition and type raising admit alternative derivations that nevertheless result in fully equivalent parses from a semantic point of view.",
        "In fact, the numbers of such semantically equivalent derivations can multiply at an alarming rate.",
        "It was shown in Wittenburg (1986a) that even constrained versions of functional composition and type raising can independently cause the number of semantically equivalent derivations to grow at rates exponential in the length of the input string.2 While this spurious ambiguity property may not seem to be a particular problem if a depth-first (or best-first) parsing algorithm is used – after all, if one can get by with producing just one derivation, one has no reason to go on generating the remaining equivalent ones – the fact is that both in cases where the parser ultimately fails to generate a derivation and where one needs to be prepared to generate all and only genuinely (semantically) ambiguous parses, spurious ambiguity may be a roadblock to efficient parsing of natural language from a practical perspective.",
        "The proposal in the present work is aimed toward eliminating spurious ambiguity from the form of Combinatory Categorial Grammars that are actually used during parsing.",
        "It involves deriving a new set of combinators, termed predictive combinators, that replace the basic forms of functional composition and type raising in the original grammar.",
        "After first reviewing the theory of Combinatory Categorial Grammar and the attendant spurious ambiguity problem, we proceed to the subject of these derived combinators.",
        "At the conclusion, we compare this approach to other proposals.",
        "Overview of CCG (2) f a< The theory of Combinatorial Categorial Grammar has S \\NP (=IVP) two main components: a categorial lexicon that assigns f a> grammatical categories to string elements and a set of combinatory rules that operate over these categories.3 Categorial lexicon The grammatical categories assigned to string elements in a Categorial Grammar can be basic, as in the category CN, which might be assigned to the common noun man, or they may be of a more complex sort, namely, one of the so-called functor categories.",
        "Functor categories are of the form XIY, which is viewed as a function from categories of type Y to categories of type X.",
        "Thus, for instance, a determiner such as the might be assigned the category NPICN, an indication that it is a function from common nouns to noun phrases.",
        "An example of a slightly more complex functor category would be tensed transitive verbs, which might carry the category (SINP)INP.",
        "This can be viewed as a second order function from (object) noun phrases to another function, namely SINP, which is itself a function from (subject) noun phrases to sentences.'",
        "(Following Steedman, we will sometimes abbreviate this finite verb phrase category as the symbol FVP.)",
        "Directionality is indicated in the categories with the following convention: a right-slanting slash indicates that the argument Y must appear to the right of the functor, as in X/Y; a left-slanting slash indicates that the argument Y must appear to the left, as in X\\Y.5 A vertical slash in this paper is to be interpreted as specifying a directionality of either left or right.",
        "Combinatorial rules Imposing directionality on categories entails including two versions of the basic functional application rule in the grammar.",

        "However, since the information carried by dotted rules in algorithms designed for context-free grammars has a direct correlate in the slashes already found in the categories of a Categorial Grammar, we can incorporate such predictive information into our grammar in categorial terms.",

        "Duplicates generated from functional composition (or from other spurious ambiguity sources) require a treatment no different than Earley's duplicates except that no pointers need to be added in parsing – their derivations are simply redundant from a semantic point of view and thus they can be ignored for later processing.",
        "Karttunen's proposal does not change the worst-case complexity results for Earley's algorithm used with CCGs as discussed above and thus does not offer much relief from the spurious ambiguity problem.",
        "However, parsing algorithms such as Karttunen's that check for duplicates are of course superior from the point of view of asymptotic complexity to parsing algorithms which fail to make checks.",
        "The latter sort will on the face of it be exponential when faced with ambiguity as in (6) since each of the independent derivations corresponding to the Catalan series will have to be enumerated independently.",
        "In earlier work (Wittenburg 1986a, 1986b), I have suggested that heuristics used with a best-first parsing algorithm can help cope with spurious ambiguity.",

        "Genuine ambiguity and unparsable input in natural language can force the parser to search exhaustively with respect to the grammar.",
        "While heuristics used even with a large search space can provide the means for tuning performance for the \"best\" analyses, the search space itself will determine the results in the \"worst\" cases.",
        "Compiling the grammar into a normal form based on the notion of predictive combinators makes exhaustive search more palatable, whatever the enumeration order, since the search 13 This characterization also apparently holds for the proposals from Pareschi and Steedman (1987) being presented at this conference.",
        "14 While Karttunen's categorial fragment for Finnish does not make direct use of functional composition and type raising, it nevertheless suffers from spurious ambiguity of a similar sort stemming from the nature of the categories and functional application rules he defines.",
        "15 The n3 result crucially depends on this check, in fact.",
        "space itself is vastly reduced.",
        "Heuristics (along with best-first methods generally) may still be valuable in the reduced space, but any enumeration order will do.",
        "Thus Earley parsing, best-first enumeration, and even LR techniques are still all consistent with the proposal in the current work."
