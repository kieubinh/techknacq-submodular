        "Although A no B is a simple form, it is interesting in two respects.",
        "First, A no B represents a general linguistic problem for semantic processing.",
        "The reason is that, in some cases, A or B is a noun form derived from a verb or adjective, thus necessitating the semantic processing of verbs and adjectives.",
        "Second, A no B can be paraphrased as a noun phrase with a relative clause, in just the same way as some English complex nominals 13' 51â€¢ Putting it another way, as information is condensed into a simple expression, there are ambiguities as to the semantic relations between the two nouns.",
