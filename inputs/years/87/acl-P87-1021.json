        "My basic premise is that in processing a narrative text, a listener is building up a representation of the speaker's view of the events and situations being described and of their relationship to one another.",
        "This representation, which I will call an event/situatlon structure or 6/s structure, reflects the listener's best effort at interpreting the speaker's ordering of those events and situations in time and space.",
        "The listener's problem can therefore be viewed as that of establishing where in the evolving e/s structure to attach the event or situation described in the next clause.",
        "My claim is that the discourse interpretation of tense contributes to the solution of this problem.",
        "This work on the discourse interpretation of tense is being carried out in the context of a larger enterprise whose goal is an account of explicit anaphoric reference to events and situations, as in Example 1.",
        "Example 1, It's always been presumed that when the glaciers receded, the area got very hot.",
        "The Folsum men couldn't adapt, and they died out.",
        "That's what's supposed to have happened.",
        "It's the textbook dogma.",
        "But it's wrong.",
        "They were human and smart.",
        "They adapted their weapons and culture, and they survived.",
        "Example 1 shows that one may refer anaphorically to structured entities built up through multiple clauses.",
        "Thus an account of how clauses arrange themselves into structures is necessary to an account of event reference.2 'This work was partially supported by ARO grant DAA29-84-9-0027, NSF grant MCS-8219116-CER, and DARPA grant N00014-85-K-0018 to the University of Pennsylvania, and by DARPA grant N00014-85-C-0012 to UNISYS.",
        "30ther parts of the enterprise include a general mechanism for individuating composite entities made up of ones separately introduced [20, 211 and a representation for events that allow for anaphoric reference to both particular events and situations and to abstractions thereof [161.",
        "In this paper, I will relate the problem of building up an e/s structure to what has been described as the anaphoric property of tense [7, 11, 6, 1, 12] and of relative temporal adverbials [181 Anaphora are expressions whose specification is context-dependent.",
        "Tense and relative temporal adverbials, I interpret as specifying positions in an evolving e/s structure.",
        "My view of their anaphoric nature is that the particular positions they can specify depend on the current context.",
        "And the current context only makes a few positions accessible.",
        "(This I will claim to be in contrast with the ability of temporal subordinate clauses and noun phrases (NPs) to direct the listener to any position in the evolving structure.)",
        "The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, I discuss tense as an anaphoric device.",
        "Previous work in this area has discussed how tense is anaphoric, claiming as well that it is like a pronoun.",
        "While agreeing as to the source of the anaphoric character of tense, I do not think the analogy with pronouns has been productive.",
        "In contrast, I discuss what I believe to be a more productive analogy between tense and definite noun phrases.",
        "Previous work has focussed on the interpretation of tensed clauses in simple linear narratives (i.e., narratives in which the order of underlying events directly corresponds to their order of presentation).3 Here the most perplexing question involves when the next clause in a sequence is interpreted as an event or sequence coincident with the previous one and when, as following the previous one [4, 6, 12].",
        "In Section 3, I show that if one moves beyond simple linear narratives, there are more options.",
        "In terms of the framework proposed here, there may be more than one position in the evolving e/s structure which can provide a context for the interpretation of tense.",
        "Hence there may be more than one position in e/s structure which tense can specify and which the new event or situation can attach to.",
        "To model the possible contexts, I introduce a discourse-level focussing mechanism - temporal focus or TF - similar to that proposed for interpreting pronouns and definite NPs [17].",
        "I give examples to show that change of TF is intimately bound up with narrative structure.",
        "To keep track of and predict its movement, I propose a set of focus heuristics: one Focus Maintenance Heuristic, predicting regular movement forward, two Embedded Discourse Heuristics for stacking the focus and embarking on an embedded narrative, and one Focus Resumption",
        "Heuristic for returning and resuming the current narrative.",
        "The need for each of these is shown by example.",
        "In Section 4, I show that relative temporal adverbials display the same anaphoric property as simple tense.",
        "That the interpretation of tense should be entwined with discourse structure in this way should not come as a surprise, as a similar thing has been found true of other discourse anaphora [5]."

        "Tense does not seem prima facie anaphoric: an isolated sentence like \"John went to bed\" or \"I met a man who looked like a basset hound\" appears to make sense without previously establishing when it happened.",

        "He came home and went to bed.",

        "This linkage is the anaphoric property of tense that previous authors have described.",
        "Hinrichs (6] and Bauerle (1], following McCawley [7] and Partee [11], showed that it is not tense per se that is interpreted anaphorically, but that part of tense called by Reichenbach [141 reference time.4 According to Reichenbach, the interpretation of tense requires three notions: speech time (ST), event time (ET), and reference time (RI).",
        "RT is the time from which the evenvsituation described in the sentence is viewed.",
        "It may be the same as ST, as in",

        "Having said that it is the AT of tense whose interpretation is anaphoric, the next question to ask is what kind of anaphoric behavior it evinces.",
        "In previous work, tense is claimed to behave like a pronoun.",
        "Partee [12] makes the strongest case, claiming that pronouns and tense display the same range of antecedent-anaphor linkages:",
        "Because of this similarity, Partee and others have claimed that tense is like a pronoun.",
        "Their account of how time is then seen to advance in simple linear narratives is designed, in part, to get around the problem that while pronouns co-specify with their antecedents, the RT of clause N cannot just co-specify the same time as the previous clause [6, 12, 41.",
        "There is another option though: one can draw an analogy between tense and definite NPs, which are also anaphoric.",
        "Support for this analogy is that, like a definite",
        "NP, tense can cause the listener to create something new.",
        "With a definite NP, that something new is a new discourse entity (19].",
        "With tense, I will say for now that it is a new time at which the event or situation is interpreted as occuring.6 If one looks at texts other than simple linear narratives, this ability becomes clear, as the following simple example shows: Example 4 I was at Mary's house yesterday.",
        "We talked about her brother.",

        "That it is before the conversation is a matter of world knowledge.",
        "In the e/s structure for the whole narrative, the tense of the third clause would set up a new position for the events of the embedded narrative, ordered prior to the current position, to site these events.",
        "The claimed analogy of tense with pronouns is based on the similarity in antecedent-anaphor linkages they display.",
        "But notice that definite NPs can display the same linkages in two different ways: (1) the definite NP can co-specify with its antecedent, as in the a. examples below, and (2) the definite NP can specify a new entity that is 'strongly' associated with the antecedent and is unique by virtue of that association, as in the b. examples below7"
