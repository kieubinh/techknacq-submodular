        "Cue phrases are linguistic expressions -- such as okay, but, now, anyway, by the way, in any case, that reminds me which may, instead of making a 'semantic' contribution to an utterance (i.e., affecting its truth conditions), be used to convey explicit information about the structure of a discourse [4], [16], [5].1 For example, anyway can indicate a topic return and that reminds me can signal a digression.",
        "The recognition and generation of cue phrases is of considerable interest to research in natural language processing.",
        "The structural information conveyed by these phrases is crucial to tasks such as anaphora resolution [6], [5], [16] and the identification of rhetorical relations among portions of a text or discourse [11], [8], [16].",
        "It has also been claimed that the incorporation of cue phrases into natural language processing systems helps reduce the complexity of discourse processing [21], [4], [10].",
        "Despite the recognized importance of cue phrases, many questions about how they are defined both individually and as a class -- and how they are to be represented, generated, and recognized -- remain to be examined.",
        "For example, in the general case, each lexical item that can serve as a 'cue phrase' also has an alternate interpretation.2 While the 'cue' interpretation provides explicit 1.",
        "Previous literature has employed the terms 'clue word', 'discourse marker' or 'discourse particle' for these items [16], [4], [14], [18].",
        "More recently Grosz and Sidner [5] have proposed the term cue phrase for these items, which we will adopt in this paper.",
        "2.",
        "If 'non-lexical' items such as uh are classed as cue phrases, then this generalization may not hold for all cue phrases.",
        "However, information about the structure of a discourse, the ton-cue' interpretation provides quite different information, such as conjunction (but) or adverbial modification (anyway).",
        "Distinguishing between these two uses is critical to the interpretation of discourse.",
        "In this paper, we address the problem of how this distinction might be made.",
        "We propose that, in speech, this distinction is made intonationally.",
        "We support our hypothesis by an analysis of cue and non-cue uses of the item now in recorded naturally occurring discourse.",

        "In Section 3 we present relevant aspects of the theory of English intonation assumed here for our analysis [13], [9].",

        "Despite some recognition [5] that cue phrases are not always employed as cue phrases, no attempt has been made to discover how 'cue' uses of cue phrases are distinguished from `non-cue' uses.",
        "When does now, for example, function as a discourse marker and when is it deictic?",
        "Roughly, the non-cue or deictic use of now makes reference to a span of time which minimally includes the utterance time.",
        "This time span may include little more than moment of utterance, as in 1, or it may be of indeterminate length, as in 2.3 even uh appears to have both 'cue' and 'non-cue' uses; i.e., it may signal a digression or interruption, or it may simply serve as a pause filler.",
        "Fred: Yeah I think we'll look that up and possibly uh after one of your breaks Harry.",

        "In contrast, the cue use of now signals a return to a previous topic, as in the two examples of now in 3, or introduces a subtopic, as in 4.",

        "Fred: Ok. You see now unfortunately Harry as we alluded to earlier when there is a distribution from an IRA that is taxable ...{discussion of caller's beneficiary status}...

        "reasonable to propose that deictic now occurs only when the verb modified by now (or the main verb of the clause so modified) is temporally compatible -- i.e., non-past.",
        "For example, using the past tense in 1 -- we took one now -- seems distinctly odd.",
        "However, we took one just now is clearly felicitous.",
        "So, both cue and non-cue now are possible when the main verb is in the past tense.",
        "As examples 1 3 above illustrate, both are also possible when the main verb is in the present tense.",
        "So, tense is clearly inadequate to distinguish between cue and non-cue uses of now.",
        "Another possible diagnostic for non-cue now might be some notion of the general felicity of temporal reference in an utterance -- which might correspond to the felicity of substituting other temporal adverbials for now.",
        "For example, we'll take one in an hour would be felicitous in 1, as would I see more coupons these days in 2.",

        "A third possibility is that hearers use surface order position to distinguish cue from non-cue uses.",

        "The actual recording of 6 clearly supports the latter interpretation: the strong intonational boundary between tax and now identifies the clausal boundary --and, thus, indirectly, the surface position of now within its clause.",

        "However, this potential attachment distinction does not provide a means of distinguishing cue from non-cue now -- rather, attachment possibilities must be based on the prior cue/ non-cue distinction.",
        "So, syntactic structure provides no useful clues to the identification of cue versus non-cue usage in this case.",

        "The striking differences in phrasing noted between cue and non-cue now in sample one were again present in sample two: Again, around 40% (13) of cue now's formed separate intermediate (8) or intonational (5) phrases; only one of the 20 non-cue now's formed a separate intermediate phrase and none a separate intonational phrase.",
        "These results were significant at the .005 level -- again strong evidence of association between cue/non-cue status and phrasal composition.",
        "When we tested position of now within its intonational phrase in sample two, we again found that cue now generally began the intonational phrase: All but one cue now (this ended its phrase) began 9.",

        "While analysis of data for callers and for all speakers shows that the relationship between cue use and separate phrase is significant at the .001 level, this relationship is not significant for the host data.",

        "In the absence of alternate known means of distinction between cue and non-cue use, we propose that speakers and hearers do differentiate intonationally.",
        "Our next step is to extend our study to other cue phrases, including anyway, well, first, and right.",
        "We also plan to examine the relationship between cue usage and pitch range manipulation (7], another indicator of discourse structure.",
        "The goal of our research is both to provide new sources of linguistic information for work in plan inference and discourse understanding, and to permit more sophisticated use of intonational variation in synthetic speech."
