        "Theories of semantic interpretation which wish to capture as many generalizations as possible must face up to the manifoldly ambiguous and contextually dependent nature of word meaning) In this paper I present a two-level scheme of semantic interpretation in which the first level deals with the semantic consequences of syntactic structure and the second with the choice of word meaning.",
        "On the first level the meanings of ambiguous words, pronominal references, nominal compounds and metonomies are not treated as fixed, but are instead represented by free variables which range over predicates and functions.",
        "The context-dependence of lexical meaning is dealt with by the second level, a constraint propagation process which attempts to assign values to these variables on the basis of the logical coherence of the overall result.",
        "In so doing it makes use of a set of polysemy operators which map between lexical senses, thus making a potentially indefinite number of related senses available."

      "text": [
        "A tenet now held with some force among formal semanticists is that the meaning of a complex natural-language expression should be a function of just two things: the meanings of the parts of the expression and the syntactic rule used to form the expression out of those parts.",
        "Systems such as Montague Grammar [9] give phrases like \"former senator compositional treatments by first translating them to an expression of intensional logic, and then giving this expression a model-theoretic interpretation in the usual way.",
        "The practical relevance of this goal to work in natural language processing is clear: for any application domain, maximum coverage could be obtained from the same domain-independent set of rules, needing only to add the relevant entries, with their primitive associations of meaning, to the lexicon.",
        "'The work presented here was supported under DARPA contract *N00014-85-C-0016.",
        "The views and conclusions contained in this document are those of the author and should not be interpreted as necessarily representing the official policies, either expressed or implied, of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency or the United States Government.",
        "An obvious technical issue for this program is raised by the phenomenon of lexical ambiguity.",
        "This problem is not one that has been particularly addressed in the Montague Grammar literature.",
        "The most obvious approach is simply to make alternative lexical senses separate entries in the lexicon, and to allow these disambiguated lexical items to give rise to separate syntactic and semantic analyses.",
        "The computationally unattractive consequences of this are quite clear: the same work must be done over again for each variant.",
        "An alternative class of proposals defers the lexical part of the analysis until the rest is done.",
        "Hobbs [5] has presented the most detailed general treatment of this type to date.",
        "This treatment simply associates each ambiguous lexical item with the logical disjunction of its separate senses.",
        "Standard reasoning techniques (such as theorem proving) can then be applied.",
        "The problem with this approach is that it is simply not correct.",
        "This may be most straightforwardly seen in yes/no questions that contain an ambiguity.",
        "For example, suppose the the ambiguous verb \"have\" is to be treated as the disjunction of the predicates POSSESS, PART-OF, etc.",
        "Then the answer to the question \"Does the butcher have kidneys?\" must always come out \"yes\", because the second alternative is (assumably) true regardless.",
        "This method goes wrong because the issue in resolving ambiguity is determining which possibility was intended, not which possibility is true.",
        "A more correct approach is due to Landsbergen and Scha [8] and implemented in the PHLIOA1 system.",
        "There, the result of semantic interpretation is an expression of an ambiguous logical language called EFL (for English-oriented Formal Language).",
        "During semantic interpretation each lexeme is assigned to one (possibly ambiguous) descriptive constant of that language, which is later mapped, via local translation rules, to one or more expressions of an unambiguous logical language called WML (for World Model Language).",
        "The result is a set of complete WML translations of the entire EFL expression, from which sortally anomalous alternatives are subsequently eliminated.",
        "The PHLIOA1 system, while handling homonymy acceptably, does not address the problem of polysemy - the presence of an indefinite number of related senses for a single word.",
        "Consider the polysemous lexeme \"mouth\", which is used differently",
        "in the phrases \"mouth of a person\", \"mouth of a bottle\", \"mouth of a river\", and \"mouth of a cave\".",
        "Surely the same logical relationship is not involved in each of these cases.",
        "Generalizing the meaning of the word will not help either, for if we tried to redefine \"mouth\" to mean just any aperture, we would lose our ability to refer to human \"mouths\" independently of other parts of the body.",
        "Enumerating these separate senses with separate translation rules does not look like a very promising approach either, since it is not at all clear that the list above could not be continued indefinitely.",
        "The problem with such an approach to meaning seems to be that it is too discrete: in linguistic terms, it does not \"capture a generalization\".",
        "This paper presents a method of dealing with lexical meanings which does seek to capture the generalizations implicit in polysemy.",
        "The complexes of meanings associated with polysemous lexical items are generated, structured and extended by a kind of \"grammar\" of word meaning: a set of operators which take descriptive constants of a meaning representation language onto other descriptive constants or expressions of that language.",
        "These operations include not only metaphorical and metonymic extension of the word sense, but \"broadening\", which allows a word to refer to a wider class of items than before; \"exclusion\", which removes from the denotation of a word the members of a particular subset thereof; \"narrowing\", which narrows the denotation down to a particular subset.",
        "Each word is assumed to have a core sense (or in the case that it is homonymous, several core senses) from which extended senses can be derived by recursive application of the operators.",
        "Related to the issue of lexical ambiguity, if traditionally studied apart from it.",
        "are the problems raised by nominal compounds and metonymies.",
        "Here the problem is determining the binary relation which has been \"elided\" from the utterance.",
        "This could in principle be any relation; a translation rule approach cannot help here.",
        "Novel metaphorical uses of a word, such as the substitution of an individual for a whole class, will also escape such an approach.",
        "The point about all three of these phenomena is that they essentially create new lexical senses.",
        "The productiveness of this process suggests that the established senses of polysemous lexemes may be generated in the same way.",
        "A key innovation of this work is to treat every non-logical word as being potentially ambiguous.",
        "Thus semantic interpretation initially assigns to each such lexical item not an ambiguous constant, but a free variable capable of ranging over the appropriate type of a higher-order intensional logic (4].",
        "These free variables are restricted to range not over an explicitly enumerated set of logical expressions, but over a potentially infinite set of them which is recursively enumerable by the polysemy operators.",
        "Obviously, the core sense itself (and other established senses) are not excluded as candidates.",
        "A separate constraint propagation stage then assigns appropriate descriptive constant values to these variables based on the sortal coherence of the whole expression.",
        "This two-stage method of semantic interpretation will be seen to have an advantage over one not discussed so far: a single stage method which not does not allot a separate role to lexical semantics or pay close attention to compositionality, but rather seeks to interpret distinct patterns like \"mouth of a cave\" as a whole.",
        "Besides suffering from the same lack of generality criticised above this latter method encounters difficulty when an ambiguous word-form and a pronoun or trace are combined together.",
        "A second constraint propagation stage enables the dependence of word meaning on context - specifically, on the meanings of other words and the referents of anaphors and deixis in the utterance - to be captured.",
        "The computational effect is that search can be cut down in a space that is essentially a cartesian product over the ambiguous elements of an utterance."

        "The present section lays down the representational structure which the next, dealing with the polysemy operators themselves, will make use of.",
        "Let a \"domain\" be defined as a set of descriptive constants and axioms involving them, subject to three conditions: (1) The descriptive constants are such that a specification of each of their extensions gives a \"state of the world\" relevant to the domain (2) The axioms are such that they constrain which states of the world are possible or allowable (3) The axioms do not define the constants with the biconditional, but with one-way implication only, thus leaving the constants primitive.",
        "If complete definitions of constants via lambda-abstraction is allowed it is only as a technical convienence; these are to be regarded as \"extra\".",
        "The latter condition (3) captures the important fact that domains are not definable in terms of other domains.",

        "This has an impact for natural language question answering systems in which DA is the notions of ordinary language and DB the logical vocabulary of some technical domain.",

        "On a literal interpretation of the word \"carry\" the predication of the sentence is satisfied whether the ships \"carry\" the missiles as weaponry or as incidental cargo, yet of these only the first alternative is the desired one.",
        "If the query were instead \"What ships carry oranges?\" the second alternative is the preferable one.",
        "The resultant \"splitting\" of lexical senses can be regarded as a form of ambiguity generated by the contact between logical domains.",
        "Other kinds of mapping between notions of different domains are more complex, not taking place along the lines of greater or lesser specificity, but involving instead another kind of mapping that is really tantamount to metaphor.",
        "A phrase like \"in Marketing\", for example, is not locative in the literal sense of location in space but rather makes use of a metaphor having to do with this notion.",
        "Here the initial domain is that of space and spatial inclusion, while the final one is that of, say, fields of employment or expertise.",
        "The formal representation of metaphor used in this work is that of Indurkhya [7].",
        "Indurkhya identifies a metaphor with the formal notion of a \"T-MAP\": a pair <F,S> where F is a function mapping descriptive constants from one domain to another and S is a set of sentences which are expected to carry over from the first domain to the second.",
        "A metaphor is \"coherent\" if the transferred sentences S are logically consistent with the axioms of the target domain, \"strongly coherent\" if they already lie in the deductive closure of those axioms.",

        "One way around this is not to use predicate calculus (as Indurkhya does) but a language that is more restrictive than predicate calculus.",
        "For the price of surrending complete expressive power one gains the advantage of deductive tractability.",

        "The variables associated with nominal compounds are initially left unconstrained.",
        "Thereafter, constraint propagation may end up in one of three states: satisfaction, in which case the module returns a single logical expression; underconstraint, in which case there is an ambiguity with which the user must be presented; overconstraint in which case reinterpretation is invoked to search for an interpretation which coheres.",
        "The most important issue in performing reinterpretation is controlling the process that the system does not \"hallucinate\" arbitrary meanings into an expression.",
        "The control heuristics include:",
        "1. consider overconstrained variables for reinterpretation first 2. prefer generalizations and exclusions which modify a small number of properties 3. prefer metaphorical extensions with a high ratio of plausibility (as in Sec 3.2) and minimize the number of \"augmentations\" and \"positings\" [7] 4. avoid multiple reinterpretations of the same item",
        "5. prefer reinterpretations to already established polysemous senses instead of creating new ones In Hobbs' work [61 control turns on a notion of a \"costfunction\" associated with the lengths of proofs.",
        "The notion of \"minimality\" in that work has some similarity to the heuristics above, which seek to avoid arbitrary reinterpretations of lexical meanings by prefering conservative reinterpretations and discouraging multiple ones.",
        "The creation by the polysemy operators of new sense for a word can effectively be regarded as a kind of \"learning\".",

        "I have tried to show how a compositional semantics need not be incompatible with a context-dependent notion of word meaning by making a division of labor between the rule-to-rule translation of syntactic structure and the complex semantics of lexical items.",
        "I shall even go so far as to say that such a division of labor is neccesary for the compositional program to succeed.",
        "A component which takes into account the creativity of lexical meanings and which utilizes knowledge representation and limited inference not only gives word meaning its proper place in a modular system but also has the potential of extending coverage and flexibility beyond what is currently available in natural language systems."
