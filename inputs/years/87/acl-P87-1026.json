        "Natural language processing systems must use a broad range of lexical knowledge to account for the syntactic use and meaning of words and constructs.",
        "The problem of understanding is compounded by the fact that language is full of nonproductive constructs – expressions whose meaning is not fully determined by examining their parts.",
        "To handle these constructs, some systems use a phrasal lexicon [Becker, 1975, Wilensky and Arens, 1980b, Jacobs, ,1985b, Steinacker and Buchberger, 1983, Dyer and Zernik, 1986], a dictionary designed to make the representation of these specialized constructs easier.",
        "The problem that phrasal lexicons have is that they are too rigid: the phrasal knowledge is entered in a way that makes it difficult to represent the many forms some expressions may take without treating each form as a distinct \"phrase\".",
        "For example, expressions such as \"send a message\", \"give a hug\", \"working directory\", and \"pick up\" may be handled as specialized phrases, but this overlooks similar expressions such as \"give a message\", \"get a kiss\", \"working area\", and \"take up\".",
        "Specialized constructs must be recognized, but much of their meaning as well as their flexible linguistic behavior may come from a more general level.",
        "A solution to this problem of rigidity is to have a hierarchy of linguistic constructions, with the most specialized phrases grouped in categories with other phrases that behave similarly.",
        "The idea of a linguistic hierarchy is not novel, having roots in both linguistics [Lockwood, 1972, Halliday, 1978] and Artificial Intelligence [Sondheimer et al., 1984].",
        "Incorporating phrasal knowledge into such a hierarchy was suggested in some Al work [Wilensky and Arens, 1980a], but the actual implementation of a hierarchical phrasal lexicon requires substantial extensions to the phrasal representation of such work.",
        "The Flexible Lexicon Utilizing Specific and Hierarchical knowledge (FLUSH) is one component in a suite of natural language processing tools being developed at the GE Research and Development Center to facilitate rapid assimilation of natural language processing technology to a wide variety of domains.",
        "FLUSH has characteristics of both traditional and phrasal lexicons, and the phrasal portion is partitioned into four classes of phrasal entries:",
        "• word sequences • lexical relations • linguistic relations • linguistic/conceptual relations",
        "FLUSH'S mechanisms for dealing with these four classes of specialized phrases make use of both general and specific knowledge to support extensibility.",

        "This process continues until either the top of the compound-lexeme hierarchy is reached (which happens immediately for most relations) or until a suitable compound lexeme is found.",
        "The process of finding a compound lexeme below the given relation is a matching problem.",
        "In response to the example call to find-compound above, the lexicon proceeds to look at the defined categories underneath verb-part, which include verb-part-xxx-up, verb-part-xxxout, verb-part-xxx-of, etc., to see which one(s) satisfies the constraints.",
        "verb-part-xxx-up is found as a possibility, resulting in the same function being called recursively with the remaining constraints to find an appropriate category below it: (find-compound verb-part-xxx-up (v-verb-part pt-verb-pick)) This process is repeated until one of two conditions occurs: either the given constraints are exhausted, in which case a category that satisfies all of them has been found; or there are no more categories to search but there are still constraints left, in which case no match has been found and it may be appropriate to search the ancestors' subcategories.",
        "In this example, the verb-part-pick-up category is found and returned on the second recursion, therefore, there is no need to search the hierarchy at a higher level.",
        "If instead the parser is working in the sentence \"The man arrived from New York\", it encounters a possible verb-adjunct (va) relation between the verb \"arrived\" and the prepositional phrase \"from New York\".",
        "The lexicon is called with the va relation, but the first step in the search process (i.e., looking below the given relation) does not yield a compound lexeme because mod-rel-xxx-from is defined in terms of the mod-rel relation rather than in terms of the va relation (see Figure 2).",
        "So even though the relation that the parser encounters in the pattern is a verb-adjunct relation, the lexicon is flexible enough that it can apply more general knowledge to the retrieval problem.",
        "The meanings of compound lexemes are represented and accessed using a reference pointer that links the linguistic category to a conceptual structure.",
        "Some of the conceptual reference pointers for compound lexemes are more complicated than simple lexical access because of",
        "Although the compound lexeme representations illustrated in the previous section differ, FLUSH is able to employ a fairly flexible algorithm for accessing them.",
        "When the parser encounters a relation that may constitute a compound lexeme, it passes the name of the relation and the constituents that fill the appropriate roles to FLUSH.",
        "If FLUSH finds a compound lexeme that satisfies the constraints, it passes the lexeme back to the parser.",
        "For example, if TRUMP is working on the sentence \"John picked up the book\", it encounters a possible verb-particle relationship between the verb \"picked\" and the preposition \"up\".",
        "When this relationship is apparent to the parser, FLUSH is called with the verb-part relation with the constituents of pt-verb-pick as the verb and prep-up as the particle: (find-compound verb-part (v-verb-part pt-verb-pick) (p-verb-part prep-up)) In this example, the compound lexeme verb-part-pickup is found by FLUSH and is returned to the parser.",
        "If instead the sentence is \"John meditated up the hill\", the parser takes the same action, but no compound lexeme is found by FLUSH because \"meditated up\" has no special meaning.",
        "FLUSH uses a two step procedure to locate specific compound lexemes.",
        "First, entries below the given relation in the hierarchy are checked to see if any of them satisfy the given constraints.",
        "If a compound lexeme exists, it is usually found during this step.",
        "There are some cases, however, in which the desired compound lexeme exists as a subcategory of an ancestor of the given relation.",
        "This situation was seen in the description of the modifying relation (mod-re!",
        "), verb-adjunct (va), and noun-post-modifier (npm) in the previous section (see Figure 2).",
        "In this case, the prepositional phrase \"from New York\" invokes mod-rel-xxx-from.",
        "In turn, the transfer-event concept is invoked with \"New York\" as the source of the transfer.",
        "The explanations above illustrate that FLUSH is capable of representing and accessing most of the different types of lexical knowledge that natural language processing systems need to have.",
        "They also show how FLUSH can do most of it in a general manner, making extensions fairly straightforward.",
        "FLUSH is equipped also with a mechanism for automatic acquisition of new lexemes, described in [Besemer, 1986].",
