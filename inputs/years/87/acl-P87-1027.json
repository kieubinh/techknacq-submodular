        "Within the larger framework of the Alvey Programme of advanced information technology a research and development initiative set up in the UK to promote collaborative research projects aimed at several enabling key technologies a coordinated effort to build a natural language toolkit for the use by the wider academic and industrial community is being carried out jointly by groups at the Universities of Cambridge, Lancaster and Edinburgh.",
        "The goal of these three closely related projects is to produce directly compatible rule systems and associated software, capable of functioning together as an integrated system for morphological and syntactic parsing of texts.",
        "The projects aim to deliver, respectively, a sentence grammar of English together with a word list indexed to the grammar, a combined inflectional and derivational morphological analyser and dictionary system, and a parser for the grammatical formalism used.",
        "The work is being carried out within the theoretical framework of Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (Gazdar et al., 1985), but many of the mechanisms would be usable without a theoretical commitment to GPSG.",
        "It is envisaged that the complete integrated toolkit will be used by a number of research and development groups, as a base component for a range of applications.",

        "Further relevant details of both projects are provided in section 2.",
        "As part of the grammar project, in tandem with the development of the grammar proper, work is underway to develop a sizeable word list which will be integrated with an existing lexicon of about 4000 words, hand crafted by the morphology project.",
        "The coverage of this word list and its compatibility with the sentence grammar, word grammar and existing lexicon is critical for the complete analysis system.",
        "The word list need only contain base and irregular entries, as productive inflectional and derivational variants are analysed at runtime on the basis of the word grammar.",
        "Therefore, when the word list is integrated with the existing lexicon and dictionary system it will form a dynamic system for word analysis, and not just a repository of word forms used for simple lookup.",
        "An additional constraint on the content of the target word list comes from the fact that even though there is no provision for the analysis system to handle semantics there is still the need to provide a minimal, theoretically neutral extension to the grammar rules and lexical entry format to allow subsequent integration of a semantic component: thus information concerning eg.",
        "the predicate-argument structure of verbs and their logical types must be made available in the lexical entries.",
        "The question then arises of how to develop such a detailed and substantial word list.",
        "Our approach has been to make use of the machine-readable source of a published dictionary, namely the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (henceforth LDOCE) (Procter, 1978).",
        "Apart from the obvious motivation of attempting to derive a large list of words from a computerised source, LDOCE is particularly relevant to this project since it offers, among other things, through a highly elaborate and semi-formal system of grammar codes, detailed information about the grammatical behaviour of individual words.",
        "We have mounted the dictionary on-line and, following its conversion into a flexible lexical knowledge base (as described in Boguraev et al.",
        "1987), a range of experiments have since been carried out with the aim of establishing LDOCE's appropriateness to the task of deriving a word list with associated grammatical definitions indexed to the analyser grammar.",
        "Section 3 below describes the syntactic level information available in, and extractable from, LDOCE and summarises the description of an operational program used to derive such information.",
        "The attempt to use semi-formalised, and occasionally inaccurate, information for constructing a large computerised lexicon raises a number of practical problems.",
        "In order to make maximal use of the rich syn193 tactic data in the source machine-readable dictionary (MRD), we have designed a lexicon development system which embodies a methodology for a semi-automatic interactive cycle of lexical entry generation and testing.",

        "Furthermore, since some of the information requred is only recoverable on the basis of a comparison of codes within a word sense specified in the source dictionary, additional errors can be introduced.",

        "However, this rule breaks down in the case of an entry such as 'acknowledge\", where the two codes corresponding to different subcategorisation frames are split between two (spuriously separated) word senses (Figure 6), and consequently incorrectly assigns 0Equi to this verb.",
        "The rule consequently breaks down and 'consider' is incorrectly assigned the logical type of an Equi verb.",

        "The system is designed on the assumption that no machine-readable dictionary can provide a complete, consistent, and totally accurate source of lexical information.",
        "Therefore, rather than batch process the MRD source, the lexicon development software is based around the concept of semi-automatic and rapid construction of entries, involving the continuous intervention of the end user, typically a linguist / lexicographer.",
        "In the course of an interactive cycle of development, a number of entries are hypothesised and automatically generated from a single base form.",
        "The family of related surface forms is output by the morphological generator, which employs the same word grammar used for inflectional and derivational morphology by the analysis system and creates new entries by adding affixes to the base form in legitimate ways.",
        "The generation and refinement of new entries is based on repeated application of the morphological generator to suitable base forms, followed by user intervention involving either rejecting, or minimally editing, the surface forms proposed by the system.",
        "Below we sketch a typical pattern of use.",
        "If the user asks the system to create an entry for \"believe\", the transformation program described in section 3.2 (see Figure 4) will create an entry which contains all the syntactic information specified in Figure 1.",
        "In addition, many surface forms with associated grammatical definitions will be generated automatically:",
        "The system generates these forms from the base entry in batches and displays the results in syntactic frames associated with subcategorisation possibilities.",
        "These frames, which are used to tap the user's grammaticality judgements, are as semantically 'bleached'",
        "as possible, so that they will be as compatible as possible with the semantic restrictions that verbs place on their arguments.",
        "Each possible SUBCAT feature value in the grammar is associated with such frames, for example: SFIN:They C ... 0 that someone is something OR:They C :.. 3 someone to be something They... 0 there to be a problem OE:They C ... 3 that someone is something They C 0 there to be a problem",
        "Internally, frames are more complex than illustrated above.",
        "Surface phrasal forms with marked slots in them are associated with more detailed feature specifications of lexical categories which are compatible with the fully instantiated lexical items allowed by the grammar to fill the slots.",
        "Such detailed frame specifications are automatically generated on the basis of syntactic analysis of sentences made up from the frame phrase skeleton with valid lexical items substituted for the blank slot filler.",
        "Figure 9 below shows a fragment of the system's inventory of frames.",
        "The system ensures that slots in syntactic frames are filled by surface forms which have the syntactic features the sentence grammar requires.",
        "Displaying such instantiated frames provides a double check both on the outright correctness of the surface form and on the correctness of a surface form paired with a particular definition.",
        "For example, the user can reject They verbatim that someone is something completely, but They believes that someone is something is indicative of an incorrect definition, rather than surface form.",
        "Syntactic frames encoding other `transformational' possibilities are often associated with particular SUBCAT values since these provide the user with more helpful data to accept or reject a particular assignment.",
        "Thus for example selecting between Raising and 0Equi verbs is made easier if the frames for 1SUBCAT OR) are instantiated simultaneously: They believe someone to be something / They persuade someone to be something They believe there to be a problem / They persuade there to be a problem Figure 10: SUBCAT value selection The user has two broad options: to reject a set of frames and associated surface form outright or to edit either the surface form or definition associated with a set of frames.",
        "Exercising the first option causes all instances of the surface form and associated syntactic frames to be removed from the screen and from further consideration by the user.",
        "However, this action has no effect on the eventual output of the system, so these morphologically productive but non-existent forms and definitions will still be implicit in the lexicon and morphology component of the English analyser.",
        "It is assumed that this overgeneration is harmless though, because such forms will not occur in actual input.",
        "Editing a surface form or associated definition results in a new (non-productive) entry which will form part of the system's output to be included as an independent irregular entry in the target lexicon.",
        "If the user edits a surface form, the edited version is substituted in all the relevant syntactic frames.",
        "Provided the user is satisfied with the modified frames, a new entry is created with the new surface form, treated as an indivisible morpheme, and paired with the existing definition.",
        "Similarly, if the user edits a definition associated with a set of syntactic frames, a new set of frames will be constructed and if he or she is happy with these, a new entry will be created with existing surface form and modified definition.",
        "(The English analyser can be run in a mode where non-productive separate entries are `preferred' to productive ones.)",
        "The user can modify both the surface form and the associated definition during one interaction with a particular potential entry; for example, the definition for \"believal\" contains both an incorrect surface form and definition for a nominal form of the base form \"believe\".",
        "After the associated syntactic frames are displayed to the user, instead of rejecting the entire entry at this point, he or she can modify the surface form to create a new entry for 'belief\" a process which results in the revised syntactic frames: The beiieval The believal that someone is something The believal someone to be something The belief The belief that someone is something The belief someone to be something",
        "The user now has three options; rejecting the third syntactic frame, or alternatively deleting the associated sub-entry with a ESUBCAT ORI feature definition, followed by confirmation will result in the construction of a new entry for the lexicon.",
        "The third option, should the user decide that nominal forms never take OR complements, is to edit the morphological rules themselves.",
        "This option is more radical and would presumably only be exercised when the user was certain about the linguistic data.",
        "The system described so far allows the semi-automatic, computer-aided production of base entries and irregular, non-productive derived entries on the basis of selection and editing of candidate surface forms and definitions thrown up by the derivational generator.",
        "However, this approach is only as good as the initial base entry constructed from LDOCE.",
        "If the base entry is inadequate, the predictions produced by the generator are likely to be inadequate too.",
        "This will result in too much editing for the system to be much help in the rapid production of a sizeable lexicon.",
        "Fortunately, the system of syntactic frames and editing facilities outlined above can also be used to refine base entries and make up for inadequacies in the LDOCE grammar code system (from the perspective of the target grammar).",
        "For, example, LDOCE encodes transitivity adequately but does not represent systematically whether a particular transitive has a passive form.",
        "In the target grammar, there are two SUBCAT values NP and NOPASS which distinguish these types of verb.",
        "Therefore, all verbs with a transitive LDOCE code are inserted into the two sets of syntactic frames shown below.",
        "When these frames are instantiated with particular verbs rejection of one or other is enough to refine the LDOCE code to the appropriate SUBCAT value.",
        "For example, the instantiated frames for 'cost' are:",
        "The fact that 'cost\" does not fit into the NP passive (second) frame, behaving in a way compatible with the NOPASS predictions, means it acquires a NOPASS SUBCAT value.",
        "Since these frames will be displayed first and the operation changes the base entry, subsequent forms and definitions generated by the system will be based on the new edited base entry.",
        "This example, also highlights one of the inherent problems in our approach to lexicon development.",
        "Syntactic frames are used in preference to direct perusal of definitions in terms of feature lists to speed up lexicon development by tapping the user's grammaticality judgements directly and to reduce the amount of editing and keyboard input.",
        "They also provide the user with a degree of insulation from the technical details of the morphological and syntactic formalism.",
        "However, semantically 'bleached' frames can lead to confusion when they interact with word sense ambiguity.",
        "For example, 'weigh* has two senses one of which allows passive and one of which does not (compare The baby was weighed by the doctor with * Ten pounds was weighed by the baby).",
        "Unfortunately, the syntactic frames given for NP / NOPASS are not 'bleached' enough because they tend to select the sense of 'weigh* which does allow passive.",
        "The example raises wider issues about the integration of some treatment of word meaning with the production of such a lexicon.",
        "These issues go beyond this paper, but the problem illustrated demonstrates that the type of techniques we have described are heuristic aids rather than failsafe procedures for the rapid construction of a sizeable and accurate lexicon from a machine-readable dictionary of variable accuracy and consistency."

        "Practical natural language applications require vocabularies substantially larger than those typically developed for theoretical or demonstration purposes and hand crafting these is often not feasible, and certainly never desirable.",
        "The evaluation of the LDOCE grammar coding system suggests that it is sufficiently detailed and accurate (for verbs) to make the on-line production of the syntactic component of lexical entries both viable and labour saving.",
        "However, the less than 100% accuracy of the code assignments in the source dictionary suggests that a system using the machine readable version for lexicon development must embody a methodology allowing rapid, interactive and semiautomatic generation and testing of lexical entries on a large scale.",
        "We have outlined a lexicon development environment, which embodies a practical approach to using an existing MRD for the construction of a substantial computerised lexicon.",
        "The system splits the derivation of target lexical entries into two phases; an automatic transformation of the source data into a formalised lexical template containing as much relevant information as can be derived (directly or indirectly), followed by semi-automatic correction and refinement of this template into a set of base and irregular target entries."
