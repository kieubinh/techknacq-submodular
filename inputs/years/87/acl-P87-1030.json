        "What constitutes a good response?",
        "There is general agreement that a correct, direct response to a question may, under certain circumstances, be inadequate.",
        "Previous work has emphasized that a good response should be formulated in light of the user's immediate goals and plans as inferred from the utterance (or discourse segment).",
        "Thus, a good response may also have to (i) assure the user that his underlying goal was considered in arriving at the response (McKeown, Wish, and Matthews 1985); (ii) answer a query that results from an inappropriate plan indirectly by responding to the underlying goal of the query (Pollack 1986); (iii) provide additional information aimed at preventing the user from drawing false conclusions because of violated expectations of how an expert would respond (Joshi, Webber, and Weischedel 1984a, 1984b).",
        "The claim of this paper is that a cooperative response can (and should) also address a user's overall goals, plans, and preferences among those goals and plans.",
        "We wish to show that an advice seeker may also expect the expert to respond in light of, not only the immediate goals and plans of the user as expressed in a query, but also in light of (i) previously expressed goals or preferences, (ii) goals that may be inferred or known from the user's background, and (iii) domain goals the user may be expected to hold.",
        "If the expert's response does not consider these latter type of goals the result may mislead or confuse the user and, at the least, will not be cooperative.",
        "As one example, consider the following exchange between a student and student-advisor system.",
        "The user hopes to enroll in a particular course to help fulfill his elective requirements.",
        "But imagine that in the past the student has told the advisor, that he has strong feelings about not using FORTRAN as a programming language.",
        "If the student-advisor gives the simple response of \"Yes\" and the student subsequently enrolls in the course and finds out that it involves heavy doses of FORTRAN programming, the student will probably have justifiably bad feelings about the student-advisor.",
        "The better response shown takes into account what is known about the user's preferences.",
        "Thus the system must check if the user's plan as expressed in his query is compatible with previously expressed goals of the user.",
        "The system can be additionally cooperative by offering alternatives that are compatible with the user's preferences and also help towards the user's intended goal of choosing an elective (see response).",
        "Our work should be seen as an extension of the approach of Joshi, Webber, and Weischedel (1984a, 1984b; hereafter referred to as Joshi).",
        "Joshi's approach, however, involves only the stated and intended (or underlying) goal of the query, which, as the above example illustrates, can be inadequate for avoiding misleading responses.",
        "Further, a major claim of Joshi is that a system must recognize when a user's plan (as expressed in a query) is suboptimal and provide a better alternative.",
        "However, Joshi leaves unspecified how this could be done.",
        "We present an algorithm that produces good responses by abstractly reasoning about the overall goals and plans hypothesized of a user.",
        "An explicit model of the user is maintained to track the goals, plans, and preferences of the user and also to record some of the background of the user pertinent to the domain.",
        "Together these provide a more general, extended method of computing non-misleading",
        "responses.",
        "Along with new cases where a response must be modified to not be misleading, we show how the cases enumerated in (Joshi 1984a) can be effectively computed given the model of the user.",
        "We also show how the user model allows us to compare alternatives and select the better one, all with regards to a specific user, and how the algorithm allows the responses to be computed in a domain independent manner.",
        "In summary, computing a response requires, among other things, the ability to provide a correct, direct answer to a query; explain the failure of a query; compute better alternatives to a user's plan as expressed in a query; and recognize when a direct response should be modified and make the appropriate modification."

        "The model of a user contains, in addition to the user's immediate discourse goals, his background, higher domain goals, and plans specifying how the higher domain goals will be accomplished.",
        "In the student-advisor domain, for example, the user model will initially contain some default goals that the user can be expected to hold, such as avoiding failing marks on his permanent record.",
        "It will also contain those goals of the user that can be inferred or known from the system's knowledge of the user's background, such as the attainment of a degree: New goals and plans will be added to the model (e.g. the student's preferences or intentions) as they are derived from the discourse.",
        "For example, if the user displays or mentions a predilection for numerical analysis courses this would be installed in the user model as a goal to be achieved."

        "Explanations and predictions of people's choices in everyday life are often founded on the assumption of human rationality.",
        "Allen's (1983) work in recognizing intentions from natural language utterances makes the assumption that \"people are rational agents who are capable of forming and executing plans to achieve their goals\" (see also Cohen and Levesque 1985).",
        "Our algorithm reasons about the user's goals and plans according to some postulated guiding principles of action to which a reasonable agent will try to adhere in deciding between competing goals and methods for achieving those goals.",
        "If the user does not \"live up\" to these principles, the response generated by the algorithm will include how the principles are violated and also some alternatives that are better (if they exist) because they do not violate the principles.",
        "Some of these principles will be made explicit in the following description of the algorithm (see van Beek 1986 for a more complete description).",
        "The algorithm begins by checking whether the user's query (e.g. \"Can I enroll in CS 3757\") is possible or not possible (refer to figure 1).",
        "If the query is not possible, the user is informed and the explanation includes the reasons for the failure (step 1.0 of algorithm).",
        "Alternative plans that are possible and help achieve the user's intended goal are searched for and presented to the user.",
        "But before presenting any alternative, the algorithm, to not mislead the user, ensures that the alternative is compatible with the higher domain goals of the user (step 1.1).",
        "If the query is possible, control passes to step 2.0, where the next step is to determine whether the stated goal does, as the user believes, help achieve the intended goal.",
        "Given that the user presents a plan that he believes will accomplish his intended goals, the system must check if the plan succeeds in its intentions (step 2.1 of algorithm).",
        "As is shown in the algorithm, if the relationship does not hold or the plan is not executable, the user should be informed.",
        "Here it is possible to provide additional unrequested information necessary to achieve the goal (cf. Allen 1983).",
        "In planning a response, the system should ensure that the current goals, as expressed in the user's queries, are compatible with the user's higher domain goals (step 2.2 in algorithm).",
        "For example, a plan that leads to the attainment of one goal may cause the non-attainment of another such as when a previously formed plan becomes invalid or a subgoal becomes impossible to achieve.",
        "A user may expect to be informed of such consequences, particularly if the goal that cannot now be attained is a goal the user values highly.",
        "The system can be additionally cooperative by suggesting better alternatives if they exist (step 2.3 in algorithm).",
        "Furthermore, both the definitions of better and possible alternatives are relative to a particular user.",
        "In particular, if a user has several compatible goals, he should adopt the plan that will contribute to the greatest number of his goals.",
        "As well, those goals that arc valued absolutely higher than other goals, are the goals to be achieved.",
        "A user should seek plans of action that will satisfy those goals, and plans to satisfy his other goals should be adopted only if they are compatible with the satisfaction of those goals he values most highly."

        "In the hypothetical situation shown in figure 2, the stated goal of enrolling in CS572 is possible and the intended goal of taking a numerical analysis course is satisfiedl.",
        "The system then considers the background of the user (e.g. the courses taken), the background of the domain (e.g. what courses are offered) and a query from the user (e.g. \"Can I enroll in CS572?\"), and ensures that the goal of the query is compatible with the attainment of the overall domain goal.",

        "The system considers alternative plans to achieve the user's intended goal that are compatible with the domain goal.",
        "For this particular example, the system discovers other courses the user can add that will help achieve the higher goal.",
        "To actually generate better alternatives and to check whether the user's stated goal is compatible with the user's domain goal, a module of the implemented system is a Horn clause theorem prover, built on top of Waterloo Unix Prolog, with the feature that it records a history of the deduction.",
        "The theorem prover generates possible alternative plans by performing deduction on the goal at the level of the user's query.",

        "The second clause is similar.",
