        "Connectionist models inherently include features and exhibit behaviors which are difficult to achieve with traditional logic-based models.",
        "Among the more important of such characteristics are 1) the ability to compute nearest match rather than requiring unification or exact match; 2) learning; 3) fault tolerance through the integration of overlapping modules, each of which may be incomplete or fallible, and 4) the possibility of scaling up such systems by many orders of magnitude, to operate more rapidly or to handle much larger problems, or both.",
        "However, it is unlikely that connectionist models will be able to learn all of language from experience, because it is unlikely that a full cognitive system could be built via learning from an initially random network; any successful large-scale connectionist learning system will have to be to some degree \"genetically\" prewired."

        "For most of its history, the heuristic search, logic, and \"physical symbol system\" [19] paradigms have dominated AI.",
        "AI was conceived at about the same time that protocol analysis was in vogue in psychology [16]; such protocols could be implemented on the then-new von Neumann machines fairly well.",
        "Protocol analysis suggested that people operate by trial and error, using word-like objects as primitive units.",
        "AI has stuck almost exclusively with heuristic search and symbol systems, using them in a wide variety of natural language processing models and programming languages, ranging from ATN's, most other natural language parsing systems, and planning based models (e.g. for pragmatics) to Prolog and Planner [9].",
        "Meanwhile, it seems highly implausible that anything resembling heuristic search is used much below the level of consciousness; certainly no one would believe that a neuron executes heuristic search.",
        "The small amount of evidence marshalled to support the hypothesis of subconscious search [15] could be explained in many other ways.",
        "Such models as Marcus' deterministic parser [29] have attempted to move away from heuristic search, yet were cast largely in heuristic search terms I.",
        "1 One problem that Marcus' parser was attempting to solve was the mismatch between psychological data and heuristic search models; garden path sentences were an exception, where backtracking seems an appropriate model.",
        "Even there, it seems that to understand garden path sentences, people generally back up and completely reprocess sentences, using a \"trace\" stored in a sort of audio buffer [26].",
        "Connectionist systems have stirred a great deal of excitement for a number of reasons: 1) They're novel.",
        "Con-nectionism seems to be a good candidate for a major new paradigm in a field where there have only been a handful of paradigms (heuristic search; constraint propagation; blackboard systems; marker passing).",
        "2) They have cognitive science potential.",
        "While connectionist neural nets are not necessarily analogous to neurons, they do seem brain-like and capable of modeling a substantial range of cognitive phenomena.",
        "3) Connectionist systems exhibit non-trivial learning; they are able to self-organize, given only examples as inputs.",
        "4) Connectionist systems can be made fault-tolerant and error-correcting, degrading gracefully for cases not encountered previously [37].",
        "5) Appropriate and scalable connectionist hardware is rapidly becoming available.",
        "This is important, both for actually testing models, and because the kinds of brain and cognitive models that we build are very heavily dependent on available and imaginable hardware [23] [1]; and 6) Connectionist architectures also scale well, in that modules can be interconnected rather easily.",
        "This is because messages passed between modules are activation levels, not symbolic messages.",
        "Nonetheless, there are considerable difficulties still ahead for connectionist models.",
        "It is probably premature to generalize based on our experience with them to date.",
        "So far all systems built have either learned relatively small numbers of items, or they have been toy systems, hand built for some particular task.",
        "The kinds of learning shown to date are hardly general.",
        "It seems very unlikely to me that it will be possible for a single, large, randomly wired module to learn everything.",
        "If we want to build a system out of many modules, we must devise an architecture for the system with input and output specifications for modules and/or a plan for interconnecting the internal nodes of different modules.",
        "Finally, connectionist models cannot yet argue that they offer a superset of traditional AI operations: certain operations such as variable binding cannot yet be performed efficiently in connectionist networks."

        "Rule systems can be constructed to handle such cases, but at the expense of requiring arbitrarily large numbers of rules with arbitrarily long sets of conditions.",
        "Connectionist models inherently integrate all available evidence, most pieces of which will be irrelevant or only weakly relevant for most decisions.",
        "Moreover, one does not have to find logically necessary and sufficient conditions; connections between actions and the facts of the world can be represented as statistical correlations.",

        "as nodes which compete with or support each other; the processing of a sentence then involves clamping the values of some input word nodes, and allowing the whole network to settle.",
        "For \"regular\" inputs, strong pathways, which \"collaborate\" in reinforcing each other, can give the appearance of rule-like behavior.",
        "Given similar inputs, one can expect similar outputs.",
        "Most natural language connectionist work has been rule-like in this sense [37] [31 [33] [31].",
        "2) The appearance of rule-based behavior can also result from learned connectionist networks or associative memory models.",
        "If a system can find the activation pattern or memory which is closest to a given current event or situation, it can exhibit highly regular behavior.",
        "Such systems degrade gracefully.",

        "In a modular connectionist model, input information can be fed to syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic modules directly.",

        "This suggests to me that a large portion of a learning system must be wired initially, probably into fairly large internally regular modules, which are subject only to rudimentary learning via parameter adjustment.",
