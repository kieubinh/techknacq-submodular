        "Designing an anaphora resolution system is difficult because there exists no single, coherent theory upon which to build, even if we restrict our attention to pronominal anaphora (which we will do throughout this paper).",
        "There do, however, exist many partial theories,1 each of which accounts for a subset of the phenomena that influence the use and interpretation of 1All existing theories are partial in the added sense of being fallible.",
        "That is, even when restricted to a narrow subdomain of the facts of anaphoric behavior, no account fully explains coreference possibilities that arise in context.",
        "pronominal anaphora.",
        "These partial theories range from purely syntactic ones (for example the simple rules of number and gender agreement) to highly semantic and pragmatic ones that account for focusing phenomena.",
        "If there were a single, complete theory, then it might be appropriate to implement it.",
        "If there were no theories at all, then an ad hoc implementation might be the only alternative.",
        "But because there are partial theories but not a complete one, we have designed an architecture patterned after the idea of a blackboard system (Erman, 1981)) that allows for a loosely coupled set of modules, each of which handles a subset of discourse phenomena by implementing a specific partial theory.",
        "These modules communicate by proposing candidate antecedents and by evaluating each other's proposals.",
        "An oversight module, called the handler, mediates these communications and resolves conflicts among the modules.",
        "All the modules in this system share a common representation of the current discourse.",
        "This representation is called the core discourse structure.",
        "It includes a list of the discourse referents that have so far been introduced.",
        "Associated with each such referent is a set of assertions, including syntactic facts about the use of the referent (e.g., its number and gender and whether or not it is reflexive), semantic facts (such as the ones shown in Figure 1), and anaphoric usage facts such as coextension relations.",
        "A schematic view of the architecture is shown in Figure 2.",
        "Each of the ovals in the figure represents an implementation of one of the partial theories of anaphora.",
        "Each of these implementations is called a constraint source (CS), because each of them is viewed as imposing a set of constraints on the choice of an antecedent for a pronominal referent."

      "text": [
        "Each constraint source in this system is composed of a set of four functions (although any of these functions may be a no-op in any particular CS).",
        "These component functions are called at different times during the process of anaphor resolution, but they form a logical unit since they share knowledge structures that correspond to the particular partial theory that is implemented by the CS to which they belong.",
        "The four functions are the following:",
        "• Modeller - This function maintains the CS's local model of the ongoing discourse.",
        "Not all CS's need such a model.",
        "Simple syntactic ones like number agreement typically do not build a local model since all the information they need is available in the core discourse structure and in the anaphoric referent being resolved.",
        "But CS's that describe more global phenomena, such as rhetorical structure, may need access to information that is neither local to a particular referent nor contained in the core discourse structure.",
        "If a local model is built, it is built to rest on top of the shared core discourse structure.",
        "The content of the local model is accessible to the other functions of the same CS but not to anyone else.",
        "• Constraint poster - This function posts con",
        "straints that describe interactions among anaphora within a sentence.",
        "These constraints are then treated in exactly the same way as are semantic assertions about the referents.",
        "The algorithm for resolving anaphora (which will be described below) applies to a single anaphoric referent at a time.",
        "But, in some sentences, there are interactions among referents that make it impossible to treat them completely separately.",
        "By posting interaction constraints before processing individual anaphoric referents, we maintain the ability to treat the referents separately, but also to guarantee that the complete interpretation for the sentence in which they occur will be consistent.",
        "As an example of this phenomenon, consider the sentence, \"He saw him.\" Disjoint reference could post a constraint that he and him cannot co-refer before any attempt is made to find the antecedent for either of them.",
        "Most simple constraint sources do nothing when their constraint posters are called.",
        "• Proposer - This function takes as input an anaphoric referent and returns as its output a list of candidate antecedents, each with an associated score (which will be described later).",
        "For example, recency proposes all referents in the two most recent previous sentences, as well as any in the current sentence that occur to the left of the referent that is being resolved.",
        "Some CS's, such as number agreement, never propose candidates.",
        "• Evaluator - This function takes as input an anaphor and a candidate antecedent for that anaphor.",
        "The evaluator returns a score indicating strength of support for that candidate as antecedent to the anaphor.",
        "The returned score is based solely on the information available to the CS that is doing the evaluation.",
        "It is left to the handler, which invokes the various CS's, to combine scores from different evaluators and to resolve conflicts.",
        "Although every CS must be able to respond whenever its evaluator is called, there is a score that will be interpreted to mean, \"I have no opinion.\" (See below.)"

        "Also, the efficiency with which they reach a conclusion depends on the order in which the CS's are invoked.",
        "In Lucy, the recency constraint source is invoked first.",

        "If there is exactly one candidate with the highest rating and if the difference between that rating and the second highest rating exceeds the threshold 5 (a system parameter currently set at 0.5), then a coreference assertion can be made.3 If one candidate is not clearly best, however, two actions are possible.",
        "One IS to do nothing (i.e., post no coreference constraint) and thus essentially to produce a partial interpretation of the input sentence.",
        "This may be acceptable, depending on the use to which the sentence's interpretation is to be put.",
        "For example, it may be possible to wait until subsequent sentences are processed to see if they yield the disambiguating information.",
        "If waiting is unacceptable, however, the other available action is to query the user who input the sentence.",
        "This option is available since Lucy is being designed to serve as an interactive English front end system; if this same approach were to be used during text comprehension, some alternative, such as choose a candidate and be prepared to back up if necessary, would be required instead."

        "Thus the design of the scoring procedure has an important effect on the outcome of the resolution process.",
        "Our first implementation of this procedure exploited a single score, a number in the range 5 to +5.",
        "Each CS gave each candidate a score and the handler averaged the individual scores to form a composite score.",
        "The major drawback of this simple scheme is that there is no way for a CS to say, \"I have no opinion,\" since any score it gives necessarily changes the composite score.",
        "There is also no way to say, \"I have an opinion and here it is, (and I m very)/(but I'm not at all) confident of it.\" As a result, the system was highly unstable.",
        "It could be tuned to perform fairly well,",
        "but whenever a new CS was added or if a CS was changed even slightly, the whole system had to be retuned.",
        "To remedy these problems, we now use a scoring procedure in which each CS provides both a score and a confidence measure.",
        "The score is a number in the range 5 to +5, the confidence a number in the range 0 to 1.",
        "The function that combines a set of n (score, confidence) pairs is",

        "Any CS that wishes to assert no opinion can now do so by giving a confidence of 0 to its opinion, which wilt then have no effect on a candidate's running score.",
        "Although, in principle, a constraint source may function both as a proposer and as an evaluator and it may assign any (score, confidence) value it likes to a candidate, it turns out that the CS's that have been implemented so far are much more limited in their behavior.",
        "Most CS's either propose or evaluate, but not both.",
        "And there are patterns of (score, confidence) values that appear to be particularly useful.",
        "Each CS that has been implemented so far falls into one of the following four classes: • Finite set generators (such as disjoint reference when applied to a reflexive pronoun) are constraint sources that propose a fixed set of candidates.",
        "They assign all such candidates the same score and that score is a function of the number of competing candidates: # of candidates (score, confidence) contribution to propose of this CS",
        "These CS's never evaluate (i.e., when asked to do so, they return a confidence of 0.)",
        "• Fading infinite set generators (such as recency) are constraint sources that at could keep proposing, perhaps indefinitely, but with lower and lower scores.",
        "Recency, for example, uses the following scoring: Sentence (score, confidence) contribution of this CS n (current) (1, 0.5) = 2 n-1 (2, 0.5) = 1 n-2 (0, 0.5) = 0 These CS's never evaluate.",
        "• Filters (such as number and gender agreement) are constraint sources that never propose candidates.",
        "They serve only to filter out candidates that fail to meet specific re",
        "quirements (usually syntactic).",
        "Filters use the following two assignments when they evaluate candidates: (score, confidence) contribution of this CS pass (04, 0) = 0 fail (-5, 0.9) = 5 These scores have the following effects:",
        "• pass - Since the confidence level is 0, the score does not matter and no change will be made to the composite score as a result of the evaluator being called.",
        "Thus a candidate's score is insensitive to the number of filter CS's that it passes.",
        "• fail - The low score with high confidence forces the composite score to drop below the minimum threshold eliminating this candidate from future consideration.",
        "• Preferences (such as semantic content consistency) are constraint sources that im",
        "pose preferences, rather than absolute opinions, on a set of candidates rating each member relative to others in the set.",
        "These constraint sources may use the full range of (score, confidence) values.",
