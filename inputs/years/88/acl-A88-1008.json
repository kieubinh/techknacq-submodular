        "This paper describes a program for handling \"scope ambiguities\" in individual English sentences.",
        "The program operates on initial logical translations, generated by a parser/translator, in which \"unscoped elements\" such as quantifiers, coordinators and negation are left in place to be extracted and positioned by the scoping program.",
        "The program produces the set of valid scoped readings, omitting logically redundant readings, and places the readings in an approximate order of preference using a set of domain-independent heuristics.",
        "The heuristics are based on information about the lexical type of each operator and on \"structural relations\" between pairs of operators.",
        "The need for such domain-independent heuristics is emphasized; in some cases they can be decisive and in general they will serve as a guide to the use of further heuristics based on domain-specific knowledge and on the context of discourse.",
        "The emphasis of this paper is on discussing several of the more problematic aspects of the scoping protocol which were encountered during the design of the scoping program."

        "Natural languages contain a variety of \"logical operators\" which interact with each other to give rise to different types of ambiguity.",
        "The logical operators recognized by the scoping program include quantifiers, coordinators and negation, which are initially \"unscoped\" and must therefore be moved into position by the program, and adverbs, predicates and connectives (such as if-then).",
        "At the moment, other operators such as tense, aspect and modals are left in place and therefore assume innermost scope.",
        "There is some evidence that the handling of the scoping of quantifiers relative to such operators may require special treatment (cg.",
        "Fodor 1970; Enc 1981; Saarincn 1983).",
        "Three simple examples will illustrate some different types of scope ambiguity and their representation in an informal first order predicate logic, using restrictions on quantifiers and an infix notation for sentential formulas.",
        "The meanings of the different interpretations should be clear.",
        "For example, (4) may mean that John didn't meet either Jane or Mary (5) or that he didn't meet at least one of them (6).",
        "Further examples are given in Hurum & Schubert (1986) and Hurum (1987).",
        "Some alternative proposals for representing scope ambiguities are also discussed in the latter.",

        "Until quite recently, designers of natural language understanding systems have given little attention to the problem of dealing with scope ambiguities.",
        "Two of the earliest attempts to incorporate quantifier scoping into natural language understanding systems in an integral way are described in Woods (1978) and Dahl (1979).",
        "Some more recent scoping algorithms are presented in McCord (1981), Warren & Pereira (1982), Hobbs (1983), Saint-Dizier (1985) and Hobbs & Shieber (1987).",
        "While each of these algorithms introduces some new features, certain problems, such as the scoping of coordinators and the use of heuristics to select preferred readings, have generally been given little or no treatment.",
        "Some of the main features of the algorithm being discussed here are: (a) it handles ambiguities created by quantifiers, coordinators, negation and adverbs,' (b) it works bottom-up and left-to-right and generates the set of valid scoped readings in one pass, (c) it removes logically redundant readings as they are encountered during the process of scoping and (d) it uses domain-independent heuristics, during the scoping, to arrange the readings in an approximate order of preference."

        "This paper has described some features of a program designed to handle scope ambiguities in English.",
        "Some of the more problematic issues which were encountered during the designing of the program were selected for discussion: the choice of logical representation, the scoping of coordinated expressions, the choice of a strategy for selecting preferred scope orderings and the determination of a set of domain-independent heuristics.",
        "The program is currently being extended to include a wider range of lexical types and input expressions and the heuristics are being improved.",
        "Following this, it is hoped to incorporate some simple types of domain-and discourse-dependent knowledge into the program, in particular knowledge about expected relations among objects in a given domain and a simple discourse focus structure.",
        "The selection of preferred scope orderings depends on the complex interaction of linguistic and context-dependent knowldege.",
        "It would be a considerable advantage to be able to factor out the contributions of different types of knowledge required and then at some later time to combine them.",
        "One conclusion of this work is that there is a body of largely domain-independent knowledge which can play an important, and at times decisive, role in the disambiguation of scope.",
        "Such knowledge is most useful when it indicates a very strong or absolute preference for one reading.",
        "Absolute preferences typically occur with operators such as any or both and with distributive quantifiers or and inside strong clausal trap or inside a coordinator.",
        "Very strong preferences may occur with operators such as few, no or each, with preposed or topicalized operators and with operators inside prepositional phrases.",
        "When the domain-independent heuristics do not provide a strong preference for one reading, they may still serve as a useful guide guide for the later application of pragmatic knowledge.",
        "This is commonly the case when indefinites are present, as the \"specificity\" of indefinites is mainly context-dependent.",
        "A number of problems have not been discussed here because they remain unresolved.",
        "These include: the scoping of quantifiers relative to tense and opaque operators, the logical representation and scoping of generics, the treatment of pronouns not embedded within their quantifier antecedents, non-local problems such as the preference for \"symmetric\" readings, the use of stray words, such as together and both (as an adverb), which provide important clues for preferred scope relations and the difficult problem of combining linguistic and context-dependent heuristic knowledge."
