Watson Research Center has defined a lexical data base representation (LDB) for lexical information, a set of tools and grammars for converting machine readable dictionary (MRD) typesetting tapes to the LDB representation, and a Lexical Query Language (LQL) for specifying storage and retrieval operations on LDBs.",
        "This paper briefly discusses the LDB structure, the tools and grammar for creating LDBs from existing sources, and then describes the facilities and implementation of LQL.",

        "Dictionary entries are typically organized as shallow hierarchies of information with a variable number of instances of certain items at each level, e.g. multiple homographs within an entry or multiple senses within a homograph.",
        "More formally, they can be characterized as finite depth hierarchies of attribute-value pairs with a variable number of instances of specific nodes at each level.",
        "At at each node there is an attribute name and a value, which can be a simple value, a list of attribute-value pairs, or an entire subtree.",
        "A node may have an arbitrary number of daughter nodes of the same attribute type, just as a dictionary entry can have an arbitrary number of senses per homograph, for example.",
        "Thus, in the entry for quack from the Collins English-Italian dictionary, shown in Figure 1, the ''entry\" node has two \"superhom\" (superscript homograph) nodes as daughters; the first of these, in turn, dominates two \"homograph\" nodes, one for a noun and the other for an intransitive verb.",
        "Lexicographers are familiar with the notion of hierarchically structured entries of this type.",
        "It is important to distinguish between the type of hierarchies found in dictionary entries and those, for example, that characterize the syntactic structure of English sentences.",
        "Both types of hierarchy are, in principle, of un",
        "bounded size.",
        "Dictionary entries achieve their unboundedness by iteration: a dictionary entry may have any number of homographs, which may, in turn, have an arbitrary number of senses, and so forth.",
        "Syntax trees achieve their unboundedness both by iteration (e.g., coordination) and by recursion (e.g., self-embedding).",
        "In fact, while the nodes of a dictionary entry hierarchy may only iterate, the data values contained in the tree may have their own--possibly recursive--structures.",
        "This is the case for definition text in monolingual dictionaries, or for etymologies (as was pointed out by Martin Chodorow).",
        "The observation that dictionary entry hierarchies may only iterate is useful for defining lexical data bases.",
        "All entries in an LDB can be characterized by a \"design\" or \"template\" which is stored once for that data base.",
        "The design is a single hierarchy which serves as a grammar for any instance of an entry by naming the possible parents, siblings, and children of each node type that may occur.",
        "Figure 2 shows a simplified design for an LDB containing the Collins English-Italian bilingual dictionary.",
        "Comments are given to describe the lexicographic functions of the various nodes.",
        "The entry for quack shown in Figure 1 is an instance of the design shown in Figure 2.",
        "Different dictionaries may have different structures and hence different designs.",
        "The notion of representing dictionary entries as instances of a hierarchical design derived from a grammar is not unique to our work; Gonnet and Tompa (1987) use the same notion when they create hierarchical \"p-strings\" over the strings that they analyze with their grammatical formalism.",
        "Actual LDBs are created by storing hierarchically formatted entries in a direct access file with the design stored as control information (the creation of these formatted entries is the subject of the next section).",
        "The files are managed by the Dictionary Access Method (DAM), described in Byrd (1986) and Byrd, et al.(1986b).",
        "Each entry is stored with its headword as the key.",
        "Alternate access paths can be established by building indexes on attributes other than the headword.",
        "It may be useful to point out reasons for not using traditional data base mechanisms for storing and accessing LDBs.",
        "We believe that lexical data bases cannot be correctly viewed as relational data bases.",
        "Within the taxonomy of \"normal forms\" defined by relational data base theory, dictionary entries are \"unnormalized re-lations\" in which attributes can contain other relations, rather than simple scalar values.",
        "As a result, no efficient data base tools or attractive languages have been developed for accessing unnormalized relations.",
        "In order to use existing relational tools to store and access dictionary entries, we should first recast the entries into one of the normal forms defined by the theory.",
        "This could be achieved by defining relations over sets of siblings in our LDB designs, creating or selecting unique key attributes among those siblings, and performing join operations on those attributes.",
        "However, to do so would force us to sacrifice the intuitive advantage that hierarchically organized dictionary entries offer.",
        "We have therefore chosen not to.",
        "Similarly, traditional hierarchical data bases do not provide an appropriate model for lexical data.",
        "In those systems, as typified by IBM's IMS (Date (1986)), hierarchical relationships are represented among separate entities which are stored as \"segments\".",
        "This metaphor of separate entities does not apply to lexical data.",
        "There is no sense, for example, in which a translation in the Collins English-Italian dictionary is a separate entity to be related to other entities.",
        "Rather, each lexical entry is itself a complex entity",
        "with a hierarchical relationship among its internal components.",

        "From typesetting tape to data base.",
        "Among the resources available for making lexical data bases, we have typesetting tapes of Webster's Seventh, Longman's Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE), several Collins bilingual dictionaries, and two synonym dictionaries.",
        "Creation of lexical data bases began from a number of direct access b-tree (DAM) files which had been created from the tapes for the WordSmith on-line dictionary reference system (Neff and Byrd(1987)).",
        "These files, keyed on headword and containing the otherwise unnormalized body of the entry, complete with original font codes, were the result of a by-entry segmentation program, an idiosyncratic process reflecting the diverse origin and formatting conventions of the source dictionaries.",
        "To meet the requirements of computerized random access, some entries (e.g., those with superscripted homograph numbers) were combined into one entry; words with alternate spellings (such as \"whisk(e)y\") became multiple entries with cross references; still others (compound entries from the German-English bilingual dictionary) were broken up so that each compound word listed could be accessed by its own key.",
        "The dictionary entry parser.",
        "The hierarchical structure of a dictionary entry is implicit in its syntax.",
        "Major signposts are the homograph numbers, the sense numbers, and the consistent alternation of fonts; also useful are punctuation, position of swung dashes (indicating repetition of the head word in a collocation or example), and membership of an item in a closed set (part of speech, for example).",
        "By way of illustration, we reproduce here for the entry quack both the raw version from the tape of the Collins English-Italian dictionary and the formatted entry as it appears in the printed dictionary.",

        "the level of sophistication required of an entry parser is not as high as that required for a sentence parser.",
        "Nevertheless, two technologies for sentence parsers were readily available to us: a bottom-up, all-paths strategy offered by PLNLP (Langendoen and Barnett(1986)), and a top-down depth-first approach offered by logic grammars in Prolog (McCord(1986)).",
        "Using either would significantly reduce the effort required to parse our more than a dozen dictionaries, because each new dictionary would only require a new grammar.",
        "Preliminary versions in PLNLP and Prolog were both adequate and contribute nothing to the theoretical issues surrounding parsing strategies.",
        "The choice of Prolog for continued development was largely due to the somewhat deterministic nature of parsing dictionary entries vis-a-vis the extravagance of the bottom-up, all-paths strategy.",
        "Nevertheless, we are studying the possibility of implementing a partial bottom-up strategy analogous to parse-fitting (cf. Jensen, et al.",
        "(1983)) when it becomes necessary to process input with missing or corrupt font codes, there being few recovery strategies available to a top-down parser.",
        "Grammars for entries and grammars for sentences differ in three important ways: (1) entries can be huge: some are longer than 5000 bytes; (2) tokens, the smallest unit handled by the grammar are larger and defined differently; and (3) a dictionary grammar does not have to produce recursive structures, so can be to a large extent deterministic.",
        "A consequence of (1) is that it takes a large amount of storage to parse an entry.",
        "To process extremely long entries, we use an 8-megabyte virtual machine under VM/CMS.",
        "The motivation for (2) comes from the fact that the entries consist of text interspersed with font codes, which are not required to be delimited with blanks.",
        "The token string for an entry is therefore usually an alternating string of font codes and characters, with some semicolons or periods also defined as tokens.",
        "The grammar is a formal description of the structure of entries for a particular dictionary; its formalism is a modification and extension of McCord's (1986) modular logic grammar (MLG), which is in turn derived from the definite clause grammar (DCG) of Pereira and Warren (1980).",
        "We illustrate with some sample rules from the grammar of the Collins English-German dictionary.",

        "Rule (1) says that the body of an entry consists of optional prehomograph material (prehom) and an optional homograph list of any type(*).",
        "A significant addition to the MLG formalism was a mechanism for treatment of large numbers of optional elements in a single rule to prevent proliferation of rules.",
        "Tests added by the compiler enforce the convention that to succeed, a rule consisting solely of optional elements must contain at least one.",
        "Rule (2) says that the body of an entry consists of an alternate spelling.",
        "This rule is an alternate to (1); normal Prolog backtracking conventions apply.",
        "Rule (3) says that the prehomograph may contain any of the following, in this order: alternate spelling, pronunciation, verb morphology, a usage note, a long form of which this is an abbreviation.",
        "Rule (4) says that a numbered homograph list consists of a numbered homograph followed optionally by a semicolon (to be discarded from the resulting structure) and a numbered homograph list.",
        "This rule illustrates the mechanism for defining multiple sister nodes of the same type by means of a recursive rule.",
        "Though it appears that each successive homograph node is one level deeper in the tree, the use of McCord's definition of some nodes as weak nonte-rminals\" ensures that nodes so defined (like homlist, and, incidentally, prehom) disappear from the final structure, thus flattening the tree and eliminating recursion.",
        "Rule (5) handles the case of a single unnumbered homograph.",
        "Leaf node rules are more numerous than those that describe higher structures, and these may contain Prolog-like tests.",
        "Unlike syntax parsers, dictionary entry parsers discard some segments (e.g. font codes) after use in parsing; the \"-\" operator, added to the original rule formalism, allows any segment to disappear from the resulting tree.",
        "(6) pos ==> -font(ital) : +Seg : $not(stconc(\"(\",*,Seg)) : opt(-sc).",
        "This rule, one of four handling part of speech segments, says that the pos segment (Seg) is preceded by an italic font code (discarded), does not begin with a left parenthesis, and is followed optionally by a semicolon (also discarded).",
        "Font code definition rules and retokenization rules are needed before parsing rules are applied.",
        "Font code definition rules are simply Prolog unit clauses, which define font codes and delimiters, as in the following simple example, where the string \">u4<\" is both a boldface font token and a delimiter.",
        "delim(\">u4<\",font(bold)).",
        "Delimiters and strings between delimiters are the tokens.",
        "After initial tokenization, retokenization rules in a formalism similar to that of the grammar rules make adjustments to the token string because of the inexact mapping of font changes to segments, as in ...>u5<(>u4<word>u5<) something ...",
        "which is tokenized as font(roman).\"(\".font(bold).\"word\".",

        "Extensions include the \"opt\" operator, the \"-II operator, and the ''+ +\" operator, which allows rules to insert tokens into the string during parsing, thus allowing for breakup and analysis of two different data items not separated by a font code.",
        "The compiler and rules are supported by a Prolog shell which offers the rule developer a variety of tools for tracing, debugging, and selecting among a large number of options, including input and output data and file formats, thus supporting both development and batch processing.",
        "Tools for analyzing failures assist in the often tedious process of combing through a long entry to determine why it failed; in particular, there is a mechanism optionally compiled into the rules which marks the rightmost frontier (RMF) reached in the parsing process.",
        "Other tools analyze the RMF environments resulting from a batch run to help the developer determine which rule modifications are required by the largest number of entries.",

        "Current work is aimed at implementing the full language (including joins, updates, and aggregate operations) and improving performance in order to make LQL attractive for use in a wide variety of applications.",
        "The first large scale applications will be a standalone query processor for use in lexicological research and an entry storage, filtering, and formatting mechanism for the WordSmith on-line dictionary system.",
        "LQL queries would be tedious and difficult to create if they had to be entered all by hand.",
        "Fortunately, the LDB design can be used to build a user interface which presents a query tree template to be filled in by the terminal user.",
        "The prototype implementation does this and provides further facilities for moving, copying, and deleting subtrees during query preparation.",
        "A new one-dimensional representation must be defined for use in storing LQL programs and to provide a mechanism for issuing LQL requests from other programming languages.",
        "Beyond dictionaries.",
        "The tools described here can be used for parsing and querying other kinds of data.",
        "The notion of creating a data base from data parsed from text (\"textdominated databases,\" cf. Gonnet and Tompa(1987)) can",
        "be applied to other collections of structured data, such as almanacs, encyclopedias, abstracts, legal documents, or bibliographies."
