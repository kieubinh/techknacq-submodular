        "The lexical correction techniques described herein appear to be promising for natural language applications in which it is necessary to curtail user interaction in resolving ambiguities.",
        "Even in a more interactive environment, the usefulness of this capability should not be ruled out.",
        "It accommodates users who lack good spelling and/or typing skills by forgiving spelling errors and by allowing considerable conservation of keystrokes through ad hoc abbreviation recognition."
