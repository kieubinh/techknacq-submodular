        "Though computer systems aiding retrieval from bibliographic or full-text databases have been available for more than two decades, it is only in recent years that many people are becoming concerned about the serious limitations of those systems regarding effectiveness in finding desired references (Blair and Maron 1985).",
        "Like others, though, we are convinced that easy-to-apply automatic methods can help solve this problem (see argument in Salton 1986).",
        "Indeed, automatic approaches seem essential since many end-users want to search without involving trained intermediaries (Ojala 1986).",
        "However, since the fundamental issue is one of mismatch between language use of document authors and inquirers, leading to uncertainties regarding whether a particular item should be retrieved (Chen and Dhar 1987), we are also convinced that computational linguistics is essential for a complete solution.",
        "Since many queries are simply sets of lexemes or phrases, and all queries can be reduced to that form, we believe that focusing on lexical and phrasal issues may be the most appropriate strategy for applying computational linguistics to information retrieval.",

        "This simplifies finding related terms, eliminating much of the lookup necessary in schemes that are superficially more logic-like.",
        "The lexicon we are forming contains three different kinds of information: lexical-semantic relations among specific word senses, axioms for lexical relations, and definitional assertions.",
        "Most of the semantic information is captured in the form of lexical relations between the sense being defined and some other word or word sense.",
        "Instances of lexical relations have a natural implementation in SNePS, with base nodes representing lexemes, word senses, and individual lexical-semantic relations and molecular nodes (non-base nodes labeled Mx for some integer x) representing propositions and rules about the base nodes.",
        "To give content to individual lexical relations, relation axioms are included for the various relations.",
        "For instance, the lexical relation CHILD has a single axiom which says that if an x is a child y, then any x is a y and any x is young.",
        "While most word sense meanings determined from definitions can be represented fully by lexical relations, occasionally some aspect of meaning will remain after full analysis of the lexical relations between this and other word senses.",

        "The SNePS representations of instances of lexical relations, the relation axioms, and assertions completing definitions are not only compatible but linked, and hence can readily be combined.",
        "In addition, because these various kinds of information all have representations as SNePS subnetworks, they are all immediately available to the inferencing package (SNIP) without conversion or instantiation.",
        "Thus in most cases the semantic representations of the different kinds of lexical information is straightforward, and has the advantage that all information is uniformly available to the inference system.",
        "There is a second inferential advantage which derives from the nature of the semantic network representation.",
        "There are two different kinds of inference available in semantic networks: rule-based inference and path-based inference.",

        "Conceptually, rule-based inference represents conscious reasoning from principles, while path-based inference represents (unconscious) reasoning by traversing associational links.",
        "The most natural implementation for path-based reasoning is hierarchical inheritance, but it can be applied more generally, for example to locate synonyms.",
        "In choosing related terms for expanding retrieval queries, it turns out that path-based",
        "reasoning is by far the more important.",
        "Path-based inference is more efficient than rule-based inference, because given a starting point it eliminates the need to search the network for unifying matches.",
        "That is, where path-based inference is possible the system does not have to look for rules which might apply; it need only traverse a very limited subgraph from a given starting point along a limited set of predefined paths.",
        "As a simple example, consider the following definitions (quoted directly from the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary of Current English; in each case, the definition given is the first sense for the first homonym; pronunciations, references and examples have been omitted).",
        "sheep n (pl unchanged) grass-eating animal kept for its flesh as food (mutton) and its wool.",
        "wool n [U] 1 soft hair of sheep, goats, and some other animals ... ram n 1 uncastrated male sheep.",
        "ewe n female sheep.",
        "lamb n 1 [C] young of the sheep From these definitions, we extract (among others) the following lexical relations: sheep TAX animal sheep TFOOD grass wool PART sheep wool PART goat wool TAX hair ram MALE sheep ewe FEMALE sheep lamb CHILD sheep A simple post-processor transforms each triple of the form x R y into a SNePS User Language command of the form \"(build arg 1 x rel R arg2 y)\", which results in creating a molecular node representing the proposition that x bears the relation R to y, yielding the network shown in Figure 1 (simplified by omitting relation axioms and the network linking nodes representing lexemes to those representing a particular word sense).",
        "Since all SNePS arcs have inverses, simple arc traversals from the node for sheep will locate such related terms as ewe, ram, lamb, wool, animal, and so on.",
        "Likewise, starting from a query containing wool, the system can rapidly find sheep, etc.",
        "A more complete network, including other definitions, would allow going down as well as up the taxonomic tree, finding e.g. \"merino\" and other sheep varieties from either sheep or wool.",
        "5.",
        "Testing with SMART and CODER Several studies have been undertaken regarding the use of lexical and semantic relations in information retrieval.",
        "Though one investigation involved use of a special system constructed at HT (Wang et al.",
        "1985), most of the other work has involved the SMART system.",
        "The first version of SMART ran on IBM mainframes; a more modern form was developed to run under the UNIX operating system (Fox 1983b).",
        "In SMART, queries and documents are represented simply as sets of terms, so a multidimensional vector space can be constructed wherein each term is associated with a different dimension in that space.",
        "Queries and documents can then be associated with points in that space, and documents can be retrieved if \"near\" to the query.",
        "But since queries are typically short, it can be valuable to expand a query with terms related to the original set (especially due to variations in naming practices like those considered in Fumas et al.",
        "1982).",
        "In our first experiment, involving a small collection of 82 documents, we found a mild improvement in system performance when all types of related terms (except antonyms) were involved in query expansion (Fox 1980).",
        "Similar benefits resulted when using a different, larger collection (Evens et al.",
        "1985).",
        "In two later studies we used SMART but worked with Boolean queries.",
        "Query expansion then involved \"ORing\" in related terms with the original ones.",
        "Once again, improvements resulted, especially when the p-norm scheme for interpreting Boolean queries was applied (Fox 1983a, 1984).",
        "In all of these studies, lexical-semantic relations were identified manually for all query terms that were expanded.",
        "In other recent work with SMART, Fox, Miller and Sridaran used the same Boolean queries, but varied the",
        "source of related words.",
        "They compared with the base case of original queries the results of the following sources for expansion: all words based on manually derived lexical-semantic relations, all words (except for antonyms) taken from the Merriam Webster Thesaurus, and all words (except those in a \"stop\" list) from the definition appearing in a dictionary for the correct word sense.",
        "All expansion schemes gave better results han the base case.",
        "While the lexical-semantic relation method seemed best overall, the dictionary results were comparable and the thesaurus approach was only slightly worse.",
        "We are convinced that much larger improvements are possible if end-users can be more directly involved in the process, so they can decide which words should be expanded, and can select which related terms to include from the lists produced from our thesaurus.",
        "Testing this hypothesis, however, requires a more flexible processing paradigm than we have employed in the past.",
        "Furthermore, we believe that inferencing using the information in the semantic network we are building can allow us to develop an effective automatic or semi-automatic scheme for \"intelligent\" query expansion.",
        "The CODER system should support these approaches.",
        "Building upon early efforts to build intelligent retrieval systems (Guida and Tasso 1983, Pollitt 1984) and learning from experiences with similar systems (Croft and Thompson 1987), we have been developing the CODER (COmposite Document Expert/effective/extended Retrieval) system (Fox and France 1987, Fox 1987) for the last three years.",
        "Though part of that effort deals with new approaches to automatic text analysis (Fox and Chen 1987), in the current context the most important aspect of CODER is that it is built as a distributed collection of \"expert\" modules (according to the models discussed in Belkin et al.",
        "1987) programmed in Prolog or C, to support flexible testing of various AI approaches to information retrieval.",
        "- Weaver and France have developed modules for handling lexical and semantic relations and a server module providing access to our version of the contents of CDEL.",
        "In the future, a module will be added to interface CODER with the SNePS semantic network so that further experiments can be undertaken."

        "Based on preliminary investigations, it appears that lexical-semantic relations can be used to give small improvements in the effectiveness of information retrieval systems.",
        "Work with Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary and the Collins Dictionary of the English Language has demonstrated that text processing and natural language parsing techniques can be used to extract and organize important data about English that will be of value for information retrieval and for a variety of natural language processing applications.",
        "Furthermore, it is clear that the SNePS semantic network system can be used to store that type of data in a form that will permit both rule and path-based inference.",
        "Future work will include further processing of dictionaries (including the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English and others from the Oxford Text Archive), merging the resulting output into a large semantic network, extending the capabilities of SNePS to handle a very large thesaurus, integrating SNePS with the SMART and CODER systems, and further testing of the utility of that thesaurus to support interactive information retrieval sessions."
