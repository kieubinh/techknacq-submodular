        "The processing is divided into 3 main transformations (phonetization, automatic prosody and rhythm marking, and generation of LPC frames).",

        "The text-to-speech MULTIVOC system is the result of a technology transfer from a research institute (CNET Lannion, France), which developed the basis of the system, to an industrial company (Cap Sogeti Innovation, France) which made the system a commercial product.",
        "Generating Linear Prediction Coding frames from ordinary text written in French, the goal of MULTIVOC is to give any standard applications the ability to produce (in real time) low-cost and high-quality speech output.",
        "MULTIVOC is shipped as a complete software system which aims to provide a sophisticated driver enabling applications to directly send French spoken text.",
        "The software package consists of the kernel of the driver itself and a set of dictionaries used by it.",
        "Several tools in the package allow an advanced user to tailor his own MULTIVOC driver to specific usage.",
        "Beside this static configuration facility, MULTIVOC also provides several runtime features.",
        "By submitting specific requests an application can change the following parameters:",
        "• The sampling frequency for generated frames.",
        "Three different frequencies are available: 8 kHz, 10 kHk and 16 kHz.",
        "This parameter will characterize the quality of the output voice, a frequency of 16 kHz providing the best results.",
        "• The tone of the output voice can be adjusted in the range 50-350 Hz.",
        "• The speech speed may be set from 1 to 10 syllables per second.",
        "• Two styles of prosody are provided.",
        "The \"reading-style\" corresponds to the usual way of reading a text, while the \"advertising-style\" is dedicated to short commercial messages like jingles.",
        "• One can also choose between a female or a male voice.",
        "The method used for the synthesis produces Linear Prediction Coding (LPC) frames generated from a diphone dictionary.",
        "Such a dictionary is specific to the sampling frequency used (8, 10 or 16kHz) and also to the style of voice (Female or Male).",
        "For this purpose, MULTIVOC provides 6 differents diphone dictionaries.",
        "The overall processing is organized as a pipelined set of transformations applied to the input text.",
        "At the higher level, one can distinguish the following functions: The preprocessing (or lexical processing) is a text-to-text transformation aiming to expande some non-worded terms like numbers (1987 --> \"Mile Neuf Cent Quatre-Vingt-Sept\"), administrative numbers (A4/B5 --> \"A Quatre B Cinq\") or acronyms (CSINN.",
        "--> \"Cap Sogeti Innovation\").",
        "The phonetization process transforms the preprocessed text into phonemes according to predefined rules stored in a user-modifiable base.",
        "The prosody marking process scans the phonetized text and generates appropriate marks to reflect the prosody of the text using built-in rules based on the different punctuation signs and the grammatical type of words.",
        "The rhythm marking process computes the duration associated to each phoneme.",
        "Last, the frame generation process produces the LPC frames which correspond to the input text according to the different parameters specified and can be sent directly to the output device.",
        "In this overall processing, we have deliberately avoided a time-consuming syntax analysis, to enable MULTIVOC to run in real time.",
        "This choice has made MULTIVOC a commercially viable product providing a high-quality speech at low cost and which has been sold to serve as a basic component for several industrial applications."

      "heading": "2. THE MULTIVOC PROCESS",
      "text": [
        "As explained in the previous section, the input text provided by an application is processed in a \"pipe-line\" through five processes (see figure 1).",
        "Each process takes as input the result of the preceding one and fills specific attributes of the objects composing the internal representation of the text.",
        "The final result, a list of LPC frames, is then sent to the LPC interpreter of a speech synthesis device (not described here).",
        "■ PREPROCESSING The main purpose of this first step is to decompose the input sentences into a list of words and to set the lexical attributes of each word.",
        "In order to allow ordinary-written text to be correctly processed.",
        "some patterns are translated into a sequence of words:",
        "• numbers are expansed according to the French language rules.",
        "The words generated are tagged to permit a correct prosody marking for numbers.",
        "• digital dates, time templates (not exhaustive) are matched against corresponding patterns in a set of rules which define the transformation to be applied.",
        "Patterns corresponding to the matching part and the transformation format are expressed using a UNIX-scanf/printf-like syntax.",
        "• abbreviations and acronyms are translated according to a user-defined lexicon.",
        "The translation part associated each entry of the lexicon can be: - empty to specify that the recognized word is to be spelled ex: 'MIT.' --> .",
        "(which will produce 'M I T' [EM EE TAY in French]) - a full text string which will replace the matching word ex: 'MIT.' --> 'Massachusetts Institute of Tech-nology' (in French!...)",
        "- a phonetic string if the pronunciation is very different from the lexical form.",
        "This function is particularly useful for company or product names ••• ex: 'MIT.' --> 'AI\"MAYTI'.",
        "(better) • mathematic symbols are also translated",
        "The process then checks if each word can be pronounced, according to a dictionary of the French sequences of pronounceable letters, and if it cannot the word is spelled.",
        "Finally, an attribute is associated to each word describing the grammatical nature of the word (pronoun, determin, preposition, ...).",
        "This dictionary is rather small (300 entries) and does not contain most verbs but does contain the usual auxiliaries.",
        "A complete analysis of the sentences would provide a better prosody but, due to the size of the corresponding dictionary, could not be processed in real-time.",
        "The resulting prosody is nevertheless judged very natural, albeit in some few cases somewhat strange.",
        "<LC> and <RC> are the respective Left and Right contexts of the Matching Sequence <PS> is the sequence of Phonetic Symbols to be generated and has the meaning: \"Replace <MS> by <PS> if <MS> is preceded by <LC> and followed by <RC>.",
        "Each context specification (<LC> and <RC>) can be empty, in which case the rule is applicable with no conditions, or can be expressed as a logical combination of elementary context: context == elementary.context AND context elementary.context OR context elementary.context An elementary context is either a sequence of characters or a class of sequence of characters (e.g. consonants or vowels).",
        "During interpretation, if several rules are applicable, the one containing the longest Matching Sequence is chosen: thus, the interpreter goes from the particular case to the general case.",
        "If more than one rule satisfies this criterion the first one is chosen and if no rule is applicable, a character is popped from the input and pushed to the output before the process start again.",
        "Example of rules:",
        "- the character ' _' (underscore) denotes a blank character - the character 'I' denotes the logical operator OR - the character '&' denotes the logical operator AND One of the set of rules is dedicated to the determination of the correct liaisons between words.",
        "■ PHONETIZATION This process transforms the sentences into a sequence of phonetic symbols.",
        "This transformation is carried out by five set of rules.",
        "The sets are applied successively to the input text.",
        "Each rule has the following form: [<LC>] <MS> [<RC>] --> <PS> .",
        "where <MS> is the Matching Sequence of characters in the input text ■ PROSODY NIARKING The synthetic speech produced by mere concatenation of diphones is comprehensible but not very natural.",
        "To provide it with an acceptable quality, it is necessary to operate a prosody processing.",
        "Prosody facts are of two kinds (Emerard, 1977), (Guidini, 1981), (Sorin, 1984):",
        "• macro-prosody, related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentence,",
        "• micro-prosody, treating the interaction between two consecutive phonemes.",
        "A study of a set of phrases and the diversity of the voice \"styles\" (reading, advertising, ...) has provided an automatic prosody generation system (Aggoun, 1987).",
        "In the first step, this process decomposes the sentences in a set of so-called prosody-groups, and associates to each of them a group category.",
        "In the second step, each word within a group is marked and a pause is associated with it."

        "A prosody-group is by consecutive words.",
        "A set of rules determines the boundaries of a group and its associated category.",

        "• the punctuation marks (including the end of a sentence), each of them defining a different category • the grammatical natures of two consecutive words.",
        "For example, a group ends after a lexical word (noun, non-auxiliary verbal form) followed by a grammatical word (determinant, pre-position, ...).",
        "In that case, the category of the group depends on the second word.",
        "The resulting sequence of groups is then processed in order to adjust their categories.",
        "Here again, the process is governed by rules based on the following information:",
        "• the length of the group (the number of words it contains), • the number of syllables of each word within the group, • the number and the length of non-lexical words, • the category of the adjacent groups",
        "As an example of rule: IF there exist a sequence (S) containing 3 groups of category '5' without a pause already established for one of them, AND if one of them (G) begins with one of the following determinant ('AU' or 'AUX') THEN give a category '4' to G and give it a short pause except if its pause is already long.",

        "Although some attempts have been made to express the prosody-marking rules in a declarative way (Sorin, 1984), (Aggoun, 1987), based on the logic paradigm, the efficiency criteria and the real-time objective we have defined for this product led us to represent them in a procedural way rather than in a production-Srule form.",
        "At the end of this process, some words remain unmarked.",

        "• constant: the pitch remains unchanged • linear interpolation • exponential variation, namely F(t) = F(to) * e -p(t 40)",
        "where F(t) denotes the value of the pitch at the time 't', tO is the initial time and p is a constant (p = 0.68) Every macro-melody schema begins at Fdeb, the fundamental frequency of the speaker.",
        "Fdeb is set to 240 Hz for a Female voice and 120 Hz for a Male voice.",
        "This fundamental is adjusted if the word has a micro-mark '+' or '-'.",
        "Then a set of rules determines when these functions should be applied to a word.",
        "As an example: For words with mark '1' and containing more than four syllables: - apply constant from the beginning until the middle of the second vowel, - apply exponential with p/2 until the beginning of the first 'voise' phoneme of the last syllable (point A), - apply constant Fdeb/2 from the end of the last vowel (point B) to the end of the word, Then a set of micro-prosody rules is applied on the vowels ('fine tuning').",
        "Example: IF a vowel is not in the last syllable of a word AND followed by an unvoiced consonant THEN the pitch of the last LPC frames of the vowel is adjusted in the following manner: let C = F(LF - 3) - 7/12 *Fee, 1* 100 in",
