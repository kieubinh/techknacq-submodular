        "Online reference books may be thought of as knowledge bases, with data structures encoded in natural language.",
        "We have developed a system that reasons heuristically about the comparative likelihood of various potential attachments for prepositional phrases in English sentences by analyzing relevant definitions in Webster's online dictionary (W7) in their original text form (Binot and Jensen 1987, Jensen and Binot forthcoming).",
        "This paper reviews that earlier work and then extends it by suggesting how additional information (particularly example sentences from another dictionary, the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (IDOCE)) might be used to cope with thi.ce additional problems: the attachment of relative clauses, the resolution of some cases of pronoun reference, and the interpretation of dangling modifiers.",
        "The earlier work on PP attachments has been implemented, but we have only begun work on the implementation of these additional disambiguation problems.",
        "Nevertheless, it seems like a good idea to indicate that this dictionary-based approach should be feasible for more than PP attachments.",
        "Our objective is to consult the dictionary to find the kind of information that has previously The second author currently works for B.I.M., Belgium.",
        "been supplied by means of scripts, frames, templates, and other hand-crafted devices.",
        "This approach offers hope for reducing time-consuming, and usually incomplete, hand-codings of semantic information; and it should be of particular interest for non-restricted text processing applications such as machine translation and critiquing.",
        "We are concerned here with emulating, in some sense, the way a person uses a dictionary: look up one entry, study the definitions and the examples, look up other entries, and so on.",
        "We feel that natural language itself can be a reasonable knowledge representation language.",
        "More needs to be learned about how to access and manipulate this knowledge; but the flexibility afforded by natural language is an advantage for the task, not a drawback.",
        "This research is related to other work being done with machine-readable dictionaries, e.g. Markowitz et al.",
        "1986, in the sense that we all share the goal of automatically extracting semantic information from these rich sources.",

        "The relationships in which we are interested can he illustrated by the following sentences from Binot 1985:",
        "(1) I ate a fish with a fork.",
        "(2) 1 ate a fish with bones.",
        "(See Appendix A, Tree 1.)",
        "In both cases, the ambiguity resides in the placement of the \"with\" prepositional phrase, which might modify either \"fish\" or \"ate\".",
        "The parse tree shows the PP attached to the closest possible head, \"fish,\" with a question mark showing that it could alternatively be attached to the verb \"ate\".",
        "Focussing on (1), another way to phrase the key question is Is it more likely that a fork is associated with a fish or with an act of eating?'",
        "To answer that question, the system evaluates separately the plausibility of the two proposed constructs: (la) eat with a fork (lb) a fish with a fork then orders the solutions, and picks the one with the highest rating.",
        "In the heuristics we are currently using, the basic way to rate the likelihood of a construct is to try to establish, through the dictionary, some relevant semantic connection between the words of that construct.",
        "Easier (or shorter) connections yield better ratings.",
        "Long connections, or connections making use of approximate inferences, will lead to lower ratings.",
        "For example, the definition of \"fork\" contains the phrase ''used for taking up,' and 'eating\" is defined as a kind of 'taking' in the dictionary.",
        "By establishing these relationships, we see a plausible semantic connection between \"fork\" and \"eat,\" and ( la) receives a high rating.",
        "The relationships are established (a) by identifying equivalent function-word patterns in the definitions, such as the equivalence of \"used for\" and the instrumental 'with\"; (b) by linking important definition words (i.e., central terms in definitional phrases, such as heads of phrases, or else synonyms).",
        "This is done by parsing the definitions, identifying the central word(s), and then following hierarchical chains of definitions through the dictionary.",
        "Heuristic answers are expressed in terms of certainty factors which, as in the MYCIN system (Shortliffe 1976), take their values in the range (-1,+ 1): \"-I\" expresses absolute disbelief; \"0\" expresses complete uncertainty; \"1\" expresses absolute belief.",
        "Intermediate values express varying degrees of belief or disbelief.",
        "The two main heuristics that are used to evaluate the plausability of (la) against (lb) can be described in English as follows: HI for checking for an INSTRUMENT relation between a head and a -with\" complement:",
        "2. if some instrument pattern\" (see below) exists in the dictionary definition of the complement, and if this pattern points to a defining term that can be linked with the head, then the relation probably holds (certainty factor = 0.7); 3. else assume that there is more chance that the relation doesn't hold (certainty factor = -0.3).",
        "H2- for checking for a PARTOF relation between a head and a \"with\" complement: 1. if the head is not a noun, the relation doesn't hold (certainty factor = -1); 2. if some ''part-of pattern\" (see below) exists in the dictionary definition of the complement, and if this pattern points to a defining term that can be linked with the head, then the PARTOF relation probably holds (certainty factor = 0.7); 3. else assume that there is more chance that the relation doesn't hold (certainty factor = -0.3).",
        "Each certainty factor refers to the specific proposition (or goal) to which the heuristic is applied.",
        "Thus, if clause 3 of heuristic 112 is used when applied to the proposition ( lb), the resulting certainty factor -0.3 will indicate a relatively moderate disbelief in this proposition, stemming from the fact that the system has not been able to find any positive evidence in the dictionary to sustain it.",
        "The above heuristics make use of the fact that there arc specific words and/or phrases in dictionary definitions, forming patterns, which are almost systematically used to express specific semantic relations (Markowitz et al.",
        "1986).",
        "For the two relations considered here, some of these patterns are: INSTRUMENT: for, used for, used to, a means for, etc.",
        "PARTOF: part of, arises from, end of, member of, etc.",
        "These patterns generally take, as their objects, some central term (or terms) in the definition of the complement word.",
        "We can then try to link that term with the head of the construct that is being studied.",
        "Focussing again on example sentence (I), the system starts by examining the first construct,",
        "(la).",
        "It parses the definition of the complement \"fork,' and discovers at least one INSTRUMENT pattern, \"used for\": fork: An implement with two or more prongs wed esp for taking up (as in eating), pitching or digging.",
        "Taking the conjunction into account, the system finds three possible terms: \"taking up,\" \"pitching,\" and \"digging,\" which it tries to link with \"eat' (For the present, we deliberately avoid the phrase \"as in eating\" -- which offers a direct match -- in order to show that our approach does not rely on such lucky coincidences.)",
        "The system is able to establish that \"ear is a direct hyponym of \"take\" according to W7: eat: to take in through the mouth as food... to take food or a meal.",
        "The link is thus probably established, and the system moves on to consider (lb).",
        "Since no PARTOF pattern can be found in the definitions of 'fork,' this second possible construct will be ranked as much less likely -- (la) receives a certainty factor of + 0.7, but (lb) gets a certainty factor of only -0.3.",
        "Therefore the system recommends attaching the PP to the main verb in (1).",
        "For sentence (2), the constructs to be compared are 'eat with bones' and \"a fish with bones.\"",
        "In the definition of 'bone,\" no useful INSTRUMENT pattern is found; so \"eat with bones\" cannot be easily validated.",
        "But the first definition of \"bone\" gives the following PARTOF pattern: bone: One of the hard parts of the skeleton of a vertebrate.",
        "This yields two possible links for \"fish\": \"skeleton\" and 'vertebrate.\"",
        "\"Fish\" can be identified as a direct hyponym of \"vertebrate\" according to W7.",
        "fish: Any of numerous cold-blooded strictly aquatic craniate vertebrates...",
        "Therefore, \"a fish with bones\" receives a higher certainty factor than \"eat with bones,\" and the system recommends attaching the prepositional phrase to the direct object in sentence (2).",
        "The above examples arc among the simplest.",
        "In more difficult cases, heuristics may perform various kinds of inferences in order to establish connections.",
        "It is also possible for several heuristics to be applied to a given construct, with their results then being combined.",
        "The cumulative effect of many heuristics, and not the perfection of each one separately, does the job.",
        "The choice of certainty factors rests mainly on intuition.",
        "Some choices are easy; some inferences, for example, are obviously weaker than others.",
        "In other cases the values have to be adjusted by trial and error, by processing many examples.",
        "It is interesting to note that, as our corpus of examples increases, the certainty factors are converging toward apparently stable values.",
        "Our system currently includes about 20 heuristic rules and is able to handle the prepositions \"with,\"by,\"after,\" and \"in.\"",
        "It has been tested successfully on about 50 examples so far."

        "The higher question mark in Tree 2 is for the PP attachment.",
        "We have implemented the solution to this kind of relative clause ambiguity.",
        "Our system starts by trying to solve the PP attachment problem: does 'by my uncle' modify \"book\" or \"want\"?",
        "Of all possible relationships between the various word pairs, the AUTHOR relationship between \"book\" and 'uncle\" will receive by far the best ranking.",
        "This will happen because it can be established, by using the dictionary, that an uncle can be a human being (and thus able to author a work), and that a book is some kind of work.",

        "Syntax tells us that the relative pronoun 'that\" is the subject of the predicate \"be on the shelf.'",
        "One of the properties of the verb 'to be' is that a prepositional complement qualifying this verb really qualifies the subject of the verb.",
        "Applied to Tree 2 of Appendix A, this provides two possible interpretations: book on the shelf uncle on the shelf At this point we can see that the relative clause attachment in Tree 2 reduces to a prepositional phrase attachment, which can be solved easily by the PP attachment methods already described.",
        "Specifically, the dictionary definition for \"shelf' will tell us that a shelf is \"to hold objects' or 'for placing things on,' and the word \"book' can be related to 'object' or \"thing' much more easily than the word \"uncle\" can be so related.",
        "This will lead to the preference for -book' as the antecedent of the relative clause.",

        "The parse tree for this sentence (Tree 3 of Appendix A) shows question marks in the same positions as Tree 2.",
