        "The overall goal of the TICC project is to show the potential benefits of automatically broadcasting local traffic information.",
        "Our target system, dealing with traffic incidents in the Sussex area, is to be completed by September 1989.",
        "The project forms part of the Alvey Mobile Information Systems large-scale Demonstrator.",
        "The Natural Language Summariser component of this system is being developed at Sussex University.",
        "Its function is to accept a series of free text messages describing traffic incidents, and to extract from these messages any information that might be relevant for broadcast to other motorists.",
        "The Natural Language Summariser is designed to work in a restricted domain, and only needs to solve a subset of the problems of text understanding.",
        "The TICC's output messages are short and very simple assemblies of canned text, posing no significant natural language generation problems.",
        "Our main concern is that the messages should be useful to motorists, i.e that they be reliable indications of the state of the roads at the time they are broadcast.",
        "Programs such as METED [Chevalier et al.",
        "1978] have demonstrated that in a restricted domain with a restricted sub-language, automatic information broadcasts can be useful.",
        "Programs such as FRUMP [De Jong 1979, De Jong 1982] have also demonstrated that expectation-driven analysers can often successfully capture the gist of free text.",
        "However, the top-down depth-first confirmation of expectations based on sketchy scripts, ignoring most of the input structure, can lead to serious misinterpretations [Ries-beck 82].",
        "Our concern for accuracy of interpretation has led us to a processing strategy in which the Natural Language Summariser analyses the input text at a far greater level of detail than is given in the output messages, so the system \"knows more\" about the traffic incidents it is describing than it says in its broadcasts.",
        "Our parser uses both syntactic and semantic information to guide its search for phrases in the input that might be directly or indirectly relevant to motorists, and explores alternative possible interpretations bottom-up using an active chart [Earley 1970, Kay 1973].",
        "This is an ongoing research project, and we do not claim to have solved all the problems involved in developing a successful system yet.",
        "The current paper considers the particular natural language problems we are addressing and describes the \"interestingcorner parser\" that has been implemented in the prototype system."

        "2.1 INPUT: Our input data comes from the Sussex Police, who have a computer system for storing the text of incoming traffic messages from a variety of sources (eg.",
        "patrol cars, emergency services, motoring organisations).",
        "An example of the style of this text, derived from real input but with names etc.",
        "changed, is given in fig.1.",
        "The series of messages dealing with a",
        "single incident continues over a number of hours, depending on the severity of the incident, and the TICC can afford to spend up to one minute analysing an average length message.",
        "All aspects of the police management of the incident are described, and many of the messages are only indirectly relevant to motorists.",
        "For example, if one of the vehicles involved in an accident needs a total lift to remove it from the road, the likely delay time given in the broadcast message may be longer, although the need for the total lift will not itself be mentioned in the broadcast.",
        "Much of the input is completely uninteresting for the TICC's purposes, such as details of injuries sustained by people involved, or of which police units are dealing with the incident.",
        "There is a great variety in prose style, from the \"normal\" to the highly telegraphic, but there is a strong tendency towards the abbreviated.",
        "It is a non-trivial task to correctly identify the lexical items in the text.",
        "Parts of the input string which are not recognised as entries in the Summariser's lexicon (or regular derivations from entries) may be of four types:",
        "i) Names, numbers etc, which may be recognised as such from the context (e.g pc humphries requests ..., ford cortina reg ABC123).",
        "ii) Other English words not in the lexicon, which cannot reliably be predicted to be proper names (e.g hovis lorry b/dwn o/s bull's head ph).",
        "iii) Misspellings of items in the lexicon.",
        "iv) Non-standard abbreviations of known words or phrases.",
        "Abbreviations are not always of \"canonical\" form, and may be derived from complete words in three different ways, as follows: D Single morpheme roots: These usually have more than one possible abbreviated form and never include punctuation eg.",
        "gge, grg or gar for garage.",
        "But some words do have canonical abbreviations (eg rd for road and st for street (or saint).",
        "ii) Multi-morpheme roots: These often take only the first letter from the first root morpheme, and then either part or all of the second morpheme.",
        "They occasionally include slash punctuation eg.",
        "cway, c/way for carriageway, mcycle, m/c for motorcycle, o/s for outside (or offside), and ra for roundabout.",
        "Sequences / phrases: Some sequences of words have canonical abbreviations (e.g bbc and not britbrdcrp).",
        "Canonical examples seen in Fig. 1. below include rta for road traffic accident and oic for officer in charge.",
        "Non-canonical sequences may have a variety of abbreviations for each of the constituent words, and may or may not have slash or period punctuation, eg.",
        "f/b for fire brigade, eamb or esamb for east (sussex) ambulance, hazchem for hazardous chemicals.",
        "The problem is compounded for the TICC by the fact that the input we receive is all in upper case, hence the even the convention of distinguishing proper name abbreviations by upper case is not applicable.",
        "In order to cope with these different types of input string, we need not only a \"phrasal lexicon\" as advocated by Becker [Becker 1975], but also an \"abbreviation lexicon\".",

        "2.2 SUMMARISATION: Deriving a short broadcast for motorists from a long series of messages such as that in fig. 1 requires two main phases.",
        "First, the Natural Language Summariser must build up a picture of what is happening at the scene of the incident.",
        "Second, a Tactical Inferencer must decide what motorists should be told regarding the incident.",
        "The Natural Language Summarising process also requires two phases.",
        "In the first phase a Message Analyser extracts interesting information from a single message.",
        "In the second phase an Event Recogniser puts together the information from a series of messages to build up a description of the incident as a whole, or rather those aspects of the incident relevant to other motorists (see fig 2. below).",
        "The Message Analyser does not build a complete representation of the syntax and semantics of messages such as those at 1709 and 1723 in fig. 1 above, since they have no bearing on the progress of the traffic incident as far as other motorists are concerned.",
        "It just searches for phrases describing \"interesting\" events.",
        "These fall into two classes: Primary Events: Such as vehicles blocking the road, substances spilling onto the road, all or part of the road being closed, diversions being put into operation, garage coming to remove vehicles from the road, services like fire brigade and county council removing hazards, etc.",
        "The input messages rarely describe these events in full, so the Event Recogniser must infer, for example, that if the local council has been called out to remove debris from the road, that at some time earlier debris must have fallen on the road.",
        "Secondary Events: These include requests that some of the primary events should happen, and people being informed that primary events have happened are happening or will happen.",
        "We will not have any model of the beliefs of the various agents involved in incident handling.",
        "As far as the TICC Natural Language Summariser is concerned, the meaning of someone being informed that a primary event has happened is equivalent to the statement that it has happened.",
        "But the Tactical Inferencer will use its model of the typical progress of traffic incidents to predict the significance of the primary events for other motorists.",
        "For example, if a vehicle is stated to need a front suspended tow, then the Tactical Inferencer will predict that a certain amount of time will elapse before the vehicle is towed away.",
        "2.3 OUTPUT: Not every message input to the system will produce an update to the Event Recogniser's description of the incident, because the Message Analyser may fail to find a description of an interesting event.",
        "But even when the Event Recogniser passes a description of a traffic incident to the Tactical Inferencer, this will not necessarily result in a broadcast.",
        "For example, the Event Recogniser may recognise a series of messages as describing a traffic light failure incident.",
        "The Tactical Inferencer may decide to broadcast a message about this incident if it has occurred on a busy main road in the rush hour, but not if it has occurred late at night in a small village.",
        "The domain knowledge used in the the Tactical Inferencer is non-linguistic, and concerns inferences about the likely time delays for different types of incident, the geographical areas likely to be affected by a given incident, etc.",
        "The Transport and Road Research Laboratory, part of the Department of Transport, are assisting us in the development of rules for this part of the system.",
        "There are other components of the TICC system which we do not detail in this paper, such as the graphical interface, via a map of the Sussex area, to a database of of current traffic incidents.",
        "Although the TICC is designed to send its messages to a dedicated broadcasting system, the actual broadcasting aspect of the project is the responsibility of RACAL research, one of our other Alvey collaborators.",
        "In our current prototype system, implemented on a Sun-3 workstation, broadcasts to local geographical areas in Sussex are simulated, and the Tactical Inferencer is extremely simple."

        "Thus the rule format is most similar to that used in DCG's [Pereira & Warren 1980].",
        "Categories in rules are feature/value trees, and at each level the value of a feature may itself be another feature/value tree.",
        "Feature values may be given logical names, and occurrences of feature values having the same logical name in a rule must unify.",
        "The feature trees which constitute categories in our grammar may specify both syntactic and semantic features, so that we can write \"syntactic\" rules which also identify the semantic types of their constituents.",

        "(1) vp=(sf:VSF) – > v=(s1=(patient:P):VSF), np=(sf:P)",
        "says that a verb phrase may consist of a verb followed by a noun phrase, and that the semantic features on the noun phrase (labelled P) must unify with the semantic features specified as the value of the patient sub-feature of the verb's semantic features, and additionally that the semantic features on the whole verb phrase (labelled VSF) must unify with the (complete tree of) semantic features on the verb.",
        "By adding domain-specific semantic feature information to lexical categories, we gain the power of domain-specific semantic grammars, which have been shown to be successful for handling ill-formed input in limited domains [Burton 1976].",
        "But because we use unification by extension as the basic criterion for node admissability when we test for rules to licence local trees, we can also capture generalisations about syntactic categories that are not domain-specific.",
        "So for example if we had a verb-phrase rule such as (2) and a lexical entry as in (3):",

        "This form of expectation-driven parsing differs from that used in earlier script-based systems such as MARGIE [Schank 1975], ELI [Riesbeck 1978] and FRUMP in four ways: First, the interesting-corner parser uses an active chart to consider bottom-up all interesting interpretations that might be given to an input message, rather than proceeding left to right and filtering out later (right) candidate interpretations on the basis of earlier (left) context.",
        "Second, if there are no interesting lexical items in the input string, or if the only interesting items occur at the (right) end of the input, there is no attempt to match all the leftmost items to a series of candidate scripts or frames using top-down expectations.",

        "This process might be called \"indexed-corner parsing\", in that it effectively combines left-corner parsing and right-corner parsing, and the direction of parse at any stage simply depends upon how the individual grammar rules are indexed.",

        "Thus by assigning (sf–event_type) to be the initial value of the control feature, we ensure that only those edges are entered into the agenda that have semantic feature trees that are extensions of this tree (eg the semantic feature tree for close in (3) above).",

        "The automatic production of traffic broadcasts, given the type of free text we have described in this paper, poses many difficult problems.",
        "In many ways our overall approach to these problems follows in a long tradition of semantically driven systems, but the processing style of our Message Analyser is much closer to that used in contemporary syntax-driven systems.",
        "We make explicit use of rules in a unification-based grammatical formalism that express both semantic and syntactic information declaratively, and our interesting-corner parser provides a search of the input messages that is both thorough and efficient.",
        "We believe that complete understanding of free text messages is well beyond the state of the art in computational linguistics, but that we can nevertheless develop the TICC's Natural Language Summariser to have sufficient partial understanding to be practically useful."
