        "Individual parses may indicate alternative attachments of many kinds of constituents including prepositional phrases and relative clauses.",
        "Beginning disambiguation only after a general parse has the advantage of making clear what all the possibilities are, thus allowing their investigation in an efficient order.",
        "Performing a full parse before disambiguation need not consume an inordinate amount of space or time; techniques such as those used by Jensen (default rightmost prepositional phrase attachment), and Tomita (1985) (parse forests) adequately control resource requirements.",
        "The parser output is first transformed so that it is represented as a set of of semantic choice points.",
        "Each choice point generally represents a constituent.",
        "It contains a group of weighted semantic alternatives that represent the different ways in which word-senses of the constituent head can he associated semantically with word-senses of a higher level head.",
        "This allows word-sense and attachment alternatives to be treated uniformly.",
        "Combinatorial disambiguation then selects the consistent combination of alternatives, one from cacti choice point, that yields the highest total weight.",

        "(The illustration",
        "assumes that \"shot\" and \"bucks\" have two meanings each, and ignores determiners.)",
        "Choice point \"cl\" gives the alternative syntactic and semantic possibilities for the attachment of the constituent \"he\" to its only possible head \"shot\".",
        "Alternative el 1 is that \"he\" is the subject of \"shootl\", with the semantic function \"agent\", and is given (for reasons which will be discussed later) the weight \"3\".",
        "Alternative c12 is similar, but the meaning used for \"shoot\" is \"shoot2\".",
        "Similar alternatives are used for the attachment (c2) of the object \"some bucks\" to its only possible head, \"shoot\".",
        "Alternative c23 represents the unlikely combinations.",
        "Choice point c3 reflects the different possible attachments of \"with a rifle\"; the highest weight (3) is given to its attachment as an instrumental modifier of \"shootl\".",
        "The other possibilities range from barely plausible to implausible and are weighted accordingly.",
        "I laving obtained this repesentation (whose construction is described in later sections), the next step is to establish the single-alternative choice points as given and to propagate any associated word-sense constraints to narrow or eliminate other alternatives.",
        "(This does not occur in our example.)",
        "Then combinations of the remaining choices are searched using a variation of the A* best-first search method.",
        "See Nilsson (1980) for a thorough description of A*.",
        "Briefly, A* views combinatorial search as a problem of finding an optimal path from the root to a leaf of a tree whose nodes are the weighted alternatives to be combined.",
        "At any point in the process, the next node n to be added is one for which the potential",
        "is maximal over all possible additions.",
        "G(n) represents the value of the path up to and including n. 11(n) represents an estimated upper bound for the value of the path below n (i.e., for the additional value which can he obtained).",
        "When a complete path is found by this method, it must he optimal.",
        "The efficiency of the method, i.e., the speed of finding an optimal path, depends on the accuracy of the estimates II(n).",
        "To apply the method in our context, the search tree is defined in terms of levels, with each level corresponding to a choice point.",
        "Choice points arc assigned to levels so that those which would probably be responsible for the greatest difference between estimated and actual I 1(n) in an arbitrary assignment are examined first.",
        "Looked at in another way, the assignment of choice points to levels is made so that those which will best differentiate among potential path scores are examined first.",
        "This is done by (partially) ordering the choice points in descending order of their difference potential Dc, the difference in weight between their highest weighted alternative and the next alternative.",
        "If the highest weight is represented by two different alternatives, Dc = 0.",
        "Within this ordering the choice points are further ordered by weight differences between the 2nd and 3rd highest weighted alternatives, etc.",

        "At each point in the search, the next node to be added is that which (a) is consistent in word-sense selection with previous choices, and (b) has the highest potential.",
        "The potential is calculated as the accumulated weight down to (and including) that node plus FIc for that level.",
        "A diagram of the procedure, as applied to the example, is shown in Figure 2.",
        "The first node to be added is \"with rifle shootl\", which has the highest potential.",
        "At that point, the highest weighted consistent alternative is c21, etc.",
        "While the set of choice points implies that there are (4 x 3 x 2) = 24 paths to be searched, only one is pursued to any distance.",
        "Thus while the approach takes a combinatorial view of the problem, it does so without loss of efficiency.",
        "When a full path is found, it is examined for semantic consistency (beyond word-sense consistency).",
        "The checks made include: (a) ensuring that the interpretation includes all required semantic functions for a word-sense (specified in the lexicon), and (h) ensuring that non-repeatable functions (e.g., the goal of an action) are not duplicated.",
        "Even if the full path is found to be consistent, the search does not terminate immediately, but continues until it is certain dim no other path can have an equal score.",
        "This will he true whenever the maximum potential for open nodes is less than the score for an already-found path.",
        "A more precise description of the algorithm is given in the Appendix.",
        "When more than one path is found with the same high score, additional tests are applied.",
        "These tests include comparisons of surface proximity and, as this work is situated within a multi-target translation system, user queries in the source language, as outlined by Tomita (1985).",
        "An extended version of the method is used in comparing alternate parses which differ in constituent composition, and thus are more easily analyzed as different parse trees, each with its own set of choice points.",
        "An example is the classic:",
        "(4) Time flies like an arrow",
        "(where the main verb can he any one of the first three words).",
        "In such cases, one set of choice points is constructed per parse tree.",
        "In general, the search alternates among trees, with the next node to he added being that with the greatest potential across trees.",
        "If such trees always had the same number of choice points, this would he the only revision needed.",
        "However, the number of choice points may differ, for one thing because the parser may have detected and condensed non-compositional compounds (e.g., \"all the same\") in one parse but not in another.",
        "For this reason the algorithm changes to evaluate paths not by total scores, but by average scores (i.e., the total scores divided by the number of choice points in the particular parse).",
        "I The basic A\" algorithm is usually described as \"expanding' (i.e., adding all immediate successors 01) the most promising node.",

        "Related Work implications of the results of other kinds of decision procedures.",
        "There seems to be little work which directly addresses the combinatorial problem.",
        "First, there is considerable work in preference-related disambiguation that assumes, at least for purposes of discussion, that individual disambiguation problems can be addressed in isolation.",

        "al.",
        "(1985) propose methods of finding the \"best\" resolution of a single attachment problem by finding the first preference which is satisfied in some recommended order of rule application.",
        "Other types of ambiguity, and other instances of the same type, are assumed to have been resolved.",
        "'This type of work contributes interesting insights, but cannot be used directly.",
        "One type of more realistic treatment, which might be called the deferred decision approach, is exemplified by !first (1983).",
        "When, in the course of a parse, an immediate decision about a word sense or attachment cannot be made, a set of alternative possibilities is developed.",
        "The possibility sets are gradually narrowed by propagating the implications of both decisions and narrowings of other possibility sets.",
        "This approach has a number of problems.",
        "First, it is susceptible to error in semantic \"garden path\" situations, as early decisions may not be justifiable in the context.",
        "For example, in processing (S) He shot a hundred bucks with one rifle.",
        "a particular expert might decide on \"dollars\" for bucks, because of the modifier \"hundred', before the prepositional phrase is processed.",
        "Also, it is difficult to see how versions of this method could be extended to deal with comparing alternate parses where the alternatives are not just ones of attaching constituents, but of deciding what the constituents are in the first place.",
        "A full-scale deferred-decision approach also has the potential of significant design complexity (the Hirst version is explicitly limited), as each type of decision procedure (for words and for different kinds of attachments) must be able to understand and process the Underlying these problems is the lack of quantification of alternatives, which allows for comparison of combinations.",
        "There are, however, early and more recent approaches which do apply numeric weights to sentence analysis.",
        "Early approaches using weights applied them primarily to judge alternative parses.",
        "Syntactically-oriented approaches in this vein attached weights to phrase structure grammar rules (Robinson 1975, 1980) or ATN arcs (Bates 1976).",
        "Some approaches of this period focussing on semantic expectations were those of Wilks (1975) and Maxwell and Tuggle (1975), which employed scores expressing the number of expected dependents present in an interpretation.",
        "An ambitious approach combining different kinds of weights and cumulative scores, described by Walker and Paxton et.",
        "al.",
        "(1977), included heuristics to select the most promising subtrces for earlier development, to avoid running out of space before a \"best\" tree can he found.",
        "However, except for this type of provision, none of the early approaches using weights seem to address the combinatorial problem.2 A contemporary approach for thorough syntactic and semantic disambiguation using weights is described by L. Schubert (1986).",
        "During a lett-to-right parse, individual attachments arc weighted based on a list of considerations including preference, relative sentential position, frames/scripts, and salience in the current context.",
        "The multiple evolving parse trees are rated by summing their contained weights, and the combinatorial problem is controlled by retaining only the two highest scoring parses of any complete phrases.",
        "This approach is interesting, although some details are vague3.",
        "However, the post-parse application of A* described in this paper obtains the benefits of such a within-parse approach without its deficiences in that: (a) combinatorial computations of weights and word-sense consistencies arc avoided except when warranted by total sentence information, and (h) there is no possibility of early erroneous discarding of alternatives.",
        "2 Heidom (1982) provides a good summary of early work in weight•based analysis, as well as a weight-oriented approach to attachment decisions based on syntactic considerations only.",
        "he bucks with a rifle subj he shoot obj buck shoot with rifle shoot with rifle buck",
        "One other parser-based work should be noted, that of Wittenburg (1986), as it is explicitly based on A.",
        "The intent and content of the method is quite different from that described here.",
        "It is situated within a chart-parser for a categorial grammar, and the intent is to limit parsing expense by selecting that rule for next application which has the least likelihood of leading to an incomplete tree.",
        "While selectional preference is mentioned in passing as a possible heuristic, the heuristics discussed in any depth are grammar oriented, and operate on the immediate facts of the situation, rather than on informed estimates of total parse scores.",
        "It should be also be mentioned that the representation of alternatives in schemes which combine syntactic and semantic disambiguation is rarely discussed, although maintaining a consistent representation of the relationships among word-sense and attachment alternatives is fundamental to a systematic treatment of the problem.",
        "An exception is the discussion by K. Schubert (1986), who describes a representation for alternatives with some affinities to that described here.",
        "The information limitations of disambiguation during parsing are not found in spreading-activation approaches, exemplified by Charniak (1986), Cottrell and Small (1984), and Waltz and Pollack (1985).",

        "Explicit additive weights substitute for elaborate, case-specific rules, and also make possible a systematic treatment of alternative parses which differ in more than word-senses and attachments.",
        "I lowever, using weighted attachments for within-parse disambiguation requires calculating the summed weights of, arid examining the consistency of, all combinations encountered whose elements cannot be discarded (assuming some good criteria for discarding can he found).",
        "Deferring disambiguation until after the parse allows for optimized searching of alternatives, as described above, to significantly limit the number of combinations examined.",
        "Future work in this direction will include refining the weighting criteria, extending the method to deal with anaphoric references (using considerations developed by, for example, Jensen and 7.adrozny (1987), and integrating a treatment of non-frozen metaphor.",
        "7.Acknowledgement5 I thank John Sowa, Maria Fuenmayor, and Shelley Smith for their careful reviews and many helpful suggestions.",
        "Also, I thank Peter Woon for his patient managerial support of this project."
