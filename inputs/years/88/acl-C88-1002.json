        "Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) was introduced by /Joshi et al.",
        "1975/ as a formalism for linguistic description.",
        "A TAG's basic component is a finite set of elementary trees, each of which is a domain of locality, and can be viewed as a minimal linguistic structure.",
        "A TAG comprises of two kinds of elementary trees: initial trees (a), which are complete structures, usually rooted in 8, with preterrninals on all their leaves, and auxiliary trees (/3), which are constrained to have exactly one leaf node labeled with a non-terminal of the same category as their root node.",
        "We have added lexical trees (8), which are initial trees corresponding to arguments.",
        "Their insertion in preterminal nodes of elementary trees, which serves as predicates, is obligatory.",
        "Sentences of the language of a TAG are derived from the composition of an initial tree and any number of auxiliary trees by an operation called 'adjunction'.",

        "Recursion is provided by the structure of the auxiliary trees which can adjoin into themselves.",
        "Adjunction allows the insertion of a complete structure at an interior node of another complete structure.",
        "It appears to be a natural way of handling adverbs and modifiers in natural language.",
        "Three constraints can be associated to any node of an elementary tree : null adjunction (NA), obligatory adjunction (OA), and selective adjunction (SA).",
        "Because of the formal properties of adjunction, the formalism is more powerful than Context-Free Grammar, but only mildly so /Joshi 85/.",
        "Most of its linguistic properties come from the fact that it factors recursion from local dependencies.",
        "We are thus able to localize all dependencies such as subcategorization, agreement, and filler-gap relations.",
        "Because trees, and not categories, are considered as the units of the grammar, TAGs have a broader domain of locality than usual phrase structure rules.",
        "We have added substitution to the formalism, essentially for descriptive purposes.",
        "Although adjunction is more powerful than substitution, and could be used to simulate it, it seems more natural to have substitution itself for lexical insertion and for constructions in which the extra power of adjunction is not needed (section 2).",
        "We define a restrictive use of substitution: it inserts an initial tree (or a tree derived from an initial tree), or a lexical tree, into an elementary tree.",
        "Substitution is always obligatory and only one constraint, selectional substitution, is defined.",
        "This improves the descriptive power of the formalism without changing its generative capacity.",
        "Features structures can be associated with each node of an elementary tree /Vijay-Shanker 87/.",
        "They permit the dynamic assignment of constraints.",
        "Features are also used for constraining the lexical insertion of items such as prepositions in verbal complements, complementizer of sentential complement or determiner in NP.",
        "Our grammar currently covers the major basic and derived constructions, such as wh-question, relativization or cleft-extraction.",
        "We are also able to handle neutral and reciprocal verbs, middle and locative alternations , as well as argument reordering such as scrambling or heavy-NP shift.",
        "We refer the reader to /Abeille 88b/ for a more complete presentation of the grammar.",
        "In this paper, we focus on some constructions which are of particular linguistic significance."

        "The implementation of such a grammar leads to a new parsing strategy developed in /Schabes, Abeille, Joshi 88/.1 We have shown that TAG formalism is suited for building a sizable grammar for a natural language, and furthermore it allows one to state more local dependencies than other formalisms.",
        "We show that constraints on extraction out of complement clauses and syntactic properties of support verb constructions are handled in a natural way.",
        "We are using our current approach to build a TAG grammar for English along the same lines.",
        "The overall size of the French grammar amounts to 80 basic structures (tree-families), which correspond to simple verbs (12), verbs with sentential complements (28) support verb-noun combinations (20), and support verb-adjective combinations (20).",
        "An average tree-family comprises of 15 trees, and the whole size of the grammar is roughly 1200 trees.",
        "One should notice that what crucially' matters is the number of tree-families, which is closed, if we have been exhaustive.",
        "We have not incorporated yet pronominalization and coordination, the two major remaining phenomena.",
        "We have added selectional restrictions features to each predicate.",
        "We know how to limit the future growth of the grammar: if the derivation we want to add amounts to word-reordering, it is stated by adding a rule to the set of linear precedence rules associated either to the tree-family, or to one of the trees /Joshi 87/.",
        "If it is a lexical rule, a feature will be added to the predicative entries.",
        "In both cases, the size of the tree-database remains unchanged.",
        "If it is a syntactic rule, it adds the proper number of trees to at most each tree-family, so the multiplying factor is 80 in the worst case.",
        "Our grammar has been implemented in an Earley-type parser as defined in /Schabes and Joshi 1988/, and uses a dictionary which comprises of more than 4000 lexical items, that are the most common for French."
