        "Two-level phonology, as currently practiced, has two severe limitations.",
        "One is that phonological generalizations are generally expressed in terms of transition tables of finite-state automata, and these tables are cumbersome to develop and refine.",
        "The other is that lexical idiosyncrasy is encoded by introducing arbitrary diacritics into the spelling of a morpheme.",
        "This paper explains how phonological rules may be employed instead of transition tables and describes a more elegant way of expressing phonological irregularity than with arbitrary diacritics, making use of the fact that generalizations are expressed with rules instead of automata."

        "The examples in this paper have been drawn from English orthography hut it is easy to find examples from other languages where these techniques would be applicable as well.",
        "In an earlier paper [2], I presented a formalism for two-level phonological (or orthographic) rules very similar to Kosken-neimi's [8] and described how rules in that formalism could be interpreted in a computational system.",
        "There were problems with both my formalism and Koskenniemi's that could have been solved with the device of negative rule features.",

        "This stands in contrast to Koskenniemi's formalism, which, in its initial formulation, seemed to rule out pairs of such rules.",
        "For instance, in Koskenniemi's formalism, as originally stated, the two rules below,",
        "would clash.",
        "Together they assert that a lexical character /a/, preceded by a sequence of character pairs a and followed by a sequence of character pairs /3, must correspond to both /b/ and /c/ on the surface.",
        "The orthographic rules described here are used in a morphological analysis system that is based on the work of Koskenniemi, Karttunen, and Wittenburg [8,5].",
        "Its morphosyntactic component uses, instead of continuation classes, an extension of PATR type rules including 'a device described by Karttunen [4] for handling disjunction.",

        "That is called the lexical level.",
        "The other has to do with how a morpheme appears in text, i.e., the surface representation.",
        "There is no way for rules to apply one after the other, creating and referring to intermediate levels of representation.",
        "Instead, rules are viewed as constraints on mappings between surface and underlying forms of morphemes.",
        "They stipulate how to get from underlying to surface form, and vice versa.",
        "Two-level rules in the alternative to Koskenniemi's formalism that I proposed in an earlier paper [2], take one of three forms:",
        "1) a – +b/a__/3 2) alb allowed la_ 3) alb disallowed la__",
        "The a and # in the contexts of these rules represent strings of character pairs where one character of the pair refers to the lexical level of representation and the other refers to the surface.",
        "Rule (1) is very similar to a standard phonological rule.",
        "It means roughly that lexical /a/ must correspond to surface /b/ in the context given.",
        "A more accurate and detailed description is as follows: if lexical /a/ occurs in the given context, then it may not correspond to what it normally would correspond to, but it may correspond to surface /b/.",
        "Rule (2) means that lexical /a/ is allowed to correspond to surface /b/ in the context given, but not elsewhere.",
        "More precisely, the rule allows the pair /a:b/ (lexical /a/ corresponding to surface /b/) to occur in the context given and, unless there are other rules licensing the pair in other contexts, the context given is the only place where that correspondence is allowed.",
        "Rule (3) says that lexical /a/ may not correspond to surface /b/ in the context given.",
        "Both rules (1).",
        "and (2) mention a character's default.",
        "A normal alphabetic character in this system defaults to itself.",

        "In contrast to alphabetic characters (a through z), there are diacritic characters such as the plus sign (-F) for morpheme boundaries.",
        "In Karttunen and Wittenburg's system, [5] there is also a back-quote (`) for representing stress; Koskenniemi uses several others as well, [8].",

        "In the work of Koskenniemi [8] and Karttunen and Wittenberg; [5], diacritics are put into the lexical representation of a word in order to allow the linguist to write a phonological rule that applies in some words and not others according to the presence or absence of the diacritic.",

        "rule.",
        "In old-fashioned generative phonology, there was the notion of a negative rule feature to handle such cases.",
        "One could say of certain :morphemes that appeared to be exceptions to certain phonological rules that such morphemes possessed a feature specifying that sonic particular phonological rule did not apply to them'.",
        "The idea of negative rule features has an advantage over the use of diacritics mentioned above in that it allows simplification of the phonological rules and the lexicon.",
        "It seems to me more straightforward to have a lexical item that says minus such and such a rule than to have the lexical item contain a colon or quotation mark whose function is to assert that some rule does not apply.",
        "The complexity of the lexical items is the same, but in the first casa, at least, the phonological rule can he made simpler by omission of the arbitrary diacritic.",
        "There arc three examples from English orthography that will be used to help demonstrate how negative rule features may be employed.",
        "The analysis of consonant gemination in Karttunen and Wit-tenburg's paper, [5], relies on the use of diacritics of just the sort mentioned above.",
        "A simplified version of the rule is given below.",
        "Gemiruttion: +:c1 C * V =: cl __V; where c1 is in b,d,f,g,l,m,n,p,r,s,14.",
        "This rule uses a plus sign (+) for morpheme boundaries, and a backquote (`) for accent where accent is important.",
        "It correctly describes the following data: questioning versus *questionning, debiting versus *debitting, eating versus *eatting.",
        "The rule also correctly describes the following data, provided the lexical entry contains a backquote in the right place.",
        "referred versus.",
        "*refered (spellings in lexicon are \"refer\" + \"ed\").",
        "In order to get the facts right for monosyllabic words, Karttunen and Wittenburg's rule also mentions that, instead of a backquote, a word boundary (#) will do.",
        "The only point of contention here is that their system requires the the lexical entry to contain a diacritic (and furthermore the diacritic must be correctly located within the word).",
        "That the diacritic is reminiscent of an accent mark is no accident.",
        "Stress is clearly a facnor in English consonant gemination.",
        "Their solution is to find a way to represent stress in the orthography.",
        "The alternative proposed here is to express it in the form of a negative rule feature on the following sample lexical items.",
        "The rule is again simplified.",

        "108-109 Gemination rule: + – 4 cl/C V cl __V; where ct. is in {b,d,f,g,l,m,n,p,r,s,t} Words: refer (default is that it is consistent with all rules) bother -gemination (means that the gemination rule does not apply to this word) There are other sets of data for which this technique is useful.",
        "The case that comes to mind most readily deals with combining a noun or verb stem ending in /o/ with an /s/ morpheme representing, respectively, plural for nouns and third person singular for verbs.",
        "The following rules do well at describing these facts about English orthography.",
        "potato+s potatoes, *potatos (need an /e/) do+ s---=> does, *dos (need an /e/) piano-f-s =z pianos, *pianoes (can't have an /e/) piccolo-4-s > piccolos, *piccoloes (can't have an /e/) banjo+s banjos or banjoes (both are acceptable) cargo+s --=-> cargos or cargoes (both are acceptable) The first of the epenthesis rules describes /potato+s/ > [potatoes] and /do+s/ > [does] correctly, but incorrectly states that the plural of /piano/ is */pianoes/.",
        "The second rule is weaker, generating all of the correct forms – but all of the wrong ones too, so that it achieves the right results for /banjo+s/ > [banjoes] or [banjos] and likewise for /cargo+s/, but yields both the right and the wrong results for the others.",
        "The way to get the facts right is to put negative rule features on the lexical items in question, as shown here: LEXICON piano - [epenthesisl epenthesisl] piccolo - [epenthesisl epenthesisl] banjo - epenthesisl cargo - epenthesisl potato do The alternatives are either to list some forms as being irregular or to insert diacritics into some of the words so that the rule(s) will apply only to the correct lexical items.",
        "To list some of the forms as irregular is to miss the generalization that they are all irregular in exactly the same way.",
        "To use a diacritic (or possibly two) to describe the facts correctly may lead to making other, unrelated rules more complicated.",
        "Furthermore, it seems to be an attempt at expressing historical information, such as a word's provenance, in terms of abstract phonological segments.",
        "In general, the device of negative rule features seems to be well suited to the task of passing information between a lexical entry and the phonology component.",
        "This is a useful capability.",
        "It is perhaps analogous to employing augmented phrase-structure rules in syntax when, at least in theory, pure context-free rules would do.",
        "The main idea here is that there is a way to let phonological (or orthographic) rules refer to features of a morpheme that may",
        "not be easily represented as phonemic segements.",
        "As regards the gemination rule mentioned earlier, the right procedure might be to let the rule mention stress and store values for that feature in the lexical entries."
