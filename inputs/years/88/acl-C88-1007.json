        "This paper discusses the application of Unification Categorial Grammar (UCG) to the framework of Isomorphic Grammars for Machine Translation pioneered by Landsbergen.",
        "The Isomorphic Grammars approach to MT involves developing the grammars of the Source and Target languages in parallel, in order to ensure that SL and TL expressions which stand in the translation relation have isomorphic derivations.",
        "The principle advantage of this approach is that knowledge concerning translation equivalence of expressions may be directly exploited, obviating the need for answers to semantic questions that we do not yet have.",
        "Semantic and other information may still be incorporated, but as constraints on the translation relation, not as levels of textual representation.",
        "After introducing this approach to MT system design, and the basics of monolingual UCG, we will show how the two can be integrated, and present an example from an implemented bidirectional English-Spanish fragment.",
        "Finally we will present some outstanding problems with the approach."

        "The aim of this paper is to explore how the linguistic theory known as Unification Categorial Grammar can be adapted to the general methodology of Machine Translation using Isomorphic Grammars, as pioneered by Landsbergen and others in the ROSETTA team [Landsbergen 87a, b].",
        "UCG is one of several recent grammar formalisms [Calder et al.",
        "86, Karttunen 86, Pollard 85] which are highly lexicalist, i.e. rules of syntactic combination are not a language-specific component of the grammar, but are very general in character, and combinatory information is primarily associated with lexical items.",
        "Lexical items are represented by sets of feature-value pairs (where the values may be themselves sets of such pairs), and are combined by unification into objects of the same type.",
        "The language defined is thus the closure of the lexicon under the combinatory rules.",
        "Landsbergen's work on Isomorphic Grammars follows Monta-gue's approach of having a one-to-one correspondence between syntactic and semantic rules.",
        "A syntactic rule RBI, in the Source Language corresponds to a syntactic rule RTL in the Target Language if and only if they are both associated with the same semantic operation The translation relation is then defined in a precise manner and it can be guaranteed that well-formed expressions in the Source Language are translatable, as there will be an expression in the Target Language that is derived in a corresponding way, and can therefore be considered as a possible translation of it.",
        "According to Landsbergen, writing isomorphic grammars is a way of being explicit about the \"tuning\" of SL and TL grarrunars that is essential for reliable MT.",
        "The present paper is an attempt to adapt this approach to a type-driven mapping between syntax and semantics."

        "We can recognise two basic relations of relevance in translation.",
        "namely, \"possible translation\" (which is symmetric), and \"best translation\" given the current context and much extralinguistic knowledge (which is not symmetric).",
        "We take the task of the linguistic component of an MT system to be a correct and complete characterisation of the former, and will have nothing further to say about the latter.",
        "An important problem that arises in an interlingual translation system is what Landsbergen [Landsbergen 87b] calls the \"subset problem\".",
        "If the analysis component generates a set L of interlingual expressions, and the generation component accepts a set V of them, the only sentences that can be translated are those that correspond to expressions in the intersection L n L'.",
        "If the grammars of the source and target languages are written independently, there is no way of guaranteeing that they map the languages into the same subset.",
        "The problem arises because a sufficiently powerful system of interlingual representation will contain an infinite number of logically equivalent expressions that represent a meaning of a given Source Language expression.",
        "Of course, the Source Language grammar will only associate a single one of these with a given SL expression.",
        "However, in the absence of specific tuning, this is not guaranteed to be the same one that the Target Language grammar associates with any of the translation equivalents.",
        "Therefore, SL and TL grammars must be tuned to each other.",
        "This is not a problem specific to interlingual translation: in the transfer approach to MT system design, this tuning is effected by an explicit transfer module.",
        "The use of Isomorphic Grammars is another way of being explicit about this, tuning the grammars themselves rather than their inputs/outputs, which offers a greater possibility of bi-directionality than the transfer approach.",
        "Landsbergen assumes the existence of compositional grammars for two languages, that is, grammars in which i) basic expressions correspond to semantic primitives and ii) each syntactic rule that builds up a complex linguistic expression from simpler ones is paired with a semantic rule that builds the meaning of the complex expression from the meanings of the simpler ones.",
        "The tuning of grammars consists in ensuring that there is a basic expression in one grammar corresponding to each basic expression in the other, and that for each semantic rule there is a corresponding syntactic rule in each grammar.",
        "Two expressions are then considered possible translations of each other if they can be derived from corresponding basic expressions by applying corresponding syntactic rules.",
        "In other words, they are possible translations of each other if they are built from expressions having the same meaning, by using syntactic rules that perform the same semantic open 6tions.",
        "Note the lack of directional specificity in this definition of the \"possible translation\" relation."

        "Many recent grarmnar formalisms [Shieber 86] represent linguistic objects as :;arts of attribute-value pairs.",
        "Values taken by these attributes may be atomic, variables, or they may themselves be sets of attribute-value pairs, so these objects may be thought of as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), in which directed arcs represent features, and the nodes at the end of these represent values.",
        "Such formalisms typically support re-entrancy, that is, they provide a mechanism for specifying that objects at the end of different paths are the same object.",
        "Unification Categorial Grammar is such a formalism, which combines a categorial treatment of syntax with semantics similar to Kamp's .C,iscourse Representation [Kamp 81].",
        "Each linguistic expression licensed by the grammar corresponds to what is called a sign.",
        "A sign consists of four main entries or features, which are explained below: 1. phonology (orthography in the present case) 2. syntax: 3. semantics 4.",

        "A bilingual sign is merely a sign with top-level attributes source and target having monolingual signs as their values, and in which source semantics and target semantics share their value.",

        "This enables differences in word order in the Source and Target Languages to be accounted for, as shown below.",
        "The two monolingual modes of combination above are used to define bilingual combination through a predicate:",

        "Only that sign representing the contextually correct translation equivalence will be incorporated in the derivation.",
        "In a practical system, there would be a single bilingual sign whose Spanish component has disjunctive (or unspecified) values for gender and number, and the incorporation of this sign into the derivation will eliminate the disjunction (or bind the variables).",
        "Unlike Landsbergen's approach, it is not necessary to specify that the rules which combine the SL, and TL expressions must be the same.",

        "It conveys important stylistic information that should be captured in the translation, but which at present gets lost.",
        "Another aspect of the same problem is that we would like to be able to recognise all possible word orders in Spanish, without generating them all (as some are intelligible but sound awkward).",
        "A possible solution to this could be to include some measure of the degree of \"markedness\" of a construction in each language.",
        "The translation process would attempt to keep the markedness of the two constructions as close as possible to each other.",
        "If the grammar specifies that Spanish sentences may be more \"marked\" than the English, the more marked would never be generated, though they could be analysed.",
        "Another problem is how the set of basic bilingual signs is to be characterised.",
        "That the semantics of SL and TL signs unify is a necessary condition for them to stand in the relation of translation equivalence.",
        "It is however insufficient in two ways.",
        "First, it must be the case that there is no more specific sign in either language whose semantics unifies with that of the other language, and which is of similar markedness.",
        "Secondly, it must be the case that the semantics of the two signs will continue to unify regardless of the derivations into which the signs are incorporated.",
        "For instance, suppose that the English word leg is associated with the semantics [leg_of(X,Y)], and the Spanish word pierna with [leg_of(X,Y),human(Y)].",
        "Although these semantic values do not contradict each other, they will if Y becomes bound to a nonhuman entity.",
        "In this case, the solution is clear - a further bilingual sign must be constructed in which English leg is paired with Spanish pats, having the semantics [leg_of(X,Y),not(human(Y))1.",
        "Then, either the derivation will eliminate one or the other equivalence, or both translations will be produced, which is the desired result.",
        "It is possible that one monolingual component of a bilingual lexical sign will not be a basic expression in that language.",
        "Instead, it must be explicitly constructed in order to be paired with a basic expression in the other language.",
        "The unification-based semantics gives an indication of when such a sign-construction process must take place.",
        "The flexible categorial approach to the construction of constituents allows the non-standard categories needed to be built.",
        "In a sense, the hard work of this approach takes place at this point.",

        "Finally, there is a cluster of problems that impinge on the question of computational efficiency.",
