        "1986/.",
        "However, in at least two respects, it differs significantly from its predecessors and other formalisms which transform tree structures by mapping procedures, e.g. Rosetta (cf. /Appelo, et al.",
        "1987/), GETA (cf. /Vauquois, et al.",
        "1985/) or Mu (cf. /Nagao, et al.",
        "1985/): In the E-Framework, there are just two formal devices, and the mapping from one level to the next is not performed by traditional tree to tree transducers.",
        "Instead, the mapping strategy is based on transitions from trees to partial descriptions."

        "The large number of transfer components in a multilingual translation system obviously makes it desirable to keep them as small and simple as possible.",
        "To achieve this, language specific phenomena are neutralized in Eurotra's interface representation of a text, and the main burden of work is shifted to the analysis/synthesis components.",
        "This means that every monolingual component expresses a rather complex two-way relation between abstract representation and actual text.",
        "The E-Framework was developed because of problems in expressing this relation in a simple and perspicuous way in the earlier formalisms used in Eurotra: When grammars grew to have substantial linguistic coverage, the rules describing the mapping between levels became highly complex and numerous due to interdependence between the linguistic phenomena triggering structural changes in a representational tree.",
        "The proliferation in the number of rules was mainly due to the fact that mapping rules identified specific target level rules to evaluate the new tree structures, and the complexity of rules was due to the tree to tree transducing strategy used which strictly required specification of full-fledged target level tree structures.",
        "Therefore this kind of mapping strategy was abandoned, and a different one requiring only partial target level tree descriptions, has been adopted as the basic method for performing transitions within the E"

        "The tree, to descriptor strategy used in the E-Framework makes it possible to express the complex two-way relation between a text and its abstract representation as a set of simple, economical and non-procedural descriptions.",
        "This has been achieved by giving the generator device the power to use the grammar rules defining a level of representation for other than just checking purposes.",
        "As a consequence, the task of the translator has been diminished in that full structural specifications need no longer be stated in the t-modules as well as in the grammars.",
        "In our application, the advantage of the tree to descriptor strategy is that even when aiming at simple bilingual t-modules in a stratificational translation model, which tends to demand a number of structural changes to be performed within monolingual components, the description of these changes is rather simple."
