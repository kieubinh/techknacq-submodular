        "'Phis paper deals with the training phase of a Markov-type linguistic model that is based on transition probabilities between pairs and triplets of syntactic categories.",
        "To determine the optimal level of detail for a set of syntactic classes we developed a system that uses a set-theoretical forinalism to define such sets and has some measures to compare and optimize them individually.",
        "Ln section two we describe the optimization problem (in terms of prediction, information and economy requirements) and our approach to its solution.",
        "Section three introduces the system that will assist a linguist in handling the prediction and economy criteria and in the last section we present some sample results that can be achieved with it.",

        "IN'IRODUCTION The contest in which we started developping the system described in this paper is the ESPRIT project #860, 'Linguistic Analysis of the European Languages', which deals with seven European languages.",
        "The main objective of the project is to provide a language independent software environment for dealing with the linguistic phase of a number of applications in the realm of office automation such as high quality, natural sounding text-to-speech conversion for unlimited vocabularies, automatic speech recognition for large vocabularies, and omni-font optical character reading including automatic reading of handwriting.",
        "The decision on what type of linguistic model to be used in the project was made at an early stage.",
        "It was decided to aim at a probabilistic positional grammar (a Markov-type grammar) based on transition probabilities of pairs and triplets of syntactic categories.",
        "The use of Markov-type models immediately incurs the necessity of defining training texts.",
        "We started out with training corpora of approximately 100,000 words of official EEC publications, that were available in all languages of the community.",
        "The training consists of building a number of data structures.",
        "The first is a lexicon of all words that occur in the text, with their attendant probability of occurrence and all possible wordclasses.",
        "The second structure is formed by two and three dimensional matrices describing the transition probabilities between pairs or triplets, respectively, of wordclasses, Clearly, the probabilities specified depend on the choice of syntactic categories along the dimensions.",
        "One of the major problems with a Markovian approach is to determine the optimal level of detail of the wordclasses for each dimension.",
        "In this paper we will describe a software system that helps linguists in carrying out experiments aimed at finding an 'optimal' system of wordclasses."

        "1. is minimal in the number of labels (economy requirement) 2. provides high predictive power for adjacent wordclasses in a chain.",
        "A formal way to do this is by minimizing the average entropy of N-dimensional transition probabilities for subsequent labels in sentences, e.g. reduced to the two-dimensional case, to minimize:",
        "symbols for related classes - e.g. the classes \"verb, 1. person singular indicative present active\" and \"verb, 1. person singular conjunctive present active\" giving a cover symbol \"verb, 1. person singular present active\".",
        "At a later stage other cover symbols can be created by combining and excluding wordclass symbols and already existing cover symbols.",
        "In the optimization process different sets of labels are created subsequently and compared by measures related to either of the criteria mentioned.",
        "A user working in the optimization process needs measures to compare the significance of individual labels within a given set and to estimate the usefulness of joining labels into new, more comprehensive cover symbols.",
        "As one measure for criteriurn two we use the entropy directly in a global and diagnostic way.",
        "Additionally a number of measures have been defined that are related to entropy and give more specific information on the performance of individual labels.",
        "Given a text in which to each word a label has been assigned that is:",
        "3. is maximal in the amount of information about each labelled word, e.g. for syntactic analysis or disambiguation of alternative graphemic hypotheses.",
        "(information requirement) To find an exact solution to this problem is difficult - if not impossible, because of the dimensionality of the optimization problem (given the large number of wordclasses needed to obtain useful parsing results) - the difficulty to define a unique starting set of wordclasses for an optimization - the dependence of a possible finite solution on the analysed corpus Our approach to this problem is to start from a very detailed hierarchical wordclass system including complex information.",
        "The degree of detail can be reduced by means of the notion of \"cover symbols\" that form partitionings of the original system.",
        "Cover symbols and wordclasses not accounted for by cover symbols are called 'labels'.",
        "Initially, cover symbols will be created by combining wordclass and given a 2D-matrix that contains relative frequencies of transitions from any label (wordclass or cover symbol) to any other label in the text, then some useful measures are the branching factor for a given label, that tells how many different labels actually followed/preceeded it in an analysed text.",

        "The measures defined here for a 2D-matrix, can be applied to a 3D-matrix in a similar way, e.g. the correlation between two labels in the same matrix dimension then means correlating the numbers of two planes.",
