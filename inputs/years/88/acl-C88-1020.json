        "Speech tate is known to be a variable affecting timing in a speech signal, but one that is difficult to quantify.",
        "Absolute measures of duration in a text tell little about the relative lengths of segments, and account must be taken of all other factors involved if relative values such as 'long', `short', 'fast', or 'slow' are to be applied.",
        "Simple measures of speech rate, such as 'words-per-minute', and 'syllables-per-second' account well for variation at a global level,Init arc inadequate to describe local changes in rate, due to the effects of differences in the structure of words and syllables.",
        "Words can be mono OP poly-syllabic;- and syllables themselves can vary greatly in the number and type of segments occurring in onset, peak and coda positions.",
        "A measure of a small number of words or syllables, expressed as a rate in counts per unit of time, will be affected by the complexity of the component units, structure of syllables or syllabicity of words, such that a string of simple units will yield a higher rate than the same number of more complex ones.",
        "This effect is reduced somewhat as the number of units increases and a more balanced distribution occurs, but will always be present as a corrupting factor in the accuracy of the rate measurement.",
        "It is likely that text type, with stylistic differences in lexical choice, will be a strong determiner of `rate' in measures such as these, and a more text-independent method is required Segments would seem to be a better unit for such measurement, but as yet there is no satisfactory method of determining segment boundaries for automated measurement, and the number of decisions requirectfor measurement by hand of a passage of text long enough to provide statistically adequate results would be both uneconomical and error-prone.",
        "In the present study, a compromise is reached in the choice of syllables as basic unit, so boundary decisions arc reduced and enough measurements can be taken to allow statistically valid conclusions to be made.",
        "A method of normalising for differences in syllable structure is proposed."

      "text": [
        "A database of five thousand syllables was prepared from recordings in the Spoken English Corpus [I] which have been prosodically transcribed, tagged for part of speech and punctuated.",
        "These were measured for duration and transcribed phonemically.",
        "Samples chosen were one long text, a twenty-minute broadcast of a short story by Doris Lessing, read by Elizabeth Bell, of approximately four thousand syllables, and two shorter texts of approximately five hundred syllables each, one Open University lecture on philosophy, and one news extract, for cross-checking.",
        "Syllables were measured in milliseconds from recordings digitised at 10k Hz (4.5k lowpass filtered) with the IBM UKSC SAY speech analyser [2, 3] using interactive graphic display at one-thousand samples per screen-width, and simultaneous auditory replay of the waveform.",
        "Hard copy of both the waveform and gain plots were retained for reference purposes.",
        "In the case of ambisyllabicity, the clearest boundary in the acoustic waveform was selected, and the phonemic transcription, later to be used as input to the rule system, marked accordingly."

      "heading": "FITTING THE RULES",
      "text": [
        "`The rules operate within the framework of a model of durational behaviour which states that (a) each rule tries to effect a percentage increase or decrease in the duration of a segment, but (b) segments cannot be compressed shorter than a certain minimum duration.",
        "The model is summarised by the formula",
        "where INHDUR is the inherent segment duration in ms, MINDUR is the minimum duration of a segment if stressed and PRCNT is the percentage shortening determined by the rules.' (D. H. Klatt [4]) An iterative process was used to match the rule set (originally designed for American English, based on the durations of a single male speaker, and taken from CVC words in frame sentences uttered in a controlled environment) to the durations required for the prediction of British English and for this particular speaker-text pair.",
        "The phonemic transcription of the test text was used as input to a computer implementation of",
        "the Klatt [5] rules for duration prediction, and the resulting segment values summed to the syllable level.",
        "These were compared with the measured durations according to the factors underlying the rules, which were in turn adjusted accordingly.",
        "The same input was passed through the improved rules and the process repeated until the output stabilised.",
        "Segment durations were first adjusted, by sorting 'fit' for each syllable, expressed as a percentage of predicted duration to observed, by nature of the segments appearing.",
        "Thus, /f/ for example, although assigned an inherent duration of 120ms and a minimum of 60ms in the Klatt rules, was found to be appearing in syllables that were consistently overpredicted, and by reducing its inherent duration in the rules to 95ms, and its minimum to 50ms, a better overall fit was observed.",
        "An exact fit is not to be expected since the rules make no allowance for speech-rate variation, other than offering a single variable (`PRCNT') that can he reset to change the overall rate of duration.",
        "The variance observed in the fit for any individual factor will never be reduced below the variance of the underlying speech rate changes, but can only be minimised.",
        "The original rules assume that the minimum duration of an unstressed segment is half that of the segment in a stressed position.",
        "On further analysis of segment fit according to stress, it was found that a better prediction could be achieved by specifying absolute minima separately for the two situations; thus /k/ for example, while 65ms and 50ms for inherent and minimum in the Klatt rules, was found to fit better if specified as 65ms and 35ms, with an absolute minimum (for the unstressed position) of 15ms.",
        "The full table of final values with the original defaults is shown in Fig 1.",
        "These represent an intermediate stage in an iterative process, and arc not presented as statements about individual segment durations per se.",
        "With these segment defaults fitted to the sample text, the values specified in the rules for modifying PRCNT were similarly adjusted so that the best fit could be obtained.",
        "In summary, clause and phrase medial Syllables were found to be overpredicted, and both initial and final syllables unclerpredicted; clause final syllables considerably so.",
        "An extra rule was included to cover the ease of phrase-initial syllables, which are not accessible through the framework of the original rules [6]."

        "can be determined by examining the measures of fit according to criteria not included in the rule-set and implementing new rules to cover any regularities found.",
        "The quantification of speech-rate is thus not a single, simple process, but an iterative one, with accuracy (and therefore confidence) increasing at each iteration.",
        "It can be expressed as a ratio (`SPRATS') of predicted rate in syllables/second to observed rate in syllables/second calculated from smoothed data.",

      "text": [
        "With the rules matched to the text at a global level through statistical analysis of averaged results, differences in output can be examined at the local level.",
        "Since there is no speech-rate information in the rule-set, differences will contain a quantification this, contaminated by noise from measurement and prediction error.",
        "There will inevitably be a certain amount of error in hand-measurement of several thousand syllables, no matter how precise the equipment, but since the totals are cumulative, and sums can be simply checked against overall durations for stretches of the text, it can be assumed that the majority of errors.",
        "will lie in boundary determination.",
        "These can be overcome by smoothing with a three-syllable moving-average window since any over or under-measurement in an individual syllable should be compensated by a corresponding under or over-measurement of its immediate neighbours.",
        "Errors in prediction will be systematic by definition, and therefore susceptible to detection by statistical methods.",
        "They At the current iteration, sprate mean is 100.2% for 3959 syllables [7], indicating an almost exact overall fit between the predicted and observed durations, but with a standard deviation of 19.18 that is partly accounted for by the lack of rate information.",
        "Of the other factors contributing to this variation, no significant effects could be found for e.g. the type of syllable structure, the position of the syllable in the word, or the position of that word in the phrase or clause.",
        "Part of speech, however, appeared to be a significant factor, with sprate results for selected categories as below, syllable type mean s.d.",
        "(est) n lexical verbs 102.7 0.7 626 nouns 98.5 1.0 750 adjectives 92.9 1.2 339 adverbs 102.6 1.6 184 which shows that while verbs and adverbs are slightly overpredicted by the rules, nouns and especially adjectives",
        "would generally appear to be spoken more slowly than the rules pred,.et.",
        "An carlic.",
        ": iteration showed that polysyllabicity, instead of being in the domain of the word as the original rules predict, gives a haler lit if measured in feet, and adjustments made according to the number of the unstressed syllables that follow each strcy.cd syllable.",
        "A category that needs further examination is that of stressed but unaccented syllables which are 'prominent but have no pitch movement' [8].",
        "By default, these are treated as stressed, but on examination of the results, spratc, which is 100.3 for unstressed syllables and 98.3 for stressed, is 106.7 for stressed-but-unaccented, showing slight undcrprediction of stressed syllables, but greater ovcrpredict ion of the intermediate category.",
        "Of perhaps greater interest though, is the fit of sprate to the perceived speeding up and slowing down in the presentation of the text by the reader.",
        "Taking the mean sprate values for all syllables in the tone-group, we find the following 93.9 Walking down the path with her, he blurted out 112.1 `I'd like to go and have a look at those rocks down there.' 86.4 She gave the idea her attention.",
        "102.8 The water was pushing him up against the roof.",
        "98.7 The roof was sharp and pained his back.",
        "120.2 He pulled himself along with his hands, fast, List.",
        "97.8 and used his legs as levers.",
        "99.8 They sat down to lunch together.",
        "128.2 'Mummy, I can stay under water for two minutes, tierce minutes at least.' 84.1 It came blurting out of bins.",
        "where an increased spratc indicates overprediction in the rules or, conversely, a speeding up in the text.",
        "Here, examples have had to be chosen to include textural clues to the rate, but listening to longer passages confirms that rate correlates well with sprate.",
        "Further iterations will allow more confident examination at levels lower than the sentence."

      "text": [
        "As Fig 2. suggests, a small random or high frequency error summed, with a more slowly changing effect does little to hide its rhythms.",
        "Speech rate cannot be expressed as a simple sine wave, but its effect on the prediction of segment duration by rule can perhaps be seen in this way and until its processes are understood, no predicted durations can match observations from a real text - the lows cannot be slow enough nor the highs fast enough.",
        "Until rate information is superimposed on phonetic and phrase-level information in a systematic manner, the output will be flat and if in a computer text-to-speech system, 'robotic'.",
        "The above method provides a quantification of speech rate that reveals both local and wider-range domains.",
        "Being an iterative process, it provides for an improvement of the rules for prediction of duration in a text while at the same time revealing processes within the text that govern changes in rate at the more local level."
