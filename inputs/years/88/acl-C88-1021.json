        "Cognitive plausibility is established in that human judgements of the optimal anaphoric referent accord with those of the strategy-based method, and human inability to determine a unique referent corresponds to the cases where different strategies offer conflicting candidates for the anaphoric referent."

        "Whereas the ubiquity of the phenomenon and the necessity to cope with it in the construction of friendly natural language interfaces has long been recognized [13, 8, 9, 17, 15], no truly comprehensive computational approaches for anaphora resolution have been proposed.",
        "The RUS parser [2], the XCALIBUR system [7], and other operational natural language systems implement very rudimentary methods.",
        "And, theoretical work in linguistics is primarily concerned with certain types of syntactic intrasentential corcference, rather than pragmatic intersentential anaphora.",
        "Anaphors typically refer back to other constituents in the same sentence, or to constituents in earlier utterances in the discourse.",
        "Syntactic information plays a central role in establishing appropriate referents for the former case, intrasentential anaphora [17].",
        "But, semantic and pragmatic information is absolutely required in the latter case, intersentential anaphora [15, 9].",
        "This paper addresses the problem of intersentential anaphora resolution, integrating caseframe semantics [10, 12, 5] and more global dialog coherence structures [11, 15, 14].",
        "Empirical studies have shown that intersentential anaphora' is far more frequent and more crucial in designing interactive natural language interfaces2 [8]."

        "It is a little more difficult to mechanize a process that excludes things such as cakes from being the object of washing.",
        "One cannot simply write a \"NOT(edible)\" restriction on the object case of the verb \"to wash\".",
        "After all, vegetables and fruits arc occasionally washed prior to eating them.",
        "Perhaps a combination of typicality judgements with pragmatic knowledge extrapolating the effects of attempting to drown a cake in a sink full of water comes into play.",
        "Or, more abstract inferential constraints are appropriate, such as requiring that the object of wash be unchanged by immersion in water.",
        "Interestingly, Subjects given only the \"...and washed it\" sentence report consistently that they didn't even consider the cake a reasonable referent for \"it\".",
        "In the robot example, there are four anaphoric referents, counting the possessive \"its\" and the locative \"there\", referring to three different antecedents.",
        "Although subjects report little difficulty ascertaining the referent for each anaphor in a consistent manner, it appears that sophisticated semantics are required.",
        "Why is the referent for \"it\" in \"it goofed and dropped...\" the robot rather than the box or the conveyor belt?",
        "One could argue that the box cannot take action, but what allows a robot to goof and not a conveyor belt?",
        "Is it something as subtle as the degree to which the former can be anthropomorphized being greater than the degree to which the latter can be anthropomorphized?",
        "The difficulty in anaphoric referent specification in narratives has been argued convincingly by many researchers including Chamiak in his work on children's story comprehension [9], where substantial pragmatic domain knowledge must be brought to bear, and by one of the authors [4], where knowledge of goals and personality traits is required to resolve difficult referents.",
        "Hence, the hypothesis that anaphor resolution in its full generality is at best a difficult problem, and at worst an almost intractable one, is well supported.",
        "Nevertheless, somewhat less ambitious endeavors can prove far more tractable, and yet be of major practical import.",
        "Hayes [13] argued for the notion of limited-domain anaphora in a natural language interface to an electronic mail system.",
        "Webber [17] demonstrated that intrasentential anaphora was more tractable than its intersentential counterpart, largely through the categorization of syntactic devices absent from larger textual or dialog segments.",
        "This paper explores an intermediate position: addressing much larger classes of anaphors than those of Hayes [13] in a systematic manner, but stopping short of full generality, which requires unbounded pragmatic knowledge and inference.",
        "We explore the central hypothesis that anaphora resolution may be best accomplished through the combination of a set of strategies, rather than by a single monolithic method.",
        "The apparent complexities lie in the combination of these multiple strategies to produce syntactically, semantically and pragmatically sound anaphoric resolutions.",
        "In the multiple examples analyzed,3 unambiguous resolutions reported by human subjects correspond to situations where the applicable strategies concur on the referent of an anaphor, and disagreement on the correct referent by the human subjects corresponds to situations where the applicable strategies propose different candidate referents for the anaphor in question."
