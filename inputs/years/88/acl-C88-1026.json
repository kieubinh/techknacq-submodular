        "In this paper I propose a Binding rule for the identification of pronoun and anaphor referents in phrase-structure trees, assuming the general framework of the Government-binding theory outlined by Chomsky (1981).",
        "The Binding rule, specified by means of an attribute grammar, is a particular instantiation of the Free Indexing rule and binding axioms in Chomsky's Binding theory, with certain empirical and practical advantages.",
        "The complexities of the Binding rule proposed, .as well as that inherent in Chomsky's Binding theory, are studied, and it is shown that the new rule is more psychologically plausible and computationally efficient than the original theory on which it is based.",

        "Binding is a component subtheory of Government-binding which applies in the derivation of the logical form of utterances from their surface representation.",
        "The area of semantic interpretation dealt with by the binding theory is that of â€¢ anaphora.",
        "Binding theory defines only syntactic conditions on anaphora; the reader is referred to /Hobbs, 1978/ for some of the extra-syntactic factors that might be involved.",
        "Binding assumes an Indexing rule which applies to an input S-Structure tree and annotates it, assigning to every NP node in the input tree a referential index, which represents the coreference relation of the NP with other NPs in the input.",
        "In this paper research is continued on the use of attribute grammars to provide a fully explicit and computationally oriented statement of the Government-binding (GB) theory /Correa, 1987/.",
        "The Binding rule presented here improves over the standard statement of the Binding theory in two respects: From an empirical point of view, the new rule accounts for crossover binding phenomena /Kuno, 1987/ without recourse to reconstruction /Chomsky, 1981/; from a practical point of view, the new rule is more computationally sensible than the generate-and-test approach understood in Chomsky's theory, and hence is a plausible candidate for incorporation in natural-language parsers that account for anaphora.",
        "Previous literature on GB parsing /Wehrli, 1984; Sharp, 1985; Kashket, 1986; Kuhns, 1986; Abney, 1986/ has not addressed the issue of implementation of the Binding theory) The present paper intends in part to fill this gap.",
        "In the development below I will assume that the reader is familiar with attribute grammars and the basic concepts and terminology of Government-binding, although not necessarily with the Binding theory.",
        "The reader is referred to Waite and Coos (1984) for a concise introduction to attribute grammars, and Sells (1985) for the basic assumptions of Government-binding."

        "The antecedent of the anaphor must, furthermore, c-command the anaphor and be found within a certain local domain, notions to be made precise below.",

        "A pronominal need not pick its reference from some other NP in the sentence, but rather may have independent (deictic) interpretation, as in the first reading of (3.a).",
        "The pronominal may also be read anaphorically, having its reference determined by some other NP in the sentence (3.a-b).",
        "In this case, though, the antecedent must either be outside the local domain of the pronominal, or not c-command it.",
