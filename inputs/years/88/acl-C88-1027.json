        "Our approach represents a theoretical adaptation of Chomsky's subset of theories to the practical results obtained from and designed for SCD parsing strategy /Curteanu 1986/, /Curteanu 1987/.",
        "Mainly designed for Romanian, this strategy proved to be effective (with some peculiarities) also for English /Curteanu 1988b/.",
        "Let us consider the classical notations: X'-the second level of X projection, X\"=XP-the third (top) level of projection for X=N,V,A,P.",
        "Consider also S 7 S' and PMP(X)=XP.",
        "We do not intend to discuss the problems of S\"=110(S).",
        "We shall call X'-structures (middle level in the maximal projections) as \"groups\": a group contains an overt or an empty head, wrapped by its specifiers (denoted Specif) and modifiers (denoted Modif) but without argument(s) (der.",
        "noted Arg).",
        "Thus X'=7G.",
        "NO=N' is called Elem -entary Noun Group (ENG).",
        "Tensed Verbal Group (TVG) is V' with the (morphologic or syntactic) feature of being tensed.",
        "Non-tensed Verbal Group (NVG) is V' with the (morphologic) feature of being untensed.",
        "ECP abbreviates the Empty Category Principle.",
        "We note that X'-structures are naturally obtained by SCD rules.",
        "As Chomsky remarks \"...the distinction between modifiers and arguments is notoriously difficult in certain cases\" /Chomsky 1982 p.44/.",
        "Giving a general solution for the dis -tribution of the verbal nature modifiers , the AX'-schemes offer also the correct assign -ment of the functional dependencies between the head and its Modif, on the one hand, and the head and its Arg(s), on the other hand.",
        "The paper presents a PMP specification,which the adopted solutions are based on.",
        "It mainly says that not only V has suboategorization properties, but also some N and A (part of these verbal Ns or As being, in some languages, V).",
        "The new features of the AX'-schemes are; (1) an arbitrary number (n.)io) of Arg(s) are permitted, (2) the AP is always a Modif and (3) the PP is always an Arg in AX'-schemes whose overt or empty head is N,V,A.",
        "The sub-categorization properties depend on an ab initio assigment, at the dictionary level, of the lexical feature VERB of the category.",
        "(4) The overt or empty (PRO) subject is considered as a special argument of the tensed (S) or un tensed (NP) maximal projections of V. (5) In the hypotheses (4) and (2) the traditional , formal VP is dissolved into S or complex, ver -bal NP.",
        "(6) The phenomena of binding and bounding are easier remarked and solved this way.",

        "A Specification of PMP",
        "We have shown in /Curteanu 1987/, /Curteanu 1988a/ that, within the SCD parsing strategy, there are detached basic (middle level) structures of the form X' (like ENG, TVG, NVG).",
        "They are elements of the (tensed or untensed) clause relation predicate - arguments.",
        "For all these X'-structures we could find the same functional representation shape, written as a LISP tree.",
        "The new proposed AX,-schemes have their origin in the governing idea of the SCD strategy: the (maximal) use of the verbal character of, traditionally non-verbal (including for Romanian) categories, N and A.",
        "Let us consider the following PMP specification: The suboategorization properties of the (consistent) syntactic categories N,V,A depend on the following lexical and, respectively, morphological features of these categories: VERBality, with tEg-;falues ACT and EXIST, and PREDicativity, with the values T and NIL.",
        "Such a specification of the maximal projection function is necessary because in many languages (including Romanian) the verbal quality of the non-verbal categories like N or (sometimes) A has to be discovered and assigned at the dictionary level.",
        "E.g., for English, the nouns that \"verbalize\" in -ing have, of course, the VERB feature.",
        "There are, also, quite few participles which are not adjectives and fewer adjectives which are not participles, despite their VERB quality (and thus, of the suboategorization property).",
        "3.",
        "Augmented X' - Schemes",
        "Before proposing the new AX'-schemes, we simply remark a (more adequate, at least for our approach) alternative shape to the classical X'-scheme.",
