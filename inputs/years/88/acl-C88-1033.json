        "The influence of the criterion \"Aktionsart\" with respect to the temporal relations of temporal entities often seems to be overemphasized.",
        "On the one hand the correct classification is a problem, on the other hand, it seems that in more cases than assumed the influence of world knowledge is necessary to disambiguate the temporal relations.",
        "In this paper an approach is presented based on a two-step analysis of a text.",
        "The first step consists in constructing a partial ordering on the basis of an approximate classification of the temporal units on sentence level, using the framework of D(iscourse) R(epresentation) T(heory) /cf.Kamp 1981a/.",
        "In the second step we try to obtain possible linear readings, using background-information, provided by a database, and an inference component that is an extended version of the \"event-calculus\" /cf.Kowalski,Sergot/.",
        "The subdivision into two steps enables the temporal resolution component to work without a great number of inferencing processes.",
        "This contributes to a more modular-like structuring of the natural language processing-system.",
        "The goal is to represent ambiguous readings as such.",
        "The progressive state reading of an accomplishment leads to the problem called \"imperfective paradox\".",
        "Using the beliefs of the agent we try to give a solution for the subclass of intentional actions.",

      "text": [
        "The starting point of this paper is the conviction, following Kamp and others, that within the temporal units, events are primordial, and time is abstracted from them.",
        "The construction of pure temporal units can be based on the ultra-filter-construction introduced by Wiener /cf.Kamp 1979,1981b,van Benthem/.",
        "In order to model the natural underspecification of human perception, only the relations < , o (temporally smaller or overlap) are given within the event-structures in /Kamp 1979/ along with the following axioms:",
        "Including the axiom of linearity A7 V ei,e2 e1< e2 ; elo e2 ; e2 < other relations like \"subset\" or \"temporal equivalence\" can be defined out of these basic relations.",
        "This shows the fundamental significance of the relations < and o.",
        "The addition of new events can allow a more accurate statement of the temporal relations.",
        "If we start with an uttered relation of vague simultaneity between two events eland e2 expressed by el o e2 and if it becomes clear from later passages of the text that there are events e3 and e4 with e3 < e2 < e4 and e3 o e, and e4 o e1 we can deduce by the Wiener construction, that the event seen as punctual at the beginning, consists of at least three moments of time t1, t2, t3.",
        "Thus the internal structure of such events can become more elaborate as the text proceeds.",
        "In addition we can specify with greater precision the relation between events.",
        "In the case of e1 and e2 we are now able to conclude, that the overlap of the beginning has to be understood as a subset-relation between e2 and e1.",
        "In the following we will make use of this conception within the definition of our models for representations of texts.",
        "The Aktionsarten, redefined by Vendler, have frequently served as criterion to correctly construct time-structures from natural language-texts./cf.Dowty 1986,1finrichs,Partee/.",
        "The opinion is not tenable however that telic events (accomplishments, achievements), in the absence of temporal adverbials, shift the reference time for new temporal units forward, and that activities, or so-called atelic events, and states do not.",
        "This is often argued in the literature.",
        "Example 1: (e0) John wrote a program.",
        "(el) He logged in, (e2) opened his file and (03) began writing and correcting by using his papers.",
        "Example 2: (eo) Yesterday a lot of things happened.",
        "(e1) John bought a bicycle, (e2) Mary demolished Stanley's microwave oven.",
        "In example 1,el,...,e3are internally ordered subevents of eo.",
        "In example 2, no obvious ordering between eland e2 exists.",
        "Without inferencing and using a detailed analysis of discourse functions as \"continuation\" or \"elaboration\" we can not establish the right ordering relations for ouch cases.",
        "It is evon harder to state correctly temporal relations within a compositional approach:",
        "Only when processing the fourth sentence of example 3 do we discover that e2 is an elaboration of e, in the case of a), whereas in b) c2 is a continuation of el.",
        "Thus what we should do in the first step of the analysis is to construct an underspecified ordering hoping that in the second step, on the basis of the representation of the whole text, we can refine the conditions.",
        "We restrict ourselves to cases as in example 1 and 3, because here it suffices that one reference point is provided by the representation of the preceding text.",
        "To represent the ambiguity between continuation and elaboration we need a relation \"not-before\".",
        "However to define \"not-before\" as a transitive relation the disjunction of < and o ( < ; o) is not sufficient.",
        "This becomes clear from examples 1 and 3 which would then be expressed by the following: \"eo ( <;o) el(<;o) e2 (<;o) e,\" (e3 not-before e2 not-before ei...) Because o is not transitive, for an admitted reading \"eo o es o e2 o e,\" (which would be true in cases where e1 is a subevent of co, e2 a subevent of e1 and so on) one cannot exclude the possibility that \"e, < el\", which is surely not the case for such episodic readings.",
        "Thus we have to require:",
        "This suffices for transitivity as easily can be shown.",
        "Nevertheless we intend to tackle the problem in a second way; first because we want to be able to state a relation of isomorphy between event structures and Allen's interval structures /cf.Allen/, and second, because we want to make use of the event calculus of Kowalski and Sergot within our inference component.",
        "In their approach events are like points.",
        "To this end we need extensions of pure event structures.",
        "It has been proposed, by Moens and Steedman among others /cf.Moens,Steedman/, partly with the intention of making Kowalski and Sergot's event calculus available for natural language systems, to represent the extent of structured events, i.e. accomplishments and activities, thereby conceding them starting and final events (\"start-events\" and \"stop\"- or \"culmination-events\").",
        "This method is also adopted within our approach.",
        "In combination with the Wiener method of constructing pure time units, this finer granulation allows us to conceive the o-relation as an equivalence relation for so-called secondary events, which, as we will sec, is another way of solving the problem of \"not-before\".",
        "The model for DRS's used here is an extended version of the point-event-structure model with a domain of individuals proposed by Kamp.",
        "The version in this paper is a continuation of the model in /Reyle/.",
        "An extended point-event structure with a domain of individuals is given by: <,o,start,end,F,G > where the following is the case: E is the set of events and is subdivided into primary and secondary events: Primev, Secev.",
        "* Priinev is subdivided into Acc (accomplishments), Act (activities) and Ach (achievements).",
        "* start, end are partial functions over the primary events wills values in the domain of the secondary events such that each element of this domain is a value of one of these functions.",
        "S is the set of states.",
        "* P(T) stands for the set of periods which can be formed from the elements in 7', which is the set of atomic, purely temporal units, whereby * T contains all atomic elements which arc constructed out of E and through the Wiener construction.",
        "* d is a (<,0)-homomorphism, which relates the events in E and the states in S to the corresponding purely temporal entities in P(T).",
        "* U is the set of individuals * The following holds: every accomplishment x is assigned exactly one start-event xi and either one stop-event x2 or one cul-event x2, every activity x is assigned exactly one start-event xi and one stop-event x2, every achievement x is assigned exactly one cul-event x2, whereby the assignment of secondary events to primary events, in combination with conditions about the relations <,o can be graphically illustrated as follows:",
        "The axioms Al - A6, extended to all temporal units of the domain, hold for the relations <,o, such that it follows that, with the inclusion of the linearity axiom : A7 V x,y EEUSU P(T) : (x<y ;x oy;y <x) o has the characteristic of being an equivalence relation, restricted to the secondary events.",
        "One can thus define: V x,yESecev:x =py <-> x o y This allows the abbreviation \"x <p y\" for elements of Secev with \"x < y\" or",
        "For every nary verb R and every n +1-tupel < E G(R) there exists a state s E S and an interval i E P(T) such that b(s) = > and either \"i c d(e)\" or \"i < d(e)\" , whereby R' represents the progressive variant ProgR of R. On the other hand, there should exist for every R', which is the progressive variant of an R and which is assigned an s by b, an n +1- tupel E G(R) with the corresponding ordering and individual relations.",
        "In the system proposed here, a narrative text without any additional specifications which includes a series of events e, E Acc, e2 E Ach, e3 EAcc would be assigned the following semantic representation:",
        "Thus, the underspecification which is necessary in examples such as 1 and 3 is maintained without the side-effect of example 4.",
        "More exact relations can be established in a second step, using pragmatic knowledge, which completes the structure.",
        "In the case of example 2 we assume an indicing which does not allow an internal ordering.",
        "An advantage of this representation, using secondary events, for underspecified texts, over a representation with differentiated ordering relations, such as Allen's interval structures /cf.Allen/, is, for example, its notational efficiency: If e1,e2 EAcc, then the following holds:",
        "one can show easily that within the event substructure of the extended point-event structure the relations that Allen uses can be defined in terms of o and < such that a relation of isomorphy holds between such extended event structures and Allen's interval structures.",
        "(In general this is not the case for the original event structures).1 3) The imperfective paradox and the ambiguity of the Aktionsarten in German No attempts to solve the paradox that I am familiar with have been able to reduce the validity of a sentence in the progressive form to the validity of the same sentence without a progressive, which was the intent.2 Moens and Steedman, with their aspectual net, have proposed a solution in which progressives are only generated from the activity readings of events.",
        "I will adopt this view to a certain extent, but will take it one step further, by bringing in beliefs, in order to create the possibility of reestablishing a direct relation at least for some kinds of accomplishments.",
        "The basic idea is that it is often only on the level of a text that the hearer can decide whether or not the culmination of an accomplishment, which has been introduced by a progressive, has actually been reached.",
        "Some texts will leave this decision open, others will force the existence of a culmination, and still others will force the nonexistence of a culmination.",
        "Especially in this last case, it is necessary to question the justification of the use of the progressive state for an accomplishment: how do we know the goal of an action if it is not attained?",
        "These possible characteristics of a text should be reflected by the different possibilities of assigning an embedding function relative to a DRS in a model M. We therefore require for a function f, which maps discourse referents of a DRS K onto entities in an expanded point-event structure with a domain of individuals, in addition to the usual features /cf.",
        "Reyle/, the following:",
        "In addition the DRS construction algorithm must contain the rule: For all e E Acc, e' EEUSU P(T) end(e) <p -> end(e) E Cul If one requires, as in the correlation principle, that every state introduced by the progressive of an accomplishment verb be contained by an event, then the question whether e has a culmination (that is, represents a true accomplishment) or just a stop-point (that is , corresponds to the activity reading of an accomplishment), is transformed into the question of the existence of the corresponding f. (Compare to this end the analogous approach in /Schulz/.",
        "In a subsequent paper we want to generalize the result with respect to the whole temporal substructure of an extended point-event structure.",
        "2 Dowty's attempt using \"inertia worlds\" seems to lead to difficulties with respect to the correct non-subjective definition of the notion of an inertia world /cf.Dowty 1970/.",
        "On the other hand, the question whether a corresponding expression in German is to be read as the progressive of an accomplishment or as a real accomplishment will not necessarily be decided on the sentence level.",
        "We enter start(e) < end(e) and make the interpretation of end(e) depend on the possibility of finding an embedding function f.",
        "In this constellation, the compositionally constructed et C Acc cannot be truly interpreted as an accomplishment since Hans never arrived at the other side of the street.",
        "A simplified representation in our system would give the following: Incorporating a spatial-temporal inference component (in the second step of the analysis) which uses rules that deal with presuppositions and resulting states with respect to events and states, one would get, in pseudo-prolog notation:",
        "On the basis of these facts one can conclude that no linear ordering of the secondary events can exist if end(ei) C Cul holds.",
        "Therefore we make use of an extended version of the event-calculus by introducing for each linear reading which is to be tested \"auxiliary' events to get endpoints for the introduced states if needed.",
        "If such events contradict with respect to a story an assumption which one could call the relevance-principle, the proposed linear reading is rejected.",
        "This relevance-principle for instance would predict that in a story in which the agent crosses the street but is nevertheless later located in the street, an event of reentering the street should be mentioned.",
        "Thus, every embedding function f, on the basis of the appropriate axioms, must map end(ei) onto an element from StopM.",
        "el is interpreted as a non-real accomplishment and this part of the text is no longer ambiguous.",
        "When translating this representation into a natural language, the corresponding state-marker and not the corresponding event-marker must be considered3.",
        "accomplishment a culmination point.",
        "The culmination points of accomplishments whirls cannot be assignee a linear reading can be understood as entrance points to an inertia world /cf.",
        "Dourty 1970/.",
        "For the sake of completeness, one would then have to generate additional stop points for such es and label them as non-real accomplishments, as in the first variant.",
        "4) Intensional model of a DRS Although the correlation principle implies a relation between a sentence with the progressive form and the same sentence without, it also makes dependent on f the question of whether the corresponding event to a progressive form of an accomplishment can be read as a real accomplishment or not.",
        "If not, one must ask according to which criteria the special determinability of assertions about accomplishments is justified, since without the possibility of checking the result, the descriptions of progressives such as:",
        "in case the corresponding events arc not completed, collapse into the description of a perception of an activity: \"Hans kletterte\".",
        "What are the criteria for considering one state to be fulfilled at time t and the other not?",
        "It seems to me that one possibility of evaluating such cases could consist in referring to beliefs.",
        "There is no doubt that not all accomplishments involve agency, and even in the case of agency there is not always intentionality by the agent (cf. Dowry's notion of \"controllability\").",
        "But on the one hand intentionality and associated activity can serve as a sufficient condition for the validity of a progressive state.",
        "On the other hand, in other cases, the introduction of beliefs can serve to represent expectations of the speaker or mentioned protagonists connected to the introduction of such progressive states.",
        "Thus we get at least a further instrument to represent ambiguous readings.",
        "Our aim is not to provide the correct truth-conditions for nonintentional cases.",
        "Here further research is needed.",
        "We restrict ourselves to the description of cases as in example 6 and we will concentrate on the notion of belief in a framework where time comes into play.",
        "For cases as in example 6 we require that: \"Hans ist dabei auf den Berggipfel zu klettern\" be true at t if an activity c of climbing by Hans in the direction of the peak exists where t e e. and if Hans has the intention of climbing the mountain at t, i.e. in the \"belief state\" of Hans at t there, exists an event e which he wants to accomplish.",
        "For the interpretation of such DRS's it is useful to expand the concept of a DRS model.",
