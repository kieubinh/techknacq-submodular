        "Since our main goal is to implement a robust and efficient analyzer for French, we have designed a system which can detect errors as opposed to one which can only process well-formed input.",

        "These systems are difficult to adapt to French since they are based on knowledg which is specific to English.",
        "Furthermore, in these systems the nowledge is rarely represented explicitly: indeed, the knowledge has most often been \"compiled\" for reasons of efficiency Thus, these systems cannot easily reason about the knowled e they have.",
        "The ovel feature of our system is that it is based on an inte awn at different levels of the knowledge of French.",
        "This knowledge is represented explicitly in the system and the system keeps track of the decisions it has made, which will allow it not only to justify its decisions but also to reason about its reasoning.",
        "The main problem is in the integration of knowledge of the language, knowledge which is at different levels: knowledge of orthography /Catach 1980/, of traditional grammar /Le nouveau Bescherelle 1980/ /Grevisse 1969/, of syntax /Grevisse 1969/ /Gross 1975/ /Boons, Guillet & Leclere 1976/ and also of the most frequently encountered errors /Catach, Duprez & Legris 1980/ /Class & Horguelin 1979/ /Lafontaine, Dubuisson & t Research funded by the Social Sciences Research Council of Canada (SSRCC grant no.",

        "In our system, these sources of knowledge are used as follows.",
        "Each sentence of the text is split up into words.",
        "Each word is categorized by dictionary look-up; knowledge of French orthography is represented as a collection of correction rules.",
        "An efficient parser, driven by a context-free grammar, builds a parse tree or a forest of parse trees in the case of ambiguity.",
        "This parser is deterministic in the sense that it blocks as soon as an error is detected.",
        "The parser can recall the spelling corrector, if need be.",
        "Then, knowledge of the sub-categorization of French verbs allows the system to eliminate automatically certain ambiguities and to detect and correct many errors.",
        "Finally, the user is consulted whenever the system cannot intervene.",
        "Before presenting the system in depth, we must emphasize that the system we have designed is intended to assist at the knowledge level and not at the competence level.",
        "It is not designed as a tool to improve written communication skills.",
        "The main subtasks of the system are as follows: word categorization by dictionary lookup and spelling correction, construction of a parse tree or of a forest of parse trees in cases of ambiguity, correction of syntax errors, detection and correction of morphological errors by processing the parse tree.",
