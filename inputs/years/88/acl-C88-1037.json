        "Natural language interfaces are being applied to various applications; most of them, especially data base and expert system interfaces, require the production of precise texts, One of the key problems of precision is the correct expression of quantifier type and scope.",
        "Our research has led us to identify a new practical method to express quantification in a precise and natural way and to implement our approach in the portable written French generator called Hermes (/Gailly 87a/ and /Gailly 87b/) to be integrated in a portable natural language interface (/Binot, Gailly & Rib-bens 86/).",
        "The generator's goal is to produce French sentences from a message (a representation of their meaning) expressed in Formula, a representation language based on an extension of first order predicate calculus.",
        "The main point of our approach is the identification of the importance of properly choosing the determiners in noun phrases in conjunction with the selection of the surface structure of the sentences produced.",
        "However, we must stress the fact that we are not trying to provide a theoretical and comprehensive study of how quantification is expressed in natural language (such as in the work of /Cooper 83/).",
        "In the rest of this paper we will first discuss the difference between the problems raised by quantification in parsing and generation, then discuss the present approaches to the problem and finally present our own approach."

        "In understanding, the problem is, starting from the input sentence, to identify the quantifier scope intended by the user.",
        "In presence of an ambiguous sentence, the system will use all available information (i.e. syntactic structure, word choice and order, semantic and pragmatic knowledge, context and dialog history) to find the most plausible quantifier order.",
        "Consider: Ex.",
        "1 Un homme meurt tons les soirs.",
        "In generation, the goal is to express the quantifier scope imposed by the input message correctly and as clearly as possible in order to avoid ambiguity.",
        "We should not rely on the user's domain knowledge but provide him with clear clues about quantifier scope.",
        "Therefore, we should never produce unclear sentences such as example 1."

        "At present, the problem seems to be solved in two ways:",
        "• By indenting the text produced, (especially in database query reformulation), in order to show the structure of the text (scope of quantifiers and propositional connectives) graphically.",
        "Though this method can prove useful in small scale applications (e.g. /De Roeck & Lowden 86/ and some commercial systems), in fact it avoids the problem.",
        "• By using word order' as suggested by /Chester 76/ and",
        "/Grishman 86/.",
        "The surface structure is chosen in such a way that the variable bound by the most dominating quantifier is generated as the leftmost noun phrase and so on.",
        "The \"word order\" method is not satisfactory.",
        "Though word order is kept unchanged in the following examples, different scopes are clearly indicated by choosing adequate determiners: Ex.",
        "3 Cheque chien poursuit en chat.",

        "Ex.",
        "4 Tousles chiens poursuivent un meme chat.",
        "(All dogs are chasing a same cat.)",
        "As far as French is concerned, /Colmerauer 77/ proposed a more extensive treatment of the subject for parsing.",
        "His approach is based on the syntactic function of noun phrases and word order.",
        "Again, this method is not satisfactory: determiner selection allows to express different scopes, keeping word order and syntactic functions unchanged: Ex.",

        "• A direct3 dominance relationship cannot be expressed between any pair of noun phrases occurring in the sentence but only between noun phrases involved in specific syntactic structures.",
        "• To each of these specific structures can be attached a weak default scope rule providing a partial and default ordering of the different noun phrases involved in the structure.",
        "• Adequate determiner selection (through a mechanism we call scope expression reinforcement) can either override the default ordering given by scope rules or turn the partial ordering into a total one if necessary.",

        "\"Cheque\" (\"each\" or sometimes \"every\")4 and \"tons les\" (\"all the\") both strongly indicate that all entities specified by the noun phrase participate in the semantic relationship with the element (e.g. the verb) they depend from.",
        "But \"chaque\" adds a distributive feature which indicates that there is a state or action for each entity described in the noun phrase and therefore has the effect of giving a dominant position to the corresponding universal quantifier.",
        "Using \"to us les\" adds a collective' feature and does not give this domination effect.",
        "This leaves the possibility for another quantifier to \"take\" the dominance.",
        "Other determiners express existential quantification, such as \"un\" (\"a\"), \"des\"' and \"un meme\" (\"a same\" or \"one\")7 etc.",
        "\"Un\" does not give any domination effect; obviously, \"un meme\" indicates that the entity described in the noun phrase and participating to the semantic relationship is the same for all states or actions described.",
        "This gives dominance to the corresponding existential quantifier.",
        "Let us now consider some examples and evaluate their quality as generated text:",
        "Obviously, examples 7 and 8 are clear and unambiguous; they provide distinct and adequate expressions for the two possible quantifier scopes.",
        "Example 9 is poor.",
        "Most readers understand it as having the same meaning as example 7 but some could understand it as example 8.",
        "Such a sentence is potentially ambiguous and generating such a sentence should be avoided.",
        "Example 10 is also poor because the dominance indications given by \"cheque\" and \"un inertia\" are contradictory.",

        "Our method could still be used but the reinforcement mechanism would only be invoked whenever the lack of reinforcement would produce an ambiguous sentence.",
