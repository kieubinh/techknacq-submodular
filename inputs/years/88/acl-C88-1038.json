        "Recent research suggests that human language processing can be profitably viewed in terms of the spread of activation through a network of simple processing units.",
        "Decision making in connectionist models such as these is distributed and consists in selections made from sets of mutually inhibiting candidate items which are activated on the basis of input features.",
        "In these models, however, there is the problem, especially for generation, of obtaining sequential behavior from an essentially parallel process.",
        "The thrust of this paper is that sequencing can also be modelled as a process of competition between candidates activated on the basis of input features.",
        "In the case of sequencing, the competition concerns which of a set of phrase constituents will appear in a particular output position.",
        "This account allows outpot ordering to arise out of the interaction of syntactic with semantic and pragmatic factors, as seems to be the case for human language generation.",
        "The paper describes a localized connectionist model of language generation, focusing on the representation and use of sequencing information.",
        "We also show how these same sequencing representations and mechanisms are usable in parsing as well."

        "The order in which the constituents of an utterance appear depends on two kinds of factors: language-specific conventions and more or less universal tendencies.",
        "Examples of conventions are the placement of relative clauses after nouns in English and the reverse ordering in Japanese.",
        "Some of these conventions are absolute: relative clauses always follow nouns in English.",
        "Others are only tendencies and can be overridden.",
        "For example, in English direct objects usually follow verbs, but they may also come at the beginnings of clauses.",
        "Universal tendencies include in particular the appearance relatively early in a clause of material which is primed in some way (Bock 1982).",
        "Such psychological considerations may be the sole factor determining an item's position, as often happens in languages with relatively free word order such as Russian.",
        "But they also come into play when there is a linguistic sequencing convention which is a tendency rather than an absolute constraint.",
        "Consider the case of the position of the arguments in ditransitive sentences in English.",
        "These sentences generally refer to an instance of some kind of transfer from one person to another.",
        "In such sentences the argument referring to the semantic OBJECT may precede or follow the argument referring to the RECIPIENT of the transfer.",
        "Other things being equal, if one of these arguments refers to something which has bean mentioned recently, it will tend to come first.",
        "This tendency explains the strangeness of sentences (lb) and (2b).",
        "(la) instead of calling John, Mary sent lila a irittaz.",
        "?",
        "(lb) Instead of calling John, Mary sent Letter to him.",
        "(2a) Instead of throwing away the letter, Mary sent it to .t.rohn ?",
        "(2b) Instead of throwing away the letter, Mary sent .John .",
        "One way to view this variation is in terms of competition between the two arguments to fill the position following the verb.",
        "One argument may have a head start if it has been primed in some way, in particular if its referent has just been mentioned.",
        "In the example sentences, the givenness of the referent results both in the priming that leads that NP to come first and in the realization of the NP as a pronoun rather than a full noun phrase.",
        "This explanation, in terms of competition for output positions, can account for other types of constituent order variation as well.",
        "An example is the alternative orders possible with transitive verb-plus-particle combinations in English: take eat the trash, take it Dig Thus sequencing is a phenomenon involving competition and quantitative tendencies rather than absolute constraints.",

        "Connectionism and Language Processing",
        "In recent years there has been increasing interest in cognitive models built on networks of simple processing units which respond to the parallel spread of activation through the network (Feldman & Ballard 1982, McClelland, Rumelhart, & the PDP Research Group 1986).",
        "In the area of natural language processing, these models, generally referred to as connectionist, have been shown to exhibit interesting properties not shared by more conventional symbolic approaches.",
        "In particular, connectionist approaches to language analysis (e.g., Cottrell & Small 1983, McClelland & Kawainoto 1986, Waltz & Pollack 1985) are able to model priming effects and the interaction of different knowledge sources in lexical access.",
        "There have been only limited attempts to apply connectionist models to language generation (e.g., Dell 1986, Kukich 1986) but the potential there is also clear.",
        "While generation is usually conceived of as a top-down process involving sequential stages, it also involves bottom-up aspects, a good deal of parallelism, and \"leaking\" between the various stages, in addition to the priming effects which are handled well by spreading activation approaches.",
        "Still, there are significant problems to be surmounted when treating language processing in a connectionist framework.",
        "An important one is the representation and utilization of information about the sequencing of constituents.",
        "While information about serial order is certainly a key element in parsing, it has been possible in existing connectionist parsing schemes to avoid dealing with this problem because of the limited sets of examples that are treated.",
        "Generation is another matter: no sentence can be generated without attention to the ordering of constituents.",
        "If connectionism is to succeed as an approach to human language processing, it must be possible to handle this sort of information within the confines imposed by the framework.",
        "This paper presents a localized connectionist model of language generation in which sequencing is dealt with in terms of basic features characteristic of these models: spreading activation, firing thresholds, and mutual inhibition.",
        "The same sequencing information is also usable during parsing.",
        "Most importantly, the approach offers a psychologically plausible account of sequencing in which syntactic and semantic factors interact to yield a particular ordering.",
        "The model is implemented in a program called CHIE which has been used to test the model's adequacy for a limited set of English and Japanese structures.",

        "The program also \"parses\" the structures that it generates using the same memory and the same basic procedures, but, as noted hi 3.3, it does not save a semantic interpretation; that is, it does not know how to create schema instantiations with role bindings.",

        "While not adhering strictly to any familiar theoretical framework, the present model has aspects in common with the Phrasal Lexicon approach, (e.g., Jacobs 1985, Zemik & Dyer forthcoming), with phrase-oriented work in linguistics and psycholinguistics (e.g., Fillmore, Kay, & O'Connor 1986, Pawley & Syder 1983, Peters 1983), with other localized connectionist models (e.g., Cottrell & Small 1983, Waltz & Pollack 1985), and with psychological models making use of spreading activation (e.g., Dell 1986, MacKay 1987).",
        "The approach described in this paper is apparently the first effort to model language generation totally within the connectionist framework.",
        "There have been more limited efforts, however.",
        "Kukich (1986) has looked at the distributed representation of phrases and law these might be learned; however, she does not consider interacting",
        "factors in sequencing.",
        "Dell (1986) has developed a psycholinguistic model using spreading activation for selecting candidate items, but his model deals mainly with effects at the level of morphology and phonology.",
        "Hasida, Ishizaki, and Isahara (1986) use a spreading activation mechanism to select important information for generating abstracts.",
        "We view these three areas of research as complementing our model.",
        "Unlike distributed connectionist models, e.g., those described in McClelland, Rumelhart, and the PDP Research Group (1986), memory in the present model is localized; that is, each concept is represented by a single memory node.",
        "This mode of representation ' brings with it certain disadvantages, in particular, the property that processing does not degrade gracefully when a portion of the memory is destroyed.",
        "On the other hand, the model maintains the constituency that is basic to symbolic models and the need for which, as Fodor and Pylyshyn (1988) argue, presents the most serious challenge to distributed models.",
        "It should be clear from this paper that constituency is fundamental to the way in which sequencing information is represented and used in the model.",
        "Within connectionist models the approach to sequencing adopted here is most similar to that suggested by Feldman and Ballard (1982) in that sequencing relations are represented explicitly in the form of connections.",
        "What we have done is elaborated on this approach to deal with the complications that arise in the generation of language, in particular, the interaction of semantic and syntactic effects in sequencing.",
        "In addition, our model appears to be the first connectionist model to make use of the same representation of sequencing information for generation and parsing (but see MacKay 1987 for a psychological theory with similar claims).",
        "Our work can also be constrasted with other approaches to syntax in language analysis.",
        "In some respects the flow of activation through entries such as *SEND and *SEND-MAIL resembles what goes on in recursive transition networks; however, there are three important differences.",
        "First, in this model syntax and semantics interact in processing, and the output of the system when used in parsing represents both a syntactic and a semantic analysis of the input.",
        "Second, the network can be used in both the generation and the parsing directions.",
        "Third, the formalism permits the representation and use of tendencies as well as absolute constraints regarding sequencing.",
        "8.",
        "Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have argued that since sequencing in language involves competition among various quantitative factors, it can be profitably modelled within a connectionist framework, and we have presented a localized connectionist scheme for representing and using sequencing information in language processing.",
        "Key features of the approach are the representation of phrasal units and their constituents as pairs of network nodes, one for the start and one for the end of the sequence; the representation of ordering constraints and tendencies as weighted connections; and the use of winner-take-all networks to impose sequentiality on a parallel spreading activation mechanism.",
        "The model has been tested for a small set of simple clause and NP types.",
        "It remains to be seen whether it can cover the range of sequencing constraints and tendencies found in human languages, for example, the requirement in German and Dutch that the verb appear in second position in clauses and the apparent total lack of syntactic ordering conventions in some Australian languages.",
        "We are currently attempting to extend the model to handle such features.",
        "We are also working on a means of incorporating backtracking (in both generation and parsing) into the model to simulate garden path effects.",
        "A further area of future research is the incorporation of a learning capability in the model, The major weakness of the model thus far is the need to hand-wire the memory network, in particular to set the weights on the connections.",
