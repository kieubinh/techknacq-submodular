        "[Cullingford 87] describes an MT system which is purely lexicon driven.",
        "His system follows the Conceptual Processing model, and is not Transfer-based, hence the emphasis there is on deep Analysis and Generation.",
        "Many other systems distinguish between Lexical Transfer and Structural 'Transfer, but they take different approaches to the actual separation of these two sub-processes.",
        "In the work reported here, an attempt was made to strictly separate lexicon-driven selection of target language equivalents from the global mapping of syntactic structures in the SLI into those of the 'FL (cf. [Ulmer 85]).",
        "Vie lexicon lookup phase, which takes place before phrase structure transformations, gets as its input the internal data representation provided by the SL parser (PEG [Jensen 86], in our prototype).",
        "The terminal nodes (leaves of a parse tree) are searched in a predefined order for certain parts of speech.",
        "For each word in turn a target equivalent is selected from the bilingual lexicon and attached to the corresponding node in the parse.",
        "Features may also be added to other affected nodes.",
        "I lowever, no structural modifications are made.",
        "Structural transformations are carried out as an independent sub-process, upon completion of the bilingual lexical phase, and are not discussed in this paper.",
        "Since in many cases, and in fact for most verbs, several alternative translations exist, the selection is done by lexical differentiation rules.",
        "These rules refer to the syntactic environment of the word in the parse tree and to a limited number of semantic features.",
        "The rules can access any node and attribute identified by the parser.",
        "Given that the rules are stated in terms of the SL phrase structure, it seems more natural to apply them as close to Analysis as possible.",
        "Nevertheless, the sense distinction cannot be done as part of SL Analysis itself, as in many cases it depends on factors which may vary from one '11_, to another.",
        "'Hie sub-process of bilingual lexical substitution proceeds unidirectionally.",
        "No iterations take place for any given phrase.",
        "In some cases this may require extensive searching of the phrase",
        "structure in a manner determined by the relevant differentiation rules.",
        "The differentiation rules which comprise an entry in the bilingual lexicon are stated in a special language, and are directly executable by a set of functions (LISP, in our implementation).",
        "Although the phrase attributes and features they can refer to are similar, to some extent, to what is done in certain other systems (see for example [Nagao 86]), it seems that action rules are more flexible and powerful than static form-oriented structures.",
        "In fact, each statement in the set of rules which comprises a given lexical entry defines a correspondence between a syntactic environment (with semantic decoration) in the source language and a translation into the target language.",
        "Consider, for example, one of the four rules which comprise the entry for the verb \"avoid\" in the English-I lebrew lexicon.",
        "This particular rule identifies the case where the current verb node (CN) has a postmodifier noun phrase and the head noun of that noun phrase has the semantic attribute Animate (e.g. \"She avoids her old father.\").",
        "In that case the Hebrew translation should be \"r) pnrirm\".",
        "In terms of the lexicon specification language and the attributes used by the PEG parser, the rule looks as follows: If ( CN has Postbrother ((CAT NP)(ANIMATE ) Then < Put (IIEB pnrinn\" ); > ; The put instruction attaches the I lebrew translation as a feature on the current node (CN is the default node assumed when no explicit node name is specified for put).",
        "Certain lexical rules can be simply and elegantly formulated in terms of functions which identify grammatical relations of various kinds.",
        "Thus, for example, the rule for translating the verb \"return\" can be specified in terms of the feature Passive, and the presence or absence of a direct object.",
        "The set of rules which follows makes the required distinction between the erga-tive (intransitive) sense and the transitive reading of the verb: Start RETURN VERB",
        "1 If (call OBJECT) Then < Put (H Ell \"-rttm\" );end;> ; @ Example: Ron returned the book.",
        "@ Example: The book was returned.",
        "2 Put (IIEB \"itri\" ); @ (this is the default translation) @ Example: Ron returned early.",
        "Finish",
        "Ideally, the feature OBJECT could be defined as part of the information provided by the parser.",
        "However, if for some reason the parser does not identify such relations, it can be defined as a function, written in the lexicon specification language described in this paper, which will evaluate the parse tree during Transfer.",
        "An example of such a function, which is included as a utility function in the active bilingual lexicon system, is given in [Golan 88], an extended version of this paper.",
        "This function tests a tree for the presence of a constituent which is the direct object of a given verb.",
        "If the verb appears in the passive voice, it assumes existence of a direct object (note that the active voice is selected for the Hebrew equivalent even in the passive case; passivization is done later in Generation).",
        "It may be necessary to define functions which identify more complex grammatical relations than the direct object of a given verb.",
        "It is, for example, necessary to refer to the relation 'head noun argument, with property P, of an adjective', when formulating the rule for an adjective like \"available\": Start AVAILABLE ADJ If (Call N-of-ADJ (HUMAN)) Then < Put WEB \"vin\" );>",
        "@ Example: The doctor is not available now.",
        "@ Example: Any available salesperson can help you.",
        "Else < Put (FIEB \"11V/1\" );>; @ Example: This book is available in every store.",
        "Finish",
        "The algorithm N-of-ADJ, given in detail in section 6 below, characterizes a parameterized function which identifies the head noun argument, with property P, of a given adjective.",
        "This algorithm is written in the lexicon specification language and is also included as a utility function in the lexicon system.",
        "Rules which employ this function can render the translation of an adjective dependent upon the modified noun phrase having specific attributes.",
        "It should also be noted that the function N-of-ADJ identifies the noun when the adjective acts as a pre-nominal modifier as well as when it appears in the VP predicative form.",
        "It is important to recognize that functions of this kind are useful to the extent that they can be employed in a significant number of lexical rules.",
        "There are, however, many cases in which the translation rules must be formulated directly as search procedures on trees.",
        "There are no obvious general grammatical functions which can be used to define the syntactic relations that must be tested in order to determine translation in these cases.",
        "Consider, for example, the set of rules for the adverb \"precisely\": Start PRECISELY ADVERB 1 If (CN has ancestor((CAT NP PP))) Then < Put (I I EB 1,1711\" );end;> ;",
        "@ Example: This is precisely the question.",

        "Finish",
        "The disjunctive relation of being the descendent of either an NP or a PP does not seem to be the sort of grammatical relation which one would wish to encode in a general grammatical function.",
        "Similarly, consider the set of rules below, which are part of the definition of the verb \"allow\".",
        "The case where this verb appears in an active voice and forms part of the verb-particle construction \"allow for\" are identified by searching the tree for the preposition \"for\" which may be the head of a possibly nonadjacent PP: I If ( CN has First Postbrother (name-l((CAT' PP)) has Son name-2((CAT PREP)(base \"for\")))) Then < Put (IIEB \"pm9na tips\" ); Put in name-2 (11EB \"\");end;> ;",
        "@ Example: Ron allowed for the results.",
        "2 If ( CN has Postbrother (A((CAT AVP))",

        "@ Example: Ron allowed reluctantly and cautiously @ for the results.",
        "In fact, the basic need to look for a non-adjacent particle is rather common.",
        "It may justify inclusion of generalized",
        "relations in the lexicon formalism.",
        "A generalized notion of \"postbrother\" will enable the statement of the sense distinction above as one rule.",
        "However, the detailed design of such generalized relations is very complex and is not yet included in our model.",
        "The \"allow for\" example presents yet another problem for translation.",
        "The Hebrew translation llama npir consists of two words which have individual verb and noun entries in the TL lexicon.",
        "If the target translation is a recognized collocation or idiom it can be specified as such in the 'FL lexicon.",
        "But there are cases where an SL entry must be rephrased in the TL as an ad-hoc combination of words which does not form a lexical entity.",
        "In that case the lexical rule must mark words with corresponding parts of speech, or provide alternative information which will serve later in Generation to properly decide on the required morphological manipulation.",
        "Generally, our experiments with actual lexical entries lead us to believe that the most efficient strategy for formulating lexical rules is to use a combination of general functions and rule-specific search procedures.",
        "A formal description of the specification language and a detailed example of its expressive power aro given in sections 5 and 6 below.",
        "The creation of a large scale full-fledged BL, lexicon is a very heavy task, impeding development of product level systems.",
        "There is no way to avoid it, but there are ways to facilitate the practical development of the lexicon by making the process more modular.",
        "The scheme presented in this paper enables the system lexicographers - and each individual user - to proceed in steps.",
        "As a first, rough, approximation, one may simply define one \"default translation\"; e.g., for the verb \"type\": Start TYPE VERB Put (HEM \"tPh`rn\" ); Finish This will account for the use of \"type\" in the sense of \"typewrite\".",
        "Later, other senses can be defined (e.g. \"IIro\", for \"classify\"), going from the most frequent in a given context to the relatively rare ones, thus achieving an increasingly refined level of sense specification.",
        "The optimal level of detail may depend on user needs and on specific text domains.",
        "In fact, different sense distinctions.",
        "may be required for different domains.",
        "The user can modify the lexicon accordingly, or define his/her own private addenda lexicon, overriding identical entries in the main lexicon.",
        "The lexicon of the system is accessible to revision by users.",
        "However, users cannot modify the global transformations which map syntactic structures in the SL into those of the TL, nor can they interfere with morphological aspects of Generation ('UL values in the bilingual lexicon are given in a canonical form; e.g. for Hebrew verbs: 3rd person - singular - past tense - active voice).",
        "Consequently, user influence is constrained in such a way that it cannot disrupt the functioning of the large scale architecture of the system, but can at most affect local changes of a lexically based nature.",
        "This is one obvious advantage of the strict separation between bilingual lexical transfer and general phrase structure transformations.",
        "Another benefit of this approach is the restriction of the structures that must be considered for transformations to standard, non-distorted SI, phrase structures, as provided by the 5'L parser.",
        "This eliminates complications and loss of generality of the structural transformations.",
        "Also, from a software engineering perspective, it is clearly advantageous to keep the two sub-processes independent of each other.",
        "However, the extent to which this separation can be maintained is not evident.",
        "In certain cases, e.g. when there is no simple way to preserve the part of speech in translation, lexicon-driven modifications of the phrase structure could facilitate the process.",
        "In such cases, which are fortunately not very common, we will consider attachment of \"transformation triggers\" to nodes, based on the bilingual lexicon processing.",
        "Technically, this can be easily done in our specification formalism.",
        "The lexical phase itself will not make any changes in phrase structure, and only one pass of structural transformations will still be required.",
        "Indeed, as [Melby 86] points out, the whole issue of lexical transfer and in particular the effect lexical transfer has on the overall quality of translation deserves further study."

        "The highest level of distinction in the bilingual lexicon is the part of speech.",
        "Within each part of speech one may distinguish different senses (and specify lexical rules) as required in light of 'FL sense distinctions.",
        "According to one initially plausible view, it is possible to make use of the subcategorization information present in standard monolingual dictionaries to obtain the necessary syntactic information for disambiguating different senses of words in the SL.",
        "In fact, we have found this view to be untenable.",
        "Thus, for example, among the 13 senses that [Longman 78] distinguishes for the verb \"hold\", many are mapped to the Hebrew verb \"1”trI11\", even when they belong to different syntactic categories as defined in Longman's system.",
        "On the other hand, consider the different uses of \"hold\" in the following sample sentences: - She is holding the baby - We held our breath in fear - We were holding a meeting Although Longman makes a distinction between the three senses (cases 1,3, and 13, respectively), all of them are classified as '1,1 verbs according to Longman's coding system, which is the only feasible instrument for computer reference.",
        "In Hebrew, different verbs must be used (\"p,trin\", \"iNv\", \"ty\", respectively).",
        "Moreover, even under the same sense (10), two sample sentences are given, which in Hebrew require different verbs: - What he said still holds (\"1pn\") - Can the good weather hold?",
        "(\"111913■1\") As a second example of the inadequacy of standard monolingual subcategorization, consider Longman's class of '1'3 verbs - verbs which take infintival complements with \"to\" and NP objects.",
        "E.g.:",
        "- want Ron to win ask Ron to leave - tell Rots to come",
        "However, each of the corresponding Hebrew verbs has a distinct subcategorization frame: - \"nvr mkt) river (want that Ron will win) - 'lib wpIri\" (ask from Ron to leave) - \"Nn'; inol\" (tell to Ron to come) Note that the form \"am), Vein\" (ask that Ron will leave) is also valid in I lebrew, but as a translation of \"ask that Ron leaves\" rather than \"ask Ron to leave\".",
        "Therefore, Transfer and not Generation seems to us the natural place to decide on the appropriate form.",
        "These examples illustrate the lack of isomorphism between subcategorization patterns for specific verbs in English and their counterparts in Hebrew.",
        "It is reasonable to expect that, generally, subcategorization is not invariant under translation between most SL-TL pairs (cf e.g. [Warwick 87]).",
        "As [Nagao 86] points out, \"it is not exceptional, but rather usual, that a verb of SL has to be translated into different target lexical items, even though the native speakers of SL cannot clearly realize the meaning difference\".",
        "Consequently, we have found it useful to construct_ algorithms which map lexical items, considering subcategorization properties and sense distinctions of both SL and TL.",
        "This is especially useful for verbs, but the same specification formalism is used for all other lexical categories, making use of syntactic information in different ways.",
        "We anticipate that the construction of a large scale lexicon will be facilitated by the existence in the SL of subclasses of items, in each lexical category, which have identical or highly similar subcategorization frames, and which correspond to items in the 'I'L with similar frames.",
        "The entries for the elements of such subclasses can be handled by algorithms whose statements have more or less the same selection conditions.",
        "In constructing the BL lexicon of our system we have followed a lexicalist view of syntax.",
        "In particular, our view of the interaction of the syntactic component and the lexicon in Transfer is inspired by the projection principle [Chomsky 1981].",
        "This principle states that the syntactic structure of a phrase (at any level of representation) is a projection of the argument structure imposed by the lexical entry of the head of the phrase.",
        "Mapping of a lexical item in the SL onto a counterpart in the TL depends upon a matching of the subcategorization frames of the two items.",
        "This matching requires recognition of an SL item in a tree as the head of a sub-phrase which satisfies the argument structure specified by the antecedent conditions of one of the statements in its lexical entry.",
        "Translation of any sub-clause begins with its head, as this determines the argument structure of the clause.",
        "It is necessary to qualify this characterization of our approach in an important respect.",
        "Although our algorithms are stated primarily in terms of the syntactic information provided by the parser, we have found it necessary to supplement this information with a restricted list of general semantic features.",
        "For example, consider the verb \"run\".",
        "On its intransitive use, it translates into I lebrew as \"y1\", while its transitive use corresponds to the Hebrew causative verb \"Innn\".",
        "However, intransitive \"run\" allows certain NP adverb complements, as in \"run a mile\".",
        "To identify these NPs as adverbial phrases and so preserve the intransitive sense of \"run\", we attach attributes Time or Distance to the entries of nouns like \"time\" and \"mile\" in the SL lexicon.",
        "The algorithm for \"run\" can then recognize it as having its intransitive sense when it takes only one complement and the head N of this NP contains one of these attributes.",
        "Features such as I I uman/N on-human, Concrete/Abstract, etc., and a small number of domain specific features (e.g. hardware device, software component, state, etc., for the domain of computer manuals) are also included.",
        "There is yet another kind of feature marker that we include in the SL lexicon, and which we call \"list marker\".",
        "These markers assist disambiguation in cases where a few nouns can be grouped together, usually for computational efficiency, although their common denominator has no obvious name.",
        "For example, in the sense distinction for the verb \"assume\", if the complement is an NP with a noun in the set [office, chairmanship, position,...], then the Hebrew verb-equivalent is different from other sub-cases of \"assume\".",
        "We give this group of nouns a name and mark the nouns in the group accordingly.",
        "Then one can refer to this name as a feature.",
        "Indeed, nouns in such groups have semantic similarities, and in principle, they are equivalent to traditional semantic markers.",
        "The point is that list markers can be formed in an ad-hoc fashion, without worrying about the generality of the group, or finding an appropriate label for it.",
        "The different mechanisms presented above provide, in fact, various levels of characterization of the relation between a given verb and a noun (or an NP) to which it refers: subcategorization requirement for the very existence of a noun (NP) in a given position (e.g. as a direct object); a more constricting requirement for the existence of a noun with specified semantic features (defined as such, or by means of lists, in the SL lexicon); and a particular requirement for the existence of a specific noun (or group of nouns).",
        "The sense distinction for multi-sense nouns (homonyms and polysemes) and other parts of speech is done according to basically the same strategy which we use for verbs; namely application of context-sensitive differentiating rules.",
        "Generally, nouns and adjectives are less ambiguous for translation, but the ambiguity, when it exists, is more difficult to resolve at the sentence level without extensive semantic and pragmatic knowledge.",
        "Still, many cases can be resolved by rules of the kind shown above.",
        "For example, although nouns, unlike most verbs, do not require complement structures, disambiguation in the source language can sometimes be facilitated by rules which refer to the presence of optional N complements.",
        "Consider, for example, the noun \"statement\".",
        "When it has a 'that' S' complement (\"a statement that Rina has been promoted\") it translates to Ilebrew \"IVIM\" when it occurs with a PP complement headed by \"of\" with an NP object headed by an inanimate noun (\"statement of the theory\"), it translates to \"Mon\".",
        "When sense distinction cannot be expressed in terms of our system (e.g. for the homonymous noun \"bank\"), we specify only the more common sense in the given text domain.",
        "In the future, we may mark such cases so that the information about the lexical ambiguity can be made available to an interactive disambiguation module.",
        "For adjectives, the characterization is done in most cases by reference to semantic features of the noun(s) they modify.",
        "In some cases different translations will be required for an adjective when it appears as a prenominal modifier or in the VP predicative form: - My old friend is not old \"IN 1)7N )5w •pn-nn inn\" The syntactic distinction between the two forms of \"old\", and the selection of the different Hebrew equivalents (\"Ipt\", \"irrn\"), are easy to specify in our formalism (cf. the definition of N-of-ADJ in section 6 below)."

      "heading": "4. Some Methodological Aspects",
      "text": [
        "From the discussion and examples above, it is apparent that our lexicon specifies bilingual information in great detail.",
        "This may seem to conflict with certain modern approaches to Transfer methodology, where the guiding view is \"small (and simple) is beautiful\".",
        "[Isabelle 86], [Arnold 87], and others, advocate an approach where the BL lexicon states only facts like:",
        "know -> wissen (in German; or \"savoir\" in French; or \"rnr75\" in Hebrew, when the verb takes a sentential object) know -> kennen (in German; or \"conaitre\" in French; or \"vnn5\" in I lebrew, when the verb takes a nominal object) The selection of the correct translation is then done in the Generation phase, based on restrictions on the target language.",
        "We claim that this approach is problematic for the following reasons.",
        "First, the \"know\" example, although widely quoted in the literature, is rather simplistic.",
        "Even in the monolingual subcategorization for \"know\" in [Longman 78], there are 15 different frames, many of which require a different verb, or verb-form, use of a preposition, or even a completely different syntactic structure in I lebrew.",
        "In addition, there are verb-particle and other collocations which would be quite difficult (and unnatural) to handle if decisions were postponed to the monolingual Generation (\"know of\", \"know better\", \"know X to be Y\", are some examples which hold not only for I Iebrew).",
        "It is not single words but patterns and structures that must be handled simultaneously.",
        "Second, one should note that the mechanism presented in this paper may also, in principle, be applied to Generation rather than Transfer; the conditions will then be stated in terms of the target language.",
        "By the same token, certain differentiating rules may be also applied as part of Analysis (or post-Analysis).",
        "However, we feel that the right place for this kind of processing is in Transfer.",
        "At least when the target and source languages are linguistically remote (as, for example, in the case of English and I lebrew), severely restricting the scope of BL, operations may result in loss of information vital for translation on the way to Generation; e.g. dependence on tense or voice, when the structural expressions of these properties are different in the SL and TL.",
        "Alternatively, such information could be carried forward to Generation, but then Generation loses its primarily monolingual nature.",
        "Allowing Transfer to pass forward alternative translations for SI, lexical entries, may result in a large number of possible sentence n anslations which must be handled by Generation.",
        "Even if conceptually viable, this strategy is computationally highly unattractive.",
        "A similar comment is often made in other contexts (e.g.",
        "Analysis - cf. [Stallard 87]).",
        "Finally, it should be emphasized that keeping Transfer small is not, in itself, the crucial issue.",
        "More important, it seems to us, is the isolation of bilingual considerations.",
        "(Isolation should not be mistaken for serialization of SL-BL-IL operations, which is not at all required.",
