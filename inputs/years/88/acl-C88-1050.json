        "In English there is one type of sentence that has caused major problems for practically all linguistic theories that have tried to explain it, and none of the explanations put forward is very convincing.",
        "The sentences in question are those with crossing conference, the so-called Bach-Peters-sentences.",
        "The standard examples are",
        "1) The hunter who shot at it hit in lion the chased him and, with explicit quantifier expressions: 2) Every man who wants it will get the prize he deserves",
        "What is the difficulty with this type of sentence?",
        "They contain two noun phrases each of which contains a pronoun that refers to the other noun phrase, and the first pronoun is furthermore a case of \"backwards anaphora\", or \"cataphora\".",
        "These sentences are admittedly rare, but sentences with simple (non-crossing) cataphora Mt quite frequent in real world English (Carden 1982).",
        "And Bach-Peters-sentences are nevertheless perfectly regular, and so they should find a natural explanation.",
        "Moreover, they arc key examples of sentences where cant-phora cannot, in principle, be replaced by anaphora (cf. also Mittwoch 1983).",
        "This is important because one of the standard approaches to cataphora has been to define it away as stylistic variant of anaphora, which can be \"rectified\" by a simple transposition.",
        "In other words: Since we have to find a way to explain cataphora for Bach-Peters-sentences anyway, we can save us the trouble to devise such tricks for the simpler cases."

        "The non-reducibility of cataphoric to anaphoric pronouns in Bach-Peters-sentences becomes clear if we try to explain them in the traditional manner.",
        "It seems that both of the two traditional interpretations of pronouns, the \"descriptional\" as well as the \"denotational\" one, fail to explain the intuitive truth conditions of Bach-Peters-sentences.",
        "In Transformational Grammar the descriptional approach is taken, and pronouns are always expanded to the surface syntax form of the noun phrase they anaphorietAly refer to (in other words, pronominalization is an obligatory cyclic rule).",
        "But then we get, for the example above, a double infinite embedding of relative clauses: The hunter who shot at (the lion that chased (the hinter who shot at (the lion that chased ...))) hit the lion that chased (the hunter who shot at (the lion that chased (the hunter who shot at ...))) This analysis is patently useless.",
        "Karttunen shows (Karttunen 1971) that dropping the requirement that pronominalization is a cyclic rule alleviates the problem somewhat, but at a cost: It would make sentence 1 derivable from (at least) two different deep structures, viz. from the deep structures corresponding to the sentences This would mean that 1 has to he ambiguous between the meanings of 3 and 4.",
        "This is what Kartninen assumes, but it is a highly dubious claim as Karttunen himself seems to feel (Kai-omen 1971:167 f.).",
        "Moreover, the structure of 1 could also be derived from a deep structure corresponding to 5) The hunter who shot at the lion hit the lion that chased the hunter But this sentence is considered by many informants to 1w simply ungrammatical (Karttunen 1971:178), and it is not acceptable at all under the coreference relations that should obtain between the noun phrases.",
        "Finally, the assumption that I is three ways ambiguous between 3, 4 and 5 is unacceptable, too, In order to show this, and in order to understand better what these three sentences really mean, we can use a set of data bases (after Karttimen 1971) which either contain, or do not contain, well-defined referents for the various definite noun phrases occurring in the example sentences.",
        "We will see that 1 is not ambiguous between 3 and 4, but that the three sentences have three distinct meanings which can be derived directly from their syntactic structure.",
        "This proves, at the same time, that camphoric pronouns are irreducible in Bach-Peters-sentences.",
        "Let us first consider the definite noun phrase \"the hunter who shot at the lion that chased him\" (front 3) consisting of an embedding of two definite noun phrases.",
        "Since each singular definite noun phrase presupposes that there is a unique referent for it, this phrase can refer to a pair \"bunter I I - lion I..\" in the case where lion L is the only lion chasing hunter II, and this hunter 14 shot at this very lion L. in the following data base (Karttunen 1971:166) there is one such pair.",

        "But how can this unexpectedly straightforward solution be explained?",
        "The main problem that McCawley's representation, and Dik's modification of it, tried to overcome was: How can variable values be communicated into iota-expressions from the outside, despite the fact that, in First Order Logic, variables within the scope of an operator or quantifier are shielded from the outside?",
        "Now, in Horn Clause Logic all variables of a clause are, implicitly, universally quantified (which means that variables in a query, i.e. in a negated clause, are existentially quantified), and the scope of the implicit quantifiers is the entire clause.",
        "The bindings of variables \"spread\" throughout the clause, irrespective of how deep a variable may be embedded.",
        "This also applies to the setof-operator: All its variables are accessible from the outside, within the given clause.",
        "The variables can, of course, still be unbound when the evaluation of the setof-expression begins, and then it is the evaluation of the setof-expression that will establish bindings for these variables.",
        "But they can also get bound elsewhere, before the operator is used, and \"spread forward\".",
        "And then a proof of the setof-expression treats these pm-established bindings as constraints to be satisfied.",
        "This is the Prolog way to implement the cataphoric pronoun in Bach-Peters-sentences.",
        "In this, last, respect the setof-operator in Prolog is treated as just another predicate, and its being second order is irrelevant.",
        "The difference is that the interpretation of the setof-operator uses Prolog's meta-call facility.",
        "Or, to put it differently: A piece of code (the entries in the second argument of the setof-operator) is first treated as \"data\" (variable bindings are communicated with the outside world), and then it is treated as a piece of \"program\" that is executed (using the variable bindings that are established at this point in time).",
        "And in this the Prolog setof-operator differs fundamentally from the iota-operator as used in First Order Logic.",
        "The iota-operator has, as far as variable binding is concerned, the same force as a quantifier: A variable in its scope is immune from any outside interference.",
        "Now it is clear why we need not repeat any expressions in the representation of the example sentences, and yet the variables all get properly bound: In the example above, the two terms of 18 (i.e. the setof-expression and the expression \"hit(TH,TL)\") are part of the same clause, and values for variables created in either of them will spread to the other.",
        "In particular, the value which the variable \"TL\" takes during the evaluation of \"shot_at(H,TL)\" is still available during the evaluation of the embedded \"setof(L,(lion(L),chased(L,TH)),ITL1)\", and later during the evaluation of \"hit(TH,TL)\"."

Kamp 1981, Kamp 1983, Frey 1983, Guenthner 1983, Guenthner 1985, Kolb 1985, Guenthner 1986, Pinkal 1986, Root 1986) this will not do for the sentences with embedded definite noun phrases considered above.",
        "We must somehow represent this embedding.",
        "And we must, obviously, provide for die interpretation rules to use them.",
        "These rules will crucially rely on Prolog's meta-call facility to implement the double use of embedded set-expressions, as data structures on the one hand and as \"executable procedures\" (i.e. as provable assertions) on the other.",
        "In traditional DRT mostly indefinite and universal noun phrases (and proper names) are used while the Bach-Peters-sentences considered above all contained definite noun phrases.",
        "But for some of them there are versions with indefinite noun phrases, too, and all of them have corresponding plural versions.",
        "In order to cover all these cases we must introduce, instead of the \"conditions\" of DRT, generalised set expressions without the totality implication of Prolog's \"seta\" (cf. also Webber 1983).",
        "We use \"set(Def,Card,Gdr,Var,Int,Ext)\", where \"Def\" can take the values \"def'(inite) or \"indef\"(inite), and \"Card\" either an explicit number, \"plur\", or a quantifying expression (\"all\", \"some\" etc.).",

        "So far we have mentioned how pronouns correspond, statically, to certain semantic objects of our modified DRSs (i.e. to the level-crossing occurrences of variables).",
        "But it is one of the main goals of DRT to give a unified account of what the procedures that actually perform the resolution of pronouns should look like.",
        "This problem is much harder than the converse one, i.e. the mapping of level-crossing variables onto pronouns.",
        "The central idea used here by DRT is simple (it goes back to Karttunen, together with the term \"discourse referent\"): Indefinite noun phrases in \"assertive\" contexts create discourse referents which \"live on\", and which can be accessed by anaphoric expressions from points later in the sentence or discourse.",
        "Discourse referents, however, that are created by indefinites in universal, conditional, and negative contexts, \"die off' when the sentence in which they occur is processed.",
        "This idea corresponds closely to Prolog's concept of variables and Skolem constants (the latter standing for existentially quantified variables): During the interpretation of a program variables remain accessible by name within the clause where they occur.",
        "This corresponds to the limited lifespan of discourse referents created in universal, conditional, and negative contexts.",
        "For Skolem constants in Prolog, however, the scope is the entire program; they \"live forever\", in the same way as discourse referents created by indefinites in assertive contexts.",
        "And whenever a (definite) pronoun or definite noun phrase is encountered, a suitable antecedent must be located among the discourse referents still \"alive\".",
        "Its value is then replaced by the value of the discourse referent found.",
        "If several pronouns access the same discourse referent, they get, of course, the same value, This is the DRT counterpart of unification.",
        "If we want to have, in our modified notation, discourse referents \"float on the sur-face\" of the corresponding DRSs, accessible for later anaphoric reference, we could write, for the indefinite version of 3, viz. \"A hunter who shot at a lion that chased him hit it\"",
        "But there are fundamental differences between the treatment of variables in Prolog and DRT: During the interpretation of a Prolog program, bindings of a given variable spread throughout a clause to all occurrences of the same name, forwards and backwards.",
        "DRT, however, allows only forwards, \"anaphoric\", spreading of values.",
        "Since a pronoun is processed as soon as it is encountered, it can \"look for\" antecedents exclusively in the DRSs built up by the preceding discourse.",
        "The interpretation procedures of DRT thus implement, implicitly, the syntactic rule that a pronoun can refer anaphorically to a preceding noun phrase that c-commands it.",
        "Because this is, at the same time, the only case where anaphora is allowed, these interpretation rules block, correctly, cataphora from the pronoun to the indefinite noun phrase in 23) He said that a boy had taken the book But legitimate cases of cataphora, such as those in Bach-Peters-sentences, are blocked by these interpretation rules of DRT, as well.",
        "Hence we must weaken the accessibility restrictions for anaphoric pronominal references somewhat, but not too much: If we modelled them on Prolog's unrestricted variable sharing, 23 would go through in its coreferential reacting.",
        "Accessibility rules of DRT not only block certain correct interpretations, they also allow certain blatantly incorrect ones.",
        "They would allow, for instance, the sentence above with a definite noun phrase, i.e. 24) He said that the boy had taken the book to get an interpretation where pronoun and definite noun phrases are coreferential.",
        "Why?",
        "The correct interpretation of this sentence (no coreference between \"he\" and \"the boy\") requires that the definite noun phrase will be able to find an antecedent among the pm-existing discourse referents.",
        "But then the sentence-initial \"he\" would be equally capable of accessing them, and fins would allow the prohibited coreferential, cataphoric, reading of the \"he\" (i.e. \"pseudo-cataphora\" via a common antecedent).",
        "The same thing holds for \"He hit the lion that chased the hunter who shot at it\".",
        "The prohibited reading of this type of sentence can be ruled out on the basis of purely syntactic information.",
        "The standard rule about pronouns says that a pronoun cannot be coreferential with an noun phrase if it both precedes and c-commands it.",
        "This rules out the cataphoric use of a pronoun if it c-commands its target noun phrase but it allows cases of cataphora such as 25) When he got up, John felt hungry (which are reducible to anaphora) as well as Bach-Peters-sentences (which are not), but it blocks the prohibited coreferences in \"He hit the lion that chased the hunter who shot at it\" and \"He said that the boy had taken the book\".",
        "Mittwoch (1983) has shown that these purely syntactic criteria are not sufficiently general to cover all relevant occurrences of cataphora.",
        "In many cases, discourse considerations are needed to explain why cataphora is allowed.",
        "The pronoun can occur, for instance, in a sentential constituent which is demoted, by explicit discourse subordination markers, to a lower position than warranted by syntax.",

        "(from Macleod 1984, quoting from \"Time\") the \"but\", together with the modal \"may\", even manages to make cataphora acceptable from a sentence initial subject position (at least in journalese).",
        "The common element of all these examples of cataphoric pronouns is that they occur in discourse conditions.",
        "In simple cases this coincides with sentential conditions (\"if\" etc.",
        "), and very often with sub-sentential conditions (in particular with postmodifiers of noun phrases, such as restrictive relative clauses, prepositional phrases, or nonfinite clauses).",
        "Ilia the picture is complicated by the fact that the \"antece(lent\" of cataphora flutist be definite if the sentence is specific.",

        "Noun phrases create set expressions (the \"conditions\" of standard theory): Indefinite and definite noun phrases give rise to normal set expressions, while pronouns create set expressions of a special type, Indefinite noun phrases give rise, in addition, to discourse referents, which are, deposited in the DRS under construction.",

        "Definite set expressions derived from full noun phrases without conditional modifiers, as well as those derived front definite pronouns, arc evaluated as soon as they are created, i.e. they try to find their antecedents among the preexisting discourse referents.",

        "So far nothing really new.",
        "But now the first modification of standard theory is needed: Definite full noun phrases arc not allowed to look for filchi antecedents inside the DRS still under construction, whereas pronouns may do SO.",
        "Second, when any definite noun phrase (full noun phrase or pronoun) has found die correct discourse referent, it drags it into the DRS tinder construction.",
        "These two changes make sure that two full noun phrases within the same clause are never interpreted as coreferential.",
        "They also block cataphora in \"Ile said that a boy had taken the book\" (the \"he\" has dragged the appropriate discourse referent into the DRS, where it is \"invisible\" to the subsequent \"the boy\").",
        "And, finally, it brings a discourse referent accessed by a definite noun phrase into focus and makes it the [Mine candiate for subsequent anaphoric reference by pronouns.",
        "The third modification to standard DR'l' is this: Because pronouns ill non-generic contexts require definite noun phrases as antecedents (see examples 28 to 31), discourse referents must also carry information about the definiteness of the noun phrase from which they were derived.",
        "Set expressions derived from pronouns will use this information to determine whether a given discourse referent is a possible antecedent.",
        "Thefourth modification, finally, takes care of cataphora: Whenever an expression denoting a condition (on the discourse, sentence, or sub-sentential level) is encountered, no embedded DRSs are created (as it is done in standard Dia for \"if\"- and \"every\"sentences) and the production of discourse referents goes on, but evaluation of all new set expressions is suspended.",
        "In particular, no further attempts at anaphora resolution are made, and all pronouns encountered from now on are stored M the DRS under construction as unevaluated set expressions.",
        "It is only when the end of die clause is reached that unevaluated set expressions are processed.",
        "Among die set expressions and discourse referents \"in suspended animation\" within a DRS, any reference (backwards and forwards) is permitted, as long as the conditions outlined above are fulfilled.",
        "This allows cataphora to be modelled, while the classical syntactic restrictions (cataphora only front a non c-commancling constituent) are subsumed.",
