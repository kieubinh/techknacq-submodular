        "In addition to its literal meaning, a sentence or utterance conveys a host of indirect information that can be pragmatically inferred.",
        "Presuppositions, which we mark \">\", are one part of that information.",
        "Table 1 gives several examples of presupposition with their traditional analysesl.",
        "Roughly, a presupposition is a proposition that is conveyed by a sentence or utterance2 but is not part of the main point, and must be consistent with the established context in order for that sentence or utterance to be felicitous.",
        "For example, the following is infelicitous because the second sentence presupposes that Angie quit, which contradicts the first sentence: (1) *Angie didn't quit.",
        "It's surprising that she quit.",
        "Other types of pragmatic inference include entailment, conversational implicature, and conventional implicature (see Levinson (1983) for detailed descriptions).",
        "Presuppositions can be distinguished from other sorts of pragmatic inference by their unique behavior when the sentence from which they originate is negated.",
        "These basic ideas are generally agreed upon; however, their formalization into a theory of presupposition has been difficult.",
        "We will now introduce two problems and our approach to solving them.",
        "1 Throughout this paper, we use the sentence itself as short form for its semantic representation, in order to avoid addressing the orthogonal issue of semantic representation.",
        "2 The sentence/utterance distinction will be made clear in the presentation of our approach.",
        "Horton (1987) reviews several theories, including those of Karttunen (1973, 1974), Karttunen and Peters (1979), Weischedel (1975, 1979), Gazdar (1979a, 1979b), Wilson and Sperber (1979), and Atlas and Levinson (1981).",
        "One problem is that many theories of presupposition implicitly make the following unrealistic assumptions3:",
        "• Truth Assumption: If sentence S (or its utterance) presupposes proposition P, then P is true.",
        "• Shared Belief Assumption: If sentence S (or its utterance) presupposes proposition P, then all agents involved share the prior belief that P is true.",
        "Weischedel and Gazdar are exceptions; each of them attributes presuppositions to the speaker as either knowledge or belief.",
        "However, we will show that the beliefs of agents other than the speaker must be considered in order to correctly express many presuppositions.",
        "Our approach is to treat presuppositions as beliefs, but also to consider the beliefs of all agents involved in discourse.",
        "A second difficulty has been in finding an adequate definition of presupposition.",
        "Many definitions state that the presuppositions of a sentence must be known prior to the utterance of that sentence to avoid infelicity.",
        "Some have the stronger constraint that the presuppositions must be mutually known by all participants.",
        "The following definition (Levinson 1983, 205) has these properties:",
        "DEFINITION 1: An utterance A pragmatically presupposes a proposition B iff A is appropriate only if B is mutually known by participants.",
        "These requirements, which reflect the Shared Belief Assumption, are too strict – presuppositions are often used to introduce new information.",
        "Conversely, many definitions accept inferences from the other inference classes as presuppositions.",
        "Our definition, to be presented in section 3.2, weakens the overly strict prior knowledge condition so that it does not reject valid presuppositions, and avoids accepting inferences from other classes by checking whether each candidate exhibits the distinctive behavior under negation that signifies a presupposition.",
        "Hence, the new definition captures presupposition more precisely.",
        "The next section describes the unique behavior of presuppositions under negation.",
        "In section 3 the details of our",
        "approach are presented.",
