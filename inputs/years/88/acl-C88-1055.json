        "A better model is one in which the candidates exist not as distinct choices but as assumptions contributing to a complete meaning representation.",

        "The idea of TRUMP is to use a combination of \"core\" knowledge about language and certain specialized knowledge to produce a complete semantic interpretation.",
        "In each of the examples, the italicized word or phrase represents a vague, ambiguous, or metaphorical verb sense.",
        "The problem for a good semantic interpreter is to derive the real or intended sense of each phrase without excessive computation or specialized knowledge.",

        "If other inter",

        "The requirements above suggest a model of language understanding that progressively refines a semantic interpretation, based on linguistic and contextual information, but that incorporates into each specific interpretation knowledge upon which that interpretation builds.",
        "In other words, the ultimate goal of the system is to produce the most specific consistent interpretation, and the means of achieving that goal is to treat each interpretation as an assumption.",
