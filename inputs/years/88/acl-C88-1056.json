        "The ideological underpinning of local dependency parsing is to focus on adjacent word pairs and see if a binary dependency relation holds between them.",
        "The words of a sentence have various attributes in our parser.",
        "Some of the attributes have been extracted by a morphological preprocessor /Jdppinen and Ylilamnd 1986/, while others are tagged during the parsing process.",
        "Local Government Let <w1 w2...wn> be an ordered list of words.",
        "We say that a word wi locally governs another word wj iff j = iel or i+1 and wi R wj, where R is a binary dependency relation such that wi is the governor (or the regent) of the pair awd.wj is the dependant.",
        "In other words, a word locally governs another one if they are adjacent (at the moment of the testing) and a dependency relation holds between them.",
        "The governor alone represents its government: once a local government has been established between two adjacent words the dependant is linked with the governor and disappears thereafter from sight.",
        "An elementary destructive processing step takes place, reducing the number of visible words by one (shown by arrows in Fig. 1).",
        "Government is transitive.",
        "If wi locally governs wj, and wj locally governs wk, then wi governs wk.",
        "Government is also antisymmetric and irreflexive.",
        "Locally Governed Trees Due to the destructive processing step explained above, a governor gets a new neighbor immediately after a local government has been built.",
        "This new neighbor qualifies for a local government as well.",
        "A single word may therefore locally govern a number of other words, and two initially distant words may later on establish a local government between themselves.",
        "If a word is the governor of several words simultaneously, we say that it governs a locally governed tree of depth one (IGT-1).",
        "In fact, we can view a (binary) local government as a LGT-1 having just a single branch.",
        "IGT-1's are elementary trees.",
        "Relational trees which preserve the locality principle and can reach arbitrary depth are called locally governed trees (IGT).",
        "LGT's are defined recursively as follows: i.",
        "Any IGT-1 is a LGT.",
        "ii.",
        "A tree formed by a word which locally governs LGT's is itself a LGT.",
        "Let <wi w2 wn> be a sequence of words.",
        "If there exists a LGT which governs all the words, the IGT is a parse tree of the words.",
        "Figure 1 portrays two parse trees.",
        "Parsing Strategy In the implemented parser the parsing strategy is based on the following two control principles: (1) parsing focuses first on the leftmost word (the initial word principle); (2) the parser always tries first to establish a focused word as a governor to its left neighbor and then shifts focus to the right neighbor (preferred direction principle).",
        "The resulting parsing strategy is a left-corner-up strategy.",
        "The strategy is tuned to efficiently bind prepositional attributes as dependants.",
        "THE MACHINE We have designed and implemented a parsing system for IGT's. The underlying abstract machine has one focus register and two stacks which hold the left and the right contexts of the focused word, respectively /Nelimarkka et al.",
        "1985/.",
        "locality is enforced by permitting a focused word to bind dependants only from top of either stack - the left stack being preferred.",
        "The machine has also instructions for contextual testing.",
        "These tests may penetrate the stacks.",
        "THE SOFTWARE A high-level language FUNDPL (Functional Dependency Parsing Language) was designed for parsing locally governed trees /Jappinen et al.",
        "1986b/.",
        "A precursor was a more procedural language DPL /Nelimarkka et al.",
        "1985/.",
        "The system includes a compiler and supporting programming environment for the developmental work /Lehtola et al.",
        "1985/.",
        "A grammar description has three parts in FUNDPL.",
        "The initial part declares data types.",
        "The second part describes valid binary dependency relations.",
        "For each named binary relation the user specifies valid word pairs using morphological and/or lexical attribute values.",
        "The notation permits concise use of boolean operations on attributes.",
        "The third part of a grammar description defines a set of functional schemata.",
        "Functional schemata have both declarative and procedural readings.",
        "From the declarative point of view, functional schemata define a set of valid LGT-1's. Each schema describes a regent and its possible local governments.",
        "A local government is either mandatory or optional, and an optional one may recur.",
        "By default the surface ordering of local governments is free.",
        "Sometimes stringent ordering constraints exist between local governments; sometimes it is advantageous to give probabilistic information about the ordering of positionally free governments.",
        "Such structural information may be written in a schema.",
        "Schemata have also procedural reading which is yet another distinguishing feature from phrase structure rules.",
        "A schema actively controls the build-up of the LGT-1 it represents.",
        "From the procedural viewpoint a schema monitors function calls of local governments using blackboard control regime /Valkonen et al.",
        "1987/.",
        "THE SEARCH PROBLEM OF PARSING ARBITRARY LGT'S To discover a parse tree for an arbitrary LGT is a complicated search process even in a bottom-up strategy (in top-down problems would be worse).",
        "The basic problem is this: how does an algorithm know on which level in the hierarchy a given word belongs to?",
        "That is, when parsing proceeds from left to right and an attempt is made to establish the right neighbor of a governor as a dependant, the link is possible only if that word is not a governor of a yet incomplete LGT.",
        "Our left-corner-up strategy occasionally has to invoke complex search for this reason.",
        "If a language constrains the structures of its possible LGT's, LGT's become computationally much more economical devices.",
        "The problem discussed above does not arise with constituent grammars and phrase structure rules because these rules indicate hierarchy implicitly through the naming of the constituents.",
        "CONSTRAINED LGT'S Finnish is a highly inflectional, agglutinating language.",
        "Both verbs and nominals have numerous distinct surface forms which distinguish between different syntactic functions the words can have in sentences.",
        "Word forms carry, among other things, such syntactic information which in configurational languages is indicated by the precedence relation.",
        "Word order in Finnish is relatively free.",
        "The basic Finnish sentence configuration is SVO: a subject LGT is followed by a verb, an object LGT, and possible adverbial IGT's. Topicalization, wh•movement, and other movements create variations to this basic configuration.",
        "The shape of nominal IGT's is markedly distorted.",
        "They have almost all modifiers on their left hand side forcing them to lean to the right.",
        "The most important modifiers are adjectival and genitive.",
        "Adjectival attributes modify the head noun iteratively, as in the phrase (1).",
        "(1) Nuori pitka viehattava tytt8 Young tall charming girl",
        "Genitive attributes, themselves nominals, modify head nominals recursively, as in the phrase (2).",
        "(2) TytBn isan ty8nantajan auto Girl (gen) father (gen) employer (gen) car (A/the girl's father's employer's oar) Other prepositional modifiers for nouns are quantifiers and demonstrative pronouns.",
        "Prepositional modifier types can be mixed (under certain restrictions) as in the phrase (3).",
        "(3) Taman nuoren viehattavan tytOn vanha kiero isa This young charming girl (gen) old crooked father (non)",
        "(This young charming girl's old crooked father) Prepositionality of Finnish is also demonstrated by the fact that postpositions are common but prepositions rare.",
        "Nouns have also occasional postpositional nominal modifiers, but these modifiers can be governed only by the maximal nominal heads of a IGT (the governors which fill the valencies of verbs) or by another postpositionally modifying LGT.",
        "For example, the nominal phrase (4) (4) suuren miehen pieni auto talon takana big man (gen) small car (non) house (gen) behind (a/the big man's small car behind the house) has the LGT shown in Fig. 2.",
        "The postpositionally modifying adverbial LGT \"talon takana\" (behind the house) cannot modify the genitive attribute: *suuren miehen talon takana pieni auto.",
        "AN EFFICIENT PARSING ALGORITHM FOR LGT'S The basic left-corner-up algorithm can be modified so that it hierarchically first builds nominal LGT's without postpositional modifiers, then LGT's governed by prepositions and postpositions, then nominal LGT's with postpositional modifying nominal LGT's, and finally the LGT governed by the finite verb.",
        "The structural constraints of LGT's prune search, and it can be proved that the algorithm then parses unambiguous sentences in linear time.",
        "The following restrictions are assumed: i. Adjectives, quantifiers, and adverbs have only prepositional modifiers.",
        "ii.",
        "Nouns have postpositional modifiers only on the maximal level.",
