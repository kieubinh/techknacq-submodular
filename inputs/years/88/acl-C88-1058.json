        "The approach concentrates on distinguishing predicate coordination from other types of coordination and suggests that low-level structural cues (such as the number of predicates, coordinators, and subordinators occurring in the input string) can be exploited at little cost during the early phase of the parse, with dramatic results.",

        "b. John hits Fred and the other guys attack him.",
        "c. When John hits Fred and the other guys attack him.",
        "Many variations on this theme are possible, to the point where serious doubts are raised regarding the efficacy in this domain of conventional parsers of either the top-down or bottom-up variety.",
        "In such parsers, it is necessary either to invoke backtracking to undo the effects of incorrect hypotheses or to store large numbers of alternatives until local indeterminacies are resolved.",
        "In this paper, we will suggest an alternative approach based on the `Reconnaissance-Attack' model described in Kac et al.",

        "On the one hand, it does not present a detailed picture of an actual parsing algorithm, being intended rather to show that a significant body of linguistic data supports the contention that rapid, early resolution of local structural indeterminacies of the kind exemplified in (1) is feasible in the vast majority of cases.",
        "On the other hand, it is also based on a significant idealization, namely that each word belongs to only one syntactic category.",
        "Our intent is, in part, to show the applicability to a difficult parsing problem of a technique which can he found in other Al domains (Kowalski 1979) but which seems to have been little exploited in work on natural language processing'."

        "In a Reconnaissance-Attack parser, no structure-building is attempted until after an initial 'overflight' of the entire sentence has been made, directed at obtaining information, provided by low-level structural cues, which can then be exploited in narrowing the range of available options at a later point.",
        "(We assume here that the cues used are present in a minimally analyzed string, by which we mean one about which the only structural information available concerns the relative order and category membership of the individual words.)",
        "It is of the utmost importance to bear in mind that in this approach, if a given case cannot be resolved at a given point in the parse, there is no guessing as to which type of coordination might obtain and hence no need to backtrack for the purpose of undoing the effects of erroneous hypotheses; rather, the parser simply defers the decision to a later phase at which more structural information is available.",
        "Note as well that this is not 'bottom-up' parsing in the usual sense either, since where more than one possibility is logically available, the parser makes no attempt to represent them all and cull out the false positives later on; there is a strict principle of 'altruism avoidance' (that is, never undertaking computational effort without a guaranteed payoff) which compels the parser to give no answer at all during 'The approach described in Sampson 1986, while quite different in its actual character, is nonetheless similar in spirit to what we are proposing.",
        "a particular phase if more than one answer is possible in principle given the information available to that point.",
        "(If, at the end of the process, unresolved indeterminacies remain, ambiguity is predicted.)",
        "Intuitively, the difference between Reconnaissance and Attack is that Reconnaissance constitutes the gathering of information while Attack constitutes anything which involves decision-making.",
        "More formally, Reconnaissance can be viewed as a series of parameter-setting operations each of which is done independently of any of the others while Attack requires simultaneous access to all parameters.",
        "It is worth noting that there does not appear to be any reason to exclude in principle the possibility of hybrid models in which principles of the sort we shall develop below are invoked prior to the application of a parser along the lines of those described in e.g. Dahl and McCord 1983 or Fong and Berwick 1985.",
        "Our principal contention is that whatever choices are made about how to go about 'parsing proper' (that is, actually building a syntactic representation for an input sentence), there is an advantage to having certain global structural information already available rather than starting 'blind'.",
        "Following Kac 1978 and 1985, we subsume under a single rubric of 'predicate coordination' the coordination of verbs, VP's, and S's on the rationale that common to all three types is that they have the effect of rendering predicates `equiordinate' (that is, so related that neither is sub or superordinate to the other).",
        "In e.g. (2) I believe that John likes Mary and Harry admires Sue.",
        "the verbs likes and admires are both subordinate to believe but neither is subordinate to the other.",
        "Similarly, in a sentence like (lb) above, hits and attacks are both 'topmost' in the ordination scheme.",
        "(For a more detailed development of the theory of ordination relations, see Rindflesch forthcoming.)",
        "In this approach a distinction is made between STRICT and LOOSE coordination (two coordinate expressions are strictly so if separated by at most a conjunction, loosely coordinate otherwise, as in e.g. John and Mary ran vs. John ran, and Mary (too) ) and also between PRIMARY and SECONDARY coordination.",
        "The primary coordinates in a coordinate structure are the largest coordinate expressions (e.g. the S's in sentential coordination), while the secondary coordinates are smaller expressions contained in the primary ones taken (by the theory) to be coordinate by virtue of the coordination of the containing expressions; for example, the predicates of coordinate sentences (both VP's and V's) are secondary coordinates in a sentential coordination.",
        "For purposes of parsing, we assume that the first task is to coordinate WORDS rather than the larger expressions containing them; that is, secondary coordinates are sought first, and the primary coordinates in which they appear are identified later.",
        "This is consistent with the overall theoretical approach, described in more detail in Rindflesch op.",
        "cit., which is much more akin to dependency syntax than to phrase structure analysis.",

        "In the earliest stages of parsing a given sentence containing a coordinating conjunction, each conjunction is identified as either (a) definitely involved in a predicate coordination, (b) as definitely not involved in such a coordination, by virtue of failing certain necessary conditions for being so involved, or (c) as of indeterminate status which must be resolved (if possible) in a later phase of the parse.",
        "The following principles are invoked for this purpose: Applied early in Attack:",
        "(3) LIMITS CONSTRAINT (Rindflesch forthcoming) The number of predicate-coordinating conjunctions in a sentence must be smaller than the number of verbs.",

        "Applied late in Attack: (5) MAIN PREDICATE CONSTRAINT There is at least one predicate in every sentence which is not subordinate to any other predicate in that sentence.",
        "(6) EQUIORDINATION CONSTRAINT",
        "If two predicates are coordinate then they are also equiordinate.",
        "The principles (3-6) arc all rather straightforward, even common-sensical; it is nonetheless not entirely uninteresting to learn that they form the basis for an extremely effective parsing strategy.",
        "Reconnaissance involves a single pass through the current string, the first steps being lexical lookup and counting and indexing all categories.",
        "The information gained from this counting and indexing is then used to eliminate impossible structures, via a check for compatibility with the principles (3-6) above.",
        "In order to deal with coordination two ancillary lists, called POMNTIAL COORDINATION LISTS, are associated during Reconnaissance with each conjunction which occurs in the input string.",
        "One of these, PCL-L, contains words which occur to the left of the conjunction with which the list is associated; each of these words could thus potentially serve as the left-hand member of a coordination effected by that conjunction.",
        "The other list, PCL-R, serves a similar function for words which occur to the right of the conjunction.",
        "Two elements can be coordinated only if one occurs in PCL-L for a given conjunction and the other occurs in PCL-R for that conjunction The constraints which apply early in Attack presuppose no information beyond what is gathered during Reconnaissance and are used to eliminate words in the input string as candidates for inclusion in these lists (on the assumption that it is best to eliminate as much as possible as early as possible on the basis of the least possible amount of information and thus enhance the efficiency of the parser).",
        "The remaining constraints remove words from the lists.",
        "In the early stages of the parse, each of these lists may be quite long, but as the parse proceeds, elements are deleted by the invocation of the Attack principles, until, for well formed input strings, each list contains only elements which, on some admissible reading of the input, can enter into a coordination effected by the associated conjunction.",
        "(In ambiguous cases such as John believes the boys and the girls believe Fred , each list would have more than one member.)",
        "In unambiguous cases, it can be determined that a conjunction is definitely involved in predicate coordination if both its PCL-L and its PCL-R contain exactly one predicate and no other word, and a conjunction is definitely not involved in predicate coordination if either of its PCL's does not contain any verb at all.",
        "The coordination status of a conjunction is indeterminate with regard to predicate coordination when, although both PCL's contain a verb, one (or both) of them contains at least one additional word.",
        "A natural question to ask at this point is whether the strategy just described is not just bottom-up parsing of the familiar sort.",
        "The answer is no, for at least two reasons.",
        "First, the PCL's do not hold fully specified analyses of substrings of the input; they contain only words which, on the basis of information so far available, cannot be excluded from consideration as potential coordinates of the conjunction associated with a given pair of lists.",
        "Nor do the lists hold potential conjunct pairs.",
        "(Suppose, for example, that PCL-L and PCL-R respectively hold words A, B and C and X and Y.",
        "There is an obvious difference between the two lists and the six conjunct pairs derivable from them, that is, <A, X>, <A, Y>, <B, X> ) Reconnaissance consists of a single pass through the input string, during which, after lexical lookup, each word is indexed, a count is kept of the number of tokens of each category which occurs in the input string, and the PCL's are created for each conjunction.",
        "After Reconnaissance, if there are any conjunctions, the PCL's are filled subject to the Limits Constraint and the Position Constraint.",
        "The Limits Constraint is applied only when PCL-L is filled, and the Position Constraint is applied only when PCL-R is filled.",
        "PCL-L is filled first.",
        "A word is put into PCL-L if and only if its index is less than the index of the conjunction with which the PCL-L is associated and the number orwords of this category in the string is greater than one (when this second condition is met the Limits Constraint is satisfied).",
        "Thus when hits is encountered while the parser is attempting to fill PCL-L for the conjunction in (l a), hits is not put into PCL-L since there is only one verb in the string.",
        "It can accordingly be determined that the conjunction is not coordinating predicates in (I a), since there will be no verb in either of the PCL's.",
        "In order to satisfy the position constraint when PCL-R is filled, a word is put into PCL-R if and only if its index is greater than the index of the current conjunction and there is already a word in the PCL-L for the current conjunction which has the same category as the word being considered for inclusion in the PCL-R for this conjunction.",
        "For example, in processing (7) John and Martha know Fred likes Dora The parser does not put either know or likes into PCL-R because there are no verbs in PCL-L. As will be discussed below, in the vast majority of cases in at least one domain the type of coordination occurring in a sentence can be determined solely on the basis of these straightforward principles.",
