        "There are two systems, labeled by Mood-type and Indicative-type.",
        "Each system has an input condition to its left, specifying when its options are applicable.",

        "In each system, exactly one of the features to the right of the vertical bar must be chosen.",
        "For example, in the Indicative-type system, either Declarative or Interrogative must be chosen.",

        "1. determine the set of systemic features for each constituent, 2. assign grammatical functions to each constituent.",
        "Other theories of grammar also make use of features and grammatical functions, however they have a distinct significance in systemic theory.",
        "The feature set associated with a constituent plays an important role in specifying its meaning (i.e., the features are not simply discarded after syntactic analysis), so a relatively large number (e.g., over 50) of features may need to be assigned to each constituent.",
        "Each constituent may also be assigned to several grammatical functions, because of the multifunctional nature of systemic analysis.",
        "For example, it is common to describe a single constituent simultaneously as SUBJECT, ACTOR and TOPIC.",

      "text": [
        "Many computational linguists have found systemic grammar (SG) to be quite useful, because it provides an explicit representation of features that determine how a sentence functions in the context of communication.",
        "SG has been used directly as the basis for several computer text generation programs [Mann 82], but it has only been used indirectly for computational parsers.",
        "Winograd used principles from SG in designing SHRDLU [Winograd 72], a successful natural language understanding program, but his program did not contain an explicit representation of the grammar's system network.",
        "Instead, he used a special purpose programming language to encode grammatical knowledge in a procedural form tailored specifically to the language understanding task.",
        "Another procedural implementation of SG was developed by McCord [McCord 77].",
        "Both of these methods would require a significant programming step before a parser could be produced for a different grammar.",
        "Our goal has been to develop a general parsing method using a declarative representation of SG, and to determine to what extent a grammar that is adequate for text generation can also be used for text analysis.",
        "Our parser has been developed and tested using Nigel [Mann 83], a large grammar of English that has previously been used as part of a text generation system.",
        "Systemic linguistics builds on the foundation of Halliday's concept of the system network [Halliday 76].",
        "A systemic grammar is organized around choices between grammatical features that reflect the structure and content of a constituent.",
        "Each choice between features is called a system.",
        "Thus, a systemic grammar has two major components:",
        "where a E A, to describe atomic values; where 1 E L and 0 E FDL, to describe structures in which the feature labeled by I has a value described by 0; where 1 E L, to describe a structure in which 1 has a substantive (non-NIL) value; where p E to describe a structure that shares a common value with the path p; where 0, E FDL, denoting conjunction; where 0; E FDL, denoting disjunction; where (ki E FDL, denoting classical implication.",
        "2 Compilation into Functional Unification Grammar The basic method used to construct the parser has been to develop a compiled representation of systemic grammars in the notation of Functional Unification Grammar (FUG).",
        "The parsing process itself is then derived by extending methods already developed for parsing with FUG [Kay 85].",
        "In FUG, a grammar can be regarded as a special kind of logical formula [Rounds 87], and the parsing problem is reduced to finding the set of feature structures that satisfy the formula subject to the constraints of the words in a particular sentence.",
        "Using the feature description logic (FDL) of Kasper and Rounds [Kasper 86], the types of formula used to define a grammar include:' The last type of formula, denoting implication, is an extension to FUG that enables a more efficient modeling of systemic descriptions than is possible in Kay's version of FUG [Kasper 87d].",
        "The compilation of systems into FUG is relatively straightforward.",
        "Each system is represented by a disjunction containing alternatives for each feature that can be chosen in the system.",
        "These alternatives also contain attributes that represent constraints on grammatical functions imposed by realization statements.",
        "For example, the Mood-type and Indicative-type systems can be represented by the description shown in Figure 3.",
        "System input conditions are bidirectional: they are represented by the embedding of descriptions, and also by feature existence conditions.",
        "In the FUG representation there is one functional description (FD) corresponding to each major constituent category of the systemic grammar.",
        "Major constituent categories for English include acme, nominal-group, and prepositional-phrase.",
        "The method of representing a systemic grammar as a set of FDa in FUG is described in greater detail in [Kasper 87b,Kasper 87d].",
        "A. program has been implemented to automatically translate any system network into FDa, verifying the effectiveness and generality of this compilation procedure.",
        "This program has been used to compile the entire Nigel grammar, which contains over 500 systems, into FUG many different times as changes to the grammar have been made.",
        "'Let A and L be sets of symbols used to denote atomic values and feature labels, respectively."

        "Our early experiments using the Nigel grammar showed that the existing methods for parsing with FUG had several shortcomings when applied to a large grammar.",
        "Kay's method for parsing with FUG [Kay 85] cannot be applied directly to our grammar because it requires:",
        "1. expanding the grammar FD to disjunctive normal form (DNF); 2. creating a disjunct for each possible ordered combination of constituents that is compatible with pattern features.",
        "Each of these disjuncts can be regarded as equivalent to an annotated phrase structure rule.",
        "In both cases our grammar contains too many alternatives to carry out the procedure: 1.",
        "Our grammar of English clauses contains over 100 systems.",
        "Since each system is represented by a disjunction in FUG, the DNF expansion of the clause grammar might require over 2100 disjuncts!",

        "Assuming that there are at least 10 optional adjunct types, we have 2'° different combinations of adjuncts, not counting any additional combinations resulting from order variation.",
        "The first problem has been solved by a new unification algorithm for disjunctive descriptions that does not require expansion to DNF [Kasper 87c].",

        "The PS component is something like a skeleton that cannot be seen in the final descriptions produced by the parser.",
        "Not very many PS rules are required, because they only need to encode broad category distinctions.",
        "Fine category distinctions are encoded by the FDs that are attached to rules.",
        "Each major constituent category of the grammar has a special rule that is annotated with the FD produced by compilation from the systemic grammar for that category.",
        "For example, the category CLAUSE has a rule of the form:",
        "CLAUSE-PS is a non-terminal that can derive any valid constituent pattern for clauses.",
        "The first unification of this rule identifies any features that are known from the constituents derived by CLAUSE-PS with features of the CLAUSE nonterminal.",
        "The second unification provides the functional description that must be satisfied for any clause.",
        "Consider again the problem of optional adjuncts.",

        "The PS component is the only part of the grammar used by the PATR-II parser that is not produced automatically from a systemic grammar.",

        "Bidirectional grammar, i.e. using the same grammatical knowledge for both parsing and generation of a language, has been a real but sometimes elusive goal in computational linguistics.",

        "In other words, the framework of systemic grammars is potentially invertible, but particular grammars may require some modification before they can be used effectively for both parsing and generation.",
        "Generally, parsing places greater demands on the realization component of the grammar, while generation places greater demands on the systems of choice.",
        "The Nigel grammar was originally developed for use in a text generation program, so our observations deal mostly with problem that can arise when inverting a grammar that is adequate for generation but untested for analysis.",
        "Most inodifications that we have made to enable parsing involve eliminating unintended ambiguities or disjunctive alternatives in the grammar that require an inordinate amount of time to resolve.",
        "Systemic grammars can exhibit ambiguity between grammatical fea, tures, in addition to the well known types of lexical and structural ambiguity.",
        "Unintended ambiguities between grammatical features often arise from underapecified parts of the grammar, i.e., the grammar contains an alternation between two or more features with insufficient realization information to determine which features apply in many cases.",
        "Usually the solution to this problem is to add realization information for those features.",
        "Sometimes the realization of those features may depend on other features and the modification is somewhat complex.",
        "In such cases, it is possible to temporarily disable the underspecified alternatives while parsing until a more complete solution is developed.",
        "Some features may have realizations that are formally adequate and efficient for generation, but quite inefficient for parsing.",
        "For example, the Nigel grammar for nominal groups contains the Pronominal feature to indicate that the head constituent is a pronoun.",
        "There is no explicit realization statement associated with this feature, but the system network contains more specific features for each of type of pronoun.",
        "These more specific features have realizations that specify particular lexical items for the head constituent.",
        "Since English pronouns are a closed class, there is a finite number of features that need to be examined to determine whether a nominal group is pronominal.",
        "However, it is quite inefficient to consider each member of the class individually.",
        "Obviously, we can improve the parsing efficiency of the grammar by adding a realization to the Pronominal feature that constrains the head to be a member of the class of pronouns.",
        "We have found a significant number of similar cases, where the grammar was adequate for generation, but was missing some useful generalization for analysis.",
        "It seems reasonable to expect that most grammars that are originally developed specifically for generation or parsing tasks will need similar kinds of tuning before they can be used effectively for the inverse task.",
        "A bidirectional grammar seems to be a reachable goal, but it will probably have some specifications that are superfluous for either parsing or generation.",
        "These specifications can be marked if necessary for efficiency, so that the parser or generator does not have to examine unnecessary information."

      "heading": "5 Conclusions",
      "text": [
        "We have developed a general method for parsing systemic grammars by extending the techniques of FUG and the PATR-II system.",
        "The parser is reasonably efficient for grammar testing and use as a linguistic research tool, but further refinement would be necessary for applications demanding real-time performance.",
        "Using the full Nigel grammar, it currently requires less than a minute to parse simple single-clause sentences, and several minutes to parse more complex sentences.",
        "It should be noted that parsing speed depends heavily on grammar size, and we are using a grammar that is significantly larger than most grammars that have been implemented to this date with unification-based methods.",
        "We have only investigated an exhaustive bottom-up strategy, in which the parser produces all possible parses for a sentence.",
        "This strategy is well-suited to grammar testing, but other strategies should be developed for applications demanding more selectivity and efficiency.",
        "We have not yet attempted to incorporate extra-grammatical (i.e., semantic and pragmatic) information for ambiguity resolution, but this would also be necessary for most practical applications.",
        "It would be very desirable to discover a way to produce the phrase structure component of the parsing grammar, or some functionally equivalent mechanism, automatically from a systemic description.",
        "If accomplished, this would make it possible to fully automate the production of a parsing grammar, but this appears to be a difficult problem.",
        "It is currently much easier to produce a small phrase structure component manually from one's knowledge of the grammar."
