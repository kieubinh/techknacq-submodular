        "If asked \"Did Sally eat?\" after having been told that Sally ate a pear, speakers of English would not hesitate to answer \"Yes\".",
        "But we would not expect English speakers to answer \"Yes\" if asked \"Did David dress?\" after being told that David dressed the baby.",
        "Here the appropriate answer would be \"I don't know\".",
        "Computational linguists engaged in building Question-Answering systems should find these examples thought-provoking.",
        "Two sequences consisting of a statement followed by a question which appear to be parallel syntactically (transitive use of a verb in the statement, intransitive use of the same verb in the question) elicit quite different responses.",
        "The simple syntax of these pairs is unlikely to pose a challenge for the parsers used in most existing systems.",
        "The problem is that the intransitive uses of the two verbs, eat and dress, receive very different interpretations.",
        "Thus the intransitive use of eat found in the question \"Did Sally eat?\" implies the existence of an understood but unexpressed object that is interpreted as a prototypical type of food or a meal:",
        "(1) Sally ate a pear.",
        "Sally ate.",
        "(i.e., Sally ate some food.)",
        "The question \"Did David dress?\" on the other hand does not mean 'Did David dress something one typically dresses?', it means 'Did David dress himself?': (2) David dressed the baby.",
        "*> David dressed (i.e., David dressed himself.)",
        "Natural language systems should be able to recognize that the relationship between transitive and intransitive dress is not the same as that between transitive and intransitive eat.",
        "A large number of English verbs have both transitive and intransitive uses.",
        "Interchanges parallel to the one described for eat are possible with a wide range of verbs:",
        "(3) Jessica typed a letter.",
        "Did Jessica type?",
        "Yes.",
        "(4) Gabriella swept the floor.",
        "Did she sweep?",
        "Yes.",
        "(5) Miriam read the book.",
        "Did Miriam read?",
        "Yes.",
        "But the behavior of the verb dress is not exceptional.",
        "Another set of verbs including bathe, change, shave, shower, and wash behave like it.",
        "For example, these verbs show the same entailments as dress:",
        "(6) Carla bathed the dog.",
        ":4> Carla bathed (i.e., Carla bathed herself.)",
        "(7) Jill washed the sweater.",

        "(8) Peter shaved Tom.",

        "Peter shaved (i.e., Peter shaved himself.)",
        "The different relationships between transitive and intransitive uses of verbs cannot be ignored in the design of a natural language system and its lexical component, The most obvious way to handle these relationships is to add information to the lexical entries of each verb with transitive and intransitive uses.",
        "While such an approach is viable when a system has a small lexicon, it becomes less tractable as the lexicon grows larger since it requires a tremendous increase in the amount of idiosyncratic information which must be registered in the entry of each verb.",
        "The examples discussed so far illustrate just a few of a wide range of relationships between alternate expressions of the arguments of verbs that must be correctly interpreted by any natural language system that aims at substantial coverage of English.",
        "We believe that what is required in order to implement a system that meets these demands is an understanding of English lexical organization.",
        "For this reason we draw on recent theoretical linguistic investigations into the lexical knowledge possessed by native speakers of English carried out by the MIT Lexicon Project (Rappaport, Levin, and Laughren [1988], Levin [1985], Hale and Keyser [1986], Levin and Rappaport [to appear]).",
        "These studies have established a range of semantic-syntactic interdependencies exhibited by semantically coherent classes of verbs and have identified a number of essential classes of verbs, as well as the central properties characterizing verbs of each type.",
        "The results of this work have been used in the design of a lexical component for the START natural language system developed at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (Katz [1988]).",
        "In this paper we show how these results allow START to attain a broader range of coverage than most existing systems while maintaining modular organization.",
        "Assumptions about Lexical Organization A verb denotes an action, state, or process involving one or more participants, which we refer to as the arguments of the verb.",
        "Some verbs may express their arguments in more than one way, sometimes with slightly different semantic interpretations.",
        "We say that such verbs particiate in argument alternations.",
        "We have seen that certain verbs have both transitive and intransitive uses, and that the relationship between the uses is not uniform across all verbs; rather, it is a property of the verb involved.",
        "We say that such verbs participate in transitivity alternations, a subclass of argument alternations.",
        "So far, we have seen the indefinite object alternation, in (9), and the reflexive alternation, in (10):",
        "(9) Sally ate a pear.",
        ".-=-* Sally ate.",
        "(i.e., Sally ate some food.)",
        "(10) David dressed the baby.",
        "David dressed.",
        "(i.e., David dressed himself.)",
        "These are only two of about a dozen transitivity alternations found in English.",
        "(See Atkins, Kegl, and Levin [1986], Hale and Keyser [1086), Levin [1985] for a description of various other alternations.)",
        "A question that a system designer might ask is whether the argument alternations a verb participates in are predictable or whether they are merely an idiosyncratic property of that verb.",
        "This question is clearly also of linguistic interest.",
        "Argument alternations, including transitivity alternations, have received considerable attention from theoretical linguists.",
        "It turns out that each alternation is associated with particular semantic types of verbs.",
        "Thus the verbs participating in the indefinite object alternation are all activity verbs; most of them describe typical occupations:2",
        "(11) drink, eat, file, iron, plow, read, sweep, type, write, ...",
        "The verbs participating in the reflexive alternation are all verbs of grooming: (12) bathe, brush, change, comb, dress, shave, shower, wash, ...",
        "Studies of phenomena such as those described here reveal that English verbs are organized into classes on the basis of shared components of meaning.",
        "The members of these classes share certain syntactic properties, specifically properties concerning the possible expressions of their arguments.",
        "To state this differently, certain linguistically relevant aspects of a verb's meaning serve as a pointer to its place in the organizational scheme of English verbs.",
        "Once this place is identified, various syntactic properties of a verb can be determined.",
        "For linguists working on the lexicon the study of alter-' nations can provide insight into linguistically relevant aspects of meaning due to the interdependency between the syntactic and semantic properties of a verb.",
        "(For instance, see Hale and Keyser [1987] for a discussion of another transitivity alternation, the middle alternation, from this perspective).",
        "For computational linguists this characteristic of lexical organization suggests a modular system design: many lexical properties can be associated with verb classes, and need not be registered in the lexical entries of individual verbs, which can simply indicate class membership.",
        "These ideas are incorporated into the design of the START system, as we describe in detail in the remainder of the paper.",
        "11n certain circumstances, a much wider range of English transitive verbs show an intransitive use with an indefinite object interpretation: when they are used by people whose activity involves the action denoted by the verb to describe the activity.",
        "For example, the verb stuff does not usually occur without an object, *She stuffs, but if this verb is used to describe the activity of someone who stuffs pillows in a pillow-factory, then it would be all right to use the verb intransitively.",
        "3.",
        "An Overview of the START system",
        "The START natural language system (SynTactic Analysis using Reversible Transformations) consists of two modules which share the same Grammar (see Katz [1980], Katz and Winston [1982]).",
        "The understanding module analyzes English text and produces a knowledge base which incorporates the information found in the text.",
        "Given an appropriate segment of the knowledge base, the generating module produces English sentences.",
        "A user can retrieve the information stored in the knowledge base by querying it in English.",
        "The system will then produce an English response.",
        "START has been used by researchers at MIT, Stanford University, and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for constructing and querying knowledge bases using English.",
        "(See, for example, Winston [1982], [1984], Winston, Binford, Katz, and Lowry [1983], Doyle [1984], Katz and Brooks [1987]).",
        "START rearranges the elements of the parse tree it constructs into embedded ternary expressions ( T expressions) by tying together the three most salient parameters of a sentence, the subject, the object, and the relation between them, <subject relation object>.",
        "For instance, the sentence",
        "(13) Gabriella might buy some stickers",
        "will result in the T-expression <Gabriella buy stickers>.",
        "Certain other parameters (adjectives, possessive nouns, prepositional phrases, etc.)",
        "are used to create additional T-expressions in which prepositions and several special words serve as relations.",
        "The remaining parameters – adverbs and their position, tense, auxiliaries, voice, negation, etc. – are recorded in a represen, tational structure called history.",
        "The history has a page pertaining to each sentence which yields the given T-expression.",
        "When we index the T-expression in the knowledge base, we cross-reference its three components and attach the history H to it.",
        "One can thus think of the resulting entry in the knowledge base as a \"digested summary\" of the syntactic structure of English sentences.",
        "In order to handle embedded sentences, START allows any T-expression to take another T-expression as its subject or object.",
        "START can analyze and generate sentences with arbitrarily complex embedded structures.",
        "We conclude our description of START with a brief overview of how the system answers questions.",
        "Questions are requests for information from START's knowledge base.",
        "In order to answer a question START must translate the question into a T-expression template which can be used to search the knowledge base for T-expressions which contain information relevant to providing an answer to the question.",
        "We illustrate the actual question-answering process with an example.",
        "Suppose that as a result of analyzing and indexing a text containing sentence (14), the knowledge base contains T-expression (15):",
        "(14) Mary presented Paul with a gift.",
        "(15) <<Mary present Paul> with gift> Now suppose that a user asks START the following wh-question: (16) Whom did Mary present with a gift?",
        "In the context of .",
        "(14) the answer is Paul.",
        "In order to determine this, the system must first turn the question into a T-expression template that can be used to search the knowledge base.",
        "The first step in this process is to undo the effects of the wh-movement transformation that is used to create English wh-questions.",
        "To do this, START must find the place in sentence (16) that the wh-word whom came from and then insert the wh-word in this position:",
        "(17) Mary presented whom with a gift.",
        "Next the language understanding system leads sentence (17) through the same flow of control as any other declarative sentence and produces the following T-expression which serves as a pattern used to query the knowledge base: (18) <<Mary present whom> with gift> Treating whom as a matching variable, the system feeds T-expression (18) through a matcher in order to determine whether there is anything in the knowledge base that matches (18).",
        "The matcher finds the T-expression created from (14): (19) <<Mary present Paul> with gift> and the language generation system then uses this T-expression to produce the English response to question (16): (20) Mary presented Paul with a gift.",
        "START handles yes-no questions in a similar fashion.",
        "Suppose that START had been asked the yes-no question",
        "(21) Did Mary present Paul with a gift?",
        "As in the wh-case, START would turn this question into a T-expression template that could be matched against the T-expressions in the knowledge base.",
        "The difference between yes-no and wh-questions is that the T-expression template generated by a yes-no question would contain no variables.",
        "The question above would generate the template <<Mary present Paul> with gift> which would match against (19), allowing the system to answer:",
        "(22) Yes, Mary presented Paul with a gift.",
        "4.",
        "Introducing S-rules",
        "Since T-expressions in the START system are built using the pattern <subject relation object> at every level of embedding, they mimic the hierarchical organization of English sentences.",
        "As a consequence, sentences differing in their surface syntax but close in meaning are not considered similar by the system.",
        "For example, given sentence (23) as input, START will create an embedded T-expression (24), whereas a near paraphrase, sentence (25), will generate T-expression (26):",
        "(23) Mary presented Paul with a gift (24) <<Mary present Paul> with gift> (25) Mary presented a gift to Paul (26) <<Mary present gift> to Paul>",
        "Speakers of English know that sentences (23) and (25) both describe a transfer of possession.",
        "In both sentences, the gift is the transferred object, Paul is the recipient of this object, and Mary is the agent of the transfer, despite different syntactic realizations of some of these arguments.",
        "It seems natural that this kind of knowledge be available to a natural language system.",
        "However, START, as described so far, does not consider T-expressions (24) and (26), which are associated with these sentences, to be similar.",
        "The difference in the T-expressions becomes particularly problematic when START is asked a question.",
        "An example will clarify this point.",
        "Suppose the input text contains only one present sentence, (27), and the knowledge base contains only the corresponding T-expression, (28):",
        "(27) Mary presented Paul with a gift (28) <<Mary present Paul> with gift> Now suppose the user asked the following question: (29) To whom did Mary present a gift?",
        "Although a speaker of English could easily answer this question after being told sentence (27), START would not be able to answer it.",
        "This question presents a problem for START because T-expression (30) produced by question (29) will not match T-expression (28).",
        "(30) <<Mary present gift> to whom> START is unable to answer such questions because it is unaware of the interactions between the syntactic and semantic properties of verbs.",
        "This limitation is a serious drawback since interactions similar to the one just described pervade the English language and, therefore, cannot be ignored in the construction of a natural language system.",
        "The present example illustrates that START needs information that allows it to deduce the relationship between alternate realizations of the arguments of verbs.",
        "In this instance, we want START to know that whenever A presents B with C, then A presents C to B.",
        "We do this by introducing rules that make explicit the relationship between alternate realizations of the arguments of verbs.",
        "We call such rules .5rules (where S stands for both Syntax and Semantics).",
        "Here is the S-rule that solves the problem caused by the verb present:",
        "(31) Present S-rule",
        "If <<subject present objectl> with object2> Then <<subject present object2> to objectl> S-rules are implemented as a rule-based system.",
        "Each S-rule is made up of two parts, an antecedent (the IF-clause) and a consequent (the THEN-clause).",
        "Each clause consists of a set of templates for T-expressions, where the template elements are filled by variables or constants.",
        "For example, the Present S-rule contains three variables, subject, objectl, object2, which are used to represent the noun phrases in the T-expressions.",
        "This rule also contains three constants, present, with, and to, shown in boldface.",
        "The Present S-rule will apply only to T-expressions which involve the verb present and which meet the additional structural constraints.",
        "S-rules operate in two modes: forward and backward.",
        "We describe both modes of operation briefly, although in this paper we concentrate on S-rules operating in the backward mode, since this mode is most useful in a Question-Answering natural language system.",
        "When triggered by certain conditions, S-rules in the forward mode allow the system to intercept T-expressions produced by the understanding module, transform or augment them in a way specified by the rule, and then incorporate the result into the knowledge base.",
        "For instance, if the Present S-rule is used in the forward mode, as soon as its antecedent matches T-expression",
        "(32) produced by the understanding module, it creates a new T-expression (33) and then adds it to the knowledge base: (32) <<Mary present Paul> with gift> (33) <<Mary present gift> to Paul>",
        "Now question (29) can be answered since T-expression (30) associated with this question matches against T-expression (33).",
        "The generating module of START responds: (34) Mary presented a gift to Paul.",
        "All additional facts produced by the forward S-rules are in• stantly entered in the knowledge base.",
        "The forward mode is especially useful when the information processed by START is put into action by another computer system because in such a situation START ought to provide the interfacing system with as much data as possible.",
        "In contrast, the backward mode is employed when the user queries the knowledge base.",
        "Often for reasons of computational efficiency, it is advantageous not to incorporate all inferred knowledge into the knowledge base immediately.",
        "S-rules in the back ward mode trigger only when a request comes in which cannot be answered directly, initiating a search in the knowledge base to determine if the answer can be deduced from the available information.",
        "For example, the Present S-rule used in the backward mode does not trigger when sentence (27) is read and '1'-expression (28) is produced by START.",
        "The S-rule triggers only when question (29) is asked since this question cannot be answered directly."

        "In order to understand an English sentence, the START system needs to have morphological, syntactic, and semantic information about the words in the sentence.",
        "All the words that the system is awake of, along with information about their part of speech, inflection, gender, number, etc.",
        "are stored in the Lexicon.",
        "Virtually every branch of START uses the Lexicon to accomplish its task.",
        "In this section we discuss the way in which the Lexicon extends the system's ability to deal with semantic-syntactic interdependencies.",
        "We show that the Lexicon provides a place where a verb's membership in a semantic class can be registered, allowing more general S-rules to be stated.",
        "To examine how lexical information about verb classes may be utilized by the S-rules, we introduce another argument alternation in English, the property-factoring alternation (Van Oosten [1980]).",
        "Consider the following sentence:",
        "(35) Paul surprised the audience with his answer.",
        "An English speaker knows that sentence (35) can be paraphrased as: (36) Paul's answer surprised the audience.",
        "Notice that in (35), the subject brings about the emotional reaction (surprise) by means of some property expressed in the with phrase.",
        "Sentence (36) describes the same emotional reaction as in (35) but in (36) the property and its possessor are collapsed into a single noun phrase.",

        "While a speaker of English would know that the answer to this question is Yes, this reply is not obvious to START since T-expressions related to sentence (35) and question (37) are very different:2 (38) <<Paul surprise audience> with answer> (39) <answer surprise audience>",
        "Extending the approach taken to the example with the verb present in section 4, we could formulate a simple S-rule that could be used to answer question (37).",
        "The Surprise S-rule (40), like the Present S-rule, makes explicit the relationship between the alternate realizations of the arguments of the verb surprise:",

        "Formulating a special purpose S-rule which applies only to the verb surprise does not seem to be the best solution to the problem.",
        "Surprise is only one of many verbs which exhibit the property-factoring alternation.",
        "This alternation holds of a large class consisting of over one hundred verbs, among them",

        "For this reason we identify a class of emotional-reaction verbs and say that the property of the verb surprise responsible for the alternation shown in (35) and (36) holds for all verbs that comprise the emotional-reaction class.' Once we have tied the ability to participate in the property-factoring alternation to a particular class of verbs, we no longer need to indicate this property in the lexical entry of each verb in the class or write verb-specific S-rules, such as the Surprise S-rule.",
        "Rather, we can associate the alternation with the class and then simply indicate in the lexical entry of a verb whether it belongs to this class.",
        "That is, we augment a verb's lexical entry with an indication of its semantic class membership.",
        "For instance, we would register in the entry for surprise that it is a member of the emotional-reaction class.`",
        "(46) (surprise :verb :emotional-reaction) Now instead of writing a number of verb-specific S-rules, we can write a single general S-rule which triggers not only on the verb surprise, but on any verb from the emotional-reaction class: (47) Property-factoring S-rule",
        "If <<subject verb objecti> with object2> Then <object2 verb objectl> Provided verb e emotional-reaction class The revised S-rule contains a PROVIDED clause which specifies the class of verbs to which the rule applies, ensuring that it applies to the emotional-reaction verbs.",

        "The PROVIDED restriction of S-rule (47) not only allows the rule to apply to verbs of the appropriate semantic type, but it also prevents the rule from applying to verbs that do not display the property-factoring alternation.",
        "For instance, the verbs surprise and present can express their arguments in a similar fashion – both are found in the context [NP V NP with NP], but they differ in the other realizations of their arguments.",

        "*Paul surprised his answer to the audience.",
        "In the absence of the PROVIDED clause, the Property-factoring S-rule could potentially misapply to verbs like present.",
        "The surprise example shows how the addition of information about semantic class membership to verb entries allows the system to handle a particular phenomenon (or lexical property) common to all verbs in a particular class, with the help of a single S-rule.",
        "We refer to this approach as the verb class approach.",
        "We could have achieved the same effect in another way: instead of specifying verb class membership in the entry of each verb, we could have explicitly registered the lexical properties that apply to the verb (or the names of the corresponding S-rules).",
        "Taking this approach, the lexical entry for surprise would indicate property-factoring instead of emotional-reaction but would otherwise be unchanged.",
        "(52) (surprise :verb :property-factoring) This approach could allow us to dispense with the PROVIDED clause in the S-rules since the lexical entry of a verb would be tagged with the set of S-rules that could apply to that verb.",
        "However, the verb class approach has a clear advantage over the alternative lexical property approach when more than one property is involved.",
        "Typically each semantic class of verbs has a number of properties associated with it, which must ultimately be handled by a natural language system.",
        "If we take the lexical property approach, whenever we add a new lexical property, we would need to write an S-rule for this new property, and we would then have to add the property to the lexical entry of each member of the class of verbs that exhibit this property.",
        "In contrast, if we take the verb class approach, it is easy to extend the system to handle new properties of a class of verbs.",
        "All that is required is the addition of the appropriate S-rule, formulated so that it triggers on this class of verbs.",
        "There is no need to alter the lexical entries of the members of the class in any way if the lexical entry of each verb in the class indicates that it is a member of this class.",

        "(56) Thunder never fails to frighten.",
        "The subject of the middle use (54) bears the same semantic relation to the verb as the object of the transitive use (53), while the subject of the null-object use (56) bears the same semantic relation to the verb as the subject of the transitive use (55).",
        "The null-object alternation, like the indefinite object alternation, involves an unexpressed but understood object in the intransitive variant.",
        "However, the understood object here is interpreted as \"people\".",
        "Emotional-reaction verbs are also set apart by another property: they only have passive nominals.",
        "Thus, the children's disappointment means that the children experienced disappointment (passive interpretation), not that they caused disappointment (active interpretation).",
        "Compare the interpretation of this nominal to that of the nominal related to a verb like describe: Gene's description can refer to the description that Gene gave (active interpretation) or to a description that someone gave of Gene (passive interpretation).",
        "We return to the example involving present discussed in the previous section.",
        "The alternation manifested by the verb present is exhibited by the members of a small class of verbs which also includes entrust, furnish, supply, and trust.",
        "The Present S-rule in (31) can be generalized so that it will apply to the entire class of verbs like present, which we name the present class.",

        "Although the sentences in each of these pairs might appear at first glance to be paraphrases, they arc not.",
        "For instance, in the first pair, only (69), the locative variant, may be used to describe a situation where a small portion of the wall is covered with paint as a result of the spraying (the partitive interpretation), while sentence (70), the with, variant, necessarily implies that the wall is entirely covered with paint as a result of the action (the holistic interpretation).",
        "The sentences in each pair are near paraphrases in the sense that the truth of the with variant entails the truth of the locative variant, but not vice versa.",
