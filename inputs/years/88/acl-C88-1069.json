      "text": [
        "The two-level model provides a language independent framework for describing phonological and morphological phenomena associated with word inflection, derivation anti compounding.",
        "The model can be expressed in terns of finite-state machines, and it is easy to implement.",
        "The model has, in fact, two aspects: (1) it is a linguistic formalism for describing phonological phenomena, and (2) it is a computational apparatus which implements descriptions of particular languages as operational systems capable of recognizing and generating word-forms.",
        "The model consists of three representions (morphological, lexical and surface forms) and two systems (the lexicon and phonological rules) rehiring them: morphemes in word-form LEXICON texicki representation of word•form TWO-LEVEL RULES surface representation of word-form The surface representation is typically a phonemic representation of word-form, but sometimes graphic or written forms are used instead.",
        "The lexical representation is an underlying (postulated) morphophonemic representation of the word stem and affixes.",
        "These two representations need not be identical, and in case there are phonological alternations in the language, these representations are more or less different.",
        "The task of the two-level rule component is to account for any discrepancies between these representations.",
        "The task of the lexicon component is twofold.",
        "First, it specifies what kinds of lexical representations are possible according to the inventory of known words and their possible inflectional forms, plus derivations and compounds according to productive rules.",
        "The second task of the lexicon is to associate proper morphemes to lexical representations.",
        "The task of the lexicon component is considered to be universal.",
        "Many languages can be quite well described with rather simple lexicon structures.",
        "The lexicon needed for Finnish is basically a set of sublexicons (for sterns, case endings, possessive suffixes, clitic particles, tense of verbs, person, etc.).",
        "Each entry specifies all continuation lexicons which are possible after that morpheme.",
        "This scheme is equivalent to a (partly nondeterministic) finite state transition network.",
        "Two-level rules compare lexical and surface representations.",
        "The partitive plural of the Finnish word Iasi 'glass' is laseja.",
        "This form might be represented as a stem Iasi plus a plural ending I plus a partitive ending A.",
        "• The correspondence would be then be:",
        "There are three discrepancies here: the stem final i is realized as e (and not as i like in singuler forms), the plural I is realized as j instead of i, and the partitive A is realized as the back vowel",
        "a (and not as front vowel a ).",
        "The first discrepancy is described with a two-level rule: i:e <=> _ I: This states that lexical i is realized as surface e if and only if it is followed by a lexical I (the plural affix).",
        "The plural I itself is a bit different from other i's because it is realized as j if and only if it occurs between two surface vowels (let V denote the set of vowels): I:j <=> :V _ :V The realization of partitive A is an instance of Finnish vowel harmony, which causes endings to agreee in frontness or backness with stem vowels.",
        "Thus A has two possible realizations: it must be a back vowel iff there are back vowels in the stem: [A:a I 0:o I U:u] => :Vback :Vnonfront* _ The set Vback contains the back vowels a, o, and u whereas Vnonfront contains anything that does not have one of a ö u on surface.",
        "Phonological two-level descriptions have been made for about twenty different languages up to now.",
        "Only about a third of them can be considered to he comprehensive.",
        "Typically a description co of 7-40 rules (English and Classical Greek being the low and high extemes).",
        "A special compiler is used for converting these rules into finite state transducers (Karttunen, Koskenniemi, and Kaplan, 1987).",
        "The resulting machines are similar to the ones that were hand compiled, eg.",

      "text": [
        "[Barton86] poses a challenge to find the constraint that makes words of a natural language easy to process: \"The Kimmo algorithms contain the seeds of complexity, for local evidence does not always show how to construct a lexical-surface correspondence that will satisfy the constraints expressed in a set of two-level automata.",
        "These seeds can be exploited in mathematical",
        "reductions to show that two-level automata can describe computationally difficult problems in a very natural way.",
        "It follows that the finite-state two-level framework itself cannot guarantee computational efficiency.",
        "If the words of natural languages are easy to analyze, the efficiency of processing must result from some additional property that natural languages have, beyond those that are captured in the two-level model.",
        "Otherwise, computationally difficult problems might turn up in the two-level automata for some natural language, just as they do in the artificially constructed languages here.",
        "In fact, the reductions are abstractly modeled on the Kimmo treatment of harmony processes and other long-distance dependencies in natural languages.\" [Barton86, p56] We suggest that words of natural languages are easy to analyze because morphological grammars are small.",
        "As Barton shows, two-level complexity grows rapidly with the number of harmony processes.",
        "But, fortunately, natural languages don't have very many harmony processes.",
        "Any single language seems to have at most two harmony processes:",
        "• zero (most, ie.",
        "some 88 % of languages), • one (Uralic, Tungusic, Sahaptian) or • two (most Altaic languages)",
        "Even in principle, a three dimensional vowel harmony is rather improbable, because it would lead to a total (or almost total) collapse of distinctions between vowels.",
        "In most languages there are not enough distinctive features in vowels to make a four-way harmony even possible.",
        "We have not found any reliable accounts for more than two harmony-like processes in a single language.",
        "Normally, most complexity results describe space/time costs as a function of the size of the input.",
        "Claims in support of the two-level model are generally of this form; speed is generally measured in terms of numbers of letters processed per second.",
        "Barton's result is somewhat non-standard; it describes costs as a function of the size of the grammar (or more precisely, the number of harmony processes).",
        "Complexity results generally don't discuss the \"grammar constant\" because any particular grammar has just a fixed (and very small number) of rules (such as harmony processes), and thus it isn't very helpful to know how the algorithm would perform if there were more, because there aren't.",
        "If phonological grammars were large and complex, there could be efficiency problems because processing time does depend on the size and structure of the grammar.",
        "However, since phonological grammars tend to be relatively small (when compared with the size of the input), it is fairly safe to adopt the grammar constant fissumption.",
        "Let us consider the satisfaction reduction in.",
        "[Barton86].",
        "Barton used a grammar like the one below to reduce two-level generation to the satisfaction problem.",
        "In this artificial grammar, it is assumed that there are an arbitrary number of harmony processes over the letters: a, b, c, d, e, f, • each letter must correspond to either T (truth) or F (falsehood), consistently throughout the word.",
        "This reduction is a generalization of harmony processes which are common in certain families of natural languages.",
        "In these languages, stem (and affix) vowels must agree in one or more of the following distinctive features:",
        "• Front/back vowels (palatal, velar harmony), eg.",
        "in Uralic and Turcic languages.",
        "(Replaced by consonantal palatalization in Karaite, a Turcic language.)",
        "• Rounded/unrounded vowels (labial harmony), eg.",
        "in Turcic languages Tongue height, eg.",
        "Tungusic languages • Nasalization, and Pharyngealization eg.",
        "emphatic consonants and vowels in semitic languages",
        "Some processes are classified as umlaut rather than vowel harmonies, but behave similarly.",
        "One, still different but relevant process, has been reported in Takelma (Sapir 1922).",
        "There, a suffixal /a/ is replaced with an /i/, if the following suffix contains /i/.",
        "This rule derives [ikuminininink] from underlying /ikumanananink/.",
        "It may be a mistake to classify all of these processes as vowel harmonies, and if so, it only strengthens the claim that languages don't have very many vowel harmony processes."
