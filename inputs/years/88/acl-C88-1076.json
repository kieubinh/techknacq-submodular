        "There are at least two stages of text generation.",
        "One is generating the content of the text.",
        "The other is generating the language that represents and communicates the content (Thompson 1977).",
        "These two stages, though interrelated, have their owh sets of interesting problems and principles.",
        "The first stage, generating the semantic content of the text, involves motivating, planning and creating the conceptual and semantic content of a piece of text.",
        "Once the semantic representation for a text has been constructed the language of that text can be generated.",
        "The second stage, language generation, involves communicating the intent and content of the text without confusing or misleading the reader.",
        "This paper will address the second stage only.",
        "It is not enough to merely generate text.",
        "It is also necessary to generate cohesive text.",
        "However a shopping list is cohesive, though not \"flowing\" text by any means.",
        "A set of sentences that are propositionally related are cohesive though are not necessarily beautiful prose.",
        "It is not enough to attend to ellipsis and pronominalization to generate readable prose.",
        "We believe that there are other factors which must be attended to to generate prose.",
        "The NOSVO system is an attempt to take into account old/new information contrasts (Chafe 1974, 1976) which we believe will help natural language generation systems produce more readable text.",
        "2.0 \"Old\" and \"New\" It is important at this point to clarify the use of the terms \"old information\" and \"new information\".",
        "The term information\" is a misnomer, though it expresaes the intuition needed for this paper.",
        "The term suggests \"it is what the listener is expected to know already\" (Haviland and Clark 1974).",
        "The term \"new information\" is also a incorrect.",
        "It suggests that what the speaker has uttered is completely new to the hearer and is being introduced into the speaker's consciousness for the very first time.",
        "But as Chafe (1976) points out a person uttering the sentence \"I saw you father yesterday\" is \"unlikely to assume that the addressee had no previous knowledge of his father, even though; by the usual criteria \"your father\" would be considered new information\" (Chafe 1976: 30).",
        "Chafe suggests that the terms \"already-activated\" and \"newly, activated\" would be more anoronriate.",
        "Certainly \"alreaay activated\" and \"newly activated\" (information) are by far better than the terms \"Oven\" and \"new\".",
        "Even so, they are still somewhat imprecise.",
        "\"already activated\" and \"newly activated\" imply, as does Chafe, that the concept that is activated, whether extralinguistic or linguistic, is directly activated by a (linguistic or extralinguistic) referent.",
        "As Prince (1978) shows for clefts and as LaPolla (1986) shows for inversion `gild prepositional phrase fronting this need not be the case.",
        "Rather the antecedent \"simply has to be appropriate to the situation, and hence cooperatively 'assumable as being there\" (Prince 1.978:889).",
        "This is quite important and expands upon Chafe since for him the important thing is that the antecedent must be in the hearer's consciousness, i.e. in the hearer's focus of attention, while for Prince and LaPolla it need only be appropriate, to the situation or in sortie other way cooperatively assumable to be in the hearer's consciousness.",
        "Hajicova and Vbrova (1981) also takes exception with the terms \"given (or old) or \"new\" information and suggests that \"contextually bound\" and \"contextually non-bound\" lexical item would be more appropriate.",
        "\"contextually bound\" and \"contextually non-bound is even mom appropriate than \"already activated\" and \"newly activated\" because it seems to also convey situational appropriateness.",
        "However, it seems that Hajicova restricts her terminology, as well as her theory of discourse (focus) structure, to linguistic antecedents.",
        "That is, her \"shaved stock of knowledge\" appears to be closer to, if not completely, linguistic in representaiion.",
        "Therefore, neither her theory or terminology has the power to deal with an antecedent that is merely inferable or appropriate to a situation.",
        "We will use the familiar terms \"new/old information\" but will define them a little more precisely later in the paper."

        "If the above statement is accepted then one might characterize a discourse as a session where particular slices of memory are accessed and changed.",
        "Since this accumulated store ef information in memory is,,presumably very large and has a complicated structure, it is useful if the communicator can first identify the locations in memory that are to be modified or added to before introducing the modifications",
        "or additions (Hajicova and Vbrov,i 1981; LaPolla 1986).",
        "Beginning a sentence with old information allows a speaker to direct the hearer's focus of attention to exactly those elements which he wishes to modify before he utters the .rest of the sentence, presumably new information (Chafe 1974).",
        "If a speaker began a sentence with new information, the listener would not know where to connect it in the discourse.",
        "The listener would have to wait until the old information is uttered to locate where the new information is' to be used (LaPolla 1986).",
        "The former process takes less concentration by the listener (Green 1980).",
        "If we model human memory, specifically lexical access, as a sweading-activation network (Quillian 1962, 1967; Collins and Loftus 1915) we can describe the effects of uttering, old information before new as priming, for at least the class of linguistic antecedents.",
        "Old information primes an already active node in memory raising its level of activation' and making it more accessible than surrounding nodes.",
        "The priming may then spread to related concepts.",
        "This causes only the relevant and related portions of memory to be available for modification or replacement, and restricts the amount of memory brought into the processing of discourse.",

        "If new information were uttered first then the level of activation achieved would be equal or close to previously primed concepts and the speaker's attention would not be properly focused.",
        "We can now define old (linguistic) information as already activated memory.",
        "New (linguistic) information, then, is either information not in memory or information that has not yet been activated.",
        "Using Quillian's model, all concepts that have been primed by the discourse, either directly or by spreading-activation, are old.",
        "Everything else is new.",
        "Structures like inversion and PP-fronting, to a name a few, ex tend the syntactic and logical possibilities of information presentation lit a language, They allow adjuncts, e.g. in PP-fronting, or objects, e.g. in passives, or other arguments, e.g. in inversion, to be presented before other syntactic constituents.",
        "To complete the above definitions we will adopt and expand Quillian's definition of \"concept\".",
        "For Quillian, and Collins and Loftus, a concept corresponds \"to particular senses of words or phrases\" (Collins and Loftus 1975: 408).",
        "We will expand this to include extralinguistic phrases or groups of actions and objects.",
        "A concept then is not only senses or words or phrases such as NPs, \"machine\", VPs, \"to machine\", and phrases \"the particular old car I own\" (page 408) but also extralinguistic objects: a picture of a fire engine, and actions, the picture of a fire engine racing down the street.",
        "This also includes situations such as eating in a restaurant and paying the check.",

        "The lexicon maps into either a domain specific ore non-domain specific KB.",
        "Both the domain specific and non-domain specific KBs are hierarchical networks which support the relations ISA, 14AS, HAS-PART, LOC, IS-CALLED, EXAMPLE, SUPER and SUBCLASS.",

        "The first would be the extra computation and heuristics required to resolve the ambiguities.",
        "The second problem would be determining when to prime a node.",
        "It might not be correct to prime a node just because the lexicon accessed it.",
        "Oue might have to wait for a completed parse before priming the concept bases.",
        "The discourse base is a tree.",
        "As NOSVO generates text, it builds the discourse tree connecting old information to new while retaining the autonamy of each predicate.",
        "The discourse base contains the structure of the discourse and is a way to record priming.",
        "The discourse base maps directly into the Kits as well.",
        "One could assume that the discourse is just a a section of primed memory.",
        "However, it was felt that a more linguistic representation would be useful in helping to resolve anaphora.",
        "The discourse base was modeled after the discourse mechanism in LaPolla (1986).",
        "NOSVO's first step in determining whether a predicate or an argument is \"old information\" is whether or not it has been introduced into the discourse, that is whether or not it is definite (Ileim 1982,1983).",
        "If a referent has already been introduced into the discourse then it is necessarily old information.",
        "However, the converse is not necessarily true.",
        "That is, just because a referent has not been introduced into the discourse does not mean it is 'new information' (Von Stechow 1981).",
        "All it means is that the referent has not been introduced.",
        "The information may have been.",
        "The nonlinguistic Kfis contain metalinguistic knowledge about articles, stories or other appropriate formats and the expectations speakers have about them, knowledge about the topic of the text and specific and general knowledge about the lexicon.",
        "NOSVO tries to establish a link from the sentence under generation to one of the KBs.",
        "If a link can be found from an argument or an adjunct in the input predicate to the knowledge base, the link is recorded and the old information first grammar is used to generate the argument or adjunct first, if possible.",
        "(This is a oversimplification and will be expanded upon.)",
        "If NOSVO can not establish a link to the knowledge base, it searches the meta-knowledge base, i.e. the knowledge base containing information about author motivation for writing an article or story, the techniques authors use to write articles or stories, and information about articles and stories, their parts and subcategories.",
        "The meta--knowledge base is primarily used to establish bridges (Clark and Haviland 1974) discourse initially from the old information in_ the predicate to an inferrable metalinguistic antecedent.",
        "For example, a college professor may begin a lecture (or course) with the discourse initial utterance \"What we're going to look at today (this term) is...\" but not \"*What one of my colleagues said this morning was...\" (Prince 1978, page 889) or \"*What I told my wife this morning was...' (The asterix means semantically unacceptable) The first sentence is allowable because the context, i.e. the class room setting, allows a direct inference to studying (for the term).",
        "'The meta-knowledge base has two parts: a taxonomy similar to the Domain Specific KB and scripts that have knowledge about objects and the actions that they perform, e.g. writers write stories, writers set scenes, stories have scenes.",
        "The algorithm which NOSVO uses to determine which old information first syntax is appropriate is straightforward.",
        "The complicated part is how NOSVO decides what is old information.",
        "Currently NOSVO searches through all comcepts with activation greater than 5.",
        "The value 5 is arbitrary, however.",

        "If NOSVO cannot find an antecedent it assumes that one exists and generates a sentence with plan vanilla, SVO structure, leaving it to the reader to establish the connection.",
        "If NOSVO did not assume an antecedent it would have to discard the sentence as a nonsequitur and potentially confusing and/or misleading.",
        "This is an important issue and will be dealt with in a later and expanded version of NOSVO.",
        "The Linguistic Converter and Category Analyzer analyzes the old information to determine its syntactico-semantic category.",
        "It checks whether it is a prepositional phrase, agent, theme or instrument, in that order.",
        "It then decides if the old information is an internal or external argument or a prepositional phrase adjunct.",
        "With this informatiion it picks the type of grammar that will place the particular argument or adjunct first and sends the choice along with the predicate to the English generator.",
        "The English generator is a prolog grammar segmented into the various old information first syntaxes, e.g. prepositional phrase first, object first rules, and a plain vanilla syntax.",
        "At this point all, or most, of the intelligent work has been done and the generator is nothing more than a syntactic manipulator under the direction of the Linguistic Converter and Category Analyzer.",
        "5.0 Future Research and Directions Future research and development topics for NOSVO include:",
        "1. determining when information cannot be assumed to be in the listener's common ground, i.e., at what level of priming is a concept not in the listener's common ground?",
        "; 2. expanding NOSVO's capability to handle",
        "ellipsis, definiteness, and pronominalization and investigate how the generation of ellipsis and definiteness affects the generation of old information first; 3. extending NOSVO to do more of the linguistic generation from either a more \"conceptual\" representation or to take as input another source langauge such as another natural language or a computer program and generate English from that underlying representation, i.e. expand NOSVO's backend; 4. extending NOSVO's capabilities to handle the subtle distinction between arguments and adjuncts; 5. determining how much the nonapplication or missapplication of the old information first principle, discussed above, makes a difference in reading and understanding text; 6. finally, investigating other old information first syntactic structures and phenomena to determine how they affect a discourse and how they might be integrated into NOSVO.",
        "The next generation of NOSVO will be written in CLOS and Lisp.",
        "The application will be \"generating descriptions of Lisp programs\".",
        "CLOS objects will be used to organize the knowledge structures and CLOS methods will be used to do the actual parsing.",
        "Eventually NOSVO will be expanded and refined along the directions stated above."
