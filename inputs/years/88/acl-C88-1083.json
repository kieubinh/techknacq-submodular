        "Introduction From a computational point of view there is an important difficulty of an adequate formalization of both assertion and presupposition.",
        "It rests on dividing utterances into an explicit part (assertion) and an implicit one (presupposition).",
        "Frege /1892/ refused any explication of this implicit part, because of his idealization that logic deals only with correct statements.",
        "At least in regard of definite descriptions Russell /1905/ pleaded for such an explication.",
        "But classical conjunction was one of its essential formal tools.",
        "To a certain extent assertion and presupposition were represented at one and the same level.",
        "Strawson /1950/ claimed that presuppositions have to be explicated, but not at the same level like the implicit part.",
        "Many linguists e. g. Kiefer /1973/ - believe that logical means can be used to represent both parts of utterances separately, but these representations cannot be put together in one and the same logical expression, because Russell's solution is unsatisfactory.",
        "My intention is to show that functorial variables render to be possible tools for integrating representation of both assertion and presupposition in one and the same logical formula.",
        "Moreover - unlike Bergmann /1981/, Jung/KOstner /1986/ - this representation is a syntactical one and different from that given by means of classical conjunction (cp.",
