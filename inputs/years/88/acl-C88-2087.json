        "Applying F results in a description of the time in terms of a set of phases which forms a chain in the temporal hierarchy with x as its most specific phase or period.",
        "Posterior deictics will have positive numbers as step, anterior will have negative numbers and simultaneous will have 0.",
        "For example, a deictic such as i morgon (tomorrow) will be mapped to a set of Corresponding phases from the YEAR period down to the DAY period, leaving more specific phases unspecified.",
        "This means that while constructing a description of a time unnecessary work is avoided as we are dealing with partial descriptions and not the temporal objects as such.",

        "• Noun phrases with a temporal phase or period word as head and a modifier or ordinal that signals a deictic function, such as (nasta vecka (next week), fOrra dret (last year), etc.",
        "In many contexts prepositions are omitted in Swedish deictic expressions if the remaining NP signals a deictic function on its own.",
        "Note also that a phasal expression such as in October may, apart from specifying a phase October, also function deictically, that is, it may provide phasal values for the periods above its explicit level.",

        "Determining the initial reference time (or index) for deictic expressions is another important consideration.",

        "Next-expressions Expressions such as nasta torsdag (next Thursday), nasta sommar (next summer) and ndsta jul (next Christmas) may be ambiguous to certain speakers.",
        "These expressions seem to be ambiguous in the sense that they either take you 1 or 2 steps from your reference time.",
        "So nasta torsdag may refer to the first or second Thursday from the initial reference time.",

        "How is this possible?",
        "If somebody says nasta torsdag (next Thursday) when the initial reference time is a Thursday, then there is no ambiguity; the step value will be +1 which will pick out the first phase that has the value torsdag after the initial RT.",
        "However, if nasta torsdag was uttered on a Sunday, we would have to adjust the initial RT by either starting at the Thursday preceding the initial RT or at the Thursday succeeding it, and from the 'new' initial RT move +1 to reach a temporal reference.",
        "The expression nasta jul (next Christmas) is analogous to ndsta torsdag.",
        "Instead of saying that next-expressions have two possible step values, +1 or +2, we claim that there is only one value, namely +1, but that when the argument is a phasal expression, such as torsdag, the initial RT may be chosen in two ways depending on individual strategies.",
        "Some may for example choose the nearest phase as their new RT.",
