        "Complicated rules must be established to calculate the right pair for an expression, because of the amount of discrepancies that different languages show with respect to each other.",
        "The way we have chosen to deal with this problem is, conversely, the projection of the different values coming from verbs (type, processivity, morftense, morfaspect, moodrequirement), from adverbs, prepositional phrases and temporal Ws (deixis, aspect, iteration), and from subordinate conjunctions (aspect, moodrequirement).",
        "All this information permits to obtain a final value for aspect and tense for the whole sentence, which later on is percolated, not only to the verb node, but also to the the rest of elements conveying information.",
        "Our proposal relies on the fact that tense/aspect calculation is relevant not only for a good translation of verbs, but also for a good translation of adverbs, PPs, temporal NPs and conjunctions, as we have intended to demonstrate in this paper."
