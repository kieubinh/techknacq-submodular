        "adequate, but also economical and modular.",
        "The tank of the theory is to offer a relatively complete framework, which never captures all the details in their specific and often exceptional character , but which , as Karen Jensen notes in her point (7), offers a maximal coverage , i.e. which contains means necessary and suffieient for handling all such detail s as far as they are relevant for the given application field, In this respect, the theoretical.",

        "2.",
        "The formalism is not the only important ingredient of an NLP system, and it is not interesting here for its own soake.",
        "It is true that the bottleneck of an NLP system is in handling the \"dirty\" exceptional cases, rather than the cases directly fitting into the main body of this or that theory.",
        "As a matter of fact, using any theory, we have to face such intricate but common examples as Kirschner's cases of target language ambiguity (or vagueness) corresponding e.g. to that Of English A11E-forms, or the long but lexically bound sequences of nouns in terminological noun groups, or a procedure translating lexical items by modifying the prodmctive affixes of international terms of Greek and Latin origin and other \"emergency rules\" ensuring that at least an approximate (at least partially readable) output will he achieved.",
        "3.",
        "All this heavily supports the argument that the theoretical framework should be relatively economical.",
        "If two theories, which",
        "in the given conditions cannot be systematically compared.",
        "with respect to their coverage, seem to exhibit a more or less equal degree of adequacy, then the simpler.",
        "one will.",
        "be preferred.",
        "With this framework it is more probable that there would be space enough for capturing all the necessary \"dirty\" details illustrated.",
        "in Section 2.",
        "Dependency grammar meets this condition, since its trees (or even the more complex representations required.",
        "for a treatment of coordinated.",
        "structures) are much simpler than any kind of phrase--structure based represene.",
        "Cations: it is possible to use here complex (although strictly limited) node 'labels and thus distinguish between the syntactically.",
        "free lexical occurrences and function morphemes (the latter need not have nodes of their own); moreover, the representations can be conceived of without nnnterminal symbols (if the kinds of dependency relation, similar e.g. to theta roles, cases, and.",
        "valeney, are denoted by the labels of the edges).",
        "4- Besides the advantage of an economical description, a dependency based procedure may derive from the lexical data all the information necessary for the assignment of theta-roles (valency slots) end other complement-ations by a. head This property is extremely valuable for the formulation of a parser; once the verb is identified and looked-up for in the dictionary, it 'predicts' many pieces of information necessary for the identification of the functions of nominal (including prepositional) complexes (am complementatione of the given verb).",
        "Ac far as our own experience with the build-up of Lilt' eyetems goes , this holds true not; only when working with highly inflectional languages (the word order of which is, consequently, not grammatically determined), but also 0.1 for parser of English, Theinformation on the 'theta mles' belongs to one dimension of the tree , namely the vertical one.",
        "The second dimension, horie-zontal, is left free to denote the topic--focup articulation and the deep word order, which contributes to the determination or operator scopes in semantic interpretation.",
        "Coordination (as well so apposition) constitutes a third dimension, similarly ae with other approaches; rules have been formulated (by Pit Sgall, Petkevie) which handle hierarchical.",
        "as well em sequential coordinated structures in the linearized sent-once representations.",
        "5.",
        "The arguments brought forward against dependency as the basis of an integrated linguistic description are not so weighty am they may seem at first blush: anaphoric relations and the relative closeness of adjunct:: or other modifications can best be solved on the basis of an account of topic and focus;, and instead of \"double dependency\" with predicative complements we use a broader notion of manner adverbial.",
        "Our framework differs from Gaifman's in imposing no specific limits on the sequences of non-terminals used in the derivations of representations (Borota).",
        "The framework has been used with advantage as the basis of the natural language processing systems built in our group, be it parsers for machine translation systems (English-to-Czech, Czech-to-Russian) or for a system modelling natural language comprehension (MAO."
