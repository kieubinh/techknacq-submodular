        "This paper Identifies two kinds of sentences: linguistic\" sentences rod \"real' sentences.",
        "The former is a kind of sentences that ere alien discussed in (cornputational) linguistic literatures, such as tiiime in Figure 1.",
        "The latter, on the other hand, is a kind of sentences that appear hi practical applications, such as those In Figure 2.",
        "IV' 'emus both are grammatical English sentences, they appeal' to bo significantly different.",
        "In this paper, we discuss the characteristics of those two kinds of sentences, and claim that a different approach is necessary to parse each kind of sentences.",
        "John hit Mary.",
        "Every man who owns a donkey beats it.",
        "I saw a roan with a telescope.",
        "The horse raced past the barn fell.",
        "limo flies like an arrow.",
        "The mouse the cat the dog chased ate died.",
        "John persuaded Mary to expect that he believes that she likes an apple.",
        "All processes (programs) In the destroyed window (or Icon) are killed (except nohupod processes; see nohup(1) in the 1-1P-UX Rotaroma); therefore, make sure you really wish to destroy a window or an Icon before you perform this task.",
        "This window contains en HP-UX shell (either a Bourne shell or C-shell, depending on the value of the SHELL environment variable; for details, sun the \"Concepts\" section of the \"Using Commands\" chapter).",
        "It seems Mat problems in parsing sentences can be classified Into two categories: linguistically \"Interesting\" problems and linguistically \"uninteresting\" problems.",
        "Linguistically Interesting\" problems are those for which there are no obvious solutions, and reasonably sophisticated theories are required to solve them, or those behind which there are general linguistic principles, and a small number of general roles can cope with them (e.g., relativization, causativization, ambiguity, movement, garden-path, etc).",
        "On the other hand, linguistically \"uninteresting\" problems are those for which there exist obvious solutions, or those behind which there Is no general linguistic principle, and it is just a matter of writing and adding rulerl to cope with these problems (e.g., punctuation, dale and time expressions, Idioms, etc).",
        "Figures 3 and 4 show example Interesting\" and \"uninteresting\" problems, respectively.",
        "While one could give an elegant explanation of why the second sentence in figure 3 ungrammatleal, there Is no particular reason why \"15th July\" le ungrammatlea, other than that it is simply not English.",
        "John expects Mary to kiss herself.",
        "* John expects Mary to kiss himself.",
        "John expects Mary to kiss him.",
        "on July 15th on the fifteenth of July on 7/15 ' on 15th July in July 15th",
        "\"Linguistic\" sentences usually contain one or more linguistically interesting problems, with few or no linguisctically uninteresting problems.",
        "\"Real\" sentences, on the other hand, contain many uninteresting problems, but fewer interesting problems.",
        "In (computational) linguistic literatures, uninteresting problems can be Ignored, as long as everybody agrees that there are obvious solutions for them.",
        "In practical applications, on the other hand, we cannot ignore uninteresting problems, or systems simply do riot work.",
        "One of the projects at the Center for Machine Translation at Carnegie-Mellon University is to translate personal computer manuals from English to Japanese and from Japanese to English.",
        "In this project, and perhaps in any other practical projects that have to deal with \"real\" sentences, the system's failures are caused by a few Interesting problems and tons of uninteresting problems.",
        "There often exist reasonable approximate solutions to Interesting problems in practical applications; for example, it is quite acceptable to assume that there are no embedded relative clauses in computer manuals, in order to simplify the (interesting) problem of relativization.",
        "On the other hand, there are no quick solutions to uninteresting problems other than writing a bench of rules.",
        "• We can never anticipate and prepare for all of these uninteresting problems in advance.",
        "It seems as if there will be always these problems no matter how carefully and how many times we test and debug the system and its grammar.",
        "• The quantity of the knowledge sources (i.e., grammars/rules) has to be very large; unlike interesting problems, rules for uninteresting problems can hardly generalized into a smaller number of rules, as each of them represents an uninteresting problem with no general linguistic principles behind it.",
        "• it is more difficult for humans to test, debug, and maintain a larger amount of knowledge sources accurately and consistently.",
        "• It is more difficult for a system to access a larger amount of knowledge sources efficiently.",
        "These problems are much more serious than linguistically \"Interesting\" problems, and directly affect performance of practical systems."
