      "text": [
        "This paper is concerned with heuristics for segmenting narratives into units that form the basic elements of discourse representations and that constrain the application of focusing algorithms.",
        "The importance of proper segmentation is frequently mentioned; as one text says, \"the need for segmentation is almost universally agreed upon .... A good model of segmentation is essential to simplify the problem of understanding discourse.",
        "In particular, it divides the problem into two major subproblems: what techniques are needed to analyze the sentences within a segment and how segments can be related to each other\" (Allen 1987: 398-399).",
        "However, \"there is little consensus on what the segments of a particular discourse should be or how segmentation could be accomplished.",
        "One reason for this lack of consensus is that there is no precise definition of what a segment is beyond the intuition that certain sentences naturally group together\" (ibid.).",
        "A brief discussion of our position is therefore in order, addressing the following questions: What is it that is being segmented?",
        "What is the dominant feature of a segment?",
        "What is the purpose of the segmentation process?",
        "We adopt the position that reading a narrative, like taking part in a conversation, is a form of social interaction.",
        "However, the nature of the interaction is quite different in narratives and conversations, and so are the principles of segmentation and the nature of the resulting segments.",
        "The time of a conversation coincides with the time of its content.",
        "Simultaneity in time is typically accompanied by a tight integration between linguistic and non-linguistic behavior: the verbalization of how-to-get-there directions is the action of giving directions, task-oriented conversations between an expert and apprentice are an integral part of performing the task at hand, and the unfolding text of an William Rapaport Graduate Group in Cognitive Science and Department of Computer Science State University of New York at Buffalo Buffalo, NY 14260 rapaport@cs.buffalo.edu argumentative dialogue is precisely the activity of arguing.",
        "Conversation can thus properly be called performative discourse.",
        "By contrast, the content of a narrative is decoupled from the linear progression of its text and unfolds in its own, separate timeline.",
        "It follows that in place of the situation of discourse, a narrative is processed with respect to a constantly maintained deictic center, which is \"the locus in conceptual space-time of the objects and events depicted or described by the sentences currently being perceived.",
        "At any point in the narrative, the cognitive agent's attention is focused on particular characters (and other objects) standing in particular temporal and spatial relations to each other.",
        "Moreover, the agent 'looks' at the narrative from the perspective of a particular character, spatial location and temporal location.",
        "Thus the deictic center consists of a WHERE-point, a WHEN-point and a WHO-point.\"",
        "(Bruder et al.",
        "1986: 1).",
        "In this paper, the WHEN-point of the deictic center is referred to as the Temporal Focus (cf. Webber 1987a,b; Nakhi-movsky 1987b).",
        "We conceive of discourse segments (DSs) as continuous stretches of text corresponding to relatively monolithic pieces of internal representation.",
        "What \"relatively monolithic\" means is the subject of much of the rest of the paper; at this point, we simply say that the DS remains the same as long as the deictic center does not undergo drastic changes in space, time, perspective or composition, while the beginning of a new DS is accompanied/signaled by a discontinuity in one or several of these parameters.",
        "Within each segment, reference and anaphora are processed by local algorithms mostly relying on recency lists as in Sidner (1983).",
        "At the beginning of a new DS, a snore global search through the accumulated representation is required.",
        "We thus have three kinds of entities organized into three kinds of structures: linearly ordered stretches of text forming the Linear Text Structure (LTS); the Event-Situation Structure (ESS, cf. Webber 1987b), representing the narrative's unfolding contents; and the Current Focus Space, which is a collection of focusing mechanisms (including the deictic center) that together represent the \"attentional state\" (Grosz & Sidner 1986) of the system.",
        "The components of the LTS are frequently linked by rhetorical relations such as elaboration, resumption or flashback (see, e.g., Hobbs 1982).",
        "We believe that these rhetorical relations are simply macro labels that stand for certain oft-repeated clusters of discontinuities in the ESS.",
        "It is the discontinuities that are essential for constructing the ESS; the rhetorical labels need not be recognized by the reader at all, just as, on the sentence",
        "level, speech acts need not be recognized in order to understand the intention of the speaker (Cohen & Levesque 1987).",
        "The foregoing has served to motivate the need for reliable segmentation heuristics.",
        "Most such heuristics found in the literature are syntactical in nature, relying, in almost Eliza-like fashion, on clue words and phrases (see references in Grosz & Sidner 1986: 177).",
        "We propose that heuristics should be based on semantical considerations such as discontinuities in the representation.",
        "This paper investigates four kinds of discontinuities: discontinuities of topic, discontinuities of space and time, discontinuities of figure and ground, and discontinuities of the narrative perspective.",
        "Section 2 explains what these are; the remainder of this section gives a preliminary and partial illustration and reviews related work."

        "(1985) can be seen as a search for the principles on which such patterns are built.)",
