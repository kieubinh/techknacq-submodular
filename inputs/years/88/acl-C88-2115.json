        "In this paper we present a research paradigm which, in fact, does not exactly match any of these perspectives: The Languages Network.",
        "In this paradigm each pair of languages will be treated as within a transfer application but with the characteristics of indirect translation: analysis of the source language and synthesis of the target language are riot totally dependent on each other.",
        "The proces must be split up into a large number of pieces which can he connected into a huge network performing MT from and into several languages.",
        "Implementations of this paradigm are being carried out by the author by means of the translator generator SYGMART (see /Chauche/, /Chauché, 1974/ and /Rolf, 1985/), winch permits the linguist to implement whatever he wants in the field of MT in an efficient way on a wide range of computers (from Atari1040STf via SUN's to IBM VM/CMS mainframes)."

        "The idea which leads to the definition of an intermediate language originates from the wish that, in translation from one source language into several target languages, no completely different translation should have to be made for each pair of languages.",
        "Brandt Corstius /Brandt Corstius, 1978/ expresses this idea as follows (the citation has been translated from Dutch into English): \"Instead of making 90 programs in order to translate ten languages into one another (from each language into each of the nine others), it would be sufficient to have 20 translation programs (from each language into Machinish, and from Machinish into each of the languages).",
        "It is even conceivable that eighteen programs would he sufficient, if one of the ten languages is given the role of this intermediate language.\" This standpoint implies an \"efficient\" method in terms of the amount of work, without indicating whether this method solves also any principal problems with respect to machine translation.",

        "This implies that a language should he found in which it is possible to represent all possible meanings in an unambiguous way.",
        "If Brandt Corstius is followed in this, then in the translation from and into natural language this would have to be one of the natural languages.",
        "But one of the main characteristics of natural language is precisely that it is efficient, which implies that with few words and constructions a lot can be expressed in very many different circumstances.",
        "The way in which each individual natural language is efficient differs from language to language: ambiguities and vagueness in a source language cannot usually be projected in a one-to-one correspondence onto a target language.",
        "So it would seem to be not entirely plausible to select an intermediate language from the languages to be translated, seeing that the.",
        "demand of unarnbiguity is too heavy precisely for natural language.",
        "An intermediate language should not only be unambiguous, but it should also be able to represent all possible meanings.",
        "We are convinced that for every sentence of a natural language an infinite set of meanings is possible, since meaning depends on the universe of discourse and the set of possible universes of discourse is infinitely large.",
        "All in all there is enough cause for a fundamental approach to the problem: what is to be achieved in defining an intermediate language in the machine translation of a set of natural languages from and into each of the members of that set?",
        "The need for an intermediate language originates, on the one hand, from the idea that the analysis of a source language will be largely the same, irrespective of the target language into with it is to be translated, and on the other hand, from the need to analyse the source language in such a way that all ambiguities have been solved, and that therefore the generation of the target language can take place without any further problems.",
        "With respect to the former, we, too, believe that the idea that the analysis of a source language is partly the same, irrespective of the selected target language, is entirely correct.",
        "When we plot the translation process on a line from source language to target language, tins will be the part which is close to the source language: to put it in rather more linguistic terms: the morphological analysis and that part of the other syntactic analysis that can be summed up in the term surface grammar, so in any case the.",
