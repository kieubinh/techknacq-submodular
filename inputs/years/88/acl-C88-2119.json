        "It constructs a definition by weighting both the strategic predicates that might comprise a definition and the propositions that might be used to fill the strategic predicates.",

        "In its simplest form, a definition-giving dialogue consists of an information-seeker asking \"What is an X?\" and an information-provider saying \"An X is a ....\" In actual practice, however, there are many ways a definition can be requested and many ways the request can be responded to by the information-provider.",
        "In order to identify the characteristics of definition-giving dialogues; we have analyzed transcripts of novice-expert dialogues from a variety of domains, including student/advisor dialogues, recipe-providing dialogues, taxpayer/tax-agent dialogues, and radio talk shows in which callers sought expert advice on investments and real estate.'",

        "In addition to giving definitions in response to a request by the user, the expert may provide a definition as part of correcting a user misconception [McCoy 1986], or may generate definitions spontaneously.",

        "McKeown [McKeown 1985] studied definitions in the context of requests for information about the objects modeled by a database system.",
        "She claimed that humans have mutually known conventions for organizing information and providing definitions, and that a natural language system should make use of these strategies in producing explanations.",
        "Given a definition request, her TEXT system selected a rhetorical strategy based on the information available.",
        "The rhetorical strategy was then responsible for selecting the information to be incorporated into the definition.",
        "TEXT treated requests for definitions as isolated queries, whereas we are interested in definitions generated in the course of ongoing task-oriented dialogues.",
        "Our analysis of transcripts of naturally occurring interactions indicates that definitions generated in task-oriented dialogues differ significantly from those generated statically or as a result of isolated definition requests.",

        "1.",
        "In task-oriented dialogues, the information-provider knows something about what the information-seeker is trying to accomplish, and will generate definitions that help the information-seeker achieve his goals.",

        "E: \"Baking soda is an ingredient that, when heated, releases carbon dioxide, thereby causing the mixture to expand in size.\" E: \"Baking soda is a substance that, when dissolved in water, produces a chemically basic solution that will counteract acidity.\"",
        "2.",
        "Whereas static definitions or responses to one-shot requests for definitions must assume a generic model for the information-seeker, responses to definition requests during an ongoing dialogue can take into account acquired beliefs about the information-seeker's specific domain knowledge.",
        "For example, the information-provider might include an analogy to an entity that the information-seeker is already familiar with, as in the following definition of the course CS106: E: \"CS106 is like CS105, except that it uses Fortran instead of Pascal and emphasizes scientific applications of computing.\" 3.",
        "Whereas static definitions and responses to one-shot requests for definitions must be generated all at once, dialogue allows the information-provider to produce what he thinks will be an acceptable definition and analyze the information-seeker's response to determine whether to elaborate on the definition.",
        "For example, in the following dialogue with a veterinarian about treating a cat with a hyperthyroid condition, the veterinarian (E) provides a definition that he believes will satisfy the information-seeker's needs, then must elaborate on it when the information-seeker's response reveals multiple goals: to improve the condition of the cat and to have medication that is easy to administer.",
        "E: \"Tapazole is a drug that decreases the function of the thyroid.\" U: \"How large are the pills?\"",
        "If a system carrying on a task-oriented dialogue is to be viewed by the information-seeker as cooperative, intelligent, and natural, it must take the above factors into account.",
        "Otherwise, it will not appear to be directed toward the user's goals (uncooperative), will not appear to make use of what the user already knows (unintelligent), and will not appear to take advantage of the fact that the interaction is ongoing, as opposed to one-shot (unnatural).",
        "Our hypothesis is that, instead of using a rhetorical strategy to determine the content of a definition, the system should reason about the user's plans and goals and specific domain knowledge to decide the importance of incorporating individual propositions into the final definition.",

        "The choice of a rhetorical strategy should be made on the basis of being able to include into the definition those features deemed most important.",
