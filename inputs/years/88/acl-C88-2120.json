        "The most important issue in discourse parsing is the necessity of semi-determinism.",
        "Spontaneous dialogue involves unpremeditated turn-taking and interruption.",
        "In order for this to be possible, there must regularly be points in an interaction at which the interpretation of utterances so far is mutually established as independent of the discourse which is to follow.",
        "Moreover, an unanticipated next utterance can operate in a mutually understood way on the structure of the discourse so far (for instance, by abandoning a digression to pop to a previously interrupted dcu).",
        "Therefore, at points where such a move is allowed, there must also be mutual agreement on the structure of the discourse so far.",
        "The granularity of this \"unpredictability without misunderstanding\" seems to be the clause or sentence level.",
        "We therefore postulate an incremental left-to-right parsing process at this level of granularity, which operates in essentially deterministic mode.",
        "In [24] we gave an informal description of such a parsing process, which processes every incoming sentence incrementally, extending an existing discourse tree to the right by node insertion.",
        "An important assumption of the parsing process as described there, is that at any point it only uses information on the right edge of the existing discourse tree.",
        "This means that interlocutors just need to be.",
        "aware of the stack of information which corresponds to the labels on the right edge of the tree, rather than the complete details of the discourse that went before.",
        "Inspection of the grammar rules in the previous section suggests that this grammar Is compatible with the parsing strategy outlined in [24]: relevant information is always propagated up to the right edge of the tree, and dcu interpretations get propagated up without being influenced by the nature of the intervening nodes."

        "The augmented context free grammar developed above should be taken as a demonstration of the possibility and utility of formal grammars for decribing structural and semantic phenomena in natural language discourse.",
        "We expect that work of this kind, especially if carried out on a larger scale, will constitute a more fruitful path to new insights than approaches which are oriented towards essayistic description or unprincipled implementation.",
        "We should not make exaggerated claims concerning the formalism we have used here.",
        "Much more work is needed before it will be clear what kind of formal framework has the best fit with the phenomena.",
        "But it is probably useful to articulate our thoughts on how the augmented context free grammar formalism compares to other formalisms that could have been used in this work.",
        "The formalism we have used is a context free grammar augmented with attributes, which propagates feature values through term unification on value-expressions containing variables.",
        "Similar formalisms have been used for sentence-level syntax.",
        "The closest is the ACFG formalism used for the grammar of BBN's Spoken Language System [111 (21, which mainly differs in assuming a more limited syntax of attribute-value expressions.",
        "Definite Clause Grammars [21], if decoupled from their commitment to Prolog programming, are also very similar.",
        "Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar [7], as well as related theories such as HPSG and LFG, share many aspects of our approach: ad emphasis on context free surface structure, and the use of a unification process to enforce the desired agreement and inheritance behaviour on the values of attributes.",
        "However, these frameworks use unification on graphs rather than logical term-expressions.",
        "This probably creates additional expressive power, but it goes at the cost of ease of implementation and of conceptual clarity.",
        "It is a major advantage of logical term unification that there is an obvious and simple semantics for it: any object which may contain variables, be it an attribute value, a syntactic tree, or a context free rule, can be viewed as an abbreviation for the set of its ground instances; applying the most general unifier to a set of terms yields a term standing for the intersection of the sets of their ground instances.",
        "Compared to the conceptual and computational simplicity of logical term unification, the graph unification formalisms used in modern linguistic frameworks are rather cumbersome.",
        "There do not seem to be good linguistic reasons for preferring graph unification.",
        "An interesting perspective on the kind of grammar we have used follows from the realization that it can be viewed as a particular instance of an attribute grammar as defined by Knuth [16]: one in which the values of the attributes on a node are always synthesized from the values on the nodes of Its immediate constituents.",
        "This raises the question whether one might want to formulate this directional dependency explicitly in an attribute grammar notation.",
        "More interestingly, it raises the question whether there are phenomena that could be more elegantly described as inheritance from a top node to its constituents, rather than the other way around.",
        "We expect such phenomena to occur if we would want to Integrate more global constraints, related to people's tasks, goals and plans, into our description of discourse.",
        "Finally, we want to reflect on the Augmented Transition Network formulation of discourse structure that we used in previous, more informal papers [23].",
        "ATNs do have some properties which are attractive for discourse.",
        "A looping arc which updates a register constitutes a powerful device that doesn't have a direct equivalent in other formalisms.",
        "In the current grammar we emulate the effect of such an arc by a recursive binary structure: lists and narratives are built up by repeated extension to the right.",
        "Intuitively, one sees lists and narratives as flat structures, and we have described them in those terms in previous papers [24].",
        "The power of ATNs thus makes it possible to account more directly for the structures that seem plausible.",
        "The framework used in the present paper is conceptually simple, and more limited than any of its alternatives.",
        "Nevertheless, it seems powerful enough to describe the phenomena we encountered in developing the grammar presented here.",
        "Subsequent research will have to answer the question whether It is ultimately powerful enough to describe the full range of discourse phenomena in a felicitous way.",
        "In the present discussion we have ignored what in previous work we have called the level of speech event structure, which is concerned with the structure of discourse as a social activity.",
        "[22] [23] By the same token, we have left unaddressed the fact that discourse structures may reflect the tasks, goals and plans of the discourse participants, as they would be construed in A.I.",
        "based approaches to discourse analysis.",
        "Observations reported in [36] show (1) that speech event structure and linguistic discourse structure may be at odds with each other, and (2) that the linguistic discourse structure has the most direct semantic relevance In such cases.",
        "Though speech event structure and task structure have in fact considerable semantic relevance and must ultimately be factored In, we want to hold off on dealing with the complexities involved in this issue.",
        "The grammar presented in this paper provides a formal characterization of Discourse Parse Trees by means of the bottom-up rules used in its construction.",
        "The problem of mating these bottom-up rules with necessary high-level, top-down rules Involving phenomena occurring in the task domain or interaction is essentially the problem of plan-recognition.",
        "In an operational system, the functionality of a linguistically based discourse parser would thus be very much enhanced by an efficient Plan Recognizer of the type envisioned in \"plan based\" and \"intention based\" pragmatic discourse models [1], [14], [18], [33].",
        "On the other hand, Incorporating a discourse grammar would improve the",
        "functionality of existing plan based models, which lack explicit mechanisms for relating sentential syntax and semantics to pragmatic plan structures."
