        "In this paper, we present a uniform framework for dealing with errors in natural language sentences within the context of automated second language teaching.",
        "The idea is to use a feature grammar and to analyse errors as being sentences where features have other values than those they should have.",
        "By using a feature grammar it is possible to describe various types of errors (agreement, syntactic and semantic errors) in a uniform framework, to' define in a clear and transparent way what an error is and this is very important for our application to analyse errors as arising from a misunderstanding or ignorance of grammatical rules on the part of the students.",
        "The treatment and even the definition of errors within a language tutoring context is very different from the context of other applications of natural language understanding (c. f. approaches as described in [WEISCHEDEL 1983]), because the goal is different.",
        "In most applications, the: goal is to understand a sentence despite any errors, i. e. to somehow analyse the sentence.",
        "In a language tutoring system, the goal is to understand what the student wanted to do, where he went wrong and what grammar rules he misunderstood or was unaware of.",
        "In this respect, error treatment is more difficult in the context of language tutoring than in other contexts, because errors do not need to be just ignored or sentences to be parsed despite any errors, but the errors and the reasons for them have to be understood.",
        "To formulate this concisely, we could say : we are attempting to perform sensitive parsing rather than robust parsing.This means that we aim to achieve a, system which is very sensitive to all possible kinds of errors and which moreover tries to find the \"why\" and the \"how\" of errors.",
        "Related research has been carried out by [MENZEL 1986; PULMAN 1984; WEISCHEDEL et al.",
        "1978].",
        "Menzel's system is much more limited than ours, because he handles only fragmentory utterances whereas we try to analyse the correctness of complete sentences freely formed by students.",
        "Weischedel's treatment of syntactic and agreement errors Is very similar to ours but less general and less thorough (they only recognize an error without explaning the reasons for it).",
        "Here it is proposed to describe how we deal with agreement, syntactic and semantic errors within a German language tutoring system [SCHWIND 1986].",
        "1.",
        "Agreement errors",
        "In German, articles, adjectives and nouns within a noun group have to agree in gender, number and case, and verbs have to agree in person and number with the subject noun phrase of the sentence.",
        "The object complements of verbs take certain cases and so do prepositions.",
        "Agreement errors are errors on the syntactic level, but they do not concern the order of the words in a sentence, hence they can be corrected by changing the case, the number, the person or the gender of the noun phrases or parts of them.",
        "2.",
        "Syntactic errors",
        "We consider two types of syntactic errors, the first involving words which have been omitted or added, e.g. when an article or a preposition is missing or superfluous, and the second involving the permutation of words or syntactic groups.",
        "The latter error is very frequent in German because here the possible places of verbs in a sentence can differ from many other languages : for example, the verb can go to the very end of a sentence or to the very beginning.",
        "Some syntactic errors have to be partly",
        "analysed at the morphological level because they involve both word construction and word order : for an example, in German there are verbs which have a prefix which in certain cases has to be detached and placed at the very end of the sentence.",
        "(1) Er kommt zurtick (He comes back).",
        "This is the correct formulation of the sentence.",
        "Students of German tend typically not to detach the prefix zuriJck and construct the ill-formed sentence (2) * Er zuruckkommt (He backcomes).",
        "The word zurOckkommt does not exist in German (although the infinitive is zurOckkommen) and this error has to be recognized at the word level, because zuriickkoinint is an ill-formed word, although the underlying error is a syntactic error.",
        "3.",
        "Semantic Errors",
        "We have actually been working on one type of semantic errors, namely errors in the semantic verb cases which arise from a misunderstanding of the meaning of verbs and nouns.",
        "and their semantic relationships, thus posing lexical problems.",
        "For example, when a student forms the sentence",
        "(3) *Das Heft arbeitet (The notebook works).",
        "he has not understood that arbeiten requires an animate subject and that Heft is not animate, i.e. he has a lexical problem.",
        "In what follows, we will first introduce, in a informal way, the theoretical background for error definition and then discuss the treatment of syntactic and semantic errors within the language teaching system.",
        "Our system is implemented in PROLOG II and has been tested with various dictionaries and by different users (adult language students, pupils)."

      "text": [
        "In this chapter, the concepts of feature grammar and unification are introduced informally.",
        "We provide a slightly modified definition of unification where the result of the unification is the unified elements and the set of the pairs of elements for which the unification did not work out.",
        "This set is necessary for interpreting and explaning errors, Complex features have been used by most schools 01 linguistics [KAPLAN R.M., BRESNAN J.",
        "1983; KARTUNEN 1984].",
        "The whole process of syntactic analysis is governed by features and their values.",
        "Not only the lexical elements are classified by features but also the syntactic categories.",
        "For example, the category sentence is subclassified by the features satzstellung, whose values, indicate whether the sentence has a normal word order or has the verb at the very end or at the beginning, (this corresponds in German to different types of embedded phrases), and by the feature embedded with values + and - indicating whether a sentence or a noun phrase contains embedded phrases.",
        "We have constructed a grammar using 25 syntactic and 40 semantic features.",
        "To our knowledge, until now feature grammars have never been applied to the problem of analysing iilformed sentences, nor within the context of language teaching.",
        "A feature grammar is an extension of a CHOMSKY-grammar.",
        "The alphabet consists of structured symbols which are sets of pairs (feature,value), In the rest of this paper, a structured symbol a will be written as a tuple a=[fi (vi),...fn(vn)] where the fi denote feature names and the vi their values.",
        "No feature can occur twice within a structured symbol.",
        "The set of features occurring in a, {fi ,...fn} is called the domain of a, and is written d(a).",
        "The value of fe d(a) in a is denoted by a(f).",
        "Hence a(f) = v iff f(v) E a.",
        "In many cases it is useful to introduce a more concise notation for sets of structured symbols.",
        "We need to denote such sets, because many words are ambigous and have to be described by a set of structured symbols rather than by a single one.",
        "Most current theories also allow features that have complex values.",
        "By using disjunction and negation of values many structured symbols can be written much more economically.",
        "For example, the German noun Kind can have three cases (nominative, dative and accusative), but in this formalism it is denoted by just one symbol [gender(neutr),case(neg(genitive)),number(singular)].",
        "Let us call sets of structured symbols complex symbols.",
        "Structured symbols are used in a formal grammar for natural language sentences in the following way: there is one feature, cat (category), that plays a special part and whose values are the categories usually needed in a natural language grammar: sent (sentence), rip (noun phrase), vp (verb phrase), etc.",
        "Further features characterize properties according to which categories are subclassified; e.g. vcat (verb category) is a feature whose values are intrans (intransitive) and trans (transitive) and prep (prepositional complement); the feature place subclassifies verbs and its possible values are the numbers 1, 2, 3 , standing for the number of complements of a verb.",
        "tense is a feature with the properties pluperfect, imperfect, pert, pros , fut specifying the time of a verb.",
        "These three features all subclassify verbs.",
        "Other more frequently cited features are case, number, gender which characterize articles, nouns, adjectives, but also noun phrases and noun groups.",
        "Semantic properties of categories are equally characterized by features and formally these \"semantic\" features are not distinguished from \"syntactic\" features; e.g. animate is a semantic feature whose values are + and - and which belongs to nouns, durative and static and action are features which classify verbs.",
        "All possible types of errors have been defined by means of features.",
        "The definition of unification is slightly different from the usual definition (see [KARTUNEN 1984]), because in our.",
        "application we need not only to find whether two symbols can be unified but also for what reasons they might possibly not be unified.",
        "Hence we need to have all the pairs of elements which cannot be unified.",
        "Let a= [fi (v1),•••fn(vn)] and b= [91 (w1),...9m(wm)), where vi andare sets of values.",
        "Then we define a predicate wl unify(a,b,r,e) where r is the result of the unification and e is the set consisting of all the pairs of value sets for which a and b could not be unified, together with all the symbols' contained in the symmetrical difference between a and b. r ={f(v) : f(v)e a ÷ b or (fe d(a) n d(b) and v=a(f) n b(f) whenever a(f) n b(f) 00 (= denotes the symmetrial difference between sets) e={f(v) : f(v)e a + b or (fe d(a) n d(b) and a(f) n b(f)=0 and v=<a(f),b(f)>)} The unification is defined on sets of complex symbols.",
        "Let be a.",
        "(ai , a2,...an} and b={bi , b2,...bm} where all al and bi are of the form [f1 (vi ),...fn(vn)].",
        "Then the predicate unification of a and b (with the results r and e) is defined as the union set of all elements which unify(abbi,r,e)",
        "The definite article der is described by the complex symbol c= {[Art-cat(def), Gender, case(genitive), number(plural)], [Art-cat(def), Gender(fem), case(or( genitive,dative)), number(singular) ], [Art-cat(def), Gender(masc), case(nominative),number(singular)]}.",
        "The noun Lehrer (teacher) has the representation n1= {[Gender(masc), case(neg( genitive)), number(singular)],",
        "Feature grammars are defined as formal grammars manipulating strings of complex symbols and the derivability concept is modified according to the structures of the complex symbols.",

        "The analysis of agreement errors in German is complex because morphologically, the words are highly ambigous.",
        "There are 24 different definite articles (4 cases, 3 genders and 2 numbers) but there are only 6 different words for them all, each of which can have between 2 and 8 interpretations (or meanings).",
        "lh the same way, every noun has at most four different forms which can have 8 different morphosyntactic meanings.",
        "Adjectives are even more ambigous, because there are (at least) 4 different declinations according to their context within a sentence : preceded by a definite or an indefinite article, by no• article or by a negation.",
        "Our grammar contains these four declinations, i.e. 4\"3\"2\"4 adjective meanings and only 5 forms for them (ending by \"e\", \"en\", \"gm\", \"er\", \"es\").",
        "But the case and number of a noun phrase within a sentence depend on the verb, since a verb takes a certain case and determines the number.",
        "Hence an error in the number of a",
        "noun phrase could also be an error in the number of the 'verb.",
        "Moreover, when two elements of a phrase do not •agree, there are frequently several possible ways of analysing and explaining the disagreement.",
        "For this reason, the definition of unification has been slightly modified so as to produce all the pairs of features which 'do not agree as to their values.",

        "In the above example, three different analyses have been found.",

        "We have found that case filtering gives plausible explanations.",

        "In (5), der Kind is the indirect object of the sentence and the expected case is the dative.",
        "Case filtering gives us the second error analysis : disagreement in the gender, since der is feminine whereas Kind is neuter.",
        "In (6), der Kind is the direct object of the sentence and the expected case is the accusative.",
        "by case filtering, we find that der cannot be accusative.",
        "The most likely strategy for analysing of agreement errors consists of placing an error as high as possible within a syntax tree.",
        "But this procedure can be eliminated in the following situation.",
        "Take the sentence : (7) * Der Glitter zernen (The gods are angry).",
        "Glitter has the representation",
        "Der GOtter is the subject of the sentence and the expected case is the nominative, der Miler is genitive plural and this is the error signalled (disagreement on the case).",

        "It is very unlikely that a student should try to construct a genitive plural, which is a \"difficult\" case, when the nominative is required., which is the \"easiest\" case.",
        "Poeple make errors in order to make their lives easier!",
        "Hence, the strategy of analysing errors as high as possible is not applicable when a subject noun phrase, which should be in the nominative case, could be analysed as having another case whereas parts of it are in the nominative.",
        "Now, we have seen, that in the definition of unification even when the unification is successful, the set of nonunifiable elements is produced.",
        "Besides computational issues, because the algorithm runs only once through the lists, this set is very useful when a noun phrase already analysed, such as the one in our example, has to be reviewed 'in order to find a possible ,disagreement between its parts.",
