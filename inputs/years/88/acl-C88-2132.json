        "Chart parsing is directional in the sense that it works from the starting point (usually the beginning of the sentence) extending its activity usually in a rightward manner.",
        "We shall introduce the concept of a chart that works outward from islands and makes sense of as much of the sentence as it is actually possible, and after that will lead to predictions of missing fragments.",
        "So, for any place where the easily identifiable fragments occur in the sentence, the process will extend to both the left and the right of the islands, until possibly completely missing fragments are reached.",
        "At that point, by virtue of the fact that both a left and a right context were found, heuristics can be introduced that predict the nature of the missing fragments.",
        "I.",
        "Introduction The goal of using \"high level\" knowledge sources in recognizing continuous speech is to reduce the hypotheses space generated by acoustic-phonetic analysis (and possibly to implement an interpretation of the utterance) (see for instance Walker 1976, Stringa 1988).",
        "Decodifying the vocal signal is a process that must take into account phenomena such as the coarticulatory processes typical of continuous speech and the presence of many sources of variability of the signal (anatomic characteristics of the speaker, emission speed, prosody and so on).",
        "These phenomena have as a consequence the fact that, at the level of acoustic-phonetic analysis, it is extremely uncertain how to segment the signal and what labels to give to the segments.",
        "Therefore acoustic-phonetic analysis generates a space of possible interpretative hypotheses of the signal; in general, the likelihood of each lexical hypothesis is given a score.",
        "A matrix of lexical hypotheses is provided by the lower level processes.",
        "Each hypothesis is characterized by: a) the hypothesized string that was recognized; b) the score of this hypothesis; c) the time interval that this hypothesis spans.",
        "We consider two different thresholds for the likelihoods: the word hypotheses with score above the higher threshold are to be considere4 \"very reliable\", and their role will be to drive the procest The word hypotheses with score between the two thresholds will be included in the analysis without a driving role, while the word hypotheses below the lower threshold are not to be considered, at least in the first pass.",
        "This work is about parsing with the above constraints.",
        "In this connection it seems advantageous to anchor the recognizing process to those hypotheses that were given a high score.",
        "As we shall see, there is also a predictive aspect in our approach: this means that the parser will tell the lower level component to \"do its best\" to find in the given place an instance of what was predicted.",
        "In the simplest case we can think of a direct recovering of a word hypothesis with score below the lower threshold.",
        "Our starting point will be a very well founded technique, that has also been experimentally proved as valid, namely chart parsine% Chart parsing works very well with well formed input, but the technique was not conceived for working with an uncertain input, and even worse, with a fragmentary input.",
        "Chart parsing is directional in the sense that it works from the starting point (usually the beginning of the sentence) extending its activity usually in a rightward manner.",
        "We shall introduce a different concept, that nonetheless will work with the same linguistic data.",
        "The concept is that of a chart that works outward from islands and makes sense of as much of the sentence as it is actually possible.",
        "Furthermore, where the signal was just not detected, predictions can be made on the basis of the configuration and of a set of heuristics.",
        "After the application of these heuristics, and the introduction of new low level hypotheses, the algorithm works on in the same way and if the situation was not unrecoverable concludes with one (or more) complete analysis of the sentence.",
        "It is worth noting that the proposed solution helps also in dealing with ill-formed written input.",
        "There is something more to it: in the general treatment we are giving in this paper we shall refer only to a grammar coded in the traditional form of rewriting rules, but the mechanism can work with a large number of formalisms.",
        "Some contemporary linguistic theories emphasize the role of particular words that play the role of head of a constituent (e.g. a noun in a noun phrase).",
        "As a matter of general",
        "A top-down process is needed after that because a phrase occurs without any islands in it.",
        "Through that process a noun phrase is recognized between vertices 4 and 7, so that we have the situation shown in Figure 1.",
        "At this point, by virtue of the AI composition rule an active edge with cat = S can be inserted into the chart between vertices 1 and 7 as shown in Figure 2.",
        "The last step consists in introducing an inactive edge with' cat =S into the chart between vertices 1 and 9, by virtue of the AA composition rule, as shown in Figure 3.",
        "This yields a succesful recognition of the sentence.",
        "A mechanism that extends the chart algorithm with bidirectionality has been introduced.",
        "This step is a major one, since a monodirectional chart would not be able to base its processing selectively on easily identifiable fragments (the so called islands) and derive hypotheses about the other parts of the input string.",
        "Instead, with the mechanism proposed here, for any place where the easily identifiable fragments occur in the sentence, the process will extend to both the left and the right of the islands, until possibly completely missing fragments are reached.",
        "At that point, by virtue of the fact that both a left and a right context were found, heuristics can be introduced that predict the nature of the missing fragments.",
        "The described mechanism is particularly advantageous when dealing with complex sentences, because it is an inherently nondeterministic mechanism, capable of dealing with the complex local ambiguity typical of natural language.",
        "An important aspect is that the mechanism is completely independent of the particular linguistic theory adopted.",

Let us denote such a generic active edge as A; its characteristics will be from(A)=from(I), to(A)=- to(I), rule(A)=R, fromposition(A)=i, toposition(A)= i + 1, sub-inactives = list(I).",
