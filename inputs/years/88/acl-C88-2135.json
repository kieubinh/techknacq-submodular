        "This study aims to obtain a readability formula that can be used by computer programs for style checking of Japanese texts.",
        "A readability formula predicts the difficulty of a document that may result from its writing style, but not from its content, organization, or format.",
        "A readability index is calculated from the measures of surface characteristics of the document that are thought to indicate the stylistic difficulty without an attempt to parse sentences or to consult a large dictionary.",
        "Many of the readability formulae for English, (for example, Flesch's Reading Ease Score /Flesch 1949/ and Automated Readability Index /Smith 19700, use the average length (number of syllables or letters) of words and the average number of words in sentences in a document for calculating the readability index.",
        "Word length is a measure of the lexical difficulty, i.e., difficulty of the vocabulary used in the document.",
        "Sentence length is a measure of the syntactic difficulty or complexity of the sentence.",
        "While readability indices are derived from simple formulae, they predict reasonably well the difficulty of a document.",
        "This is because the sentence length and the word length are highly correlated with features such as the complexity of the sentence and the difficulty of the word, respectively.",
        "Existing scoring methods for Japanese, such as the one proposed by /Morioka 1958/ or /Yasumoto 1983/, use the sentence length measured in letters instead of words and the percentage of kanzis (Chinese characters), the latter used for estimating the difficulty Of the vocabulary.",
        "Both rate the average number of letters per sentence and the percentage of kanzis in the text independently and do not combine the two factors into a single index.",
        "A text with longer sentences is estimated as difficult, and a text with more kanzis is also estimated as difficult.",
        "Morioka, who surveyed on school textbooks, showed that the upper grade textbooks contain longer sentences on the average and more kanzi.",
        "Yasumoto states that documents with more kanzi are less readable even for adults, for the following reason.",
        "Kanzi are logograms, one roughly corresponding to a word.",
        "Documents using more kanzis, therefore, apt to include more different words and should demand more reading skill.",
        "A problem of rating the sentence length and the percentage of kanzi independently is that these two may yield an inconsistent rating.",
        "Generally, a sentence becomes longer if its kanzis are rewritten in kanas.",
        "Thus sentence lengths depend on representations.",
        "There seems to have been no attempt on combining the factors of sentence length and the proportion of kanzi.",
        "On the other hand, no rationale is given for the separate measurements.",
        "It is possible to derive a single index that can assess readability of Japanese text.",
        "/Sakamoto 1967/ proposed a method of scoring the relative difficulty of children's books to match the reading skill of the intended readers.",
        "His method consists of three independent ratings; (1) the proportion of fundamental words based on /Sakamoto 1958/, (2) the proportion of sentences that are made of more than 10 words, and (3) the proportion of kanzi.",
        "However, Sakamoto's method introduce the problem of measuring sentence length in words in place of the conflict between sentence length and representation.",
        "Using word count or word length as an estimator of readability is not practical in the case of Japanese.",
        "Since Japanese does not use word segmentations in normal writing, dividing sentences into words needs parsing and consulting dictionary.",
        "Thus, a scoring method based on words, such as Sakamoto's, is costly.",
        "This is especially so when scoring is done by a computer, because extra devices such as parsers, a large dictionary, and, sometimes, semantic analyzers are required for word segmentation alone.",
        "Another problem with the traditional scoring methods is that they have ignored katakana, which are used to represent foreign words.",
        "Recent documents, especially scientific and technical ones, use a lot of foreign words.",
        "/Watanabe 1983/ reports that, in a year's issues of the Journal of Information Processing Society of Japan, Vol.",
        "17, about an eighth among the characters used is katakana.",
        "/Satake 1982/ surveyed the article of magazines published today and found that the ratio of katakana ranged from 4.44 to 13.75 percent.",
        "Thus percentage of katakana is not negligible in scoring today's documents.",
        "Katakana words mean imported foreign words, old and new, which are often unfamiliar to readers.",
        "Yet existing measures take into account only kanzi and are insufficient to score the today's technically oriented documents."

        "The most common Japanese writing system is based on the mixture of kanzis, kanas (hiraganas and katakanas), the Roman alphabets, Arabic numerals, and some other alphabets and symbols.",
        "Almost all normal writing is a mixture of kanzis, hiraganas, and katakanas (and others).",
        "Frequencies of types of characters in a Japanese text are known to affect its readability at least in the following manner: Kanzi, as mentioned before, are considered to make texts difficult.",
        "Since katakana and alphabets are used for foreign words, high frequencies of these characters indicate that the text contain many unfamiliar words.",
        "Hiragana are used to represent the rest of the text and more of them are considered to make texts easier.",
        "There is no rigid orthography for Japanese.",
        "Nevertheless, the way an adult Japanese spells out a sentence in usual writing is roughly fixed.",
        "Kanzis are used for nouns and for the root parts of verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and the like.",
        "Hiraganas are used to write inflections and other grammatical parts of sentences, and katakanas are used mainly for the transcription of foreign words.",
        "So in passages written in the common way, the use of types of characters, i.e., kanzi, hiragana, katakana, etc., reflects the use of vocabulary and can be an indicator of the difficulty of the passage.",
        "It is possible to write the words usually written in kanzi in hiragana.",
        "However, psychological experiments such as the ones conducted by /Kitao 1960/ or /Hirose 1983/ a reader finds it difficult to read the texts represented in the way unfamiliar to the reader.",
        "In Kitao's experiment, subjects took less time to read and recognize the word or the sentence written in a common way than written solely in hiragana.",
        "In Hirose's experiment, the words usually written in kanzi are harder to recognize than the words usually written in kana when both type of words are written in kana.",
        "Both results show that words or sentences in the representation more – familiar to a reader are more readable than those in less familiar representation.",
        "Runs In the ordinary representation, a boundary of the types of characters corresponds to the boundary of words or smaller grammatical parts thereof.",
        "That is, a series of letters of the same type in the text, bounded by other character types corresponds to a word or a smaller grammatical part.",
        "We will call such a series a run, i.e., a run is a maximal string that consists of only one type of characters.",
        "It is not a grammatical unit.",
        "Usually, a run corresponds to one or more words.",
        "A verb or an adjective is often found across two runs.",
        "Such a word normally has its root part written in kanzi and its inflection part in hiragana.",
        "As the boundary of runs roughly correspond to the boundary of words, the different graphic appearance of kanzi and kana letters helps a reader to parse a sentence.",
        "Hence, long runs, when they happen, hide the word boundaries and makes a sentence less readable.",
        "Long kanzi runs give another problem to the readability.",
        "Kango can be formed into a compound word simply by concatenating two or more of them successively.",
        "The meaning of the new word is formed by the meanings of its elements.",
        "However, how each element is related to each other in the compound word is not clear from mere concatenation.",
        "A reader must pragmatically see the relation.",
        "Therefore, it is often the case that the meaning of a compound kango is ambiguous.",
        "For example, siken-ki can be read as siken-suru-kikai (testing machine) or as siken-sareru-kikai (machine to be tested); rinzi-kyouiku-singi-kai meaning rinzi-nikyoufku-ni-tuite-singi-suru-kai (an ad hoc council to deliberate on education) can be read as rinzi-no-kyouiku-ni-tuite-singi-suru-kai (a council to deliberate on an ad hoc education).",
        "It is unlikely that there may be any good theory possible about the relationship between run frequencies and readability.",
        "Nevertheless, the run frequencies may be used in a similar manner as character frequencies.",
        "In a study preceding this /Tateisi 1987/ we found that the run frequencies are correlated with the frequencies of the character of corresponding types (0.6 5 r S 0.9, depending on character types) and a unit of run is sufficient to obtain the information otherwise supplied by both characters and runs."
