        "A new method of automatic lexical disambiguation of big texts is described, using recent proof-theoretical results from the theory of categorial grammar.",
        "O.",
        "Introduction The Institute of Dutch Lexicolcgy (INL), sponsored by the Dutch and the Belgian governments, consists of two deparbnents.",
        "One of the tasks of the Thesaurus, one of the departments, is to build a database for lexicological research.",
        "This database is a, potentially infinite, set of texts.",
        "The aim is to supply a representative and, if possible, complete overview of contemporary (since 1970) standard Dutch.",
        "In order to access the material, an efficient database architecture and application software were developed.",
        "At this moment (February 1988) the INL corpus is the most representative corpus of the Dutch language; it contains aver 45 million tokens, over 800,000 word types.",
        "The INL lexical database is not an aim in itself: it is meant to be a tool for specific projects.",
        "One of the purposes of the database is to form the raw input for a new generation of dictionaries.",
        "The database is growing, and it is not realistic to go on increasing it without making it possible to use such a rich source of information.",
        "Therefore, a short time goal is to make all the words in the database available for research purposes, on the one hand by making efficient and powerful application software, on the other hand by enriching the material.",
        "Automatic morphological analysis has now been carried out and the results will soon be incorporated into the database.",
        "One level higher, we are interested in the syntactic analysis of the sentences of the corpus.",
        "One should not think of an on-line parser only.",
        "For the process of lemmatization an effective disambiguation procedure is necessazy es well.",
        "To this end parsers are being developed that will soon be tested on the corpus.",
        "As was the case for the morphological analyzer, the syntactic parser is en Implementation of a categorial calculus.",
        "he construction of and philosophy behind the Lambek categorial parser we use for the disambiguation and syntactic analysis is the topic of this papers.",
        "1.",
        "A note on ambiguity in Categorial Grammars",
        "Each linguistic model or framework whatsoever is confronted with the problem of ambiguous lexical type asaigments, a phenomenon inherent to NL.",
        "Whatever way one deals with it as far as representation is concerned and whatever neat solutions one comes up with, the fact remains that (1) the Otrenomenon will not disappear, but (2) the explosions it gives rise to will cause (often irreparable) damage to (otherwise) neatly conceived syntactic parsers or analyzers.",
        "Categorial grammars, abiding by the centricity of the Lexicon, may seem by nature to be the first victims of this phenomenon.",
        "Some categorialists2 try to circumvent the problems by imposing inherently unmotivated constraints on otherwise rigidly defined flexible calculi.",
        "Another way to go about, however, is to take a closer look at some of the restrictions the calculus imposes indirectly, i.e. at soma of the invariants that come along naturally, but may remain unnoticed at fist sight3.",
        "Interesting invariants may act as greedy scissors, pruning away many of the useless branches of the search tree.",
        "Categorial grammars encode all syntactic information in the lexicon.",
        "The effect of this strategy on the presence of ambiguities can be gathered if one would take an ordinary phrase",
        "atexebroo groaner and turn it into a categorial one.",
        "What happens is that for emery category in the PS grammar one gets a set of categories in the Categorial grammar.",
        "On the average, the number of new categories equals the number of occurrences of the old category in the PS rules.",
        "A lexical element that is not at all ambiguous as far as syntactic category assigmuent is ocncerned, in PSG, will almost certainly become ambiguous in C. Still, we claim that effective, i.e. fast, disambiguation, is possible with CG.",
        "The rationale behind this claim in that effective disambiguation does not depend as much on the degree of ambiguity, but first and forecast on the nature of the disambiguation method.",
        "Onarewe ambiguity is damaging to classical parse procedures because there are no intrinsic properties of the system that can deal with it, almost the reverse is true of categorial parsers when fun benefit is made of their defining characteristics.",
        "In order to appreciate these statements, the best thing to do is look at a specific implementation of this idea.",
        "2.",
        "The Lembek calculus In this section we would like to present a categorial reduction system which is analogous to the imOlcational fragment of propositional logic.",
        "We will present it as a calculus, and will limit ourselves to the formal description, thus ignoring semantic interpretation (which is not immediately relevant for our purpose at hand).",
        "Some definitions Let BASCAT be a finite set of atomic categories and CCNN a finite set of category forming connectives.",
        "Then CAT (the set of all categories) is the inductive closure of BASCAT under CNN, i.e. the smallest set such that (i) BASCAT is a subset of CAT, and (ii) if X, Y are members of CAT and I is a member of CONN, then (XIY) is a member of CAT.",
        "So one could take BASCAT to be (S, N, A, T, P) and caliv \\, *) (these are called right division, left division and product, respectively).",
        "Sane of the meters of CAT are: (N\\S), ((N/N)*T), (S/(P\\(N/S))),...}.",
        "A complex category (XIY) consists of three inanaliate suboeaponents: X and Y, which are themselves categories, and the connective.",
        "When the connective is '/' or '\\', the ommpLax category is a functor.",
        "Functor categories are associated with incomplete expressions: they will form an exproseicn of category Y (result) with an expression of category X (argument)4.",
        "In the case of right division, the argument has to be found to the right of the functor category, whereas in the case of left division, the argument has to be found to the left5.",
        "The product connective '*' is to be interpreted as a concatenation operator, i.e. a product category (X*Y) is to be associated with an expression which is the ocecatenation of an expression of category X and an expression of category Y in that order.",
        "Reduction rules A specific categorial grammar is characterized by the choice of basic categories and connectives on the one hand, and on the set of reduction rules on the other.",
        "The system of reduction rules says how categories can be confined to form larger constituents.",
        "The application rule which carbines a functor with domain X and range Y with a suitable argument of category X to give a Y, is only one of the possible reduction rules.",
        "Instead of taking a set of reduction laws as primitive axioms, we will investigate the categorial reduction system as a calculus, where the reduction laws can be considered theorems that follow from a set of axioms and a set of inference rules.",
        "Next we will see that the parsing of a symbagn is really the same thing, in other words, attempting a proof for a theorem.",
        "Sequents Before we define the axiom and inference rules of the calculus, we need to define the notion of sequent6.",
        "A sequent is a pair (G,D) of finite (possibly empty) sequences G = [A,,...AO, D [131 B,,] of categories.",
        "For categorial L-sequents, we require G to be non-empty and n=1.",
        "For the sequent (G,D) we write G => D. The sequence G is called the antecedent, D the succedent.",
        "For simplicity square brackets and omana's are often left out.",
        "Axioms and inference rules",
        "(1) The axioms of L are sequents of the form X => X.",
        "(2) Inference rules of L: X, Y and Z are categories, P, T, Q, U, V are sequences of categories, where P, T and Q are non-empty.",
        "Together, Minns and inference rules define the theorems of a categorial calculus.",
        "Suppose we have a sequent S, to find out whether it is a theorem or not we have to apply several of the inference rules above till nothing but axioms remain.",
        "As one may have noticed, all these rules involve the removal of a connective in some category.",
        "Let's paraphrase the [A] rule by way of example.",
        "It says: to find out whether a sequent with some functor category Y/X is a theorem, identify a sequence of categories that follow this category, and see whether Y => the identified sequence is a theorem, and what preceded the ea-Lowry + X + what followed the sequence => old succedent is a theorem.",
        "In the following example we present a proof with the relevant category printed in bold and the identified sequence underlined.",
        "If we could find an efficient automatic decision procedure that would tell us whether a certain sequent is either a theorem or not, then we would have an efficient parser as well.",
        "The idea being, that the succedent represents something like a sentence (the categories of the words that make it up) and the antecedent the S (sentence) category.",
        "In the next section we will discuss an implementation of the decision procedure.",
        "3.",
        "The Theorem prover, alias parser An algorithm to prove a theorem could go as follows.",
        "Given: a sequent with n categories: n•1 in antecedent, 1 in succedent.",
        "Start at the the first category of the succedent.",
        "If this is a functor, pick the relevant inference rule that will eliminate the connective.",
        "If the rule tells you to identify a part of the sequent to one of the sides of the category, then first take this to be one category.",
        "See whether you can prove the resulting sequent(s) (the sequent(s) in the if-part of the inference rule).",
        "If the identification does not yield a result (i.e. in recursively calling the procedure, the bottom of only axioms remaining is not reached), then take two categories and see if this does the trick.",
        "Continue adding categories until you have a proof or there are no categories left.",
        "In the latter case, nothing is lost yet, because one could also have taken the second, or third functor to start the proof with.",
        "If in the end there are no more functors left to start the elimination with, then the theorem cannot be proven and one can even say that it is falser .",
        "Clearly, this procedure might take same time to decide on the validity of a sequent.",
        "One might hope that theorems are proven rapidly, but when the sequents are false, a lot of work has to be done.",
        "Fortunately enough, there is a simple way to prune away cone branches of the search tree that are guaranteed to lead to failure.",
        "There is a necessary formal condition that holds of valid theorack.e which is easy to detect.",
        "If a sequent does not have this formal characteristic, it cannot be a theorem.",
        "Even if the inputted sequent does have the required characteristic, in the process of proving, there will be a lot of subproofs that need not be carried out because they will fail immediately.",
        "This formal characteristic or invariant is known as van Benthem's Count, or Count for short.",
        "It counts the number of positive (range) and negative (domain) occurrences of a basic category X in an arbitrary category, basic or complex.",
        "It may be defined as follows.",
        "Generalized to sequences of categories, the X-count of a sequence, X being a category, is the sum of the X.-counts of the elements in the sequence.",
