        "The first permits the construction of generators for LFGs which generate sentences from functional structures.",
        "The second constructs generators which generate sentences from semantic structures.",
        "Both algorithms are based on concepts of derivation for LFGs which can be strengthened in such a way that the derivation can be driven by a given input structure.",
        "The principles which underlie the control mechanisms for the derivation are sufficiently general to also be applicable to other unification based formalisms which allow the derivation of functional and/or semantic structures in parallel to constituent structures (e.g.",
        "PATH (cf. e.g. [Shieber 83], [Karttunen 86])).",
        "For the generation from semantic structures, a derivation concept of this type can be defined, if, following a proposal by Halvorsen and Kaplan (cf. [Halvorsen 87], [Kaplan 87]), projector equations are used to describe (co-describe) the semantic structure of a sentence.",
        "Since the projector mechanism is independent of the specific type of semantic theory, the algorithm works as long as this mechanism is used to build up semantic representations.",
        "In addition, the derivation driven by the semantic structure can be directed by constraints over the f-structure.",
        "Usually, semantic information by itself is regarded as providing a basis for generation which is too weak to capture relevant distinctions in the surface form.",
        "This additional mechanism could contribute to make the generation more sensitive to syntactic and pragmatic information.",
        "Thus, additional functional information can enforce a specific syntactic realization, such as passivization, topicalization, extraposition or discontinuous realization of constituents.",
        "It should be clear that the specific constraints which have to be or can be imposed on this kind of generation are subject to empirical studies on questions of syntax, discourse and dialogue.2 Similarly, for machine translation, one will need interlingual comparative research on these subjects to establish what relevant functional information can be drawn directly from the f-structures of the source text, in order to guarantee a coherent target text.",
        "These important empirical questions will not be addressed directly in this paper.",
