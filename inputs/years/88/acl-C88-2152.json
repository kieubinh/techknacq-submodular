        "In a system that engages in a dialogue with a user about some domain, like the one we are building in the WISBER project [Bergmann, Gerlach 87] , the problem of describing the meaning of a speech act in terms of its effect on the user model and, more generally, on the system's knowledge base becomes central.",
        "The fundamental problem is that, until now, there has been no general formal theory of meaning for speech acts.",
        "Previous formal semantic theories such as Montague [74] and situation semantics [Barwise and Perry 83] were limited to assertions.",
        "Cohen and Perrault [79] give only a theory of how speech acts are planned, the semantics being implicit in the add and delete lists of the operators.",

        "However, there is no explicit theory of communication.",
        "As Appelt himself states, what is lacking is an explicit theory of intention.",
        "Searle and Vanderveken [85] do little more than classify speech acts based on features that were seen as relevant to their differentiation.",
        "However, as we will argue below, those features are not motivated by any coherent theory of meaning.",
        "The crucial features that define force are left unanalyzed.",
        "None of the above theories give a formal semantics for nonassertive speech acts.",

        "We then describe the speech acts in Searle's classification in terms of the semantic and pragmatic effects they have in the communicative situation.",
        "Finally we show how the semantics and pragmatics of speech acts is related to the general communcative process in the social world and show that the classification of speech acts really reflects the fundamental way agents use language to coordinate and make possible their social actions."

        "According to Searle, when humans communicate they are engaged in an activity.",
        "An utterance, according to Searle, can be broken down into two basic components, the illocutionary force F and the propositional content p. The utterance is symbolized as F(p) • In order to classify the different types of force F , Searle and Vanderveken [85] attempt to reduce the force of a speech act to more primitive features.",

        "In Searle's classification of illocutionary acts [Searle 75] he distinguishes six general classes based on four dimensions.",
        "The four dimensions were the illocutionary point (assertive , directive !",

        "of word-to-world , the psychological state B for the sincerity condition to hold must be that the speaker belives B the propositional content expressed p .",
        "Example: The speaker states The door is open and belives that the door is open.",
        "2.",
        "Directives: W(II does A) This states that the directive !",
        "has a direction of fit of world-to-word , the psychololgical state must be that the speaker wants that the hearer II do the action A .",
        "Example: The speaker gives the command Open the door and wants the door to be opened.",
        "Note, here, as in the declaratives, we need certain role presuppositions to hold.",

        "4.",
        "Expressives: E 4)(P)(S/H + Property) The expressive El has no direction of fit , the psychological state should correspond to the emotion/attitude expressed by the speaker about the property of the spearker S or hearer H. E Kample: The speaker exclaims I like your coat and means it.",
        "5.",
        "Declarations: D -*4 (p) The declaration D has a self-realizing direction of fit 4+ (since the state described by the propositional content p is realized by the very act of saying it).",

        "There is a psychological state in the sincerity condition that the speaker must believe B the proposition expressed.",

        "Critique of Searle's Notion of Force",
        "Note that the actual classes of illocutionary acts.",
        "that Searle distinguishes correspond exactly to the values of the illocutionary point dimension.",
        "It turns out that there is a one to one correspondence between the illocutionary point and the type of speech act.",
        "It should be evident that the point of the epeech act is just another name for the speech act type and does not add any more distinguishing information for the individuation of that type from the others.",
        "Hence, one can conlude that it is the information in the remaining three dimensions ( the direction of fit, pyschological state and propositional content) that really distinguish the speech act types considered by Searle.",
        "One is still left with the nagging question: But, what is the force of an utterance?",
        "Well, if we have an utterance u F(p) ,and, if u is a directive, then u t W(II does A), where the force F = it W and p 111 does A .",
        "But, if we are right about the irrelevance of the illocutionary point !",
        "to tee classification, then the force of a directive becomes P W and the utterance u becomes u=",
        "However, one can plausibly argue that the sincerity condition W, that the speaker want the action indicated by the propositional content, is really not part of the force of the utterance.",
        "For the utterance is understood by the hearer whether the speaker wants the action or not.",
        "For example, it may well be that a general is forced to order his troops to war, after a declaration of war by the president.",
        "The general's command still has its meaning and effect irrespective of his personal wants.",
        "And, indeed, a little reflection should convince the reader that the want W does not contribute to the differentiation of the typology.",
        "So now we have reduced the force of a directive to a single parameter value the direction of fit t .",
        "If we are so impertinent as to ask What is the direction of fit?",
        ", we will find no ready answer that is not circular.",
        "The direction of fit of a directive is \"world-towords\" t .",
        "In other words, the force of a directive is to change the world using words.",
        "Or, better, to influence an agent to change the world by communicating a directive to that agent.",
        "In effect, in spite of all the symbols, the force remains essentially an unanalyzed notion.",

        "Directives are used to change the world.",
        "Assertions are used to describe the world.",
        "True, but it is not enlightening.",
        "Hence, we have shown some of the dimensions to be redundant, vague and of questionable computational usefulness.",
        "We have also shown that the attempt to reduce the point feature to the remaining features leads to a dead end.",
        "At the heart of these problems lies a more devastating pathology: We have seen that the point of the speech act is redundant for Searle's classification of speech acts.",
        "However, the point of the speech act is that part of the force that gives the central purpose of the act.",

        "[p.37, Searle and Vanderveken 851 Yet a few lines later they say the analysis of the point of speech acts requires a theory of mental states, specifically, a theory of intentionality which they say is beyond the scope of the book.",
        "Thus, the point of a speech act is a very complicated notion that requires a formal theory of psychology before that notion can be made formally rigorous.",
        "They also state that the point of a speech act is the most important component of the force [p.14, Searle and Vanderveken 851.",
        "Since the force of a speech act is the most important element that differentiates speech act theory from traditional referential semantics, the point of the speech act is the central theoretical notion in the foundations of the theory of speech acts.",
        "Yet it is the point of the speech act that is left unanalyzed in Searle's formal account.",
        "To sum up, the features constituting the notion of force are not motivated by any coherent theory of the meaning of speech acts.",
        "As Searle and Vanderveken admit, they have no semantics for the two most central features in the definition of force, namely, the point and direction of fit of the speech act.",
        "Instead, they leave these notions primitive, and unanalyzed.",
        "That, however, amounts to leaving the notion of force an unanalyzed concept.",

        "Of more global significance is the fact that our theory of communication fits well with von Neumann and Morgenstern's economic theory [see von Neumann and Morgenstern 47j.",
        "This is because our theories of communication and intention allow us to define complex social roles and social structures [Werner 88a, 88b].",
        "This will hopefully help to clarify the complex relationship between language and society."
