        "In the case of Aidtrans, the intention was, while leaving the final selection of the exact translation to the end user, to produce output of greater accuracy and coherence than is generally found in current post-editing systems.",
        "The strategy of multiple generation produces a set of complete alternative translations, rather than one which must be amended piecemeal by a posteditor, while the text-type-based predictive model and preference-weighted linkages cut down greatly on the range actually offeied to the end-user, and group those which survive into semantically and stylistically coherent wholes.",
        "Thus, while a conventional posteditor needs access to the source text to check the accuracy of raw output and as a guide to its revision, here enough information is available in the output to form the basis of the end-user's final selection."

        "To ensure to an English monolingual technical writer the output of accurate and acceptable Icapanese, the conventional strategy would be pre - editing, passing to the mach* only text in a restricted sub language known to be within its translation capacity.",
        "Our system etruld perhaps be said to offer interactive pre-editing interleave4 with translation; rather than interactive translation as no contrastive or bilingual information is presented to the end user in the interaction.",
        "The restricted input sub language, .however, is simply grammatical English, which if ambiguous must be disambiguated.",
        "This should be seen not as a constraint en a technical writer but as a desideratum.",
        "The Nu-an prototype is designed to offer three forms of interactive query: on-lme dictionary creation, syntactic disambiguation of English input, and Japanese lexical selection in transfer.",
        "When a word is found in an input text for which no dictionary entry yet exists; the user is offered the option of creating an entry for it immediately.",
        "This is done using a tree structured question procedure, eliciting the category of the English word and its values for the features associated with that category, such as mass/count and animacy for nouns, valency and aspectual type for verbs, gradability for adjectives, and so on.",
        "The on-line dictionary building routine, although it incorporates a reasonable range of information about an English word, does not ask for Japanese translation equivalents.",
        "Instead, entries created in this way are held in a separate dictionary file, where they are accessible to the analysis component, but also set aside for later completion by a bilingual linguist.",
        "Until this is done the English word is at present simply passed into the Japanese output in its original form, marked off by a special delimiting character.",
        "We intend to implement in a further developed version of the system a facility for passing through such words in katakana transcription.",
        "Given a reasonable core dictionary, most new words will be specialized technical terms, for which this will in fact be the correct rendering.",
        "Syntactic ambiguities in the English input are also referred to the user for disambiguation.",
        "The parser first builds a surface syntactic dependency structure, or functional structure, which is then mapped to a deep or semantic structure, and a record kept of the mappings ('obj', for example, is mapped to 'arg0').",
        "During this mapping stage, a record is also kept, for each well-formed s-structure produced, of the set of mappings entailed by the subcategorization requirements of the lexical items involved.",
        "Each mapping records the derived semantic relation which is assigned between a constituent and its parent.",
        "Examples of \"maptrace\" are given with the examples below.",
        "The disambiguation module then computes a set of differences among all the recorded mapping sets and builds a set of all those relations which are true for only a subset of the parses.",
        "These are then presented to the user, after conversion of some of the internal semantic relation names to external names which are intended to be more immediately understandable.",
        "The generator for the user-form representation of mappings is: describeas(map(X,Y,Z),) :- logtocase(Y,C),!.",

        "The alternatives are presented as a set of statements distinctively characterizing the possible semantic interpretations, as can be seen in the examples below.",

        "The Aidtrans Japanese-to-English prototype (implemented in C, and running on a Sharp Unix-based microcomputer) is an implementation of a comprehensive, highly detailed and sophisticated algorithmic grammar of Japanese developed by Dr. Jiri Jelinek as a teaching tool for rapid intensive instruction in technical Japanese (Jelinek 1978).",
        "The core of this grammar is its Integrated Dictionary System (IDS).",
        "The philosophy of IDS is to incorporate as much as possible of the grammar and the analysis heuristics in the dictionary.",
        "This is done in an explicitly language-specific, and, as applied to translation, language-pair specific form, allowing great accuracy and precision (at some inevitable cost in adaptability).",
        "The dictionary of the finished prototype contains entries for some 6,000 words.",
        "While committed to the maximum use of lexical resources, Aidtrans also sees translation as a relation over whole texts rather than individual words or even sentences.",
        "The purpose of each act of translation is to retain the global sense, rather than the concatenation of word-meanings, of a text as it is reformulated in a different language.",
        "To achieve this, it is clearly not enough to produce one acceptable translation for each separate sentence of a text and adjoin them.",
        "Just as a syntactic parser will produce alternative analyses of an ambiguous sentence from which the one intended must be selected, so Aidtrans produces alternative translations of each part of the input text, from which the translation most appropriate to the context must be selected.",
        "Such selection from among possible translation equivalents is familiar from human translation or post-editing.",
        "Here, however, much of the selection, or rejection, is carried out by the system itself.",

        "Patterns can be recognized at the general level of syntactic configuration and at the more specific level of individual lexical items and collocations; at present the system recognizes well over 200 different types of juxtapositional linkage.",
