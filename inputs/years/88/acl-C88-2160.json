      "text": [
        "The main goal here is to resolve correctly ambiguities arising in natural language analysis in every case.",
        "To date, this cannot be accomplished by any existing automatic MT system.",
        "The problem remains choosing a sentence structure that most accurately reflects the author's intended message and it therefore remains an unsolved and yet important problem.",
        "Classical machine translation systems use heuristics based on statistical regularities in the use of language.",
        "Interactive systems ask questions directed at a specialist of the system (like ITS of BYU [Melby & alii 80]) and/or a specialist of the domain (like the TITUS system of Institut Textile de France [Ducrot 82]).",
        "There, the interaction is done purely at the syntactic level, as a syntax directed editor for a programming language is used by a specialist of both the system and the languages.",
        "Models or projects using extralinguistic knowledge will not be able to solve ambiguities in every case: a document is generally supposed to provide some piece of new information that may not be coded in the knowledge base.",
        "The use of learning procedures is at present not effective.",
        "None of these approaches can resolve ambiguities correctly in every case.",
        "The problem is basically a matter of interpretation: only the author of the document himself can tell what he intended to say.",
        "Nevertheless, he is not supposed to have any knowledge of the target language and therefore, he should not be involved during the transfer phase2.",
        "In the case of interaction with the author, two problems arise:",
        "1.",
        "The author is supposed to write his document and not to solve weird linguistic problems.",
        "2.",
        "In all interactive systems, the system asks a specialist questions based on knowledge of the underlying linguistic theory.",
        "For interacting with the author, this approach is to be rejected: see examples of interaction with ITS [Melby & alii 80] or even Tomita's system [Tomita 84].",
        "A proposal To solve these problems, we propose : - to integrate the interactive system as one function of a word processor, the interaction being initiated by the author; - to explain an ambiguity presenting a set of paraphrases generated from the set of parse trees of the ambiguous sentence; - to explain an error (of spelling and of grammar) by presenting a \"reasonable\" correction and a comment of the error.",
        "This point will not be treated in this paper.",
        "See for example [Jensen & Heidorn 83, Zajac 86b]."

    {
      "heading": "Discussion",
      "text": [
        "The integration in a word processor allows the use of a \"controlled language\" where checking and correction is done during the creation or modification of a document.",
        "This can be viewed as an extension of the capabilities of a simple spellchecker, in the form a toolbox of linguistic aids for the author, checking the spelling, the terminology, the grammar and the style.",
        "For the translation of technical material, the use of a normative grammar, imposing precise limitations on terminology and syntax, will entail more clarity and concision in expression, as argued by [Elliston 79] and [Ruffino 82], and will offer a convenient tool for normalizing a documentation.",
        "In the cases where a correct interpretation uses domain knowledge interactively, it will be possible to make a clear cut between the pure linguistic knowledge, to be coded in the analyser, and the extralinguistic knowledge (semantics of the domain).",
        "As a matter of fact, it is not always justified to integrate in the grammar specific semantic categories, as in the METEO system for example.",
        "This separation will allow us to enlarge the domain of applicability of a machine translation system, that could be, for example, extended to a personal translation system [Tomita 84], and this could be interesting when no translation service is available or if the quantity of translation does not justify using the services of a translator [Kay 82]."

        "The linguistic framework The linguistic treatment of ambiguities is based on the struture of a linguistic descriptor (labeled and attributed tree) defined in SCSL [Zajac 86a].",
        "Let us recall briefly the multilevel linguistic theory of '786 GETA [Vauquois 78].",
        "There are four main levels of linguistic interpretation:",
        "1. categories : morphosyntactic categories (gender, number, class of verb,...), semantic categories (abstract, concrete,...), actualisation categories (perfective, imperfective,...), syntactic categories (noun, verb, valencies,...) and syntactic classes (sentence, verb phrase,...).",
        "2. syntactic functions : subject, objectl, object2, attribute of the subject, attribute of the object, complement of noun or adjective, determiner, circumstantial complement,... 3. logical relations : predicate-argument relations.",
        "4. semantic relations : causality, consequence, qualifier, qualified,...",
        "The geometry of the tree corresponds to a phrase structure : the labels of inner nodes are syntactic classes, the labels of leaves are lexical units.",
        "Additional information is coded in the attributes of each node.",
        "The morphological, syntactic and semantic categories are computed by a morphological analyser written in ATEF.",
        "The output of the morphological analyser will be the input of a structural analyser producing multiple outputs in ambiguous cases.",
        "Architecture of the interactive translation system A classical machine translation process in the ARIANE system [Boitet & alii 82, 85] uses a morphological analysis phase (MA) and an automatic structural analysis phase (SA, on the left of the figure).",
        "This phase is replaced with an interactive phase (in the middle).",
        "Disambiguation and correction dialogues make calls to paraphrasing and correcting modules.",
        "The remainder of the process uses classical automatic transfer steps (LT and ST) and generation steps (SG and MG).",
        "On the figure, the existing modules are in bold outline, modules where there exists only a model are in normal outline, specified modules are shaded grey).",
        "The approach we propose is not to produce explanations using linguistic concepts of the linguistic model (as it has been done up to now, see [Melby & alii 80, Tomita 84]), but to produce paraphrases that make explicit the ambiguous relations.",
        "Lexical ambiguities are quite trivial to solve by presenting the definitions from a dictionary.",
        "In this paper, they are supposed to be already solved.",
        "Structural ambiguities are treated after a complete parse.",
        "In a practical setting, the best strategy would probably be to produce a complete parse, to solve lexical ambiguities and then to solve structural ambiguities for the remaining parses.",
        "We propose, for some types of ambiguities that can arise, paraphrastic transfortnations that make ambiguous relations explicit.",
