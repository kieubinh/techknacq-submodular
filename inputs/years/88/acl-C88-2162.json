        "Computer programs so far have not fared well in modeling language acquisition.",
        "For one thing, learning methodology applicable in general domains does not readily lend itself in the linguistic domain.",
        "For another, linguistic representation used by language processing systems is not geared to learning.",
        "We introduced a new linguistic representation, the Dynamic Hierarchical Phrasal Lexicon (DHPL) [Zernik88], to facilitate language acquisition.",
        "From this, a language learning model was implemented in the program RINA, which enhances its own lexical hierarchy by processing examples in context.",
        "We identified two tasks: First, how linguistic concepts are acquired from training examples and organized in a hierarchy; this task was discussed in previous papers [Zeinik87].",
        "Second, we show in this paper how a lexical hierarchy is used in predicting new linguistic concepts.",
        "Thus, a program does not stall even in the presence of a lexical unknown, and a hypothesis can be produced for covering that lexical gap."

        "Consider the following sentence produced by a second language speaker: John suggested her to go out, but she refused.",
        "This incorrect use of suggest could be viewed as a communication failure, since by textbook grammar suggest does not take this form of the infinitive.",
        "Alternatively, this can be viewed as a surprising success.",
        "In spite of missing lexical information, a person managed to convey a concept, rather than give up the communication task altogether.",
        "Our aim here is to explain such robust human performance in computational terms, and consequently to describe the principles underlying the program RINA [Zernik85, Zernik86] which models language acquisition."

        "The problems arising from incomplete lexical knowledge are illustrated through the following scenario.",
        "In this scenario RINA encounters two unknown words plaid*, and doove, and uses the word suggest whose lexical definition is incomplete.",
        "RINA reads a paragraph provided by a user, and then generates text which conveys the state of her knowledge to the user.",
        "The first problem is presented by the word plead which does not exist in RINA's lexicon.",
        "RINA is able to extract partial information: Frank communicated a concept to Corinne regarding coming over.",
        "It is not clear, however, who comes over.",
        "Did Frank promise Corinne to come over to her, or did Frank ask Corinne to come over to him?",
        "The word doove is also unknown.",
        "Here too, RINA can guess the main concept: Corinne decided not to come over.",
        "This hypothesis is not necessarily correct.",
        "However, it fits well the context and the structure of the sentence.",
        "At this point, RINA must respond to the input text by generating a paraphrase which conveys its current hypothesis.",
        "Also in generation, RINA faces the problem of incomplete lexical knowledge.",

        "Three knowledge sources must be negotiated in resolving this problem.",
        "Syntax and Control: In Prank asked Corinne so come over, the word ask actually controls the analysis of the entire sentence Iliresnan82al, and determines the answer to the elementary question, who comes to whom?",
        "The embedd(xl phrase to come over, which does not have an explicit subject obtains its subject from the control matrix [Bresnan821] of ask.",
        "Accordingly, Corinne is the subject of \"coining over\".",
        "On the other hand, in he pleaded her to come over, the controlling word plead, is yet unknown.",
        "In absence of a control matrix it is not clear how to interpret to come over.",
        "How can a program then, extract even partial information from text in such circumstances?",
        "Lexical Clues: Although plead itself is unknown, The form of the sentence X pleaded Y to come over, suggests that \"X communicated to Y a concept regarding coming over\".",
        "Three assumptions are implied: (a) plead is a communication act, (b) Y is the actor of",
        "\"coming over\", (c) \"coming over\" is only a hypothetical, future act (and not an act which took place in the past).",
        "How is this intuition, which facilitates the initial hypothesis for plead, encoded in the lexicon?",
        "Contextual Clues: The hypothesis selected for doove above is a direct consequence of the context, which brings in a structure of plans and goals: (1) Corrine has an outstanding goal; (2) Frank suggests help.",
        "Given this background, the selected hypothesis is: (3) Corinne rejects the offer.",
        "This selection is problematic since doove could stand for other acts, e.g., she wanted to stay, she tried to stay, and she forgot to stay, etc.",
        "Thus, how does the context impact the selection of a hypothesis?",
        "Some of the issues above can be handled by specific heuristic rules, custom tailored for each case.",
        "However, the challenge of this entire enterprise is to show how a unified model can employ its \"normal\" parsing mechanism in handling \"exceptions\"."
