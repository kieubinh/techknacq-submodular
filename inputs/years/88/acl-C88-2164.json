        "By controlling parameters such as initial knowledge, the nature and order of the data, we can empirically determine how each parameter affects the efficiency of learning.",
        "Our ultimate goal is the modelling of human learning by machine.",

        "how does one say x ?",

        "Language learning can be viewed as a special case of problem solving in which the learner tries to build and intelligently explore a hypothetical search space.",
        "If this view is correct, then two sets of questions arise immediately.",
        "On one hand one may want to know: riohwatitthise [.livatlutr4ocfrethmis esnetaar lehasgnees:islOcawirvtg agil:oegahrvvieawrres ?",
        "), c) how it is explored (strategies: intelligent, opportunistics vs systematic search).",
        "On the other hand, one may want to investigate how (i) the knowledge at the outset and (ii) the ordering of the data will affect the building and the searching of the space.",
        "Typically one does not learn from scratch, nor is it likely that one encounters either well-ordered data, or a complete set of examples: natural learning is incremental.",
        "Obviously, these.facts imply that: * initial knowledge, in particular, knowledge of other languages may bias the kind of variables (attributes or hypotheses) considered, i.e., included in the search space; * the order of the data (the examples encountered by the student) may determine what rules are likely to be inferred at what moment, and finally * rules are inferred from incomplete data (incremental learning).",
        "Furthermore, the same data may be characterized in different ways.",
        "That is, several equivalent descriptions may be inferred from the same data set.",
        "Which of these descriptions turns out to be the most adequate generally cannot be established until one knows the complete data set.",
        "Thus, rules may have to be revised in the light of new evidence.",
        "Consequently, errors are not only unavoidable parts of the learning process, but also an indispensable source of information for the learner."

      "text": [
        "As we have shown, learning can be seen as searching.",
        "Actually, teaching, as well as learning, can be conceived of as problem solving or reasoning in an information-exchange environment.",
        "There is a sender, a goal, a message and a receiver.",
        "The SENDER may be a native speaker, a teacher, a parent, a book or a computer.",
        "The GOAL is the task or performance (output).",
        "In our case it is knowledge of how to produce sentences in French.",
        "The MESSAGE is the input to the learning component: examples from which the rules have to be inferred (1).",
        "The RECEIVER or learner can be any system, natural or artificial, capable of perceiving, memorizing and analyzing a set of data and drawing the necessary conclusions: a child, a student, or a computer program (2).",
        "Learning occurs in various settings.",
        "Depending on the order of the examples and the control of the information flow, we speak of natural, experimental, or institutional settings.",
        "Natural learning is characterized by the absence of a clearly defined learning objective (3), by noisy and heterogeneous material, and by unordered examples.",
        "The underlying regularities are thus multiple, diffuse, and hard to perceive.",
        "Experimental learning and teaching, on the other hand, have a learning objective, the material is error-free, homogeneous and coherently ordered according to some point of view (learner or teacher).",
        "Whereas experimental learning can be characterized by the following sequence: (i) encountering the data (ii) analysis, (iii) building and testing of hypothesis, (iv) feedback and (v) proof or demonstration of the theory traditional teaching goes through the following stages: (i) exposition (ii) practice, (iii) testing and (iv) evaluation.",
        "This can be schematized as follows: Teacher: sets the task and presents the learning material; Student: analyzes the data; Teacher: provides a set of examples; Student: practices; Teacher: asks questions to test the gained knowledge; Student: answers the questions; Teacher: evaluates the answers, provides feedback (explanations) and organizes future data as a function of actual performance Student: integrates the feedback into the knowledge base and corrects misconceptions; As one can see, the information flow here is entirely teacher-controlled.",
        "He is the one who sets the task, and provides the examples and the feedback.",
        "Consequently, the teacher decides the nature and the order of the material to be learned.",
        "There are two major shortcomings in this approach.",
        "Not knowing what information is needed by the learner, the teacher may present the wrong data.",
        "More importantly, the student is only loosely integrated in the learning process.",
        "Instead of being active, generating and testing plausible hypotheses (discovery learning), he reacts to questions.",
        "Thus, it may happen that the student perceives his task as the learning of the material rather than the learning of the underlying principles.",
        "Ignorance of what or how to learn may result in (i) learning the unintended, (n) poor problem-solving skills or (iii) little transfer.",
        "As long as the learner does not go beyond the information given (the concrete word level), he cannot transfer the gained knowledge to similar situations, because the perception of similarity presupposes abstraction.",
        "Given these criticisms, it would be useful to have a system which has the qualities mentioned above without having the drawbacks.",
        "A good learning environment should be both flexible and constraining enough: * to allow for simulation of real communication, that is to say, to provide a setting where both participants can take the initiative and control the information-flow, * to ensure the learning of the appropriate material (i.e., what to learn) as well as the necessary problem-solving skills (the methods, i.e., how to learn).",
        "A computer program could provide such an environment.",
        "It would offer different kinds of information (see below: trace-function), while answering the student's questions as he goes along generating and testing different sorts of hypotheses."

        "While some forms (e.g., words) have to be learned, they generally serve for illustrative purposes.",
        "Rote learning of the entire set of surface forms (words and word combinations) is not only inefficient, but in fact impossible, because of time constraints: there are more possible combinations than we have time to learn.",
