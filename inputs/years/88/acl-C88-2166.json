        "There is growing awareness among computational linguists that much of the information needed for lexical entries across systems is basically shared or \"identical\" information /Ingria 1986, Zaenen 1986/.",
        "An example for verbs is subcatcgor-ization information (transitive, intransitive, takes a that-complement), and selectional features (takes a human object, selects for inanimate subject); an example for nouns is gender (female, male).",
        "It should be possible for much of this shared information to be collected into a large \"polytheoretical\" data base for use by individual systems.",
        "This lexicon (sometimes called a \"meta-lexicon\") would consist of the overlapping set of the various attributes, features, characteristics, etc., that are needed by all or most NLP systems.",
        "Each system could then consult the repository of information stored in the central lexicon and extract the information it might need.",
        "The extracted information could be enhanced by theory-specific and application-specific information.",
        "Thus, instead of each system duplicating efforts, the computational \"meta-lexicon\" gathers together lexical information for use by programs, in the same way that traditional dictionaries contain information for use by people.",
        "One of the goals of the Lexical Systems project at IBM is to design and build such a lexicon.",
        "We have called the system COMPLEX (for COMPutational LEXicon).",
        "Although this is an ambitious goal, we believe that careful lexicographic, linguistic, and computational research will permit us to represent whatever information is common to most NLP systems in a neutral representation and in a uniform data structure so as to be compatible with a range of requirements of natural language systems.",
        "Corollary to the goal of designing and building a data structure containing information for different NLP systems is the goal of broad coverage.",
        "Indeed, until recently, the lexicon was not the primary focus of most natural language processing (NLP) projects.",
        "The result (with a few exceptions) has been a proliferation of descriptively rich syntactic and semantic analyzers' with impoverished lexical coverage.",
        "Many NLP systems have small hand-built lexicons, hand-tailored to the idiosyncrasies of formatting and processing required by the system.",
        "Our aim is to extract information automatically or semi-automatically using machine-readable sources, and in this way to achieve broad coverage.",
        "Currently, our primary resources are machine readable dictionaries although we have plans to expand to text corpora in the near future.",
        "Initially, we restrict our attention to building English lexicons but there is good evidence that some information may be transferable to computational lexicons for other languages via bilingual dictionaries."

        "1982, Johnson 1984/, the kind-types Knowledge Representation system KT /Dahlgren and McDowell 1986/, and others.",

        "/Taft and Forster 1976, Cutler 1983/.",
