        "f. Every admiral has to deploy a ship today.",

        "They can incur equipment failures or undergo personnel changes.",
        "Such events, in turn, can affect the ships' readiness ratings, which are expressed by codes such as C3 or C4.",
        "Much of the information that the JANUS user is trying to access is time-dependent in that an appropriate answer can be given only if the time of the query and/or the time of the events in question are taken into account.",
        "It is, therefore, imperative that at the level of semantic representation of the natural language input an adequate analysis can be provided for those linguistic expressions that carry time information: for example, tenses, temporal adverbials, and temporal adjectives.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, I will sketch the basic ideas of the framework of logical semantics, or more specifically, of Montague Grammar, the framework that I will use for my analysis.",
        "Section 2 also gives a brief overview of the conceptual modularity of the JANUS system, which demonstrates how Montague Grammar as a linguistic theory can be applied in natural-language processing research.",

        "My own analysis of temporal semantics is very much a response to the kinds of analyses that have been provided in classical tense logic.",

        "In addition, I will show how a contextual analysis of nouns and noun phrases lets us account for the kind of temporal phenomena that were first discussed in Enc 1981, 1986.",
        "In Section 7, I argue that the context-dependent feature of the analysis does not add extra complexity to my treatment of time-dependent expressions, but is needed for purposes of discourse understanding in general.",

Montague 1973).1 Montague Grammar shares the fundamental assumption of all truth-conditional theories of meaning, namely that natural language semantics has to relate in a systematic fashion linguistic expressions such as words, phrases, and sentences to nonlinguistic, real-world objects, events, and states of affairs.",

        "Montague Grammar provides a simple and elegant interface between the syntactic and semantic components of a grammar.",

        "In this paper I have argued that a logical semantics for temporal expressions can provide adequate representations for natural-language input to an interface such as JANUS.",
        "The temporal logic is based on Reichenbach's models for the semantics of English tense and uses multiple indices for semantic interpretation.",
        "This multi-indexed logic overcomes the kinds of problems that arise when systems of tense logics are used that rely on just one index of evaluation.",
        "I have demonstrated how giving narrow scope to tense quantifiers enables us to provide adequate scope relations with respect to NP quantifiers and to interpret such NPs relative to a given discourse context.",
        "I have argued that the context-dependent feature of the analysis does not add extra complexity to my treatment of time-dependent expressions, but is needed for purposes of discourse understanding in general.",
        "Finally, I have demonstrated how the narrow scope of tense results in a fully compositional syntax and semantics of tensed sentences in English."
