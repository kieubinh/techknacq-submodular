        "Ideally, a natural language system's responses should contain exactly the information that will be most helpful to the user.",
        "But since not all users are alike, achieving such behavior requires that the system have a model of the particular user with whom it is currently interacting.",
        "One way of constructing this model is to query the user at the start of the interaction, as was done in the GRUNDY system (Rich 1979).",
        "But querying the user may fail to provide an accurate and adequate characterization.",
        "Or extensive questioning of the user may be inappropriate if one of the system's goals is that its dialog with the user resemble naturally occurring information-seeking dialogs.",
        "In such cases, the system may be able to use the information exchanged during the dialog and its knowledge of the domain to hypothesize a model of the user, and dynamically adjust and expand the model as the dialog progresses.",
        "One of the most important components of a user model is the representation of the system's beliefs about the user's plans and goals.",
        "As demonstrated by Cohen, Perrault, and Allen (1981), users of question answering systems \"expect more than just answers to isolated questions.",
        "They expect to engage in a conversation whose coherence is manifested in the interdependence of their often unstated plans and goals with those of the system.\" We are interested in a class of information-seeking dialogs in which the information-seeker is attempting to construct a plan for a task.",
        "The task is not being performed during the system's interaction with the user, as is the case in apprentice-expert dialogs, but instead is being constructed for future execution.",
        "In some cases, only a partial plan will be constructed, with further details filled in later.",
        "For example, a freshman accessing an advisement system may only construct part of his plan for earning a degree, leaving other aspects of the plan to be fleshed out in subsequent years.",
        "These dialogs are typical of a large percentage of interactions with database management systems, decision support systems, and expert systems.",
        "Typical tasks include expanding a company's product line, purchasing a home, or pursuing a degree at a university.",
        "One aspect of our research has been to develop a strategy for dynamically constructing a model of an information-seeker's underlying task-related plan from an ongoing dialog and for tracking his focus of attention in this plan.",
        "Since the system's beliefs about the user's plans and",
        "goals provide a context for understanding subsequent dialog, we will refer to this part of a user model as a context model.",
        "Our analysis of naturally occurring dialog indicates that humans understand many utterances that would appear imperfect or incomplete to current natural language systems.",
        "For example, a speaker may inadvertently use incorrect or ambiguous terminology in constructing the language representation of his intended query, or he may shortcut its complete specification.",
        "But if a system's communication is to be regarded as natural, it must be able to handle the full spectrum of utterances that humans appear to understand with relative ease.",
        "Part of this research has been concerned with how a system can reason on its context model to remedy many of a user's faulty utterances and allow the dialog to continue without interruption.",
        "We have developed a method, based on Grice's theory of meaning and maxim of relevance, for handling queries that do not conform to the system's model of the world and are therefore regarded as ill-formed.",
        "This method uses the task-related plan inferred for an information-seeker to suggest variants of an ill-formed utterance that might represent the information-seeker's intentions or at least satisfy his perceived needs.",
        "We have also developed a method for understanding intersentential elliptical utterances that occur during the course of an information-seeking dialogue.",
        "Our strategy uses discourse expectations and our model of the speaker's plan to identify the discourse goal that he is pursuing via an elliptical fragment and to interpret his elliptical utterance relative to his task-related plan.",
        "Our work on understanding ellipsis is presented in Carberry (1985).",

        "Section 5 describes our current research on relaxing restrictive assumptions present in previous work on plan recognition and developing a more robust plan inference framework.",
        "We propose a four-phase approach to handling the problem of possible disparity between the system's context model and the actual plan under construction by the user, and argue for an enriched context model that differentiates among its components according to the support it accords each component as a correct and intended part of the user's plan.",

        "Robinson (Robinson et al.",
        "1980, Robinson 1981) extended Grosz's work and developed a process model for determining the referents of verb phrases, such as variants of do in the utterance \"I've done it.\" However, in apprentice-expert dialogs, the overall task that the apprentice is attempting to perform is known at the outset of the dialog, and the ordering of actions and subtasks in the plan being executed strongly influences the dialog between expert and apprentice.",
        "This differs from the kind of information-seeking dialogs that we are investigating, in which the information-seeker is attempting to construct a plan for a task that will be executed at a later time.",
        "In such dialogs, the informa-tion-seeker's utterances are not tightly constrained by the order in which actions in the task will eventually be executed.",
        "For example, in an information-seeking dialog between a client and a travel agent, the client may first plan hotel accommodations and theater attendance in New York before inquiring about ways to reach New York, even though travel to New York will occur before attend a New York theater in a temporal ordering of actions in the resultant plan.",
        "Allen (Allen et al.",
        "1980, Perrault et al.",
        "1980) inferred the goal underlying a speaker's utterance in the context of an information agent in a train setting.",
        "This inferred goal was used to account for extra helpful information included in the agent's response, and the inference path connecting the speaker's utterance and the inferred goal was used to interpret indirect speech acts.",
        "However, Allen's domain was very restricted; the only domain goals were meeting a train and boarding a train, each of which could be accomplished by a few primitive steps, and his system was primarily concerned with utterances that might occur at the outset of a dialog.",
        "In more complex domains, the information-seeker's complete plan will consist of a hierarchy of subplans and subgoals that accomplish his overall goal.",
        "Such a complete plan is not immediately evident from a single utterance, and",
        "where Uses(_sect&SECTIONS, ixt:&TEXTS)",
        "individual utterances must be related to one another to build the user's plan as the dialog progresses.",
        "Sidner (1983, 1985) and Litman (1986) developed enhanced models of plan inference.",
        "However, both were concerned with dialogs that were initiated in order to begin or continue execution of an underlying task (display of structures on a graphics terminal and meeting/boarding a train), and the dialogs were therefore constrained by the order in which individual actions in the task had to be executed.",
        "In addition, Sidner investigated how discourse markers aid in recognizing the speaker's intent, and Litman studied a meta-plan framework for task dialogs.",
        "Pollack (1986) has recently proposed that plans be viewed as mental phenomena.",
        "She contends that, in order to comprehend an utterance and relate it to the user's plan, the system must reason about the configuration of beliefs and intentions that it should ascribe to the speaker.",

        "In order to reason about what the user wants to accomplish, the system must have knowledge about the goals that a user might pursue in a domain and plans for accomplishing these goals.",
        "We view a plan as the means by which an agent can accomplish a non-primitive task-related goal.",
        "Using an extension of the STRIPS formalism (Fikes et al.",
        "1971), we represent a plan as a structure containing applicability conditions, preconditions, a plan body, and effects.",
        "Applicability conditions and preconditions both represent conditions that must exist before a plan can be executed.",
        "However, an agent can plan to satisfy preconditions, whereas it is generally anomalous to plan to satisfy applicability conditions; the latter determine whether it is reasonable to even consider a particular plan for achieving a desired goal.",
        "For example, suppose an agent wants to vacation on a particular island.",
        "If the island has an airport and the agent has money for a ticket, then the agent can plan to fly there.",
        "But the requirements that the island have an airport and that the agent have money for a ticket are intuitively different.",
        "If the agent does not have enough money for a ticket, he can plan to try and satisfy this requirement; but if the island does not have an airport, it is unreasonable for the agent to arrange for an airport to be built on the island so that he can fly there for a vacation.",
        "Of course, agents sometimes do unreasonable acts.",
        "If the agent in the above case is very wealthy, is adamant about vacationing on this particular island, and abhors boats, he may build an airport on the island and charter a plane to fly him there.",
        "Our plans are intended to represent normal plans that an agent might be expected to pursue, and the distinction between preconditions and applicability conditions is useful in preventing consideration of plans that would occur only in exceptional circumstances.",
        "How exceptional plans should be incorporated into a plan recognition system is an area for future work.",
        "Wilkins used preconditions similar to our applicability conditions in representing operators in the SIPE system (Wilkins 1984).",
        "What we call a precondition, Wilkins incorporated into the set of actions and goals comprising an operator.",
        "His reasons for having un-plannable preconditions in his representation scheme were both to capture the appropriateness of applying an operator in a given situation and to connect different levels of detail in a hierarchical planner.",
        "A proposition, that at one level of abstraction was part of the specification of how an operator was to be performed, might appear at a lower level of abstraction as a precondition of an operator, indicating that further planning for the lower level operator is inappropriate unless the proposition is already satisfied.",
        "But mixing standard preconditions (conditions that must exist before an operator can be performed, but which can be planned for) with the set of goals and actions that constitute performing an operator fails to capture the intuitive difference between the two.",
        "For this reason, our representation scheme distinguishes among applicability conditions, preconditions that can be planned for, and how one goes about performing an action.",
        "The plan body contains a conjunction of subgoals, and the effects represent the results of successfully executing the plan.",
        "Arguments in plans are either constants, represented as uppercase strings, or typed variables, represented as lowercase strings preceded by the character \"_\" and followed by the characters \":&\" and Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 3, September 1988 25 Sandra Carberry Modeling the User's Plans and Goals an uppercase string giving the variable's type.",
        "Figure 1 presents a sample plan used by TRACK.",
        "Its plan body states that in order to learn the material of a section of a course, an agent must both learn from the person teaching the section and study the text used in the section.",
        "TRACK' s plans are hierarchical, since many of the subgoals in the bodies of plans and many preconditions are non-primitive and therefore have associated plans which may be substituted for them.",
        "Thus a plan can be expanded to any desired degree of detail by replacing non-primitive preconditions and subgoals with their associated plans.",
        "At the outset of an information-seeking dialog, the system has little knowledge about the information-seeker's (IS) purpose in requesting information.",
        "In most cases, a complete plan for IS cannot be constructed during the first part of a dialog.",
        "Instead, potential goals must be inferred from individual utterances and integrated into the overall plan structure, thereby incrementally expanding and instantiating the system's model of IS's plan as the dialog progresses.",
        "Oftentimes there will be many domain goals that a single utterance might address.",
        "For example, if a student asks what time Dr. Smith arrives in the morning, he may want to either visit Dr. Smith or call him in his office.",
        "Furthermore, even if we can identify a single domain goal addressed by an utterance, there may be many ways in which that goal could be incorporated into an overall plan.",
        "For example, if a student asks whether Political Science 210 is offered in the spring, we might infer that the student wants to take Political Science 210.",
        "But how should this goal be built into the student's overall plan?",
        "Perhaps he is considering taking Political Science 210 in order to satisfy a breadth requirement or perhaps he wants to major or minor in Political Science.",
        "So the issue that must be addressed in dynamically inferring IS's underlying task-related plan from an ongoing dialog is the following: how can we identify which of many candidate goals is the actual goal which IS is addressing with a particular utterance, and how can we determine where this particular goal fits into IS's overall plan?",
        "Two factors appear to provide a basis for a solution: 1) the organized nature of naturally occurring information-seeking dialogues, as exhibited in dialog transcripts, and 2) the assumption that IS and IP are working cooperatively to help IS achieve his plan construction goals.",
        "These two factors produce a structure in information-seeking dialogs.",
        "As a result, we can formulate focusing heuristics that specify how individual utterances should be related to the existing dialog context, as represented by the plan inferred for IS and his current focus of attention in that plan.",
        "Thus our approach is the following:",
        "1. hypothesize from an individual utterance a set of domain-dependent candidate focused goals that may represent the information-seeker's focus of attention in the task; and 2. use focusing heuristics to select the candidate",
        "focused goal most apropos to the existing dialogue context and incorporate it into the model of the information-seeker's plan.",
        "In some cases, several candidate focused goals may be equally likely, and alternative versions of the context model may need to be built.",
        "In a cooperative, coherent dialog in which the information-seeker successfully communicates how his questions relate to what he wants to accomplish, subsequent utterances should enable the system to identify the particular context model that represents the user's plan.",
        "However, if the user asks a sequence of questions that have no definite relationship to one another, then we may have a computationally explosive situation.",
        "But this behavior violates our assumption of an overall cooperative, coherent dialog.",
        "We have given some preliminary consideration to a more robust process model containing a stack of disjoint contexts with potential relationships to one another.",
        "Further utterances could clarify these relationships and permit merger of the disjoint contexts into a single overall context model.",
        "Such a strategy would have the advantage of handling disconnected portions of dialogs without the computational explosion that can result from modeling all possible expanded contexts."

        "Our analysis of naturally occurring dialog suggests that a plan recognition framework for handling disparate plans should include four phases: 1.",
        "Detecting clues to possible disparity between the system's context model and the user's actual goals and plans for accomplishing them.",
        "For example, expressions of surprise at the system's response and what appear to be major unsignaled shifts in focus of attention should lead the system to suspect that its context model might be in error.",
        "2.",
        "Reasoning on the system's context model and the system's domain knowledge to hypothesize the source of these disparities.",
        "3.",
        "Negotiating with the user to isolate the errors.",
        "The negotiation phase should be guided by the system's hypothesis about the source of errors in the context model.",
        "4.",
        "Appropriately repairing the context model, as indicated by the negotiation dialog.",
        "We believe that the knowledge acquired from the dialog and how it was used to construct the context model are important factors in hypothesizing the cause of disparity between the system's context model and the actual plan under construction by the information-seeker.",
        "Natural language systems must employ various techniques such as focusing heuristics and default rules for understanding and relating dialog in order to do the kind of inferencing exhibited in dialogue transcripts and provide the most helpful responses.",
        "But confidence in individual components of the resultant context model appears to be important in hypothesizing errors.",
        "We contend that the system's context model should be enriched, so that its representation of the plan inferred for the user differentiates among its components according to the support that the system accords each component as a correct and intended part of that plan.",
        "The system can then reason on this enriched context model to hypothesize the most likely sources of suspected disparities.",
        "For example, if the system believes that the information-seeker intends the system to recognize from his utterance that G is a component of his plan, then the system can confidently add G to its context model.",
        "Components that the system adds to the context model because of the system's domain knowledge should be less strongly believed.",
        "This distinction resembles intended recognition versus keyhole recognition (Cohen et al.",
        "1981).",
        "Intended recognition is the inference of those goals and plans that an agent intends to convey.",
        "Keyhole recognition is the inference of an agent's goals and plans by unobtrusively observing the agent, as if through a keyhole.",
        "Intended recognition is essential in communicative situations (Cohen et al.",
        "1981), since the listener must identify the intended meaning of a speaker's utterance.",
        "Our analysis of naturally occurring dialog suggests keyhole recognition is often critical to expand beliefs about what the information-seeker is trying to do and how it should be done.",
        "For example, if CS180 is an introductory course restricted to majors in computer science and electrical engineering, then the system might infer from the utterance \"Can you tell me what time CS180 meets?\" not only that the user wants to know the meeting time for CS 180, but also that the user is a computer science or electrical engineering major.",
        "However, the user may intend the system to recognize the first goal, but it is questionable whether the user actually intends the system to recognize that the user is pursuing a major in computer science or electrical engineering.",
        "This latter inference is based on the system's beliefs about who can take CS180 – knowledge that the user may not have.",
        "Therefore, since the user may not have intended to communicate these components, they are more likely sources of error than components that the user intended the system to recognize.",
        "The particular rules used to add a component to the context model should affect the system's faith in that component as part of the information-seeker's overall plan.",
        "For example, since default inference rules and focusing heuristics select from among multiple possibilities, they add components that are likely sources of suspected errors.",
        "We believe that if a plan recognition system builds such an enriched context model, uses it to hypothesize the source of suspected errors in the model, and attempts to negotiate with the user to isolate and repair its model, the system will be able to handle a much larger set of dialogs than can current models of plan inference, and will be likely to produce responses resembling those found in transcripts of naturally occurring information-seeking dialogs."

        "We have presented a strategy for dynamically inferring the context model from an ongoing dialog, and have shown how this model can be used to handle one class of problematic utterances – the set of utterances that violate the pragmatic rules of the system's world model.",

        "We contend that a natural language system must be able to detect and recover from discrepancies between the system's context model and the actual plan under construction by the user, and have suggested that handling disparate plans requires an enriched context model that differentiates among its components according to the support it accords each component as a correct and intended part of the information-seeker's plan."
