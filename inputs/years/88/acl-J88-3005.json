        "Responses to misconceptions given by human conversational partners very often contain information refuting possible reasoning which may have led to the misconceptions.",
        "Surprisingly there is a great deal of regularity in these responses across different domains of discourse.",
        "For instance, one reason a user might have given an object a property it does not have is that the user confused the object with another similar object.",
        "In correcting such a misconception, a human conversational partner is likely to point out this possible confusion.",
        "This work describes a method for generating responses like the one just described by reasoning on a highlighted model of the user to identify possible sources of the error.",
        "Through a transcript study a number of response strategies were abstracted.",
        "Each strategy was associated with a structural configuration of the user model.",
        "For example, the above mentioned strategy of pointing out a similar confused object is associated with a configuration of the user model that indicates the user believes there is an important similar object that has the property involved in the misconception.",
        "Upon finding that configuration in the highlighted user model, the system can respond with the associated strategy.",
        "Notice that the reasoning must be done on a highlighted user model since the perception of both an object's importance and its similarity with another object change with the perspective being taken on the domain.",
        "This paper investigates how domain perspective can be modeled to provide the needed highlighting and introduces a similarity metric that is sensitive to the highlighting provided by the domain perspective.",
        "Finally, the paper shows how the highlighting affects misconception responses."

      "text": [
        "When people interact with a database or expert system, it is reasonable to expect that they might reveal a misconception about an object modeled by the system.",
        "Since a human conversational partner would correct such a misconception if it was important to the current goals of the conversation, our database and expert systems should also be equipped with this ability.",
        "In order to investigate how the process of correcting misconceptions might be automated, a study of transcripts of both humans interacting with what they thought were expert systems (Malhotra 1975, Malhotra and Sheridan 1976, Schuster 1982), and humans interacting with other humans to achieve some goal (Pollack, Hirschberg, and Webber 1982) was undertaken.",
        "The transcripts, which varied greatly in their domains of discourse, were analyzed to determine if there was any regularity in the content and rhetorical force of responses given to misconceptions.",
        "The intention of this analysis was not to mimic the actual behavior found in the transcripts, but to use them as a source of intuitions about the context and textual shape of responses as well as the process of generating them.",
        "The study revealed that a response to a misconception important to the current discourse goals of the participants can be viewed as consisting of three parts: 1. a denial of the incorrect information; 2. a statement of the correct information; and 3. justification for the denial and correction given.",
        "For a particular type of misconception (i.e., one involving a particular kind of knowledge), variations in responses could be found in the form of the justification given.",
        "The justification often seemed to refute support that might have led to the misconception.",
        "While the kind of support someone might have for a misconception seems unrestricted, the form of the justification was limited for misconceptions",
        "involving a particular kind of knowledge.",
        "A large number of responses found could be accounted for by a small number of correction strategies based on the kind of justification given (and hence the faulty reasoning refuted).",
        "If a principled reason for using one strategy over another could be developed, these strategies could be used by a natural language generation system for responding to a misconception.",
        "In this work the faulty reasoning refuted by several of the found correction strategies is characterized in a domain-independent fashion in terms of the user's beliefs about the domain.",
        "Therefore, given a highlighted model of the user's beliefs about the domain, a generation system can look for possible support for the misconception.",
        "The response strategy that refuted the kind of support found could then be instantiated.",
        "Notice that the domain-independent characterization of the faulty reasoning enables the same strategies and same method for choosing a strategy to be used given a highlighted user model for any domain.",
        "It is crucial that the user model given to the misconception corrector be highlighted by previous discourse since the kind of response given by a human conversation partner is apparently not only dependent on the beliefs about the person being corrected, but also on the context in which the misconception occurred.",
        "For instance, we could imagine the following dialog where the user exhibits the misconception that T-bills have a penalty.",
        "A reasonable response is shown.",
        "U: I am interested in investing in some securities to use as savings instruments.",
        "I want something short-term and I don't have a lot of money to invest, so the instrument must have small denominations.",
        "I am a bit concerned about the penalties for early withdrawal.",
        "What is the penalty on a T-Bill?",
        "R: T-Bills don't have a penalty.",
        "Were you thinking of Money Market Certificates?",
        "This response might be prompted by R thinking that U came to the misconception by confusing T-Bills with Money Market Certificates.",
        "On the other hand, it is reasonable that the response might be different given a different preceding dialog.",
        "For example: U: I am interested in investing in some securities.",
        "Safety is very important to me, so I would probably like to get something from the government.",
        "I am a bit concerned about the penalties for early withdrawal.",
        "What is the penalty on a T-Bill?",
        "R: T-Bills don't have a penalty.",
        "Were you thinking of T-Bonds?",
        "This response may have been prompted by R thinking that a confusion between T-Bills and T-Bonds was the source of the misconception.",
        "The two different responses to the same misconception suggest that the user model should be influenced by previous discourse.",
        "I will show how part of this influence can be achieved by a highlighting due to the perspective being taken on the domain.",
        "Currently, when a user model containing what the system takes to be the user's model for the domain is accessed, all user knowledge has equal importance.",
        "When people engage in a conversation, however, certain aspects of their domain model become more important than others.",
        "This importance is more than just a highlighting of those things that have been explicitly mentioned.",
        "Rather, certain things that are somehow related to those things explicitly mentioned in previous discourse are also highlighted.",
        "In fact, an orientation on the domain is usually established.",
        "In section 8 I will introduce a notion of object perspective that will enable this highlighting effect of previous discourse to be incorporated into the user model.",
        "Thus when the user model is accessed, certain things in it will be highlighted while other things will be suppressed.",
        "I will show how this variable highlighting of the user model can explain why the response to a particular misconception by a particular user may vary."

        "The method of correcting misconceptions outlined above should be contrasted with the way that misconceptions are handled by AI systems today.",
        "For the most part misconceptions have been left to the Intelligent Computer Aided Instruction systems, which basically use an a priori listing of misconception-response pairs (see, e.g., Brown and Burton 1978; Stevens, Collins, and Goldin 1979; Stevens and Collins 1980; Woolf and McDonald 1983; Woolf 1984).",
        "The major problem with these systems is due to their inability to reason about the misconception itself, they are completely at a loss when faced with a misconception absent from their a priori listing.",
        "The work of Sleeman (1982) on inferring defective algebra rules (mal-rules) is based on the observation that the a priori listing of misconceptions is a difficult, if not impossible, task.",
        "Sleeman proposes on-line inference of mal-rules based on the answer the student has given to a particular problem.",
        "Although Sleeman's work is a major improvement over the a priori listing approach, it still has several problems.",
        "First, there is no measure of how reasonable or likely a particular mal-rule is.",
        "In addition, once a mal-rule has been inferred, no indication is given concerning how the misconception should be corrected.",
        "The work of Kaplan (1979) and Mays (1980) is closer to the work described here in that they were concerned with handling and reasoning about whole classes of misconceptions, thereby giving the system the ability to handle a potentially infinite number of misconceptions.",
        "Kaplan and Mays were concerned with responding to Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 3, September 1988 53 Kathleen F. McCoy Reasoning on a Highlighted User Model to Respond to Misconceptions certain types of misconceptions in the context of a natural language interface to a database system.",
        "They worked on detecting and correcting such misconceptions based on domain independent linguistic cues from the user and an enhanced model of the domain.",
        "For instance, the query \"Which faculty take courses?\" indicates a presumption failure.",
        "A truthful response of \"none\" to this query would confirm the user's erroneous belief that faculty can take courses.",
        "Mays suggests correcting a query like the one above by 1. denying that the \"take\" relation can hold between faculty and courses, and 2. describing all correct alternatives which can be reached by abstracting on each of the objects and the relation involved.",
        "This method would produce the following kind of response: R: I don't believe that faculty can take courses.",
        "Faculty teach courses.",
        "Students take courses.",
        "Although responses such as this would probably be helpful to the user, they have the potential (given a complicated domain) for being overly verbose and containing information that the user does not care about.",

        "In this work, a misconception is defined to be some discrepancy between system beliefs and user beliefs (as exhibited through the conversation).",
        "Upon encountering such a misconception, the assumption is that the system knowledge is correct, and therefore the job of the misconception corrector module is to attempt to bring the user's knowledge into line with the system's knowledge.",
        "The scope of this work is limited by several assumptions about the kind of knowledge available.",
        "• The system's model of the world contains an object taxonomy with attribute/value pairs attached to the objects.",
        "• The system has available to it a user model that includes the user's beliefs about the world.'",
        "This is what the system takes to be the user's model of the domain.",
        "Although the content of the user model and the system's model of the world may differ greatly, the user model is in the same form as the system's model of the world.",
        "Thus while both of these models contain an object taxonomy with attribute/value pairs attached to the objects, the set of objects in the taxonomies and the way these objects are classified, as well as the particular attribute/value pairs associated with an object, may vary.",
        "This model of the user may be updated as the conversation progresses.",
        "• The system has available to it certain pieces of contextual and discourse information that serve to highlight the user model.",
        "This highlighting (explored below) is gained from a new notion of object perspective and from a record of items and attributes which have been explicitly focused on in the discourse.",
        "Given the kind of information assumed in the system's and user's models of the world, there are two kinds of misconceptions that may occur: misclassifications (a user may classify an object wrong) and misattributions (a user may give an object an attribute/value pair it does not have).",
        "For each of these kinds of misconceptions, a small number of response strategies2 were found in the transcript study.",
        "These were abstracted into response schemas.",
        "In section 4, examples of the response strategies found for misclassifications will be examined.",
        "For each strategy an abstract specification of the content will be given.",
        "Next we will look at what beliefs about the user might have prompted the use of each strategy, and characterize these beliefs in terms of the structure of a highlighted user model.",
        "With this pairing of user model structures and response schemas, a misconception can be responded to by looking in the highlighted user model for one of the user model structures and instantiating the associated schema.",
        "Section 5 examines response strategies for misattributions.",
        "The sections following that will concentrate on the highlighting from object perspective.",
        "A new notion of object perspective will be defined and it will be shown how object perspective aids in generating context sensitive responses to misconceptions.",

        "The system takes as input a specification of the information that is inconsistent with the system's model of the world, the current perspective (described below), and a record of past focus.",
        "It produces a formal specification of the response.",
        "This response specification is passed into the Mumble system (McDonald 1980), which, using a grammar and dictionary written by Robin Karlin (1985), produces an actual English response.",

        "We claim that in order for the above strategy for correcting misconceptions to work, the similarity metric that is used to assess object similarity must be affected by the preceding discourse.",
        "To date, most AI systems do not assess object similarity in a way that is context dependent.",
        "Several systems that do assess object similarity (Rumelhart and Abrahamson 1973, McKeown 1982, Carberry 1984, Weiner 1984) use a metric based on distance in some space.",
        "Most often, this space is the generalization hierarchy.",
        "Basically, two objects that have a common immediate superordinate (i.e., are siblings in the hierarchy) are seen as very similar, while objects whose lowest common ancestor is several levels up in the hierarchy are seen as quite different.",
        "One problem with this metric arises when objects can be classified in more than one way and there are several lowest common ancestors of the objects being compared.",
        "A decision must be made about which of these lowest common ancestors should be considered since the similarity assessment of the objects might vary widely as a result.",
        "For instance, a treasury bond and a corporate bond may be assessed as being very similar since they have a common immediate superordinate of bonds.",
        "On the other hand, both of these objects can be classified along other dimensions.",
        "If we look at a treasury bond as being a treasury issue, which is a type of US Government security, it seems quite different from a corporate bond, which is a corporate security.",
        "A second major problem with a similarity metric based on distance in the generalization hierarchy is that it is context invariant; contextual information has no way of affecting the assessments.",
        "As shown by Tversky (1977) and others, human judgments of object similarity have been found to shift both when the set of objects under discussion are altered (e.g., a violin and an electric guitar may be judged quite similar when in a group with a clarinet and an oboe, and may be judged quite different when the other members of the group are Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 3, September 1988 57 Kathleen F. McCoy Reasoning on a Highlighted User Model to Respond to Misconceptions a cello and an electric bass), and when the salience of attributes are altered (e.g., in a group containing a red triangle, a blue triangle, and a red square, the red triangle might be judged similar to the blue triangle when attribute shape is stressed, but may be judged similar to the red square when attribute color is stressed).",
        "One metric that avoids these problems was introduced by Tversky (1977).",
        "Tversky's metric, rather than relying on distance in some space, is based on the common and disjoint features of the objects involved.",
        "The metric, termed a contrast model, allows context to be taken into account in several places.",
        "Suppose we have two objects a and b where A is the set of properties associated with object a and B is the set of properties associated with object b. Tversky's measure can be expressed as:",
        "for some 0, a, and 0.",
        "In the above equation 0, a, and /3 are parameters which represent the importance of each piece of the equation.",
        "The function f maps over the features and yields a salience rating for each.",
        "In essence, the contrast model states that the similarity of two objects is some function of their common features minus some function of their disjoint features.",
        "The importance of each particular feature involved (determined by the function f) and the importance of each piece of the equation (determined by 0, a, and /3) may change with context.",
        "Although Tversky discusses in general terms how these functions might be set, he gives no concrete methods for doing so.",
        "For instance to set 0, a, and p he turns to the relative prominence of objects a and b in the discourse.",
        "The more prominent an object is, the more its attributes should have an impact on the similarity rating.",
        "Thus, finding the relative prominence of objects a and b in the discourse would help set these values.",
        "If a is relatively more important, then functions 0 and a should be greater than /3 resulting in the attributes of the more prominent object having a greater influence over the similarity assessment.",
        "While I would conjecture that information about the focus of the discourse (Grosz 1981, Sidner 1983, Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983) might give an indication of an object's prominence and would therefore be useful in setting the values of 0, a, and /3, in this work I have assumed a value of 1 for the 0, a, and /3 and have concentrated on setting the f function.",
        "We turn, then, to the problem of finding a value for the f function: the measure of salience for each property of the objects involved.",
        "Other work, such as Carbonnell and Collins (1970) and Weiner (1984), has hand-encoded salience values for attributes of individual objects directly into the knowledge base, permanently setting the f function.",
        "This approach is not sufficient for setting the f function for Tversky's metric, since it is crucial that the f function be able to change with context.",
        "In order to make this happen, the salience values computed by f must change with context.",
        "To see this, consider our ability to explicitly mention an attribute to increase its salience.",
        "In the example earlier with the red and blue triangles and the red square, if the request for a similarity judgment had been preceded by \"Look at the pretty colors of these objects\", the red triangle and red square would have probably been judged to be more similar than the red triangle and the blue triangle.",
        "Thus we see that explicit mention of an attribute in a discourse is one way that the f function might be affected by previous discourse.",
        "Explicit mention of an attribute is only one way in which the salience of the attributes may change dynamically.",
        "Another aspect of dynamic salience comes from the point of view, or perspective, applied to the domain.",
        "For instance, a building can be referred to as being an architectural work, for example, or as being someone's home.",
        "The two different views of the building cause different sets of attributes to become salient.",
        "Notice that this set of attributes is in addition to the attributes that have been explicitly mentioned in the discourse.",
        "From an architectural work point of view, attributes like the architect's name, date of building, and particular architectural features become salient.",
        "On the other hand, from the home point of view, attributes like the kitchen size, number of bedrooms, and living space become important.",
        "If we can find a way of modeling how these \"precompiled\" sets of attributes become highlighted in a discourse, we will have a principled method for setting the f function needed for Tversky's similarity metric.",

        "Yet, this highlighting is applied to different objects – some of which may not even have the same superordinates.",
        "What seems to be happening is that the conversational partners are viewing an entire group of objects from the same perspective.",
        "A limited inheritance mechanism cannot account for this unless each of the objects under discussion can be said to have the same (immediate) superordinate.",
        "A final effect that is not accounted for by the limited inheritance mechanism, yet seems to hinge on the view being taken on the domain, has to do with the heightened importance of some objects during a discourse.",
