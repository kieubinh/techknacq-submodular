        "We have found further evidence of this phenomenon in naturally occurring texts (Collier 1962, Britannica 1984, Britannica-Junior 1963, New Book of Knowledge 1967, Encyclopedia of Science 1982, Chevrolet 1978, Weissler 1973), where the information presented to readers varies with their assumed level of general knowledge.",
        "Likewise, a question answering program that provides access to a large amount of data to many different users could be more effective if it could customize its answers to each user, retrieving from its knowledge base the facts that are most appropriate and useful for a given user.",
        "Much research to date has focused on tailoring an answer depending on a user's goals, but customizing an answer depending on what the user knows about the domain of the question has been overlooked.",
        "This is an important factor in tailoring an answer if the answer provided is to be both informative and understandable to the user.",
        "The answer should not provide information that is obvious to the user (Grice 1975).",
        "However, if the answer assumes knowledge that the user does not have, it may be very hard (if not impossible) for the user to understand the answer (Wilson and Anderson 1986).",
        "In this paper we show the feasibility of incorporating the user's domain knowledge, or level of expertise, into a generation system and address the issue of how this factor might affect an answer.",
        "Through an analysis of texts, we found that two distinct discourse strategies were used in describing texts.",
        "We postulate that the writers' choice of strategy might be based on the assumed domain knowledge of the expected readers.",
        "If so, then the reader's level of knowledge about the domain affects the kind of information provided as opposed to just the amount of information.",
        "In previous generation systems, the user's",
        "domain knowledge affected only the amount of detail provided in the text (Wallis and Shortliffe 1982).",
        "In this work, we show how the two discourse strategies found in texts can be used to provide answers to users whose domain knowledge falls anywhere along a knowledge spectrum, from naive to expert.",

        "It is clear that the goal of the user also influences the content of an answer, or of a description.",
        "It would be interesting to examine how the goal and the level of expertise combined can help a program in choosing appropriate facts from the knowledge base.",
        "In this research, we found that the level of expertise affects the kind of information to include in a description.",
        "This is also clearly true for a user's goal: the information provided in the description should help the user in pursuing his/her goal.",
        "Thus, depending on a user's goal, the information included would vary.",
        "The interaction of these two factors can become quite complex.",
        "However, until both factors are fully understood individually, we feel that it will be very hard to determine exactly how they interact.",
        "6.3 FEASIBILITY AND EXTENSIBILITY OF THIS APPROACH In this work, we make the assumption that a system that tailors its answer to its users will be most useful.",
        "This is true only provided that this tailoring does not hinder the system's performance or increase its complexity significantly.",
        "We argue that tailoring a description to a user's level of expertise using the method described above will not add to the cost of generation and yet might provide better answers.",
        "Whether a generation system tailors its answers to users or not, it needs to employ a discourse strategy to guide its decision process lest the resulting text be incoherent.",
        "The two discourse strategies used by TAILOR are of comparable complexities, and there is not much cost added to combine them.",
        "While this work was done only with respect to generating descriptions of complex devices, we think this approach will be useful in any information seeking environment to which users with different background and knowledge levels have access.",
        "Such environment could be a large knowledge base of facts (of the kind of an encyclopedia), or a help system.",
        "Providing different information in an answer might also be done in explaining the behavior of an expert system that is used both as a teaching tool and as a problem solving engine."

      "text": [
        "In this paper we have demonstrated that the user's domain knowledge can be used as a factor in tailoring an answer.",
        "In particular, we have shown how the description of a complex physical object might be tailored to a user's level of expertise.",
        "We presented different kinds of knowledge users can have, explaining how a system can take them into consideration in order to generate a description.",
        "From our studies of texts, we have found two distinct discourse strategies that are used in describing complex devices.",
        "We postulated that the level of expertise of the user affects the kind of information given as opposed to just the amount of detail provided.",
        "Even though we conducted this study in the domain of complex physical objects, we believe this result can extend to other domains.",
        "We thus propose that a user model containing information about the user's domain knowledge can be used in a question answering system to guide the decision process.",
        "We presented the two distinct descriptive strategies that can be used in a question answering program and showed how they can be mixed to include the appropriate information from the knowledge base, based on the information contained in user model.",
        "Finally, we presented TAILOR, a program that generates descriptions tailored to users with various levels of expertise.",
        "TAILOR employs one of the two discourse strategies described to generate a text for a novice or an expert.",
        "TAILOR is also able to automatically mix the strategies to provide device descriptions tailored to users whose domain knowledge fall anywhere along the knowledge spectrum.",
        "By representing explicitly the user's domain knowledge in terms of parameters, TAILOR does not require an a priori set of stereotypes but can provide wide variety of descriptions for a whole range of users."
