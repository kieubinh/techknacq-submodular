        "The relational model of data (RM), first proposed in 1970 (Codd 1970), has by now become the standard for both database practitioners and theoreticians alike.",
        "In spite of this success, however, much recent database research has focused on ways to extend RM to overcome perceived shortcomings.",
        "Chief among the criticisms has been RM's lack of any \"real-world semantics.\"",
        "Among the many diverse efforts directed at this deficiency have been a number of attempts to extend RM to incorporate a temporal dimension at the model level.",
        "While such efforts as Ben-Zvi (1982), Ariav et al.",
        "(1984), Snodgrass (1984), Lum et al.",
        "(1984), Clifford (1985), Snodgrass and Ahn (1985), and Gadia and Vaishnav (1985) have all addressed this issue, the Historical Relational Database Model (HRDM) ((Clifford 1982a), (Clifford and Warren 1983), (Clifford 1985), (Clifford and Croker 1987)) has the advantage of being directly parallel to a formal theory of natural language.",
        "In Section 2 we present an overview of HRDM, as it serves as the environment in which we wish to explore our query language.",
        "In particular, HRDM views database attributes as functions from moments in time to values (in the appropriate domain), and the intensional logic ILs provides a mechanism for direct reference to these higher-order objects, and for incorporating them into a general temporal semantics for the database.",
        "We can therefore express both static and dynamic queries in the same language, by quantifying over variables of the appropriate types.",
        "In a series of papers culminating in Montague (1973), henceforth PTQ, Richard Montague embarked upon a program of providing a formal syntax coupled with a model-theoretic semantics for increasingly sophisticated fragments of English.",
        "Section 3 argues that a successful formal treatment can be given to a natural language querying facility for a historical relational data base (HRDB), through the medium of the intensional logic 1Ls.",
        "We view this work as important for two reasons.",
        "First, it represents one of the initial attempts to adapt the ideas of Montague Semantics (MS) (Montague 1974) to a practical problem.",
        "(Landsbergen (1981) looks at the issue of machine translation within an MS framework.)",
        "The research that has been done since the PTQ paper has primarily looked at extensions or modifications to its linguistic or logical theory, or at implementations of the theory on the computer.",
        "We will attempt to show that this theory of language can serve as the formal foundation of a useable computer system for querying actual databases.",
        "Second, in addition to approaching the problem of NLQ formally, rather than from a purely engineering approach, the theory presented provides a novel (but see Gunji (1981) for a similar approach developed",
        "concurrently with ours) approach to the interpretation of queries that involves both a semantic and a pragmatic account.",
        "This work represents only a first step in this direction within a MS framework.",
        "The fragment of English that we define herein is certainly not adequate to express all of the queries that one would want to present to an HRDB.",
        "It is intended only to lay the groundwork for a formal theory of database querying that is both extendible and implementable.",
        "In this paper we present an informal overview of a fragment of English for database querying that we call QE-HI.",
        "We discuss the kinds of properties and abilities that a database query language in English should possess; principal among these are (1) an account of question semantics that possesses close analogs in database theory, (2) an account of the semantics of multiple-WH questions, (3) an account of the semantics of time, and (4) a grammar that is conducive to a computer implementation.",
        "After examining a number of partial solutions to these problems, we introduce the notion of a formalized pragmatics as an equal partner with the syntax and semantics in the specification of the QE-III language.",
        "We argue that assigning to the pragmatic component the task of providing a representation for the answer(s) to a question is both appropriate and elegant.",
        "Finally, we discuss several other recent attempts at developing a formal theory of questions.",
        "QE-III is defined as a formal language, with syntax paired with semantics, and with a pragmatics defined on the two of these; the language as a whole is designed with the database application in mind.",
        "QE-III is both a simplification and an extension of the PTQ semantic theory.",
        "Within the tradition of Montague Semantics, QE-III is a formalized fragment of English allowing questions, tenses, and temporal operators.",
        "The inclusion of a formal pragmatics as an interpretive component of QE-III is an interesting extension to the traditional conception of a Montague Grammar.",
        "Among the other extensions to the PTQ fragment embodied in are (1) the inclusion of time-denoting expressions and temporal operators, (2) an analysis of verb meanings into primitive meaning units derived from the database schema, and, of course, (3) the inclusion of certain forms of direct questions.",
        "These extensions, and the semantic and pragmatic interpretations with which they are provided, are motivated by the ultimate goal of database access, but they are equally interesting in their own right.",
        "The syntactic theory presented is in some cases admittedly naive, for we have been primarily interested in getting the interpretation right.",
        "Section 4 provides an overview of the salient features of the QE-III by means of a number of example derivations and translations.",
        "The complete definition of QE-III is given in Clifford (1982b) and again in Clifford (1987), where it appears with a fuller set of examples.",
        "We conclude in Section 5 with a discussion of some of the limitations of the fragment and of some possibilities for further extensions."

        "In the standard or \"static\" relational model, we might see a relation such as emp on a scheme EMP(EMP-NAME MGR SAL DEPT).",
        "A typical query of such a relation, say, \"What is employee John's salary?",
        "\", would be expressed in the relational algebra as irSAL (CrEMP-NAME=John(emp)).",
        "A first-order language would express this same query as something like {z I 3 x3 y emp(John,x,y,z)} where x,y, and z are individual variables and John is an individual constant.",

        "The HRDM (and other historical or temporal database models) attempts to satisfy the need for access to the temporal dimension of information by providing a unified and formal theory of database semantics that includes time.",
        "In particular, HRDM and QE-III, recognizing the need for maintaining a historical record of changing data, and a language (English) that makes explicit or implicit reference to the concept of time, together provide a theory of database semantics capable of interpreting sentences in the language correctly, i.e., in a way that corresponds with our intuitive understanding of the relation of time to the semantics of the real world.",
        "Consider again the query \"Has John's salary risen?\"",
        "Even with time represented explicitly in the database, there is no apparent simple relational algebraic formulation for this query.",
        "With the first-order representation for John's salary given above, as a first guess we might imagine that RISE* I 3x3y emp(John,x,y,z)}) would represent this new query, where RISE is a predicate symbol.",
        "However, even with the knowledge that John has only one salary, say 25K, it clearly makes no sense to ask whether 25K \"rises.\"",
        "To answer this question, more data is needed than the current extension of John's salary: the values of John's salary for some other point(s) of time (in this specific instance, in the past) are needed.",
        "The HRDM model presented in Clifford and Croker (1987), built upon a formalization of the concept of intension, provides a uniform way to view attributes (such as SALaries) not as individual dollar amounts, but as functions from moments in time to dollar amounts.",
        "For the purposes of this paper we will present an overview of HRDM and discuss some of the issues involved.",

        "A relation in the ordinary, or static, relational data model would consist of a set of such tuples representing the facts about a set of employees.",
        "Each tuple would consist of exactly four atomic values, one for each of the four attributes in the scheme.",

        "HRDM serves to formally incorporate a temporal semantics into an extended relational database model.",
        "In order to query a historical database using English, we define the semantics of queries expressed in English in terms of the semantics of HRDM, by defining a small query fragment as a Montague Grammar.",
        "The correlation between the database semantics and this query language is made explicit by providing the semantics of the query fragment via an indirect translation into the intensional logic ILs. '",
        "The translations provide for a completely extensional treatment of verbs (i.e., there are no verbs like seek, which can be nonextensional in object position in the PTQ treatment).",
        "This treatment is dictated by the application to a database environment, in which existence is tantamount to existence in the database (Reiter 1978).",
        "Through these translations, then, the historical database essentially serves as a model for ILs and therefore as the model for a formal definition of the interpretation of the English queries.",
        "In addition to providing a semantic interpretation, which in model-theoretic terms is called its denotation, we also provide for each expression a pragmatic interpretation in a manner to be explained.",
        "Our goal in this effort has not been to define an English database query language that is, in any sense of the term, complete.",
        "Rather, we have been motivated by two complementary goals.",
        "First, we have wanted to investigate the possibility of a formal, model-theoretic query language for historical databases.",
        "This led to our interest in Montague Semantics and to our second goal – demonstrating that Montague's theories of natural language semantics are applicable to such a practical task.",
        "Along the way we discovered that it was simpler and more natural to define the interpretation of this query language in two components, one semantic and the other pragmatic.",
        "Two overrriding principles have guided this work.",
        "First was that whatever interpretation or meaning our theory would give to a natural language database query should be as close as possible to the interpretation given to database queries in, say, the relational algebra or calculus.",
        "This meant that the interpretation of a query should somehow encompass its answer as represented in the underlying data base.",
        "Second, the theory should make sense computationally.",
        "This meant taking into account what had already been learned about parsing strategies for Montague Grammars (Friedman and Warren (1978), Warren (1979), Landsbergen (1981)), as well as what database theory had to say about the semantics of the modeled enterprise.",
        "These principles motivate certain systematic simplifications to the PTQ translations from English to logic, wherever these are suggested by the simplified view of the semantics of the enterprise provided by the database model.",
        "Moreover, since we are not attempting to develop a semantic theory of questions for English in general, these simplifications have been introduced into the translation process as early as possible.",
        "We believe that this strategy has the dual effect of making some of the PTQ theory a little more accessible, and eliminating the need to resort to the less computationally attractive technique of introducing a large number of meaning postulates and using logical equivalences to perform the reductions at a later stage.",
        "We have made little attempt to develop a sophisticated syntax for our fragment.",
        "Numerous extensions to the syntax of the PTQ fragment have been investigated by researchers in the past decade that we have not incorporated into our fragment.",
        "Since our primary concern has been \"getting the meaning right,\" we felt that a too broad syntactic coverage might obscure our major points.",
        "For this reason, we have extended the PTQ fragment only slightly.",
        "The treatment of questions that we present is syntactically naive, although in its favor we might point out that unlike most work on questions in Montague Grammar, QE-III makes a stab at direct questions.",
        "We believe that the semantic theory of questions that we present, and particularly our proposal to capture the answer in a pragmatic component, are an important contribution to the formalization of the interpretive component of natural language understanding systems.",
        "Naturally, the true test of a natural language query facility is in how useable it is; certainly the syntax of QE-III would have to be extended before anyone would think of using it.",
        "In this section we discuss the major issues underlying the definition of QE-III, which fall roughly into two broad categories: aspects of the process of database querying that we have incorporated into the fragment, and modifications and additions to the PTQ fragment Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 4, December 1988 13 James Clifford Natural Language Querying of Historical Databases that these, and the database semantics, have occasioned.",
        "As in much of the work that has been done in the area of Montague Semantics since Montague's death in 1970, we have allowed the PTQ fragment to stand pretty much intact as the heart of QE-III.",

        "For example, instead of translating the verb \"manage\" into the unanalyzed predicate \"manage', we take advantage of the database semantics to incorporate directly into its translation the information that its subject must be an IC in the role of a MGR, and that its object must be a constant IC that is an EMP.",
        "We do not change the logical type of the translation, i.e., a transitive verb in our fragment denotes the same kind of function as it does in Montague's treatment; we simply analyze its meaning in terms of the database primitives.",

        "In order to provide a semantics for this expansion of the PTQ fragment Dowty argues for the necessity of several significant extensions to the logic IL: a radically different treatment of the phenomenon of tense is one of his contributions.",
        "Because we are concerned with many of the same issues as Dowty – in particular tenses and direct temporal references – it seems appropriate to discuss his work and to contrast two different solutions to some of the same issues.",

        "The problems with a number of different classification schemes that have been proposed over the years are discussed, in particular Vendler's scheme (Vendler 1967), which divides verbs into the four categories of statives, activities, accomplishments, and achievements.",

        "More recently Engdahl (1986) explored the issue of constituent questions in Swedish, and proposed a semantic theory of questions similar to those of Ham-blin (1973) and Karttunen (1977), which we shall discuss in Section 3.6.",

        "In what seems to be his only published remark on the issue of questions, he says: \"In connection with imperatives and interrogatives truth and entailment conditions are of course inappropriate, and would be replaced by fulfillment conditions and a characterization of the semantic content of a correct answer\" (Montague 1973).",
        "Perhaps inspired by this comment, a number of researchers have been investigating ways to incorporate a formal account of the syntax and semantics of questions within the framework of Montague Semantics.",

The problem of multiple wh-questions has a rather simple solution if one is willing to restrict one's attention to questions that involve only one wh-word; it is well known, however, that multiple wh-words require a considerably more complex treatment if the semantics is to be defined compositionally as in a Montague framework it must (Kuno and Robinson 1972).",

        "It will be important to keep in mind the distinction between objects in a model for IL, and objects in the relational database model.",
        "In the relational model, particularly when dealing with the relational algebra, one tends to think of all relations as being the same kind of object.",
        "One projects and joins relations at will, since these relational operators are defined generically.",

        "Two common threads run through much of the recent work on formalizing a theory of questions.",
        "The first is the idea that all questions should be defined so as to denote objects of the same type.",
        "Generally, this has meant propositions or sets of propositions, but it seems that even before the choice of just what questions denote was made, this \"single semantics\" viewpoint had been adopted.",
        "The other, as we have already pointed out, is that some account of the answer(s) to a question should be included at least as a component of its semantics.",
        "When combined with other factors these two biases have led to somewhat different results.",
        "Thus Hamblin (1973) suggests that a question denotes the set of all \"propositions that count as answers to it\"; Karttunen (1977), \"the set of propositions expressed by[its] true answers\"; Bennett (1977, 1979) and Belnap (1982), who worked with Bennett on the theory, \"sets of open propositions:functions from sequences of individuals to propositions.\""

        "As we have said, Karttunen (1977) presents an analysis of the semantics of questions that falls within the single semantics tradition.",
        "(Hamblin (1973) earlier proposed a treatment similar to Karttunen's, but his theory was not worked out in as much detail.)",
        "In Karttunen's theory, for example, the question \"Who manages John?\"",
        "would roughly be translated as: Ap3x[p(i) A p = Ai [manage' (i)(x)(i) ,John]) .",
        "Semantically, this expression, when interpreted with respect to a model and a state, denotes the set which contains, for each person x that manages John, the proposition that x manages John.",
        "Such a treatment of the semantics of questions seems inappropriate to us for two related reasons.",
        "First, it seems to confuse propositions with the sentences that express them.",
        "Whatever a proposition might be in our informal use of the term, it is in the formal system defined by ILs a function from indices to truth values, or equivalently a set of indices.",
        "In order to see why this seems an inappropriate choice for the semantic object denoted by a question, consider a model in which the constants manage' and love' are interpreted as follows:",
        "Now consider the two queries Q1: \"Who manages John in 1978?",
        "\", which translates to Ap3x[manage'(1978) (x,John) A p = Aimanage'(i)(x,John)]; and Q2: \"Who loves John in 1978?",
        "\", which translates to Ap3x[love' (1978)(x,John) A p = Ailove'(i)(x,John)].",
        "Given these translations, the interpretation of these two queries in this model, [Q1] and [Q2], is: [Q1] = { {1978,1979} /*Mary manages John */ {1978} } /*Susan manages John*/ [Q2] = { {1978,1979} /*Bill loves John */ {1978} } /*Susan loves John */",
        "Under this interpretation, both queries, which are obviously quite distinct, denote exactly the same set of propositions in the model, the set containing the proposition {1978,1979} and the proposition {1978}.",
        "Thus under this interpretation we cannot distinguish between these two questions – they are semantically equivalent in the database under this theory.",
        "The second and related objection is that under this interpretation all direct mention of the entities (Mary, Susan, John, .",
        ".",
        ".)",
        "involved disappears.",
        "Instead, the theory claims that the question denotes a set that contains sets of states (years).",
        "What this implies is that there is no obvious way of going backwards from these objects in the model (the sets of propositions) to some useful expression in a language (English) that names them.",
        "Since in this theory the denotation of questions loses the people involved, we have no simple way to recover their names and report them to the questioner.",
        "The theory neglects considering the use and effects of the question.",
        "Moreover, there seems to be no way even to add a pragmatic component to such a theory in order to account for a question's answer(s), for on the one hand the syntax has no mention of the names of the individuals involved, nor on the other hand does the denotation involve any individuals at all.",
        "In the pragmatics of our theory the two queries would instead be interpreted, with respect to a given database, as follows (where [Qi] now means the pragmatic interpretation of Qi): [Q1] = {Mary,Susan}, and [Q2] = {Bill,Susan}.",
        "With these interpretations we have not lost the people involved, and there is an obvious relationship between these objects and English expressions for them",
        "(\"Mary and Susan\" and \"Bill and Susan\"), as well as the relations in the database that express the same information.5 understand it, we provide the following table of the types of the variables used.",
        "As noted earlier, Bennett discussed the issue of the logic of questions in two separate papers, and collaborated with Belnap in the development.",
        "Their theory is presented cumulatively in Bennett (1977, 1979) and Belnap (1982).",
        "Motivated again by the goal of a single semantics, and even more strongly by a desire to account for the individuals that answer the question, Belnap and Bennett develop a theory that incorporates sequences of individuals into the model theory.",
        "Thus a question like \"Whom does John love?\"",
        "is treated as denoting a set of functions from sequences of individuals to propositions.",
        "Essentially all and only those sequences that close the open proposition \"John loves [it-ACC-0]\" and make it true are included in this denotation.",
        "What this is tantamount to is incorporating the standard (Tarskian) notion of a variable assignment into the model theory, instead of leaving it in the meta theory of the logic.",
        "For technical reasons the entire system must be altered to include these sequences, so that even sentences are no longer translated into formulas, but rather into expressions denoting sets of such sequences.",
        "This rippling effect of the complications to the semantics is extraordinarily reminiscent of the problems we had in 'formulating a theory with inductive wh-terms.",
        "In order to accomplish this result, the set of types of the IL is expanded to include as a basic type n, expressions of type n denoting a natural number.",
        "Thus the natural numbers must be included as objects in the model, as well as functions constructed from them.",
        "Of particular interest in their theory are the functions from N to individuals, i.e., sequences.",
        "The ripple effect necessitates that \"all expressions of English [denote] functions from sequences of individuals to their usual extensions\" (Bennett 1979).",
        "Even sentences are no longer translated into formulas, but rather into expressions of type <<n,e>,t> that denote sets of sequences.",
        "Unfortunately, the results of this complication to the logic and the English translations do not seem to justify the cost.",
        "Certainly this theory represents a step closer to the goal of capturing explicitly in the denotation the individuals that answer the question, so it is an improvement over the proposition proposal.",
        "But these individuals are hidden somewhere inside infinite sequences of individuals, with no indication of their position within those sequences.",
        "An example should clarify this point.",
        "In order to In the Bennett/Belnap theory, an open sentence like \"John loves him\" is translated as: [As[love' ([ APP(s(1))])(John')], which denotes (ignoring inten-sions) the set of sequences such that John loves the first member of each of them.",
        "The corresponding question \"Whom does John love?\"'",
        "would be: [A0[0 = [Asr love'([^APP(s(1))])(John')]] A 3r[vO(r)]]], which denotes a set of open propositions.",
        "But these again involve infinite sequences of individuals, and there is no indication of which projection of these sequences represents the individuals that John loves.",
        "This problem of having the individuals that constitute the answer embedded in infinite sequences without knowing how to project them out is the same one that we have in our semantic theory.",
        "For our semantics translates questions into open formulas, which denote the set of variable assignments that satisfy the formula.",
        "Our relegating to pragmatics the task of projecting these variable assignments could also be used to solve this problem here.",
        "But if this is the case, then what is gained by paying the price for the complication to the model theory and the translation rules?",
        "This use of sequences in effect duplicates the variable assignment of their Tarskian meta-theory (albeit restricted to the domain De) in the object language and in the logical model with no noticeable advantages."

        "Since both redundant and non-redundant answers are possible, and since non-redundant answers are generally much more natural, we hold that no serious theory of questions and answers should restrict itself to a treatment of redundant answers alone, and that it should be able to handle both.\"",

        "With respect to IL, the major change is that in ILs, we evaluate any expression a with respect to a state s by forming the expression [Aia](s).",
        "The other major aspect of QE-III is the inclusion of a formal pragmatic component to the language, on an equal standing with the syntactic and semantic components.",

        "First, we note that the basic verb is prefixed with #, and this Computational Linguistics, Volume 14, Number 4, December 1988 29 James Clifford Natural Language Querying of Historical Databases prefix remains even after S4 is applied to combine the term \"John\" with the intransitive verb phrase \"#manage Mary\".",

        "The importance of this characterization will be made clearer when we consider the interaction of tense with interrogative sentences.",

        "Dowty (1979) makes a similar point – though still in terms of introducing the tense via a SUBJ + PRED rule – but does not incorporate the idea into the fragment presented there.",
        "In a number of the PTQ rules Montague makes use of the auxiliary notions of the gender of a CN or a T, and the third-person singular form of a verb.",
        "These notions are never defined with the same rigor that Montague demanded of other characteristics of his logic and grammar, presumably because he felt they were obvious and uninteresting.",
        "As in Bennett (1974) we make use of a number of similar auxiliary notions in our rules.",
        "This example points out two such notions, viz., that of the tense of a clause and the case of a variable.",

        "The problem of modeling the semantics of time is one which is beginning to be explored by researchers in a number of different areas of computer science.",
        "We believe that formal logic can make an important contribution to our understanding and specification of the properties of time that we can incorporate into our models and systems.",
        "Using the logic IL, and the framework of MS, we have presented in this paper an overview of the HRDM, which is a formalization of the concept of a historical database.",
        "HRDM provides for the modeling of historical information in a DBMS, for the specification of constraints on the way that information can change over time, and for a query language for accessing that information with specific reference to its temporal dimension.",
        "To complement the relational query language of HRDM (Clifford and Croker 1987), we have in this paper described a formal English database query language, QE-III, which is defined in a MS framework.",
        "QE-III incorporates a formal syntax, semantics, and pragmatics to account for an interpretation of questions that accord with the interpretation of HRDM, including an account of multiple-wh questions, a semantics and pragmatics of time, and a grammar that is conducive to a computer implementation.",
        "In addition to its formal syntax and parallel semantics, QE-III is provided with a formal pragmatics that provides a representation for the answer(s) to a question as a function of its syntax and semantics.",
        "We believe that this approach, and the whole area of formal pragmatics as a component of language theory, is a fertile area for further research."
