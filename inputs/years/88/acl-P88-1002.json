        "In this paper we discuss the syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic analysis of fragmentary sentences in English.",
        "Our central claim is that these sentences, which have often been classified in the literature with truly erroneous input such as misspellings (see, for example, the work discussed in [Kwasny1980, Thompson1980, Kwasny1981, Sondheimer1983, Eastman1981, Jensen1983]), are regular structures which can be processed by adding a small number of rules to the grammar and other components of the system.",
        "The syntactic regularity of fragment structures has been demonstrated elsewhere, notably in [Marsh1983, Hirschman1983]; we will focus here upon the regularity of these structures across all levels of linguistic representation.",
        "Because the syntactic component regularises these structures into a form almost indistinguishable from full ?This work has been supported in part by DARPA under contract N00014-85-C-0012, administered by the Office of Naval Research; by National Science Foundation contract DCR-85-02206; and by Independent R&D funding from System Development Corporation, now part of Unisys Corporation.",
        "Approved for public release, distribution unlimited.",
        "assertions, the semantic and pragmatic components are able to interpret them with few or no extensions to existing mechanisms.",
        "This process of incremental regularisation of fragment structures is possible only within a linguistically modular system.",
        "Furthermore, we claim that although fragments may occur more frequently in specialised sublanguages than in the standard grammar, they do not provide evidence that sublanguages are based on grammatical principles fundamentally different from those underlying standard languages, as claimed by (Fitspatrick1988], for example.",
        "This paper is divided into five sections.",
        "The introductory section defines fragments and describes the scope of our work.",
        "In the second section, we consider certain properties of sentence fragments which motivate a modular approach.",
        "The third section describes our implementation of processing for fragments, to which each component of the system makes a distinct contribution.",
        "The fourth section describes the temporal analysis of fragments.",
        "Finally, the fifth section discusses the status of sublanguages characterised by these telegraphic constructions.",
        "We define fragments as regular structures which are distinguished from full assertions by a missing element or elements which are normally syntactically obligatory.",
        "We distinguish them from errors on the basis of their regularity and consistency of interpretation, and because they appear to be generated intentionally.",
        "We are not denying the existence of true errors, nor that processing sentences containing true errors may require sophisticated techniques and deep reasoning.",
        "Rather, we are saying that fragments are distinct from errors, and can be handled in a quite general fashion, with minimal extensions to normal processing.",
        "Because we base the definition of fragment on the absence of a syntactically",
        "obligatory element, noun phrases without articles are not considered to be fragmentary, since this omission is conditioned heavily by semantic factors such as the mass vs. count distinction.",
        "However, we have implemented a pragmatically based treatment of noun phrases without determiners, which is briefly discussed in Section 3.",
        "Fragments, then, are defined here as elisions.",
        "We describe below the way in which these omissions are detected and subsequently 'filled in' by different modules of the system.",
        "The problem of processing fragmentary sentences has arisen in the context of a large-scale natural language processing research project conducted at UNISYS over the past five years [Palmer1988, Hirschman1988, Dowding1987, Dah11987].",
        "We have developed a portable, broad-coverage text-processing system, PUNDIT.1 Our initial applications have involved various message types, including: field engineering reports for maintenance of computers; Navy maintenance reports (Casualty Reports, or CASREPs) for starting air compressors; Navy intelligence reports (11ADIFORms); trouble and failure reports (TFR8) from Navy Vessels; and recently we have examined several medical domains (radiology reports, comments fields from a DNA sequence database).",
        "At least half the sentences in these corpora are fragments; Table 1 below gives a summary of the fragment content of three domains, showing the percent of centers which are classified as fragments.",
        "(Centers comprise all sentence types: assertions, questions, fragments, and so forth.)",
        "The PUNDIT system is highly modular: it consists of a syntactic component, based on string grammar and restriction grammar [Sager1981, Hirschman1985]; a semantic component, based on inference-driven mapping, which decomposes predicating expressions into predicates and thematic roles [Palmer1983, Palmer1985]; and a pragmatics component which processes both referring expressions [Dah11988], and temporal expressions [Passonnesul987, Passonneau19881."

        "We argue here that sentence fragments provide a strong case for linguistically modular systems such as PUNDIT, because such elisions have distinct consequences at different levels of linguistic description.",
        "Our approach to fragments can be summarised by saying that syntax detects 'holes' in surface structure and creates dummy elements as placeholders for the missing elements; semantics and pragmatics interpret these placeholders at the appropriate point in sentence processing, utilising the same mechanisms for fragments as for full assertions.",
        "Syntax regulates the holes.",
        "Fragment elisions cannot be accounted for in purely semantic/pragmatic terms.",
        "This is evidenced by the fact that there are syntactic restrictions on omissions; the acceptability of a sentence fragment hinges on grammatical factors rather than, e.g., how readily the elided material can be inferred from context.",
        "For example, the discourse Old house too small.",
        "Â°New one will be larger than _ was (where the elided object of than is understood to be old house) is ill-formed, whereas a comparable discourse First repairman ordered new air conditioner.",
        "Second repairman will install _ (where the elided object of install is understood to be air conditioner) is acceptable.",
        "In both cases above, the referent of the elided element is available from context, and yet only the second ellipsis sounds well-formed.",
        "Thus an appreciation of where such ellipses may occur is part of the linguistic knowledge of speakers of English and not simply a function of the contextual salience of elided elements.",
        "Since these restrictions concern structure rather than content, they would be difficult or impossible to state in a system such as a 'pure' semantic grammar which only recognised such omissions at the level of semantic/pragmatic representation.",
        "Furthermore, it matters to semantics and pragmatics HOW an argument is omitted.",
        "The syntactic component must tell semantics whether a verb argument is missing because the verb is used intransitively (as in The tiger was eating, where the patient argument is not specified) or because of a fragment ellipsis (as in Eaten by a tiger, where the patient argument is missing because the subject of a passive sentence has been elided).",

        "In PUNDIT'a treatment of fragments, each component contributes exactly what is appropriate to the specification of elided elements.",
        "Thus the syntax does not attempt to 'fill in' the holes that it discovers, unless that information is completely predictable given the structure at hand.",
        "Instead, it creates a dummy element.",
        "If the missing element is an elided subject, then the dummy element created by the syntactic component is assigned a referent by the pragmatics component.",
        "This referent is then assigned a thematic role by the semantics component like any other referent, and is subject to any selectional restrictions associated with the thematic role assigned to it.",

        "Although the initial PUNDIT system was designed to handle full, as opposed to fragmentary, sentences, one of the interesting results of our work is that it has required only very minor changes to the system to handle the basic fragment types introduced below.",
        "These included the additions of: 6 fragment BNF definitions to the grammar (a 5% increase in grammar size) and 7 context-sensitive restrictions (a 12% increase in the number of restrictions); one semantic rule for the interpretation of the dummy element inserted for missing verbs; a minor modification to the reference resolution mechanism to treat elided noun phrases like pronouns; and a small addition to the temporal processing mechanism to handle tenseless fragments.",
        "The small number of changes to the semantic and pragmatic components reflects the fact that these components are not 'aware' that they are interpreting fragmentary structures, because the regularisation performed by the syntactic component renders them structurally indistinguishable from full assertions.",
        "Fragments present parsing problems because the ellipsis creates degenerate structures.",
        "For example, a sequence such as chest negative can be analysed as a 'sero-copula' fragment meaning the chest X-ray is negative, or a noun compound like the negative of the chest.",
        "This is compounded by the lack of derivational and inflectional morphology in English, so that in many cases it may not be possible to distinguish a noun from a verb (repair parts) or a past tense from a past participle (decreased medication).",
        "Adding fragment definitions to the grammar (especially if determiner omission is also allowed) results in an explosion of ambiguity.",
        "This problem has been noted and discussed by Kwasny and Sondheimer [Kwasny1981].",
        "Their solution to the problem is to suggest special relaxation techniques for the analysis of fragments.",
        "However, in keeping with our thesis that fragments are normal constructions, we have chosen the alternative of con-straining the explosion of parses in two ways.",

        "Fragments do occur with disproportionate frequency in some domains, such as field reports of mechanical failure or newspaper headlines.",
        "However, despite this frequency variation, it appears that the parser's preferences remain constant across domains.",
        "Therefore, even in telegraphic domains the preference is for a full assertion parse, if one is available.",
        "As discussed above, we have enforced this preference by means of the xor ('unbacktrackable' or) connective.",
        "Thus despite the greater frequency of fragments we do not require either a grammar or a preference structure different from that of standard English in order to apply the stable system grammar to these telegraphic messages.",
        "Others have argued against this view of the relationship between sublanguages and the language at large.",
        "For example, Fitzpatrick et al.",
        "[Fitspatrick1988] propose that fragments are subject to a constraint quite unlike any found in English generally.",
        "Their Transitivity Constraint (Tc) requires that if a verb occurs as a transitive in a sublanguage with fragmentary messages, then it may not also occur in an intransitive form, even if the verb is ambiguous in the language at large.",
        "This constraint, they argue, provides evidence that sublanguage grammars have \"a life of their own\", since there is no such principle governing standard languages.",
        "The TC would also cut down on ambiguities arising out of object deletion, since a verb would be permitted to occur transitively or intransitively in a given subdomain, but not both.",
        "As the authors recognise, this hypothesis runs into difficulty in the face of verbs such as resume (we find both Sac resumed normal operation and Noise has resumed), since resume occurs both transitively and intransitively in these cases.",
        "For these cases, the authors are forced to appeal to a problematic analysis of resume as syntactically transitive in both cases; they analyse The noise has resumed, for example, as deriving from a structure of the form (Someone/ something) resumed the noise; that is, it is analysed as under-lying'', transitive.",
        "Other transitivity alternations which present potential counterexamples are treated as syntactic gapping processes.",
        "In fact, with these two mechanisms available, it is not clear what COULD provide a counterexample to",
        "the TU.",
        "The effect of all this insulation is to render the Transitivity Constraint vacuous.",
        "If all transitive/intransitive alternations can be treated as underlyingly transitive, then of course there will be no counterexamples to the transitivity constraint.",
        "Therefore we see no evidence that sublanguage grammars are subject to additional constraints of this nature.",
        "In summary, this supports the view that fragmentary constructions in English are regular, grammatically constrained ellipses differing minimally from the standard language, rather than ill-formed, unpredictable sublanguage exotica..",
        "Within a modular system such as PUNDIT this regularity can be captured with the limited augmentations of the grammar described above."
