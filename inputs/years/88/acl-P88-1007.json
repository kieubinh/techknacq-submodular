        "Recently, however, other researchers have pointed out problems with Bresnan's approach; a very thorough and detailed criticism appears in (Pinkham 85)1, which has been our main theoretical source.",
        "Pinkham gives examples of a wide range of constructions which are difficult or impossible to explain in terms of deletion phenomena, and suggests instead an approach in which at least some comparative constructions are base-generated phrasal and then interpreted using a rule which she calls \"distributive copying\".",

        "After distributive copying, this becomes lc): Viewed in this light, we claim that our treatment of non-clausal comparison (which at first glance might seem somewhat ad hoc) is in fact fairly well-related to current tendencies in theoretical linguistics.",
        "This manoevre, replacing syntactic deletion rules with interpretative copying operations, seems to us very powerful, and (although we formulate it in a rather different way) is one of the central ideas in our own treatment of comparatives.",
        "We have in fact taken it even further than Pinkham, who keeps the verb deletion rule of \"Cellipsis\" to explain some comparative constructions: in the account presented below in section 4, we get rid of the deletion rules completely and use only interpretative methods.",
        "In this context, it is interesting to look at Levin's LFG-based work on sluicing constructions (Levin 82).",
        "Levin presents a variety of arguments to support her claim that sluicing is not a c-structure phenomenon (i.e. not elliptic in nature), but rather explainable at f-structure level (i.e. in some sense related to a semantic copying operation).",
        "The differences between sluicing and comparative ellipsis are sufficiently great that this cannot in itself be said to prove anything, but it is none the less indicative of the way in which linguists are thinking about these problems.",
        "In SNACK-85, which uses a framework based on that in (Pereira 83), we perform copying operations on \"quanttrees\", a level of structure which can loosely be compared with Chomskian logical form or LFG's f-structures."

        "In (Banks & Rayner 87) we presented this in outline and then described some problems we had encountered, which eventually caused us to abandon the approach.",
        "Briefly, it turned out that the exact formulation of the syntactic copying process was by no means straightforward: there appeared to be a strong parallel with the well-known arguments against the analogous point of view for coordination constructions.",

        "al.",
        "82), p. 271).",

        "We suggested instead that the sentence be thought of as being composed of the following components: the initial everyone, the contrasted elements London and New York, and the duplicated part, which could be rendered (roughly) as is a P such that P spent an amount of money _ in _ where _.",

        "The following account summarizes how the idea is implemented within the structure of the SNACK-85 system.",
        "Semantic interpretation in SNACK-85 is performed by first converting the parse-tree to an intermediate form, which we call (following (Pereira 83)) a quant-tree.",
        "This is then subjected to rewriting rules before being converted into the final logical form.",
        "Normally, these rewriting rules formalize so-called scoping transformations; here, we will also use them to describe the interpretation of non-clausal comparison.",
        "The basic motivation is the same, namely to remove rules from the grammar which lack syntactic motivation.",
        "We introduce four new kinds of nodes in addition to those defined in (Pereira 83): we call these comparands, comparative-objects, comparisons, and comparison-placeholders.",
        "They interact as follows.",
        "(Stage 1) At the syntactic level, we view the comparative object as a constituent in its associated comparative AP; when the parse-tree is transformed into the quant-tree, the AP gets turned into a comparand node, in which there is a comparative-object subnode representing the comparative object.",
        "(Stage 2) Rewriting rules then move the comparative-object out of the compar an d, leaving behind a placeholder.",
        "This is a triple consisting of the compared predicate (the adjective, adverb or whatever), and two logical variables (the \"linking\" variables), which correspond to the lambda-bound variables y and P above.",
        "(Stage 3) The \"raised\" comparative-object node is a 4-tuple.",
        "It consists of",
        "• The two variables y and P (and is thus \"linked\" to the placeholder through them - hence the name), • The comparison type (more than, less than, same as etc.)",

        "represents the comparand NP or PP.",
        "The rewriting rules move it upwards until it finds a quant node that it can be compared against.",
        "At the moment, the only compatibility requirements are that the quant node and the comparative-object's quant subnode not have incompatible case-markings.",
        "This could be improved upon; one way would be to define preference heuristics which gave higher priority to comparisons between quant nodes whose variables are of similar type.",
        "The result of merging the two nodes is a comparison node, which is a 5-tuple consisting of",
        "• The comparative-object's quant node • The quant node it has been merged with • The comparison type • The two \"linking variables\", y",

        "• \"Simple\" phrasals (section 5),",
        "handled by a different direct interpretation method.",
        "We do not claim that this classification is the only way to explain the facts; as we have said above, it would be possible to rewrite simple phrasal comparatives into directly interpreted phrasal comparatives, and also to rewrite directly interpreted phrasal comparatives as clausal comparatives.",
        "We think, however, that this manoevre would give us nothing in the form of real gains; even though a unified solution might seem more elegant, the syntactic transformations needed are more complicated than the use of different categories.",

        "In this connection we think that the following data from Swedish may be of interest.",
        "Comparative constructions in Swedish are virtually identical to the corresponding ones in English.",
        "One significant difference, however, is the distribution of the relative pronoun vad (\"what\"); this can optionally be inserted after the comparative marker in some constructions, as shown in 10) and 11)1.",
        "Given the correspondences between clausal comparison and relative• clauses described in section 4, it is very tempting to account for the \"vad\" as a relative pronoun realizing the normally null Q.",

        "This would seem problematic for a transformational account, but is quite natural if phrasal comparatives are treated by direct interpretation; there isn't any Q, so it can't be realized as a \"vad\".",
