        "The system then analyzes the English input and produces a representation of the task.",

        "The representation consists of a decomposition of verbs into primitive actions which are semantically interpretable by the motion synthesis procedures.",
        "It also includes default information for all knowledge which is not made explicit in the input, but must be explicit in the animated output.",
        "The representation contains sufficient non-geometric information needed to schedule task start and end times, describe concurrent actions, and provide reach, grasp, and motion goals.",

        "An empirical study of approximately 110 sentences from nine cookbooks was carried out.",
        "Verbal modifiers were found to play an essential role in the expressive power of these sentences.",
        "Therefore, in order to develop a representation for the verbal modifiers, the study describes and categorizes their occurences and provides a semantic analysis of each of the categories.",
        "Each of the categories is considered a semantic role in the representation of the natural language input.",
        "Temporal adverbials were found to be particularly prevalent in recipes because they are needed to specify temporal information about actions which is not inherent in the meaning of verbs and their objects.",
        "This paper discusses two categories of temporal modifiers: duration and repetitions as well as speed modifiers.",
        "Other categories of modifiers which were analyzed include quantity of the object, end result, instrument, and force.",
        "Passonneau (1986) and Waltz (1981,1982) are concerned with developing semantic representations adequate for representing adverbial modification.",
        "Pas-sonneau's work shows that to account for tense and grammatical aspect requires a much more complex representation of the temporal components of language than the one used in SEAFACT.",
        "However, she does not look at as many categories of temporal adverbials, nor does she propose specific representation for them.",
        "Waltz (1982) suggests that adverbs will be represented by the scales in his event shape diagrams.",

        "Moens and Steedman identify temporal/aspectual types following Vendler, but introduce new terminology.",

        "(Moens, 1987, p. 1) Each process in cooking must have a culmination because any cooking task involves a finite sequence of steps, whose goal is to bring about a state change.",
        "An important point about verbal modifiers in the cooking domain, revealed in this study, is that many of them are concerned with characterizing the culmination points of processes.",
        "In many cases a verb and object alone do not specify a clear culmination point.",
        "For example, the command beat the cream does not contain information about the desired culmination of the process, that is, when to stop the beating.",
        "Some sort of verbal modifier such as for 10 minutes or just until it forms peaks is necessary to specify the culmination of the process.",
        "Another aspectual type is a culmination.",

        "This new state we will refer to as the \"consequent state\" of the event.",

        "In addition to the sentential aspect discussed above, the SEAFACT implementation identifies the lexical aspect of the verb.",

        "For example, the lexical aspect of the verb stir is a process.",
        "However, the sentential aspect of the sentence stir the soup for 3 minutes is a culminated process.",
        "The implementation checks that the sentential aspect of each input sentence containing a process verb is a culminated process.",
        "That is, there must be some verbal modifier which coerces the process into a culminated process.",
        "If this is not the case, as in the sentence stir the soup, then the input is rejected since it would specify an animation without an ending time.",

        "For example, the categories of modifiers which express the number of repetitions of an action can only modify expressions which include an endpoint, that is, points, culminations, or culminated processes.",
        "The analysis of the verbal modifier categories reveals many areas where common sense knowledge or physical knowledge about the world is required to represent the semantics of these categories.",
        "For example, when an action is performed on a plural object, physical knowledge about the size and consistency of the objects and about the action itself is necessary to tell us whether it must be repeated for each of the objects separately or performed on all the objects in a group.",
        "SEAFACT is a successful implementation of a natural language interface to a computer-generated animation system, operating in the domain of cooking tasks.",
        "The primitive actions along with the timing information in the SEAFACT output are used to represent the range of verbal modifiers discussed in this paper.",
        "The output will be interpreted by an interface to the lower level motion synthesis procedures.",
        "This interface (Badler, 1988, 1987a, 1987b) can interpret each type of information in the SEAFACT output: motion changes (e.g. rotation), motion goals, constraints in position and orientation, and temporals."
