        "The analysis of tense and aspect requires specifying what relations can or cannot hold among times and events, given a sentence describing those events.1 For example, a specification of the meaning of the past-tense sentence \"John ate a cake\" involves the fact that the time of the main event – in this case, the cake-eating event – precedes the time of utterance of the sentence.",
        "Various proposals have also been made regarding the analysis of aspect which involve auxiliary times or events, whereby the proper relationship of these auxiliary times or events to \"real\" main events is specified.",
        "We provide an analysis of English tense and aspect that involves specifying relations among times rather than events.",
        "We also offer a means of interpreting tenseless elements like nouns and adjectives whose interpretation may be temporally dependent.",
        "For example, the noun phrase \"the warm cakes\" picks out different sets of cakes, depending on the time relative to which it 'receives an interpretation.",

        "Harper and Charniak (1986) [henceforth H&C] provide an interesting and revealing analysis of English tense and aspect involving relations between events.",
        "There are several kinds of events: the utterance event, which is associated with the time of the utterance; the main event, or the event being described by the main verb of the sentence; the perfect event; and the progressive event.",
        "The representation of every sentence involves the utterance event and the main event; sentences with progressive or perfect aspect also involve progressive or perfect events.",
        "This treatment is quite different from the Re-ichenbach (1947) conception of \"reference time\", which is assumed to be relevant for all sentences.",
        "To translate between the two systems, the reference time may be thought of as being represented by the perfect event in perfect sentences and by the progressive event in progressive sentences.",
        "In the case of perfect progressives, one might consider that there are two reference events, while in simple tenses there is no reference event at all.",
        "Alternatively, in a system like Webber (1987) in which reference points for each sentence are used to construct an event structure, the tensed event (what H&C call the \"anchor event\") is the relevant one: the perfect event for sentences with perfect aspect; for sentences with progressive but no perfect aspect, the progressive event; or the main event for simple tense sentences.2 2 Although instants rather than events are used in the representation described here, a similar strategy would be employable in building up a Webber-style event structure.",
        "In accordance with H&C, we propose perfect reference points for sentences with perfect aspect and progressive reference points for sentences with progressive aspect.",
        "Thus, the interpretation of each sentence involves a number of relevant times: the beginning and end of the event described by the main verb for all sentences, the perfect time if it has perfect aspect, and the progressive time if it has progressive aspect.",
        "In our analysis, unlike H&C, what is relevant for the interpretation of sentences is not a set of events (which have potential duration and beginning and end points) but a set of times or instants.",
        "Instants, unlike events, have no beginning or end: they are one-dimensional points.",
        "This has several advantages over an analysis such as H&C, in which the perfect and progressive reference points are events.",
        "First, if the reference points for perfect and progressive sentences are events rather than instants, it ought to be possible to predicate duration of them.",
        "However, this is not a possible option for perfect and progressive sentences; durational adjuncts are only interpreted relative to the main event.",
        "The sentence \"John has swum for three hours\" is only true when the duration of the main event (the swimming event) is three hours.",
        "Second, relations among events in H&C's system reduce anyway to relations between instants: the starting and ending points of events.",
        "That is, the primitives of systems like H&C's are relations among times.",
        "There seems to be little to be gained from constructing hypothetical events based on these relations when a simpler and cleaner analysis can be constructed on the basis of these primitive notions alone.",
        "There might seem to be the following objection to adopting times as relevant for the interpretation of sentences: given a sentence like 'John was frosting a cake from 3:00 to 4:00 yesterday', we know about the progressive reference point only that it lies between 3:00 and 4:00; there are infinitely many instants satisfying that condition.",
        "It would be impossible to iterate over all of these times to determine the truth of any utterance.",
        "In fact, though, to determine whether a sentence containing perfect or progressive aspect is true, it is unnecessary to instantiate the perfect or progressive reference times to specific values; it suffices to show that an interval exists within which such a point can be found.",
        "That is, they are merely existentially quantified, not instantiated to a value.",
        "In this manner, perfect or progressive times may give the appearance of being similar to events with a starting and an ending point, because they are constrained only to exist within some nonnull interval.",
        "Checking whether or not the sentence is true involves determining whether the interval exists.",
        "The following is the representation for the simple past sentence \"John frosted a cake\", with words in upper case representing variables and words in lower case representing predicate names or constants:",
        "The predicate holds in the first clause of the representation takes three arguments, representing the predicate and the beginning and ending times of the event.",
        "In other words, John frosted X from time Start to time End.",
        "The predicate cake(X) specifies that the thing John frosted was a cake.",
        "We do not represent this with a holds predicate because we assume that the property of being a cake is a static property, not one that changes over time.",
        "The predicate precede(End, now) specifies that the ending time End of the cake-frosting event must precede now, the current time.",
        "In the course of validating this logical form, the variable End will be instantiated to a numerical value, and the atom now will be replaced by the value of the current time.",
        "The predicate precede represents the less-than-or-equal-to relation, while the predicate strictly_precede represents the less-than relation.",
        "Thus, the cake-frosting event must occur in the past.",
        "Let us next consider the semantic representation of a sentence with perfect aspect, \"John will have frosted a cake\":",
        "(2) exists X Start End Perfect",
        "3 This is not a necessary part of the analysis; the representation has been chosen in part for the sake of simplicity.",
        "It would also be possible to represent the predicate cake(X) inside a holds predicate, with the Start and End times representing when the cake began and ceased to exist.",
        "The interpretation of perfect sentences involves a perfect time Perfect.",
        "This time is constrained to follow the main event; this is enforced by the clause precede(End, Perfect).",
        "Since this is a future perfect sentence, Perfect is constrained to be in the future.",
        "The future tense is represented by the predicate strictly_precede; the perfect time must follow now (not coincide with it).",
        "Note, therefore, that in the case of future perfect sentences the main event is required only to end before a time in the future, and that (as with H&C) it is not a contradiction to say \"John will have arrived by tomorrow, and he may already have arrived.\"",
        "Unlike analyses in which relations among all reference points are fully specified, this analysis allows the main event to be in the past even though the sentence itself is in the future perfect.",
        "The following is a representation of the past progressive \"John was frosting a cake\":",
        "Here the progressive time, represented by the variable Progressive, must occur during the cake-frosting event; that is, it must occur after the start and before the end of the main event.",
        "Since the sentence is a past progressive, there is a final requirement on Progressive: it must precede now.",
        "Notice that past progressives differ from simple past sentences in that it is the progressive time and not the ending time of the main event that is required to be in the past.",
        "Consequently, as in H&C, the interpretation of a past progressive like \"John was frosting a cake\" does not require that the main event lie entirely in the past, but only that some part of it be in the past.",
        "The present analysis allows for the possibility that sentences like the following can be true:",
        "(4) John was frosting a cake at 3:00, and he is still frosting it.",
        "We shall see in the next section that what was referred to as the progressive time in the foregoing example actually appears in the representation not only of progressives, but of every sentence, as what we shall call the during time.",
        "The during time will be used in the temporal interpretation of nontensed elements in the sentence.",
        "For this reason, the above representations of the simple past and future perfect sentences above were only a first approximation; actually, their complete representations also contain a during time.",
        "Finally, the representation of a sentence with both progressive and perfect aspect, like \"John will have been frosting a cake\", is the following:",
        "Progressive, the progressive or during time, occurs during the cake-frosting event.",
        "Progressive is constrained by the clause precede(Progressive, Perfect) to precede the perfect time Perfect.",
        "In other words, for a perfect progressive sentence, the requirement is that some portion of the main event lie before the perfect time.",
        "The perfect time is constrained by the clause strictly_precede(now, Perfect) to lie in the future.",
        "In this analysis, underspecification of relations among times yields results that match the natural-language semantics of sentences.4 Use of a perfect and a progressive time allows uniform treatment of perfects and progressives without the complication of introducing unwarranted pseudo-events into the representation of simple tenses.",
        "Also, the progressive/during time is useful as an anchor for the interpretation of nontensed elements, as we will see below."
