        "Of course, context also influences the interpretation (or meaning in context) of the utterance, in which, for example, referring expressions have been resolved.",

        "Such a grammar might, for example, leave quantifiers in place [30], attach all prepositional phrases low and right [22], and bracket to the right all compound nominals.",
        "These neutral analyses can then serve as input to a system that produces interpretations (and not meanings) in a nearly compositional manner, in that the interpretation of a phrase3 is a function of the interpretations of its syntactic constituents together with its context of utterance.",
        "This model of semantic interpretation assumes that contextual information is available whenever it is needed for deciding among alternative interpretations.",
        "However, this is often not the case: questions about the interpretation of some constituent of an utterance might be answerable only when information about the interpretation of syntactically distant constituents becomes available.",
        "Familiar examples of this can be found, for instance, in sentences with quantifier scoping ambiguities and in sentences that include intrasentential anaphora.",
        "The so-called donkey sentences [9] exhibit both these phenomena.",

        "To take advantage of the generally compositional nature of semantic analysis without constraining unduly the order in which pragmatic decisions are made, we assign to phrases conditional interpretations, 2 There are reasons to suspect that ultimately syntactic analysis should be incorporated into the same stage of processing as semantic and pragmatic analysis; in particular, it is difficult to develop syntactically neutral representations for certain constructions such as conjunction.",

The effect of applying the definite discharge rule to an interpretation (S, A) is twofold: the bind assumption operated upon is removed from the set of assumptions A; the sense S is changed to reflect the binding.",

        "Given a sentence and its syntactic analysis, the interpretation process applies semantic-interpretation and pragmatic-discharge rules, according to their applicability conditions, to construct the derivation of a complete interpretation of the sentence.",

        "Strictly compositional approaches to semantic interpretation, such as Montague grammar [19], have so far proved inadequate for dealing with interactions between meaning and context; reasons for this are noted in Section 1.",
        "Our approach can be thought of as a generalization of the compositional mechanism of Cooper storage [6], or of its computational analogue developed by Woods [30].",
        "Alternative approaches that attempt to address these interactions include discourse-representation theory (DRT) [14,18] and Barwise's partial-valuation approach [2].",
        "In DRT, the interpretation of a sentence is derived in a compositional manner from an intermediate representation called a discourse-representation structure (DRS).",
        "However, the rules that have been developed for constructing DRSs are not themselves compositional.",
        "According to the DRS-construction rules presented by Kamp [18], the DRS for a phrase is found only as a by-product of finding the DRS for the embedding discourse.",
        "In particular, DRS-construction rules apply only after the relative scope of noun phrases and anaphoric bindings have been determined.",
        "It is conceivable that our notion of conditional interpretation might be reexpressible in DRT terms, leading to a compositional system for DRS construction.",
        "Barwise [2] uses the notion of partial valuation, that is, partial assignments of values to variables, to analyze the sorts of interactions exemplified by the donkey sentences.",
        "Similar comments apply to Webber's work [29].",
        "In addition, none of the aforementioned accounts has been concerned with as wide a range of phenomena as is currently handled in Candide.12 One of the motivations for our work has been to see how Barwise's direct-interpretation approach could be turned into a two-stage one in which phrases are first \"compiled\" into conditional interpretations, which are then \"executed\" by applying pragmatic-discharge rules.",
        "Finally, several other computational systems developed recently are concerned with interactions between context and meaning, especially Pundit [8,21] and Tacitus [17,16].",
        "Both these systems have emphasized solutions to such difficult pragmatic problems as reference resolution.",
        "In particular, the Pundit project has made notable progress on the question of resolving missing arguments, while the Tacitus group has done the same for questions involving the determination of implicit relations.",
        "In Candide, solutions to such pragmatic problems should be encoded in the procedures that discharge assumptions; in future versions of the system the discharge procedures might be improved applying some of the techniques developed in this other work.",
        "What neither Pundit nor Tacitus has been concerned with is the question of how to build interpretations composition-I2To date, we have included capabilites for processing reference and coreference (definite and indefinite noun phrases, pronouns, possessives, and proper nouns), quantifier scope, compound nominals, prepositional-phrase attachment, and certain types of underspecified relations (e.g., main-verb \"have\").",

        "Both systems first build partial interpretations of sentences, and then attempt to solve a collection of associated pragmatic problems.",
        "Pundit does the latter in an overly constrained way, with the result that it cannot handle systematically the sort of interactions exemplified by the donkey sentences.",
        "Tacitus, on the other hand, casts all the pragmatic problems as theorems to be proved; the result is an underconstrained control strategy.",
        "We believe that the generally compositional approach developed in Candide enables us to avoid both these extremes."

        "We have developed a mechanism of semantic and pragmatic interpretation that relaxes the constraints of compositional semantics just - enough to allow pragmatic information to play its necessary role in the derivation of sentence interpretations.",
        "Central to the mechanism are conditional interpetations, which allow us to separate constraints on interpretation that depend only on syntactic structure, represented by the sense component of the conditional interpretation, from those that depend on pragmatic choices, represented by the assumption component.",
        "The interpretation process is carried out by a combination of semantic-interpretation rules, which build conditional interpretations of phrases on the basis of lexical and syntactic information, and pragmatic-discharge rules, which satisfy assumptions on the basis of discourse and domain information.",
        "While the system we have implemented deals with a variety of semantic and pragmatic phenomena, of which only a few were discussed in this paper, it can only be seen as a first limited instantiation of a system architecure that requires much further work.",
        "We shall mention now a few of the directions that might be pursued in developing the architecture further.",
        "At the most theoretical level, it is interesting to note the formal similarity of our interpretation rules to rules in \"deductive\" models of programming language semantics [25].",
        "It is also interesting to consider the connection between conditional interpretations and the relational theory of meaning from situation semantics [3].",
        "These two similarities might be fruitful in developing a semantic justification for our formal interpretation rules in terms of constraints on interpretation relations.",
        "The applicability of discharge rules depends in many cases on the compatibility of expected and supplied sorts for relation arguments.",
        "In general, these sorts may be parameterized by assumption parameters, and some semantic interpretation problems not considered here suggest that higher-order parameterized types, instead of first-order sorts, may be needed.",
        "A suitable notion of type subsumption for such higher-order parameterized types [15] would be useful.",
        "More generally, the whole architecture would benefit from a semantically grounded treatment of parameters and parameterized objects.",
        "Other pragmatic processes associated with discharge rules, such as those for reference resolution, also must be able to reason with parameterized objects – for example in checking the uniqueness of a dependent object relative to arbitrary parameter assignments.",
        "Ultimately, the proper treatment of singular noun phrases in context will require a closer connection between assumptions and [parameterized] fragments of the discourse context."
