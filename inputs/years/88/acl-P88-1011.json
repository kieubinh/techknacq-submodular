        "At the other end of language processing, logic is a well-known tool for expressing the pragmatic information needed for plan recognition and speech act recognition [2-4].",
        "In between these extremes logic appears much less.",
        "There has been some movement in the direction of placing semantic interpretation on a more logical footing [5,6], but it is nothing like what has happened at the extremes of the language understanding process.",
        "To some degree this is understandable.",
        "These \"middle\" parts, such as word-sense disambiguation, noun phrase reference, case disambiguation, etc.",
        "are notoriously difficult, and poorly understood, at least compared to things like syntax, and the construction of intermediate logical form.",
        "Much of the reason these areas are This work has been supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grants 1ST 8416034 and 1ST 8515005 and Office of Naval Research under grant N00014-79-C-0529.",

        "The correct sense of a word depends on context, as does pronoun resolution, etc.",
        "Here we rectify this situation by presenting an axiomatization of fragment of semantic interpretation, notably including many aspects previously excluded: word-sense disambiguation, noun-phrase reference determination, case determination, and syntactic disambiguation.",
        "Furthermore we describe an inference engine, Frail3, which can use the logical formulation to carry out semantic interpretation.",
        "The description of Frail3 is brief, since the present paper is primarily concerned with semantic interpretation.",
        "For a more detailed description, see [7].",
        "The work closest to what we present is that by Hobbs [5]; however, he handles only noun-phrase reference from the above list, and he does not consider intersentential influences at all.",
        "Our system, Wimp2 (which uses Frail3), is quite pretty in two respects.",
        "First, it integrates semantic and pragmatic processing into a uniform whole, all done in the logic.",
        "Secondly, it provides an elegant and concise way to specify exactly what has to be done by a semantic interpreter.",
