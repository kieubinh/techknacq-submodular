        "Objective sentences present the story directly, rather than through the thoughts or perceptions of a character.",
        "The language used to convey thoughts and perceptions is replete with linguistic elements that make no sense unless they are interpreted with respect to the thinking or perceiving character's consciousness.",
        "Banfield calls them subjective elements; they appear only in subjective sentences and cannot appear within objective sentences.",
        "&Infield identifies perspective in narrative with subjectivity, which is expressible via subjective elements.",

        "recognizing the current perspective is, therefore, to recognize subjective sentences and the subjective characters to whom they are attributed.",
        "However, we cannot take a sentence-by-sentence approach, deciding independently for each sentence whether it is objective or subjective, and, if subjective, who the subjective character is.",
        "First, although thoughts and perceptions are often reported (as by sentences beginning with \"He thought that ... \" or \"She saw .",
        "\"), and thoughts are often accompanied by narrative parentheticals (such as \"he thought\" or \"he realized\"), many thoughts and perceptions are not marked in these ways.",
        "Second, subjective sentences do not always explicitly indicate who the subjective character is.",
        "For example: (1) 11He wanted to talk to Dermys.",
        "11How were they going to be able to get home from this strange desert land into which they had been cast and which was heaven knew where in all the countless solar systems in all the countless galaxies?",
        "[L'Engle, Many Waters, p.91] (2) 1But what [Muhammad] had seen in those few moments made him catch his breath in amazement.",
        "220n the floor of the cave, which curved back in a natural fault in the rock, there were several large cylindrical objects standing in a row.",
        "[John Allegro, The Dead Sea Scrolls] Sentence (1.2) is a represented thought, and (2.2) is a represented perception, presenting what the character sees as he sees it; yet neither is explicitly marked as such.",
        "Also, neither indicates who the subjective character is.",
        "Finally, although a subjective element marks a sentence as subjective (cf.",
        "Section 42), not all subjective sentences contain subjective elements, and subjective elements do not in general indicate who the subjective character is.",
        "However, subjective sentences that are not marked as such, or that do not indicate who the subjective character is, usually appear in the midst of other subjective sentences attributed to the same subjective character.",
        "That is, once a clearly marked subjective sentence appears for which the subjective character can be determined, unmarked subjective sentences attributed to the same subjective character often follow.",
        "Thus, to recognize subjective sentences in general, we need to consider subjectivity at the level of the discourse.",
        "For this reason, we extend the notions of subjective and objective sentences to the notions of subjective and objective contexts, which consist of one or more subjective sentences attributed to the same subjective character, or one or more objective sentences, respectively.",
        "Our algorithm for recognizing the current perspective is a discourse process that looks for the boundaries of subjective contexts.",
        "During narrative understanding, it maintains a stack, called the current perspective (CP).",
        "At the beginning of a narrative, the CP is initialized to be the reader.",
        "When a new subjective context is recognized, its",
        "subjective character is pushed onto the CP.",
        "When the end of a subjective context is recognized, a character is popped from the CP.",
        "More precisely, since SNePS (Shapiro 1979), our knowledge representation system, is fully intensional, only the reader's concepts of the characters are represented (Maida and Shapiro 1982, Shapiro and Rapaport 1987).",
        "So, it is actually the reader's concepts of the characters that are pushed onto the CP.",
        "4.",
        "RECOGNIZING SUBJECTIVE CONTEXTS.",
        "To recognize subjective contexts, our discourse process relies exclusively on linguistic signals of subjective contexts.",
        "In this, it is incomplete: If a subjective context appears in which these linguistic signals are not present, then the subjective context is not recognized.",
        "4.1.",
        "Psychological Verbs, Actions, Adjectives, and Perceptual Verbs.",
        "Reports involving psychological verbs (e.g., 'think', 'wonder', 'realize', 'want', 'remember') or .perceptual verbs (e.g., 'see', 'hear') signal that a subjective context will follow.",
        "So do predicate-adjective sentences with psychological adjectives (e.g., 'delighted', 'happy', 'jealous', 'scared') (cf. &Infield (1982), Cohn (1978), Doleiel (1973)).",
        "In addition, we have identified what we call psychological actions – e.g., \"he smiled to himself\", \"she gasped\", \"she winced\" – which function in the same way as psychological verbs.",
        "A sentence of one of these types is a typical way of establishing a subjective context.",
        "Examples (1) and (2), above, and (3), below, exhibit this pattern: (3) 'She [Hannah] winced as she heard them crash to the platform.",
        "\"The lovely little mirror that she had brought for Ellen, and the gifts for the baby!",
        "[Fran-chere, Hannah HerseV, p. 3] In each example, the first sentence is a psychological or perceptual report, and the second is a represented thought or represented perception, respectively; the subjective character of the second sentence is taken to be the subject of the first.",
        "In our discourse process, the subject of a perceptual or psychological report, or of a predicate-adjective sentence with a psychological adjective, is pushed onto the CP if a character isn't already on the top of it.",
        "If a character is already on the top of the CP, then no change is made, and the sentence is understood to be part of the already established subjective context.",
        "4.2.",
        "Subjective Elements.",
        "Many subjective elements mark a sentence in third-person narrative as subjective because they are expressive in nature.",
        "Some that Banfield identifies are exclamations, which express emotion; questions, which express wonder, epithets, such as 'the bastard', which express some qualification of the referent; and certain kinship terms, e.g., 'Daddy', 'Mom', and 'Aunt Margaret', which express a relationship to the referent She also identifies evaluative adjectives, which express an attitude toward the referent, e.g., 'ghastly', 'surprising', 'poor', and 'damned', although some evaluative adjectives, such as 'poor' and 'damned', have their evaluative meanings only when they occur in certain parts of the sentence.",
        "Intensifiers such as 'too', 'quite', and `so' are also evaluative (Banfield 1982), as in:",
        "(4) He could tell they were tears because his eyes were too shiny.",
        "Too round.",
        "[Bridgers, AU Together Now, p. 92] So are emphasizers, such as 'really' and 'just'.",
        "An example is 'really' in (5.3): (5) \"Jody managed a frail smile.",
        "52She was a little bit",
        "ashamed.",
        "siShe should really try to be more cheerful for Aunt Margaret's sake.",

        "[Gage, Miss Osborne-the-Mop, pp.",
        "16- 17] Modal verbs of obligation, possibility, and necessity are also expressive.",
        "For example, 'should', in (53), is a modal verb of obligation.",
        "So are many content (or attitudinal) disjuncts, which comment on the content of the utterance (Quirk et al.",
        "1985).",
        "For example, 'likely'.",
        "'maybe', 'probably', and 'perhaps' express some degree of doubt:",
        "(6) Something jingled – car keys probably.",
        "[Oneal, War Work, p. 132]",
        "Conjuncts, which comment on the connection between items (Quirk et al.",
        "1985), can also be expressive.",
        "For example, 'anyhow', 'anyway', 'still', and 'after all' express concession (Quirk et aL 1985).",
        "An example is 'After all' in (5.4).",
        "Other subjective elements are sentence fragments (Banfield 1982), such as (7.2), (7) \"His brain worked slowly through what he knew about this person.",
        "\"David's kid.",
        "[Bridgers, All Together Now, p. 91] and the uses of 'this', 'that', 'these', and 'those' that Robin Lakoff (1974) has identified as emotional deixis.",
        "In conversation, they are \"generally linked to the speaker's emotional involvement in the subject-matter of his utterance\" (Lakoff 1974: 347); in third-person narrative, they are linked to the subjective character's emotional involvement in the subject matter of his thoughts or perceptions.",
        "Examples are 'this' in (8.1) and \"That' in (9.2):",
        "(8) \"Ibrahim could remember every time this godless pig had patronized him... [Clancy, Red Dawn Rising, p. 13]",
        "(9) \"As she watched, a wave of jealousy spread through her.",
        "\"That insufferable stranger who had passed them on the road was receiving the welcome that she had been dreaming of all the way from Connecticut.",
        "[Franchere, Hannah Herself, p. 15] In speech, the emotion, evaluation, etc., expressed by a subjective element is always attributed to the speaker in third-person narrative, it is attributed to a character.' Clearly, many types of language-understanding abilities are needed to understand the range of subjective elements.",
        "Our purpose here is to show how our discourse process uses them as markers of subjective contexts, and how it determines the subjective character whose thoughts or perceptions they mark.",
        "However, recognizing the subjective character is always required before a subjective element can be understood.",
        "When a subjective element is encountered in the narrative, our discourse process updates the CP according to the following algorithm: (Al) If there is currently a character on the CP.",
        "'then do not change the CP else if there is an actor focus at the start of the current sentence who is a character in the scene 2then push him or her onto the CP 3else create a new and indeterminate concept and push it onto the CP.",

        "Discussion of branch 1.",
        "Branch 1 is taken when a subjective element continues the current subjective context.",
        "For example, the exclamation in (3.2), which is a subjective element, continues the subjective context established by (3.1).",
        "The subjective elements 'should' and 'really' in (5.3) and 'After all', 'Aunt Margaret', 'that', and 'ghastly' in (5.4) continue the subjective context established in (5.1).",

        "It is whoever is the agent of the current sentence.",
        "(Note that quoted speech has its own foci, which must be maintained separately.",
        "In this sense, quoted speech constitutes a separate discourse segment (cf. Grosz and Sidner (1986).)",
        "Consider the following example: (10) \"11 In the kitchen she [Jody] set the basket down on the table.",
        "1°2She put the thermos and the cups in the sink and filled them with cool water to soak.",
        "1°3 Then In sane third-person novels, particularly in the 19th century, an overt narrator (Chum= 1978) uses subjective elements.",

        "Sidner (1983) has shown that, in anaphora comprehension, the current actor or discourse focus can be rejected as the co-specifier of an anaphor on the basis of pragmatic factors.",
        "Similarly, the actor focus may be rejected as the subjective character to whom the subjective element is attributed, in favor of another character in the scene.",
        "The pragmatic factors involved appear to be which characters have been subjective characters in the past and whose thoughts or perceptions the sentence containing the subjective element is likely to be reflecting.",
        "Consider the following example, in which Adnarel, a seraph, has just appeared before Lemech and Sandy: (11) 11.1Lemech greeted him [Adnarel] respectfully.",

        "[L'Engle, Many Waters, p. 39] Lemech is the actor focus of (11.1) and (112).",
        "However, it would be clear to someone who had read the novel up to this point that (11.3) is Sandy's thought.",
        "First, Sandy is a visitor to a strange world, of which Lemech is an inhabitant; so it is Sandy, not Lemech, who is likely not to have lmown what a seraph is.",
        "Second, prior to this passage, subjective contexts have been attributed to Sandy, but not to Lemech.",

        "When the reader finally identifies the subjective character, the information that this character and the indeterminate one are co-extensional is built (that is, it is asserted that they are concepts of the same individual; cf. Maida and Shapiro (1982), Shapiro and Rapaport (1987)).",
        "Naicong Li (1986) uses this approach in her pronoun resolution algorithm if the information needed to resolve a pronoun is supplied after the pronoun is encountered.",
        "Often, the subjective character is identified by a narrative parenthetical, as in the following example:",
        "(12) 'What was holding Washington up?",
        "the colonel asked himself.",

        "'David's boy' in (15a.4) reflects Dwayne's mistaken belief about Casey, and branch 2 of algorithm (A2) is taken in order to understand it.",
        "To illustrate that information in subjective contexts is attributed to the subjective character, suppose that (15a.4) were \"This was David's girl\"; in that case, the reader would have to infer that Dwayne had somehow found out that Casey is a girl.",
        "6.1.5.",
        "Further discussion of algorithm (A2).",
        "Note that if a reference is a subjective element, such as 'the bastard', it may be a non-classificatory noun (Banfield 1982); that is, it cannot be understood entirely propositionally, since it expresses subjectivity.",
        "How it should be understood depends on the particular subjective element.",
        "Thus, specific algorithms for nouns that are subjective elements must supersede algorithm (A2).",
        "As mentioned above, algorithm (A2) is unable to understand anaphoric references.",
        "However, anaphor comprehension can be affected by perspective.",
        "Consider the following passage: (16) 16.1 The man had turned.",
        "He started to walk away quickly in the direction of the public library.",
        "16.3\"0.1C.,\" said Joe, \"get Rosie.\" i6.4 crept back to the blanket.",
        "'She felt hollow in her stomach.",
        "miShe'd never really expected to see the Enemy again.",
        "[Onea], War Work, p. 64] In (16.6), 'the Enemy' is an anaphoric reference that occurs in a subjective context (established by (16.5).",
        "which is a psychological report); it co-specifies 'the man' in (16.1) and 'He' in (16.2).",
        "It reflects Zoe's belief that the man is an enemy spy, although it is not at all clear to the reader, at this point, that he is.",
        "Personal pronouns can also reflect the beliefs of a character.",
        "The following passage is a continuation of passage (15) (italics ours):",
        "(17) He [Dwayne] wasn't sure of what.",
        "What in the",
        "arcade could scare a boy like that?",
        "He rubbed his head under his baseball cap.",
        "He could see tears in Casey's eyes.",
        "He could tell they were tears because his eyes were too shiny.",
        "Too round.",
        "Well, it was all right to cry.",
        "He'd cried when they took him to that place a few years back.",
        "Now Casey was in a new place, too, feeling maybe the same as him.",
        "If he just knew what to do about it.",
        "\"Let's don't play that game anymore,\" he said.",
        "\"I don't like that one.\" Casey wiped her face on her sleeve .. .",
        "[Bridgers, All Together Now, p. 92] Both italicized pronouns refer to Casey; the first occurs in a subjective context attributed to Dwayne, and the second occurs after the subjective context has ended (in this passage, the subjective context is ended by direct speech).",
        "6.2.",
        "Assertive Indefinite Pronouns.",
        "Assertive indefinite pronouns – e.g., 'someone', 'something', 'somebody' – are specific, though unspecified (Quirk et al.",
        "1985); that is, they generally refer to particular people, things, etc., without identifying them.",
        "When referring to a particular referent, a speaker typically uses an assertive indefinite pronoun if (1) she doesn't know the identity of the referent, (2) she doesn't want the addressee to know the identity of the referent, or (3) she doesn't believe that the identity of the referent is relevant to the conversation.",
        "A character's thoughts and perceptions are not directed toward an addressee, and so the first of these uses is the predominant one in subjective contexts.",
        "Used in this way, they express a lack of knowledge, and so are subjective elements.",
        "When one of them appears in a subjective context, the reader understands that the subjective character does not know who or what the referent is.",
        "Often, the pronoun is the only source of this information.",
        "Consider the following example:",
        "(18) 'Suddenly she ['Zoe] gasped.",
        "111.2She had touched somebody!",
        "[Oneal, War Work, p. 129]",
        "There is no explicit statement in the novel that Zoe does not know whom she touched; this has to be inferred from the use of 'somebody'.",
        "Sentences (6) and (15.5) provide further examples.",
        "63.",
        "Indefinite References.",
        "In conversation, definite references are used only if the speaker believes that the addressee has enough information to interpret them.",
        "As mentioned above, thoughts and perceptions are not directed toward an addressee, and so the use of definite references in subjective contexts is not subject to this constraint; as illustrated by (32), they are used to refer to referents familiar to the subjective character, whether or not the reader has been told about them before.",
        "So, when a specific indefinite reference appears in a subjective context, the reader understands that the referent is unfamiliar to the subjective character; otherwise, a definite reference would have appeared (Filhnore 1974).",
        "However, the referent may not be unknown to the reader or to the other characters.",
        "For example, (19) There they [the King and his men] saw close beside them a great rubbleheap; and suddenly they were aware of two small figures lying on it at their ease, grey-clad, hardly to be seen among the stones.",
        "[Tolkien.",
        "The Two Towers, p. 206] The reader knows that the King and his men have come upon two hobbits, Merry and Pippin.",
        "The King and his men do not know the hobbits, but other characters also present in the scene do know them.",
        "When the King and his men are on the top of the CP (after 'saw' and continued by 'were aware of'), the hobbits are not referred to by name, but as 'two small figures'.",
        "Branch 1 of algorithm (A2) creates new referents and, in the belief space of the King and his men.",
        "builds propositions that they are small figures.",
        "The new referents can be asserted to be co-extensional with the concepts who the reader and other characters believe are named 'Merry' and 'Pippin'.",
        "Indefinite references can sometimes indicate that the subjective character doesn't even know what the referent is.",
        "This occurs when the head noun is a superordinate, rather than a basic-level, term (Roach and Lloyd 1978).",
        "The basic level is the preferred level at which people identify things.",
        "If a superordinate, rather than a basic-level, term appears in an indefinite reference in a subjective context, the reader understands that the subjective character can't even identify the referent at the basic level.",
        "In example (19), the hobbits are referred to as 'two small figures', because the King and his men have never seen hobbits before.",
        "Here is an example that is not from a fantasy novel: (20) Slowly Hannah raised her head and blinked her eyes.",
        "Small dots of purple covered the ground around her and she reached out to explore.",
        "Violets!",
        "[Franchere, Hannah HerseY, p. 25] When she first sees the violets, Hannah can only identify them as 'small dots of purple'.",
        "Another occurs in (2.2): The fact that the reference 'several large cylindrical objects' includes the superordinate term 'objects' indicates that Muhammad doesn't know what the referents are.",
        "Another example is (21): (21) He felt firm restraints of some sort holding him in place.",
        "[Wu.",
        "Cyborg, p. 141] Peters and Shapiro (1987ab) describe a SNePS representation for natural category systems in which superordinate categories can be distinguished from basic-level and subordinate categories.",
        "After an indefinite reference with a superordinate term in a subjective context has been parsed, the fact that the subjective character was able to identify the referent only at a superordinate level is represented in the knowledge base by using their representation.",

        "CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH.",
        "Many problems remain to be solved.",
        "Our discourse process cannot recognize subjective contexts that are not established by the linguistic signals it relies on, and general principles are needed to explain how readers recognize the ending boundaries of subjective contexts.",
        "We are investigating how tense, deictic terms (cf. Bruder et al.",
        "(1986), &infield (1982)), the characters' goals (cf. Wilensky (1983)), and the argument structure (cf. Cohen (1987)) often exhibited by thoughts might be used to recognize the boundaries of subjective contexts.",
        "Branches 2 and 3 of algorithm (Al) need to be expanded to determine who the subjective character is if the actor focus isn't a reasonable candidate and no parenthetical appears.",
        "We are investigating how focus of attention (cf. Grosz (1981), Sidney (1983)) can be incorporated into algorithm (A2) in such a way that anaphoric references reflecting the beliefs of a character can be understood.",
        "Finally, there is the general problem of revision.",
        "Our algorithms assume that signals occur at the beginning of subjective contexts.",
        "However, there are cases when a subjective context cannot be recognized until some of it has already been parsed.",
        "A difficult case is illustrated by the following: \"Jody was rich and famous.",
        "°Why wasn't she happy?",
        "Bill wondered.\" Only after reading (C2) can the reader recognize that (Cl) is a represented thought.",
        "We have argued that a discourse-level approach must be taken to the problem of recognizing character's thoughts and perceptions in third-person narrative.",
        "Our discourse process, which is implemented in an ATN grammar interfaced to SNePS, recognizes subjective contexts that are linguistically signaled in ways frequently employed in naturally-occurring narratives.",
        "By using the results of the discourse process to determine the belief context needed to understand references, our reference algorithm demonstrates how perspective affects reference in third-person narrative.",
