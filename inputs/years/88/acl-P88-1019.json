        "We have been developing an English-Japanese bidirectional machine translation system implemented on a workstation (Amano 1986, Arnano et a/.",
        "1987).",
        "The system, which is interactive and designed for use by a translator, normally runs in an interactive mode, and includes a number of special bilingual editing functions.",
        "We recently realized a real-time on-line communication system with an automatic translation function by combining a non-interactive version of our Machine Translation system with the keyboard conversation function just like talk in UNIX\".",
        "Using this system, bilingual conversations were held between members of our laboratory in Japan and visitors to the 5th World Telecommunications Exhibition Telecom 87, organized by the International Telecommunication Union, held in Geneva from 20th to 27th October 1987.",
        "In the first part of this paper, we discuss in detail the configuration of this system, and give some indications of its performance.",
        "In the second part, we report informally on what for us was an interesting aspect of the experiment, namely the nature of the dialogues held using the system.",
        "In *the Centre for Computational Linguistics, University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, England **UNIX is a trademark of AT&T Bell Laboratories.",
        "particular we were struck by the amount of meta-dialogue, i.e. dialogue discussing the previous interchanges: since contributions to the conversation were being translated, this metadialogue posed certain problems which we think are of general interest.",
        "In future systems of a similar nature, we feel there is a need for users to be briefly trained in certain conventions regarding metadialogue, and typical system translation errors.",
        "Furthermore, an environment which minimizes such errors is desirable and the system must be 'tuned' to make translations appropriate to conversation."

        "Running UNIX, they support the Toshiba Machine Translation system AS-TRANSAC.",
        "On this occasion, the Machine Translation capability was installed only at the Japanese end, though in practice both terminals could run AS-TRANSAC.",
        "The workstation screens are divided into three windows, as shown in Figure 2, not unlike in the normal version of UNIX's talk.",
        "The top window shows the user's dialogue, the middle window the correspondent's replies.",
        "The important difference is that both sides of the dialogue are displayed in the language appropriate to the location of the terminal.",
        "However, in a third small window, a workspace at the bottom of the screen, the raw input is also displayed.",

        "Once the connection has been established, conversation proceeds as in UNIX's talk.",
        "An important feature of the function is that conversers do not have to take turns or wait for each other to fmish typing before replying, unlike with write.",
        "This has a significant effect on conversational strategy, and occasionally leads to disjointed conversations, both in monolingual and bilingual dialogues.",
        "For example, a user might start to reply to a message the content of which can be predicted after the first few words are typed in; or one user might start to change the topic of conversation while the other is still typing a reply.",
        "Transmission of input via the satellite was generally fast enough not to be a problem: the real bottleneck was the physical act of input.",
        "Novice users do not attain high speed or accuracy, a problem exacerbated at the Swiss end by a slow screen echo.",
        "But the problem is even greater for Japanese input: users typed either in romaji (i.e. using a standard transcription into the Roman alphabet) or in hiragana (i.e. using Japanese-syllable values for the keys).",
        "In either case, conversion into kanji (Chinese characters) is necessary (see Kawada et al.",
        "1979 and Mori et al.",
        "1983 on kana-to-kanji conversion); and this conversion is needed for between a third and a half of the input, on average (cf. Hayashi 1982:211).",
        "Because of the large number",
        "of homophones in Japanese, this can slow down the speed of input considerably.",
        "For example, even for professional typists, an input speed of 100 characters (including conversions) per minute is considered reasonable (compare expected speeds of up to 100 words/minute for English typing).",
        "It is of interest to note that this kana-tokanji conversion, which is accepted as a normal part of Japanese word-processor usage, is in fact a natural form of pre-editing, given that it serves as a partial disambiguation of the input.",
        "On the other hand, slow typing speeds are also encountered for English input, one side-effect of which is the use of abbreviations and shorthand.",
        "In fact, we did not encounter this phenomenon in Geneva, though in practice sessions (with native English speakers) in Japan, this had been quite common.",
        "Examples included contractions (e.g. pis for plea se,.0 for you, cn for can), omissions of apostrophes (e.g. cant, wont, dont) and non-capitalization (e.g. i, t okyo, j a 1).",
        "The translation time itself did not cause significant delays compared to the input time, thanks to a very fast parsing algorithm, which is described elsewhere (Nogami et al.",
        "1988).",
        "Input sentences were typically rather short (English five to ten words, Japanese around 20 characters), and translation was generally about 0.7 seconds per word (5000 words/hour).",
        "Given users' typing speed and the knowledge that the dialogue was being transmitted half way around the world, what would, under other circumstances, be an unacceptably long delay of about 15 seconds (for translation and transmission) was generally quite tolerable, because users could observe in the third window that the correspondent was inputting something, even if it could not read."

        "This environment was a good practical test of our Machine Translation system, given that many of the users had little or no knowledge of the target language: the effectiveness of the translation could be judged by the extent to which communication was possible.",
        "Having said this, it should also be remarked that the Japanese-English half of the bilingual translation system is still in the experimental stage and so translations in this direction were not always of a quality comparable to those in the other direction.",
        "To offset this, the users at the Japanese end, who were mainly researchers at our laboratory and therefore familiar with some of the problems of Machine Translation, generally tried to avoid using difficult constructions, and tried to 'assist' the system in some other ways, notably by including subject and object pronouns which might otherwise have been omitted in more natural language.",
        "We recognized that the translation of certain phrases in the context of a dialogue might be different from their translation under normal circumstances.",
