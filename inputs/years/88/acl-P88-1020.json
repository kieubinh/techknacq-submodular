        "The heart of the problem is obviously coherence.",
        "Coherent text can be defined as text in which the hearer knows how each part of the text relates to the whole; i.e., (a) the hearer knows why it is said, and (b) the hearer can relate the semantics of each part to a single overarching framework.",
        "In 1978, Hobbs ((Hobbs 78, 79, 82]) recognized that in coherent text successive pieces of text are related in a specified set of ways.",
        "He produced a set of relations organized into four categories, which he postulated as the four types of phenomena that occur during conversation.",
        "His argument, unfortunately, contains a number of shortcomings; not only is the categorization not well-motivated, but the list of relations is incomplete.",
        "In her thesis work, McKeown took a different approach ((McKeown 821).",
        "She defined a set of relatively static schemas that represent the structure of stereotypical paragraphs for describing objects.",
        "In essence, these schemas are paragraph templates; coherence is enforced by the correct nesting and filling-in of templates.",
        "No explicit theory of coherence was offered.",
        "Mann and Thompson, alter a wide-ranging study involving hundreds of paragraphs, proposed that a set of 20 relations suffice to represent the relations that hold within the texts that normally occur in English ([Mann di Thompson 87, 86, 83]).",
        "These relations, called RST (rhetorical structure theory), are used recursively; the assumption (never explicitly stated) is that a paragraph is only coherent if all its parts can eventually be made to fit into one overarching relation.",
        "The enterprise was completely descriptive; no formal definition of the relations or justification for their completeness were given.",
        "However, the relations do include most of Hobbs's relations and support McKeown's schemas.",
        "A number of similar descriptions exist.",
        "The description of how parts of purposive text can relate goes back at least to Aristotle ([Aristotle 54]).",

        "As defined by Mann and Thompson, RST relations hold between two successive pieces of text (at the lowest level, between two clauses; at the highest level, between two parts that make up a paragraph)' .",
        "Therefore, each relation has two parts, a nucleus and a satellite.",
        "To determine the applicability of the relation, each part has a set of constraints on the entities that can be related.",
        "Relations may also have requirements on the combination of the two parts.",
        "In addition, each relation has an effect field, which is intended to denote the conditions which the speaker is attempting to achieve.",
        "In formalizing these relations and using them generatively to plan paragraphs, rather than analytically to describe paragraph structure, a shift of focus is required.",
        "Relations must be seen as plans – the operators that guide the search through the permutation space.",
        "The nucleus and satellite constraints become requirements that must be met by any piece of text before it can be used in the relation (i.e., before it can be coherently juxtaposed with the preceding text).",
        "The effect field contains a description of the intended effect of the relation (i.e., the goal that the plan achieves, if properly executed).",
        "Since the goals in generation are communicative, the intended effect must be seen as the inferences that the speaker is licensed to make about the hearer's knowledge after the successful completion of the relation.",
        "Since the relations are used as plans, and since their satellite and nucleus constraints must be reformulated as subgoals to the structurer, these constraints are best represented in terms of the communicative intent of the speaker.",
        "That is, they are best represented in terms of what the hearer will know – i.e., what inferences the hearer would run – upon being told the nucleus or satellite filler.",
        "As it turns out, suitable terms for this purpose are provided by the formal theory of rational interaction currently being developed by, among others, Cohen, Levesque, and Perrault.",
        "For example, in (Cohen & Levesque 851, Cohen and Levesque present a proof that the indirect speech act of requesting can be derived from the following basic modal operators",
        "• (BEL x p) – p follows from x's beliefs",
        "'This is not strictly true; a small number of relations, such as Sequence, relate more than two pieces of text.",

        "They then define summaries as, essentially, speech act operators with activating conditions (gates) and effects.",
        "These summaries closely resemble, in structure, the RST plans described here, with gates corresponding to satellite and nucleus constraints and effects to intended effects."
