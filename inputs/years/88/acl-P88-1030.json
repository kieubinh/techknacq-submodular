        "This paper reports on several deductive parsers for a fragment of Chomsky's Government and Binding theory (Chomsky 1981, 1986; Van Riemsdijk and Williams 1984).",
        "These parsers were constructed to illustrate the Parsing as Deduction' approach, which views a parser as a specialized theorem-prover which uses knowledge of a language (i.e. its grammar) as a set of axioms from which information about the utterances of that language (e.g. their structural descriptions) can be deduced.",
        "This approach directly inspired by the seminal paper by Pereira and Warren (1983).",
        "Johnson (1988a) motivates the Parsing as Deduction approach in more detail than is possible here, and Johnson (1988b) extends the techniques presented in this paper to deal with a more complex fragment.",
        "regarding this work, although all responsibility for errors remains my own.",
        "The research reported here was supported by a grant by the Systems Development Foundation to the Center for the Study of Language and Information at Stanford University and a Postdoctoral Fellowship awarded by the Fairchild Foundation through the Brain and Cognitive Sciences Department at MIT.",
        "In this paper I describe a sequence of model deductive parsers, called PAD1 - PAD5, for a fragment of GB theory.",
        "These parsers are not designed for practical application, but simply to show that GB deductive parsers can actually be built.",
        "These parsers take PF representations as their input and produce LF representations as their output.",
        "They differ from most extant GB parsers in that they make explicit use of the four levels of representation that GB attributes to an utterance - namely D-structure, S-structure, PF and LF - and the transformational relationship that holds between them.",
        "A 'grammar' for these parsers consists entirely of a set of parameter values that parameterize the principles of GB theory - thus the parsers described here can be regarded as 'principlebased' (Berwick 1987) - and the parsers' top-level internal structure transparently reflects (some of) the principles of that theory; X' and O theory apply at D-structure, Case theory applies at S-structure, Move-a is stated as a relation between D and S-structure, and LF-movement relates S-structure and LF.",
        "In particular, the constraints on S-structures that result from the interaction of Move-a with principles constraining D-structure (i.e. X' and O theories) are used constructively throughout the parsing process.",
        "The PAD parsers are designed to directly mirror the deductive structure of GB theory.",
        "Intuitively, it seems that deductive parsers should be able to mirror theories with a rich internal deductive structure; these parsers show that to a first approximation this is in fact the case.",
        "For example, the PAD parsers have no direct specification of a 'rule' of Passive, rather they deduce the relevant properties of the Passive construction from the interaction of 8 theory, Move-a, and Case theory.",
        "It must be stressed that the PAD parsers are only 'model' parsers.",
        "The fragment of English they accept could only be called 'restricted'.",
        "They have no account of WH-movement, and Move-a is restricted to apply to lexical categories, for example, and they incorporate none of the principles of Bounding Theory.",
        "However, the techniques used to construct these parsers are general, and they should extend to a more substantial fragment."
