        "We show how idioms can be parsed in lexical-ized TAGs.",
        "We rely on extensive studies of frozen phrases pursued at L.A.D.L.1 that show that idioms are pervasive in natural language and obey, generally speaking, the same morphological and syntactical patterns as 'free' structures.",
        "By idiom we mean a structure in which some items are lexically frozen and have a semantics that is not compositional.",
        "We thus consider idioms of different syntactic categories : NP, S, adverbials, compound prepositions... in both English and French.",
        "In lexicalized TAGs, the same grammar is used for idioms as for 'free' sentences.",
        "We assign them regular syntactic structures while representing them semantically as one non-compositional entry.",
        "Syntactic transformations and insertion of modifiers may thus apply to them as to any 'free' structures.",
        "Unlike previous approaches, their variability becomes the general case and their being totally frozen the exception.",
        "Idioms are generally represented by extended elementary trees with `heads' made out of several items (that need not be contiguous) with one of the items serving as an index.",
        "When an idiomatic tree is selected by this index, lexical items are attached to some nodes in the tree.",
        "Idiomatic trees are selected by a single head node however the head value imposes lexical values on other nodes in the tree.",
        "This operation of attaching the head item of an idiom and its lexical parts is called lexical attachment.",
        "The resulting tree has the lexical items corresponding to the pieces of the idiom already attached to it.",
        "We generalize the parsing strategy defined for lexicalized TAG to the case of 'heads' made out of several items.",
        "We propose to parse idioms in two steps which are merged in the two steps parsing strategy that is defined for 'free' sentences.",
        "The first step performed during the lexical pass selects trees corresponding to the literal and idiomatic interpretation.",
        "However it is not always the case that the idiomatic trees are selected as possible candidates.",
        "We require that all basic pieces building the minimal idiomatic expression must be present in the input string (with possibly some order constraints).",
        "This condition is a necessary condition for the idiomatic reading but of course it is not sufficient.",
        "The second step performs the syntax analysis as in the usual case.",
        "During the second step, idiomatic reading might be rejected.",
        "Idioms are thus parsed as any 'free' sentences.",
        "Except during the selection process, idioms do not require any special parsing mechanism.",
        "We are also able to account for cases of ambiguity between idiomatic and literal interpretations.",
        "Factoring recursion from dependencies in TAGs allows discontinuous constituents to be parsed in an elegant way.",
        "We also show how regular 'transformations' are taken into account by the parser."

      "text": [
        "Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAGs) were introduced by Joshi et al.",
        "1975 and Joshi 1985 as a formalism for linguistic description.",
        "Their linguistic relevance was shown by Kroch and Joshi 1985 and Abeille 1988.",
        "A lexicalized version of the formalism was presented in Schabes, Abeille and Joshi 1988 that makes them attractive for writing computational grammars.",
        "They were proved to be",
        "â–  parsable in polynomial time (worst case) by Vijay Shanker and Joshi 1985 and an Earley-type parser was presented by Schabes and Joshi 1988.",
        "The basic component of a TAG is a finite set of elementary trees that have two types: initial trees or auxiliary trees (See Figure 1).",
        "Both are minimal (but complete) linguistic structures and have at least one terminal at their frontier (that is their 'head).",
        "Auxiliary trees are also constrained to have exactly one leaf node labeled with a nonterminal of the same category as their root node.",
        "Sentences of the language of a TAG are derived from the composition of an S-rooted initial tree with elementary trees by two operations: substitution or adjunction.",
        "Substitution inserts an initial tree (or a tree derived from an initial tree) at a leaf node bearing the same label in an elementary tree (See Figure 2).2 It is the operation used by CFGs.",
        "Adjunction is a more powerful operation: it inserts an auxiliary tree at one of the corresponding node of an elementary tree (See Figure 3).3 TAGs are more powerful than CFGs but only mildly so (Joshi 1983).",
        "Most of the linguistic advantages of the formalism come from the fact that it factors recursion from dependencies.",
        "Kroch and Joshi 1985 show how unbounded dependencies can be 'localized' by having filler and gap as part of 2 1 is the mark for substitution.",
        "3At each node of an elementary tree, there is a feature structure associated with it (Vijayshanker and Joshi, 1988).",
        "Adjunction constraints can be defined in terms of feature structures and the success or failure of unification.",
        "the same elementary tree and having insertion of matrix clauses provided by recursive adjunctions.",
        "Another interesting property of the formalism is its extended domain of locality, as compared to that of usual phrase structure rules in CFG.",
        "This was used by Abeille 1988 to account for the properties of 'light' verb (often called 'support' verb for Romance languages) constructions with only one basic structure (instead of the double analysis or reanalysis usually proposed).",
        "We now define by an example the notion of derivation in a TAG.",
        "Take for example the derived tree in Figure 4.",
        "Unlike CFGs, from the tree obtained by derivation (called the derived tree) it is not always possible to know how it was constructed.",
        "The derivation tree is an object that specifies uniquely how a derived tree was constructed.",
        "The root of the derivation tree is labeled by an S-type initial tree.",
        "All other nodes in the derivation tree are labeled by auxiliary trees in the case of adjunction or initial trees in the case of substitution.",
        "A tree address is associated with each node (except the root node) in the derivation tree.",
        "This tree address is the address of the node in the parent tree to which the adjunction or substitution has been performed.",
        "We use the following convention: trees that are adjoined to their parent tree are linked by an unbroken line to their parent, and trees that are substituted are linked by dashed lines.",
        "The derivation tree in Figure 6 specifies how the derived tree was obtained:",
        "In a `lexicalized' TAG, the 'category' of each word in the lexicon is in fact the tree structure(s) it selects.4 Elementary trees that can be linked by a syntactic or a lexical rule are gathered in a Tree Family, that is selected as a whole by the head of the structure.",
        "A novel parsing strategy follows (Schabes, Abeille, Joshi 1988).",
        "In a first step, the parser scans the input string and selects the different tree structures associated with the lexical items of the string by looking up the lexicon.",
        "In a second step, these structures are combined together to produce a sentence.",
        "Thus the parser uses only a subset of the entire (lexicalized) grammar."

        "Idioms have been at stake in many linguistic discussions since the early transformational grammars, but no exhaustive work based on extensive listings of idioms have been pursued before Gross 1982.",
        "We rely on L.A.D.L.'s work for French that studied 8000 frozen sentences, 20, 000 frozen nouns and 6000 frozen adverbs.",
        "For English, we made use of Freckelton's thesis (1984) that listed more than 3000 sentential idioms.",
        "They show that, for a given structure, idiomatic phrases are usually more numerous in the language than 'free' ones.",
        "As is well known, idioms are made of the same lexicon and consist of the same sequences of categories as 'free' structures.",
        "An interesting exception is the case of 'words' existing only as part of an idiomatic phrase, such as escampette in pren-dre la poudre d'escampette (to leave furtively) or umbrage in to take umbrage at NP.",
        "The specificity of idioms is their semantic non-compositionality.",
        "The meaning of casser sa pipe (to die), cannot be derived from that of casser (to break) and that of pipe (pipe).",
        "They behave semantically as one predicate, and for example the whole VP casser sa pipe selects the subject of the sentence and all possible modifiers.",
        "We therefore consider an idiom as one entity in the lexicon.",
        "It would not make sense to have its parts listed in the lexicon as regular categories and to have special rules to limit their distribution to this unique context.",
        "If they are already listed in the lexicon, these existing entries are considered as mere homonyms.",
        "Furthermore, usually idioms are ambiguous between literal and idiomatic readings.",
        "Idioms do not appear necessarily as continuous strings in texts.",
        "As shown by M. Gross for French and P. Freckelton for English, more than 15% of sentential idioms are made up of unbounded arguments, (e.g. NA) prendre NP1 en compte, NPo take NP1 into account, Butter would not melt in NP's mouth).",
        "Discontinuities can also come from the regular application of syntactic rules.",
        "For example, interposition of adverbs between verb and object in compound V-NP phrases, and interposition of modals or auxiliaries between subject and verb in compound NP-V phrases are very general (Laporte 1988).",
        "As shown by Gazdar et al.",
        "1985 for English, and Gross 1982 for French, most sentential idioms are not completely frozen and 'transformations' apply to them much more regularly",
        "than is usually thought.",
        "Freckelton 1984's listings of idiomatic sentences exhibit passivization for about 50% of the idioms comprised of a verb (different from be and have) and a frozen direct argument.",
        "Looking at a representative sample of 2000 idiomatic sentences with frozen objects (from Gross's listings at LADL) yields similar results for passivization and relativization of the frozen argument for French.",
        "This is usually considered a problem for parsing, since the order in which the frozen elements of an idiom appear might thus vary.",
        "Recognizing idioms is thus dependent on the whole syntactic analysis and it is not realistic to reanalyze them as simple categories in a preprocessing step.",

        "However some trees in a family might be ruled out by an idiom if it does not satisfy one of the three following requirements.",
        "First, the tree must have slots in which the pieces of the idiom can be attached.1Â° If one distinguishes syntactic rules that keep the lexical value of an argument in a sentence (e.g. topical-ization, cleft extraction, relativization...), and syntactic rules that do not (deleting the node for that argument, or replacing it by a pronoun or a wh-element; e.g.: wh-question, pronominalization), it can be shown that usually only the former applies to frozen elements of an idiom.",
        "If you take the idiom bruler un feu (to run a (red) light), relativization and cleft extraction, but not wh-question, are possible on the noun feu, with the idiomatic reading: Le feu que Jean a brule.",
        "C'est un feu que Jean a brule.",
        "* Que brule Jean ?",
        "Second, if all the pieces of an idiom can be attached in a tree, the order imposed by the tree must match with the order in which the pieces appear in the input string.",
        "Thus, if enfant appears before attendre in the input string, the hypothesis for an idiomatic reading will be made but only the trees corresponding to relativization, cleft ex",
        "traction, topicalization in which enfant is required to appear before attendre will be selected.",
        "But if the string enfant is not present at all in the input string, the idiomatic reading will not be hypothesized, and trees corresponding to qui attend-elle will never be selected as part of the family of the idiom attendre un enfant.",
        "Third, the features of the heads of an idiom must unify with those imposed on the tree (as for 'free' sentences).",
        "For example, it has to be specified that bucket in to kick the bucket does not undergo relativization nor passivization, whereas tabs in to keep tabs on NP does.",
        "It is well known that even for 'free' sentences application of the passive, for example, has somehow to be specified for each transitive verbs since there are lexical idiosyncrasies.11 The semantics of the passive tabs were kept on NP by NP is exactly the same as that of the active NP keep tabs on NP, since different trees in the same tree families are considered as (semantically) synonymous."
