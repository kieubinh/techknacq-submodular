        "The solution of complex problems frequently requires cooperation of multiple agents.",
        "A great deal of interaction is needed to identify suitable tasks whose completion contributes to attaining a common goal and to organize those tasks appropriately.",
        "In particular, this involves carrying out communicative subtasks including the transfer of knowledge, the adjustment of beliefs, expressing wants and pursuing their satisfaction, all of which is motivated by the intentions of the interacting agents [Werner 88].",
        "An ambitious dialog system (be it an interface, a manipulation system, or a consultation system) which is intended to exhibit (some of) these capabilities should therefore consider these intentions in processing",
        "the dialog, at least to the extent that is required for the particular type of the dialog and the domain of application.",
        "A considerable amount of work in current M research is concerned with inferring intentions from utterances (e.g., [Allen 83], [Carberry 83], [Grosz, Sidner 86]) or planning speech acts serving certain goals (e.g., [Appelt 85]), but only a few uniform approaches to both aspects have been presented.",
        "Most approaches to dialog control described in the literature offer either rigid action schemata that enable the simulation of the desired behavior on the surface (but lack the necessary degree of flexibility, e. g., [Metzing 79]), or descriptive methods which may also include possible alternatives for the continuation of the dialog, but without expressing criteria to guide an adequate choice among them (e. g., [Maing et al.",
        "87], [Bergmann, Gerlach 87]).",
        "Modeling of beliefs and intentions (i.e., of propositional attitudes) of the agents involved is found only in the ARGOT system [Litman, Allen 84].",
        "This approach behaves sufficiently well in several isolated situations, but it fails to demonstrate a continuously adequate behavior in the course of a complete dialog.",
        "An elaborated theoretical framework is provided in [Cohen, Perrault 79] but they explicitly exclude the deletion of propositional attitudes.",
        "Hence, they cannot explain what happens when a want has been satisfied.",
        "In our approach we have enhanced the propositional attitudes by associating them with time intervals expressing their time of validity.",
        "This enables us to represent the knowledge about the actual state of the dialog (and also about past states) seen from the point of view of a certain agent and to express changes in the propositional attitudes - 27 - occurring in the course of the dialog and to calculate their effect.",
        "This deep modeling is the essential resource for controling the progress of the conversation in approaching its overall goal, and, in particular, for determining the next subgoal in the conversation which manifests itself in a system utterance.",
        "We have applied our method in the NL consultation system WISBER ([Horacek et al.",
        "88], [Sprenger, Gerlach 88]) which is able to participate in a dialog in the domain of financial investment."

        "For a more intensive application, however, further conditions must be put on the connecting links.",

        "In this section we present the application of our method in the NL consultation system WISBER involving rather complex interaction with subdialogs, requests for explanation, recommendations, and adjustment of proposals.",
        "However, it is possible to introduce some simplifications typical for consultation dialogs.",
        "These are urgently needed in order to reduce the otherwise excessive amount of complexity.",
        "In particular, we assume that the user does not lie and take his/her assertions about real world events as true (the sincerity condition).",
        "Moreover, we take it for granted that the user is highly interested in a consultation dialog and, therefore, will pay attention to the conversation on the screen so that it can be reasonably assumed that he/she is fully aware of all utterances occurring in the course of the dialog.",
        "Based on these (implicit) expectations, the following (simplified) assumptions (1) and (2) represent the starting point for a consultation dialog:",
        "They express that the user knows something that 'has to do' (expressed by the meta-predicate RELATED) with states (STATE Y) concerning him/herself and that he/she wants to achieve a state (STATE X).",
        "In assumption 1, (STATE x) is in fact specialized for a consultation system as a real world state (instead of a mental state which is the general assumption in any dialog system).",
        "This state can still be made more concrete when the domain of application is taken into account: In WISBER, we assume that the user wants his/her money 'to be invested.'",
        "The second assumption expresses (a part of) the competence of the user.",
        "This is not of particular importance for many other types of dialog systems.",
        "In a consultation system, however, this is the basis for addressing the user in order to ask him/her to make his/her intentions more precise.",
        "In the course of the dialog these assumptions are supposed to be confirmed and, moreover, their content is expected to become more precise.",
        "In the subsequent paragraphs we outline the processing behavior of the system by explaining the application and the effect of some of the most important dialog rules (at least one of each of the three packages introduced in the previous section), thus giving an impression of the system's coverage.",
        "In the rules presented below, variables are suitably quantified as they appear for the first time in the precondition.",
        "In subsequent appearences they are referred to like constants.",
        "The interpretation of the special constants denoting time-intervals depends on whether they occur on the left or on the right side of a rule: in the precondition the associated state/event must hold/occur during PAST, FUTURE or overlaps NOW; in the effect the state/ event is associated with a time-interval that starts at the reference time-interval.",
        "In a consultation dialog, the user's wants may not always express a direct request for information, but rather refer to events and states in the real world.",
        "From such user wants the system must derive requests for knowledge useful when attempting to satisfy them.2 Consequently the task of infer",
        "Rule 1: Inference drawn from a user want referring to an action with unambiguous consequences (pursuing a global goal) ring communicative goals is of central importance for the functionality of the system.",
        "There is, however, a fundamental distinction whether the content of a want refers to a state or to an event (to be more precise, to an action, mostly).",
        "In the latter case some important inferences can be drawn depending on the domain knowledge about the envisioned action and the degree of precision expressed in its specificatiqn.",
        "If, according to the system's domain model, the effect of the specified action is unambiguous, the user can be expected to be familiar with this relation, so he/she can be assumed to envision the resulting state and, possibly, the precondition as well, if it is not yet fulfilled.",
        "Thus, in principle, a plan consisting of a sequence of actions could be created by application of skillful rule chaining.",
        "This is exactly what Rule 1 asserts: Given the mutual knowledge that the user wants a certain action to occur, and the system's knowledge (in form of a unique rule) about the associated precondition and effect, the system concludes that the user envisions the resulting state and he/she is familiar with the connecting causal relation.",
        "If the uniqueness of the rule cannot be 2 Unlike other systems, e.g., UC [Wilensky et al.",
        "84], which can directly perform some kinds of actions required by the user, WISBER is unable to affect any part of the real world in the domain of application.",
        "established, sufficient evidence derived from the partner model might be an alternative basis to obtain a sufficient categorization of the desired event so that a unique rule is found.",
        "Otherwise the user has to be asked to precise his/her intention.",
        "Let us suppose, to give an example, that the user has expressed a want to invest his/her money.",
        "According to WISBER's domain model, there is only one matching domain rule expressing that the user has to possess the money before but not after investing his/her money, and obtains, in exchange, an asset of an equivalent value.",
        "Hence Rule 1 fires.",
        "The want expressed by the second part of the conclusion can be immediately satisfied as a consequence of the user utterance 'I have inherited 40 000 DM' by applying Rule 5 (which will be explained later).",
        "The remainder part of the conclusion matches almost completely the precondition of Rule 2.",
        "This rule states: If the user wants to achieve a goal state (G) and is informed about the way this can be done (he/she knows the specific RULE R and is capable of performing the relevant action), the system is right to assume that the user is lacking some information which in` hibits him/her from actually doing it.",
        "Therefore, a want of the user indicating the intention to know more about this transaction is created (expressed by the meta-predicate AUGMENT).",
        "If the necessary capability cannot be attributed to the user a consultation is impossible.",
        "If, to discuss another example, the user has expressed a want aiming at a cer",
        "tain state (e.g., 'I want to have my money back'), the application of another rule almost identical to Rule 1 is attempted.",
        "When its successful application yields the association of a unique event, the required causal relation is established.",
        "Moreover, the user's familiarity with this relation must be derivable in order to follow the path indicated by Rule 2.",
        "Otherwise, a want of the user would be created whose content is to find out about suitable means to achieve the desired state (as expressed by Rule 3, leading to a system reaction like, e.g., 'you must dissolve your savings account').",
        "It is very frequently the case that the satisfaction of a want cannot immediately be achieved because the precision of its specification is insufficient.",
        "When the domain-specific problem solving component indicates a clue about what information would be helpful in this respect this triggers the creation of a system want to get acquainted with it.",
        "Whenever the user's uninformedness in a particular case is not yet proved, and this information falls into his/her competence area, control is passed to the generation component to address a suitable question to the user (as expressed in Rule 4).",
        "Provided with new information hopeful.",
        "ly obtained by the user's reply the system tries again to satisfy the (more precisely specified) user want.",
        "This process is repeated until an adequate degree of specification is achieved at some stage.",
        "In the course of the dialog each utterance effects parts of the system's current model of the user (concerning assumptions or temporarily established knowledge).",
        "Therefore, these effects are checked in order to keep the data base consistent.",
        "Consider, for instance, a user want aiming at investing some money which, after a phase of parameter assembling, has led to the system proposal 'I recommend you to buy bonds' apparently accomplishing the (substitued) goal of obtaining enough information to perform the envisioned action.",
        "Consequently, the state of the associated user want is subject to change which is expressed by Rule 5.",
        "Therefore, the mutual knowledge about the user want is modified (by closing the associated time-interval) and the the user's want is marked as being 'finished' and added to the (new) mutual knowledge.",
        "However, this simplified treatment of the satisfaction of a want includes the restrictive assumptions that the acceptance of the proposal is (implicitly) anticipated, and that modifications of a want or of a proposal are not manageable.",
        "In a more elaborated version, the goal accomplishment has to be marked as provisory.",
        "If the user expresses his/her acceptance either explicitly or changes the topic (thus implicitly agreeing to the proposal), the application of Rule 5 is fully justified.",
        "Apart from the problem of the increasing complexity and the amount of necessary additional rules, the preliminary status of our solution has much to do with problems of interpreting the AUGMENT-predicate which appears in the representation of a communicative goal according to the derivation by Rule 2: The system is satisfied by finding any additional information augmenting the user's knowledge, but it is not aware of the requirement that the information must be a suitable supplement (which is recognizable by the user's confirmation only)."
