        "Defining subsumption on the basis of lexical specifications of paradigms alone leads to a very simple statement of the conditions of inheritance of derived string forms, but disallows the possibility of inheritance of partial derived string forms.",
        "The restriction of inheritance by delegation or stipulation to subsuming paradigms, while natural, is not motivated by more general considerations.",

        "Rather, the problem lies in having to choose which of the root and melody should be expressed as the word with which a paradigm is associated.",
        "On the one hand, traditional grammar would suggest that the consonantal root has some claim to this status.",
        "However, there are clearly relationships between the vocalic melodies which indicate syntactic regularities on the basis of Ablaut (McCarthy 1981, p403), and these regularities cannot be captured if we choose the consonantal root as the paradigmatic word and disallow inheritance of partial derived string forms.",
        "In any case, such regularities should presumably be stated independently of any roots with which they happen to combine.",

        "That our approach is more general than standard FSM is clear from the fact that string variables can represent an unbounded amount of orthographic material.",

        "The problematic cases of Finnish ambifixation described by Karttunen (1983 p181, citing Koskenniemi) are handled straightforwardly, although this raises immediate questions about the formalism's interpretation in terms of finite-state transduction, discussed shortly.",
        "GOrz and Paulus's (1988) algorithm for the location of stem vowels in German which undergo Ablaut can reconstructed declaratively.",
        "Our approach also solves the problem noted by Bear (1988) of the overgenerality of rules in an FSM system.",
        "He introduces the mechanism of a negative rule feature to prevent the application of an epenthesis rule which would otherwise insert an \"e\" before the suffix \"s\" in the case of words such as \"banjo\" and \"tango\".",
        "The need for negative rule features and their quasiprocedural implications are avoided in the system we propose.",
        "The following paradigm correctly states the facts and will apply only in the case of those items that violate the subgeneralization concerning nominal plurals in \"o\".",
        "(14) table(piano, S:[noun, singular, S (piano, piccolo, ...)], [singular, plural] [S,S+s]) Free variation, such as that between \"o\" and \"oe\" forms in words like \"cargo\", is treated analogously by allowing the derived string specification to be S+{e, 0}+s in this case (where 0 represents the empty string), although this obviously fails to capture the fact that the altemants are precisely those found in the most closely related paradigms.",
        "Finally, having the level of properties over which to state generalizations means that our lexical representations of strings are not cluttered with non-realizable diacritic characters whose function is simply to trigger morphological processes (cf Bear 1988).",
        "The main advance we would claim for our system is that we have provided a calculus for orthographic forms, bringing the treatment of orthography within the same kind of logical framework now accorded to our treatment of semantic and syntactic objects.",
        "The fully declarative interpretation of our system and the similarity of statements within it to work by Daelemans (1988) offer a way of giving a formal treatment of object oriented morphophonemics.",
        "Finally, recent work by Gazdar and Evans (1988) may offer techniques for extending the formalism to more complex grammatical descriptions, in line with many current views on the nature of syntactic categories as recursively structured objects.",
        "Current work is examining this possibility.",
        "7 Reduction to finite-state transducers While the declarative nature of our system means that it is not tied to a particular computational interpretation, the fact that the closure of the lexicon may be infinite argues in favour of an interpretation that does not presuppose computation of that closure, and considerations of efficiency in favour of one in terms of finite-state transduction (Koskenniemi 1983)4.",
        "It is immediately clear that heavy restrictions have to be placed on systems involving string equations in order to have any chance of a reduction to finite-state transduction at all.",
        "One difficulty will lie in representing paradigm subsumption induced by non-orthographic properties.",
        "The assumption that there is only a finite set of such properties would make this problem easier.",

If we allow past participle to represent the null lexical rule, we may generate the string set (ge)nS(et)n which is clearly homomorphic to the context-free language anbn.",
        "Similar demonstrations can be given of context-sensitive5 and even more powerful languages.",
        "In order for the reduction to go through in this case, we should have to demonstrate the finitariness of substitutions for S. This is clearly impossible in the general case.",
        "The kinds of restriction to be imposed would include at least the prohibition of copying over unbounded domains and of affixation at both margins.",
        "partitions and duplications of the lexicons, could be computed on the basis of the properties mentioned in paradigms and lexical rules.",
        "Information from the distribution of derived forms with respect to string specifications in paradigms could then be used to construct the FSMs that mediate surface and lexical tapes.",
        "Problematic cases might only be handled by indicating an ordering over paradigms where context freeness is implicated, effectively indicating that those paradigms may only apply to non-derived forms and allowing incompleteness in the computation of the closure of the lexicon.",
        "The above paragraphs are mostly speculation.",
        "As Gazdar (1985) notes, it is not certain that morphological phenomena in natural language are best characterized by finite-state devices.",
        "Depending on one's view of the data cited by Culy (1985) and the ambifixation cases mentioned above, the formal power of our framework might be interpreted as a virtue rather than a vice and future work should also look at introducing (at least) context-free devices into our computational interpretation of morphology.",
