        "• semantic: inventory of possible lexicalizations of a concept in a given language; • syntactic: one inventory of realizatic classes per language, providing information about number, type and realizatic of the arguments of a given lexeme; • morphological: one inventory of inflectional classes per language.",

        "In other words: collocations have a basis and a cooccurring collocate.\"6 This determination manifests itself in so far as a given basis does not allow all of the collocates that would be possible according to general semantic coocurrence conditions, but only a certain subset: so in French, retenir son admiration, retenir sa haine, sa joie are possible, but *retenir son desespoir is not.",
        "The choice of collocates depends strongly on the lexeme that has been chosen as the basis; knowledge about possible collocations can be only partly derived From knowledge about general semantic properties of lexemes.",

        "8 For substantive-verb-collocations, the classification as basis and collocate is opposed to the usual syntactic description according to head and modifier; this has consequences for the lexicalization process: while it is usually possible to first lexicalize the heads of phrases, then the modifiers (e.g. substantivehead,ba,i, < adjectivemodifienceitocate, the choice of verbs depends on their nominal complements (which are modifiers, but which have to be considered as bases of collocations).",

For instance, f's of group 1 and 2 specified in the table below, applied to nouns, yield substantive+verb-collocations, those of groups 3 and 4 yield substantive+adjective-collocations, and those of groups 5 and 6 return substantive-l-substantive-collocations.",
