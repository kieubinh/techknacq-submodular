        "The paper proposes a paradigmatic approach to morphological knowledge acquisition.",
        "It addresses the problem of learning from examples rules for word-forms analysis and synthesis.",
        "These rules, established by generalizing the training data sets, are effectively used by a built-in interpreter which acts consequently as a morphological processor within the architecture of a natural language question-answering system.",
        "The PARADIGM system has no a priori knowledge which should restrict it to a particular natural language, but Instead builds up the morphological rules based only on the examples provided, be they in Romanian, English, French, Russian, Slovak and the like."

        "For highly inflexional languages, encoding all word forms Into a word lexicon (declarative morphology approach) appears to be a poor solution not only due to a great redundancy (which for some languages is prohibitive (Jappinen,1983)) but also with respect to some theoretical aspects (as for instance descriptional adequacy (Wehr11,1985)).",
        "Within an Inflexional morphology environment (Alshawi,1985), we propose a procedural approach based on automatically acquired flexioning paradigms.",
        "The paradigmatic model is incorporated into an experimental system called PARADIGM, which is intended to (partially) replace the acquisition and modelling part of our MORPHO lexicon management system (Tufis,1987a) incorporated by the IURES environment for building natural language applications (Tufis,1985).",
        "The aim of our work is twofold: to obtain a sound linguistic tool for word-forms analysis and synthesis (which In case of highly inflexional languages is by no means a trivial task) and to provide for a psychologically motivated behaviour of such a system in dealing with unknown words.",
        "In the following, we shall dwell on the technical Issues connected to the first of the above two mentioned motivations.",
        "With respect to the second one maybe it is worth saying that when PARADIGM lacks appropriate or complete knowledge It Is supposed to act the same way a child or a foreign speak partner does.",
        "That is, for Instance, to say \"goad\" or \"womans\" if the corresponding irregularity is unknown.",
        "The reason for such a decision stems mainly from our attempt to study in parallel with the implementation, the effectiveness of language learning based on informal examples.",
        "From the linguistic engineering point of view, the purpose of the system is stated very pragmatically, that is to ease and speed up as much as possible the building of language specific morphological knowledge bases without (too much) help from theoretical morphologists, experts on the language concerned.",
        "It is not always easy to find appropriate written material, not to speak about human experts, presenting in a rigorous manner (as imposed by computer applications) the rules and peculiarities of word structuring in different languages.",
        "PARADIGM was conceived to overcome, at least partially, these difficulties and to provide a handy tool for immediate verification of specific rules validity.",
        "As the general situation is with learning systems, different copies of PARADIGM may be used in parallel and finally merge the Individually developed knowledge bases.",
        "This is beneficialy not only with respect to the development time but also with respect to the linguistic coverage.",
        "Architecturally, PARADIGM was influenced by DISCIPLE (Tecuci, 1988) In the sense that the behavioral dichotomy \"apprentice-expert\" was Incorporated into its Implementation.",
        "However, due to the more specific task, the technical solutions adopted in PARADIGM for knowledge acquisition are different, being problem oriented."

        "This activity Is equivalent in the formal model to defining the SC subset and the Fl function.",
        "Further, for each subcategory in SC the system asks the designer to enter the specific features along which the inflexional behaviour of the words gets relevant.",
        "With Romanian language for instance, while number, case and enclitic articulation are relevant for COMMON-NOUN, for feminine PROPER-NOUN only the case is significant (but this is not always true: the feminine proper-nouns ending in a consonant, whatever their etimoiogy, do not flexate at all).",
        "By entering all sub-category-features associations, the system is implicitly provided with the M set and F2 function.",
        "Finally, for each feature in M, the designer will be asked to define the possible values the current feature may take (e.g. 'singular' and 'plural' for the 'number' feature).",

        "A terminal node (T-node) is not obligatory a leaf node because of the possibility of inclusion of one ending into a longer one (the reverse is always true).",
        "All T-nodes are associated with the paradigmatic information specific to the ending which they stand for.",
        "This information is represented by a list of pairs: ((Qi pl)(Q2 p2)...(0m pm)) where Qi are paradigm identifiers and p are (Identifiers for) points in the paradigmatic flexioning space P. If a T-node (hence an ending) has associated more than a single pair (0 p) it is called extrinsically ambiguous.",
        "Another type of ambiguity Is induced by the endings containing shorter embedded endings.",
        "We call such endings Intrinsically ambiguous.",

        "Anyway, for intrinsically ambiguous cases, our system has found out that for Romanian, in almost all cases the segmentation with the longest ending is the correct one.",
        "For extrinsically ambiguous endings, the system uses some statistics, extracted from the training data, which proved to be valuable.",
        "For instance, the system updates for each paradigm, a so-called local counter with each new thematic family behaving according to that paradigm.",
        "The value of this counter, specific for each paradigm is considered in sorting the interpretations of an ending :((01 pr)).",
        "According to this sorting, an interpretation p) is considered more likely than another one (0i p), if in the lexicon there are more roots \"belonging\" to (I than to This preference heuristics does not take into account the frequency of the words In running texts but only their paradigmatic classification.",
        "We plan to introduce the \"dynamic counters'.",
        "which are supposed to provide qualitative estimation based on word-forms frequences.",
        "It is clear that in order to provide valuable preferences, the values of the static/dynamic counters must result from large sets of examples and running texts.",

        "It is Important to note that the.preference kieuristics we talk about are intended only for getting a plausability ordering criterion for the possible interpretations of an ending or segmentations of an word-form.",
        "It means that no interpretation variant is rejected at this level, so that if a preferred (according to the preference heuristics) interpretation or segmentation was wrong, the correct one may still be found.",
        "Roots processing and eventually paradigms modification or absorbtion (see further) are based on some similarity criteria.",
        "If no similarity is detected between the roots of a TF, the corresponding paradigm, if marked as new, is interned as it was initially constructed.",
        "But if the roots are similar, the system tries to reduce differences between them, either by modifying the inflexional paradigm or by inferring rules for root modification.",
        "The first approach is generally taken if the differences between roots appear at their boundary with the endings.",
        "The second,method Is usually tried In case of differences appearing inside the roots.",
        "The similarity criteria are declaratively specified, so that It is easy to modify, augment or adapt them to specific needs.",
        "The notion of similarity, as used In our approach, Is very simple.",
        "We have developed a similarity description language in which one may describe the conditions under which two strings are to be considered similar.",
        "With the current version of the system, we use only three simple similarity rules:",
        "81) <x>?<y> <x> <y> $2) <X>I a <X>?",
        "s3) <X>?<Y>I <X>?<Y>?",
        "In the above rules the metasymbol < X > stands for an arbitrary string, the question mark for zero or one letter, the exclamation mark for exactly one letter and EN for the similarity relation.",
        "Their readings are: rs1) two strings are similar If they differ by at most one embedded letter (calculatoAr a calculator); rs2) two strings are similar if they are the same except the last letter of one or both of them (coplL a copil); rs3) two strings are similar if they differ by at most one embedded letter and by the last letter of one or both of them (fereAstrA a ferestrE).",
        "Actually, the similarity description language is more powerful than it is suggested.",
        "For instance, one may impose restrictions on an < X > construction such as minimal or exact number of characters in X, prosodic restrictions such as presence or absence of accent, a.s.o .",
        "If two roots are similar, the system attempts to generalize their similarity beyond the particular TF currently processed.",
        "The similarity between two roots le necessary but not sufficient for making a generalization.",
        "What is needed, is an explanation, In terms of morphological features, accounting for root modification.",
        "This explanation, if found, will be used as a precondition for the root modification rule to be synthesized.",
        "The explanation justifies the difference between the two roots (of the same TF), and consists of discriminant descriptions (in terms of morphological features) of the endings associated with them.",
        "In the current version of the system, it looks for the morphological features which have the same value for all the word-forms obtainable from the first root and another different value for all word-forms derived from the second root.",
        "For instance with the similar roots 'copil' and 'copil.",
        "(child), the system discovered that all the forms in singular are produced by the first root while the second generates all the plural forms.",
        "Using this fact, the system built the following rule, entering only one root (cool') in the lexicon: \"If a root X behaves according to the paradigm 039 and its last letter is 'I' then In all plural forms 'I' must be replaced by the letterl'.",
        "The \"generative\" flavour of this rule should not be misleading: that is, one must not infer that It is good only for generation.",
        "The same rule applies to analysis: \"If a root was discovered according to the paradigm 039 and Its last letter was 'I', the root may be recorded in the lexicon with its 'I' replaced by the letter 'I\"'.",
        "As more data sets are provided the rules may be generalized further in order to cover the new cases.",
        "We said before that the internalization of a marked paradigm was delayed until the roots of a partial TF were processed.",
        "As we shall see in the example below, the delay is justified by the possibility to alter the initial endings (hence the paradigm) in order to minimize the differences between the considered roots.",
        "A paradigm modification may appear if the last letter from each of the roots taken into account is transferred In front of all their corresponding endings (recall the LA list in the beginning of this chapter).",
        "If the system finds no feature-based justification for root modification and If the difference between the roots is given by their last letters, it decides to transfer these \"faulty\" letters into the appropriate endings, thus \"regularizing\" the TF.",
        "As a side-effect the initial paradigm is modified and in case the new one is already known the decision is considered sound and the older paradigm is forgotten.",
        "If the new paradigm is not known to the system then both paradigms (the initial and the modified ones) are kept until further evidence will allow the system to choose among them.",
        "If no such evidence is obtained in favour of one or another paradigm, it will be the task of the knowledge base designer to decide on the matter.",
        "Let us follow on an example the process of learning a root modification rule.",
        "Consider that the trainer provided the thematic family for the thematic word \"fereastra\" (window).",
        "The root detection process will generate the following segmentations:",
        "There are identified two roots: 'fereastra' and 'ferestre'.",
        "According to the rule s3) they are similar, with <X > and < Y > bound to 'fere' and 'str' respectively.",
        "The fault letters are associated with their appearance context: >elais<, >Oa' and >riei.",
        "The notations are interpreted as follows:",
        "The first decision made in order to minimize the differences between the two roots is to transfer the last character of them into endings, thus resulting the segmentations: fereastr + a fereastr + a ferestr + el ferestr + e ferestr + ale ferestr + e ferestr + elor ferestr + e A second step towards difference ellimination is to consider the deletion of the 'a' letter between < fere > and < str > .",
        "But because this operation does not contribute to paradigm modification it must be generalized (If possible) as a rule for root modification.",
        "By inspecting the morphological features of the word-forms, the system finds out that the root 'fereastr' is characterized by the feature values: feminine, singular and nom-acc, while the root 'ferestr' is characterized In all its appearances only by the 'feminine' feature.",
        "Because 'feminine' value is common to all word-forms of the thematic family, it is considered Irrelevant with respect to root modification.",
        "Moreover, no word 149 - form derivable from the 'ferestr' root has attached the \"singular + nom-acc\" feature values combination.",
        "Therefore, this Is taken as a possible condition for the faulty letter deletion and the synthesized rule is the following: RMR1){<X> = >elais<6, PARADIGM ='P00007' & NUMBER = 'singular' & CASE = 'nom-acc'} = = > â [NUMBER = 'singular' & CASE = 'nom-acc'l = = > > es < } The reading of this rule is: \"If a root of a word-form which flexions according to the P00007 paradigm, in singular and nom-acc, contains the embedded string \"eas\", then for all combinations of morphological features not containing both singular and nom-acc values, the 'eas' string is replaced by 'es'\".",
        "Let us notice that the rule Is more specific than it should be, imposing that all eligible words behave according to the P00007 paradigm and requiring the letter 's' to follow the diphtong 'ea'.",
        "But the system cannot Infer more from this single example.",
        "If provided with another example, let's say 'ceapa' (onion), with a similar behaviour the system synthesizes a rule very alike to RMR1: RMR2){<X> = >etalp<& PARADIGM =1300007' & NUMBER = 'singular' & CASE = 'nom-acc'} = = > (NUMBER = 'singular' & CASE = 'nom-acc') = = Â»ep< } The only difference between RMR1 and RMR2 is the condition that the diphtong 'ea' must be followed by 's' and 'p' respectively.",
        "By considering this condition a particular one, the system drops it and obtains a more general rule subsuming both previous ones: RMR3){<X> >alai <& PARADIGM ='P00007' & NUMBER = 'singular' & CASE = 'nom-acc'} = > - [NUMBER = 'singular' & CASE = 'nom-ace) = = Â»e< } The rule RMR3 Is still too specific.",
        "The processing of the thematic family for the word 'seara' (evening) produces a further generalization of RMR3.",
        "Firstly, the system generates the following rule: RMR4){<X> = >cal <& PARADIGM ='P00008' & NUMBER = 'singular' & CASE = 'nom-ace} = = > [NUMBER = 'singular' & CASE = 'nom-accl = = Â»e< } The difference between RMR3 and RMR4 is made by the restriction that the flexioning paradigms are required to be P00007 instead of P00008.",
        "To generalize these rules, the system investigates the feature values of the two involved paradigms.",
        "Their common properties are SC =COMMON-NOUN, GENDER = FEMININE, so the system is able to propose a new rule subsuming the RMR3 and RMR4 rules:",
        "Because generalization correctness over incomplete data cannot be guaranteed, each synthesized rule has two associated lists, one of them containing positive examples (Initially only the prototype root which generated the rule) and the other one containing exceptions (initially empty).",

        "The Implementation of paradigms absorbtion is computationally motivated: firstly by decreasing the number of paradigms, the search space is narrowed and consequently word-form processing time improved; secondly, by lengthening the endings, they become more discriminating and therefore the ambiguity is reduced.",
        "In Romanian the case is that the longer an ending, the less ambiguous its interpretation.",
        "For instance the 'I' ending has 19 possible interpretations (In our model), while the ending 'ulul' has only one.",
        "We think that this is a general property with inflexional languages and therefore we consider paradigmatic absorbtion not to be specific for Romanian.",
        "The paradigmatic absorbtion limits both types of ambiguity discussed earlier: intrinsically (due to different possibilities of a word segmentation) and extrinsically (due to different interpretations an ending may have).",
        "In order to obtain a complete morphological knowledge in a relatively short time, PARADIGM is accompanied by a merging utility program, (partially) able to unify two or more knowledge bases developed with different copies of the system."

      "text": [
        "One of our earlier goals, some years ago, was to establish, by manual procedures, a reasonable set of fiexioning paradigms for Romanian, in order to implement a reliable morphological processor, general enough to cover the requirements of technical texts.",
        "The task was taken by seven colleagues with different backgrounds (linguists, logicians, engineers and mathematicians ) and lasted for almost half an year (Cristea,1982).",
        "I used the examples from the then written material, in order to test the PARADIGM system.",
        "While differently organized, the equivalent (in linguistic coverage) knowledge base was obtained in a four-hour session.",
        "Moreover, the number of paradigms discovered by PARADIGM was smaller (97 paradigms versus 123).",
        "The rest were absorbed without any loss.",
        "By raining test data on the manually discovered knowledge base and on the PARADIGM acquired knowledge base we noted up to 10% improvement In analysis time.",
        "In hypothesising the lexical status and morphological features of the unknown words, based only on endings analysis, the PARADIGM generated knowledge base was also batter.",
        "A morphological knowledge base for Russian and another one for Spanish are under development.",
        "Experiments have also been made with French, Slovak and Hungarian.",
        "In the near future, we plan to develop the system in two important directions: - learning compound word-forms rules (proclitic articulation of nouns and adjectives, verb compound tenses, degrees of comparison for adjectives); - learning lexical affixes (that is meaning modifying preffixes and suffixes (Tufis,1988)).",
        "Related work is reported in (Wohtke,1986), (Trost,1986) but they are either concerned with English (not a very exciting language from the morphological point of view) or address generation or analysis only.",
        "The very popular two-level morphology model of Koskenniemi (1983) intended primarily to derivational morphology is, from our point of view, too expensive for a grammatical oriented processing.",
        "Recent work reported in (Goertz, 1988), (Woth-ki, 1986), (Zock,1988) share some points with our approach.",
        "We consider that the main contributions of our work stem from the following features: - freedom in defining the categorial system for the model; - independence of a specific natural language, provided it is within our \"root + ending\" approach; - applicability of the synthesized rules both in analysing and generating word forms; - possibility of rapid development of morphological knowledge bases, by merging the results of many parallel acquisition sessions; CPL - 151 - - duality of system behaviour (apprentice - expert) which allows immediate check of the acquired knowledge; - low level of linguistic competence required to the trainers."
