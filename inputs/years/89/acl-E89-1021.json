        "Dialogue is considered to be a cooperative activity where the goals and actions of each participant contribute to the overall purpose of the dialogue [3].",
        "In task-oriented dialogues, we distinguish between task level goals and plans (e.g., investing, traveling), and communicative level intentions and speech acts (e.g., explaining, requesting information) [2,6,11].",
        "We call - 154 - these aspects the intentional dimension.",
        "Each step in the dialogue concerns a particular topic.",
        "Intuitively the notion of topic might be described by a subset of objects of the problem under discussion.",
        "In fact, the boundary of this \"subset\" is not strict: one can only say that some objects are more salient than others.",
        "The attentional state is hence better represented by different levels in the focus of attention, corresponding to embedded subsets of objects [9].",
        "It is important to note that in the context of dialogue, the term deviation is not used with its strict boolean meaning: it is a complex and a relative notion.",
        "Deviation are complex because they involve both intentional and attentional dimensions.",
        "Deviations in this cooperative process arise from inconsistencies between the observed speech act and the dialogue considered as a coherent plan [4].",
        "They can be classified according to the type of interactions among of interactions among intentions of the participants and and changes on the focus of attention.",
        "The sample session above illustrates several types of such deviations: at the communicative level, the novice user requests for explanations before giving a requested information; at the task level, the user gives an inconsistent value or does not want a given action in the task plan.",
        "Deviations are generally combined with changes of subjets.",
        "Within each dimension there exist different degrees of deviations: speech acts may have indirect effects, changes in the focus of attention may be be more or less abrupt, deviations depend on the expectations each participant has concerning the reactions of the other.",
        "Therefore, we adopted models of the dialogue structure where the relationship between the intentions and the evolution of the focus of attention are made explicit [10].",
        "The detection and analysis of deviation after a user speech act relies on expectations and predictions in both the intentional and attentional dimensions.",
        "The system, having produced a speech act and waiting for a reaction of the user, expects in the first place a reaction corresponding exactly to the effect it intended to produce.",
        "If the user reacts differently, the system will use knowledge about possible types of deviation and the state of dialogue to analyze the nature of the deviation.",
        "Once a deviation has been identified, the system may need to modify more or less deeply the planned course of the dialogue: from local adaptation like embedding a small clarification subdialogue (sentences 14-15), to more global revision like reordering entire subtopics (sentence 6).",
        "Hence to interpret the influence of an unexpected speech act at a certain point in the dialogue the representation of the state of dialogue should reflect the structure of the whole dialogue: keeping track of past exchanges and anticipating the remainder of the dialogue."

        "At a given point in the dialogue the attentional state can be represented by a stack in which the bottom contains the focus associated with the most general plan and the top contains the focus of the plan currently executed.",

        "Thus, the pointer returned by the Recognizer in the Expectation Stack indicates all the changes of subject or of intention by the user while the constraints attached to parameters of the task plan reveal inconsistent values.",
