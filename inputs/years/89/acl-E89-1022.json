        "The interpretation of plural anaphora often requires the construction of complex reference objects (RefOs) out of RefOs which were formerly introduced not by plural terms but by a number of singular terms only.",
        "Often, several complex RefOs can be constructed, but only one of them is the preferred referent for the plural anaphor in question.",
        "As a means of explanation for preferred and non-preferred interpretations of plural anaphora, the concept of a Common Association Basis (CAB) for the potential atomic parts of a complex object is introduced in the following.",
        "CABs pose conceptual constraints on the formation of complex RefOs in general.",
        "We argue that in cases where a suitable CAB for the atomic RefOs introduced in the text exists, the corresponding complex RefO is constructed as early as in the course of processing the antecedent sentence and put into the focus domain of the discourse model.",
        "Thus, the search for a referent for a plural anaphor is constrained to a limited domain of RefOs according to the general principles of focus theory in NLP.",
        "Further principles of interpretation are suggested which guide the resolution of plural anaphora in cases where more than one suitable complex RefO is in focus.",

        "4) When are complex discourse entities constructed in the process of text comprehension?",

        "Up to now, most analyses of plural anaphora investigate cases of the (1.a)- or (1.b)-type, i.e. those in which the complex object is introduced explicitly, either by a simple plural NP or by a conjunction of singular or plural NPs (which in both cases yields a plural NP as well)."

        "In (1.c), Michael ... with Maria triggers the formation of Michael ED Maria.",

        "In the evening they were at a garden party.",

        "But in (2.b) they is preferably linked to Michael ED Maria; even if Michael and Maria happened to take their frisbee to the garden party, we would not want to claim that the plural anaphor they in (2.b) refers to a complex discourse entity consisting of Michael, Maria and the frisbee.",
        "In the preferred reading of (2.b), the frisbee is excluded from the antecedent of the anaphor.",
        "We have to explain why with-PPs only cause sum formation in certain cases.",
        "The proposed solution to this problem is the concept of a Common Association Basis (CAB), which is introduced in Herweg (1988).",
        "The CAB is an extension of the Common Integrator (CI), which Lang (1984) developed in his general theory of coordinate conjunction structures.",
        "1 The assumption of indicators and constraints contrasts to the less restrictive assumption of Frey & Kamp's (1986) DRT-oriented analysis of plural anaphora, in which they claim that \"any collection of available reference markers, whether singular or plural, can be 'joined together' to yield the antecedent with which the pronoun can be connected\" (p. 18).",
        "Grouping by with depends on the condition that \"x with y\" leads to \"x ED y\" only in those cases in which a CAB-relation is fulfilled.",
        "The most relevant constraint given by CAB is the condition that x and y are instances of the same ontological type at the most fine-grained level.",
        "This means two humans are good candidates to form a complex RefO, whereas a frisbee, which does not fall under the ontological type of humans or animate objects, and the human players are not.",
        "CAB constraints apply not only to cases like (1.c) and (2.b), but to sum formation in general.",
        "Consider this example:",
        "(3) Michael and his frisbee were at the park.",
        "Here the conjunction explicitly forces the sum formation of objects of different ontological types.",
        "This is at least unusual and has a strange effect.",
        "However, explicit conjunction by and presupposes the existence of a suitable CAB for the conjoined entities.",
        "The addressee must assume that the conjunction in (3) involves an instruction to derive such a CAB (or simply concede that one exists).",
        "Thus, to make conjunctions like the one in (3) acceptable and natural, one normally has to assume a CAB which is not explicitly specified or immedeatly derivable from the information conveyed in the sentence itself but which is given by the preceding or extralinguistic context.",
        "In (3), the required CAB might simply be something like 'the entities desperately being looked for by Michael's children'.",
        "In isolation however, forced sum formations like the one in (3) must be considered marginally acceptable.",
        "We now have the following situation: Grouping depends on properties of the RefOs in question, namely whether a CAB exists which constitutes a conceptual relation among the RefOs with respect to situational parameters given, for example, by predicative concepts.",
        "Furthermore, it is obvious that world knowledge and the theme of the discourse give evidence for which (complex) RefO is most appropriate as the antecedent of an anaphoric pronoun.",
        "We will propose that these factors can be handled by CABs as well.",
        "This leads us to Herweg's (1988) Principle of Connectedness: All sub-RefOs of a complex Ref() must be related by a CAB.",
        "Now consider example (1.d).",
        "It shows that some lexical concepts possess what we call grouping force, i.e. they trigger sum formation with respect to atomic RefOs.",
        "The grouping force of a lexical concept can be seen as a special case of a CAB.",
        "Without going into details of the representation formalism we can formulate the relevant sum formation processes by this rule: If \"x meets y\", then construct the complex RefO x 4 y.",
        "The status of this sum formation rule is similar to that of classical inference rules, which are used for bridging processes in the sense of Clark (1975).",
        "Not all verbs possess a grouping force as strong as meet; e.g. the grouping force of watch is considerably lower.",
        "Consider: (4) a. Michael met Peter and Maria in the pub.",
        "They had a great time.",
        "b. Michael watched Peter and Maria in the pub.",
        "They had a great time.",
        "In (4.b), the sum of Maria and Peter is significantly preferred to the sum including Michael as the antecedent of they.",
        "In (4.a), there presumably is a preference to the opposite, i.e. to link they to the sum consisting of all three persons.",
        "In contrast to highly associative verbal concepts like meet, watch must be classified as a dissociative element which does not constitute a CAB for its arguments but induces a conceptual separation.",
        "Part of the explanation for this property of watch is to be seen in the (normally understood) local separation of subject and object in the situation described.",
        "Again in contrast to meet, this local separation usually prevents an interaction or some other kind of contact which allows one to assume a suitable link (i.e. a CAB) for the persons introduced based on properties of the situation which the sentence describes."

        "There are essentially two opportunities to construct a complex RefO from atomic RefOs: it can be constructed and put into the focus when the atomic RefOs are mentioned, or the construction might be suspended until an anaphor triggers the sum formation.",
        "The second solution has some undesirable consequences; the worst is that the methods of resolving plural anaphora and singular anaphora must be completely different.",
