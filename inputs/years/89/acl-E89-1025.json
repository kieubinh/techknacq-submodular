        "A rich environment for experimentation with unification grammars R. Johnson & M. Rosner IDSIA, Lugano ABSTRACT This paper describes some of the features of a sophisticated language and environment designed for experimentation with unification-oriented linguistic descriptions.",
        "The system, which is called ud, has to date been used successfully as a development and prototyping tool in a research project on the application of situation schemata to the representation of real text, and in extensive experimentation in machine translation.",
        "While the ud language bears close resemblances to all the well-known unification grammar formalisms, it offers a wider range of features than any single alternative, plus powerful facilities for notational abstraction which allow users to simulate different theoretical approaches in a natural way.",
        "After a brief discussion of the motivation for implementing yet another unification device, the main body of the paper is devoted to a description of the most important novel features of ud.",
        "The paper concludes with a discussion of some questions of implementation and completeness.",
        "several languages: principally a demanding machine translation exercise and a substantial investigation into some practical applications of situation semantics (Johnson, Rosner and Rupp, forthcoming).",
        "The interaction between users and implementers has figured largely in the development of the system, and a major reason for the richness of its language and environment has been the pressure to accommodate the needs of a group of linguists working on three or four languages simultaneously and importing ideas from a variety of different theoretical backgrounds.",
        "Historically ud evolved out of a near relative of PATR-II (Shieber, 1984), and its origins are still apparent, not least in the notation.",
        "In the course of development, however, ud .has been enriched with ideas from many other sources, most notably from LFG (Bresnan, 1982) and HPSG (Sag and Pollard, 1987).",
        "Among the language features mentioned in the paper are - a wide range of data types, including lists, trees and user-restricted types, in addition to the normal feature structures comprehensive treatment of disjunction"

        "The development of ud arose out of the need to have available a full set of prototyping and development tools for a number of different research projects in computational linguistics, all involving extensive text coverage in - dynamic binding of pathname segments A particular article of faith which has been very influential in our work has been the conviction that well-designed programming languages (including ones used primarily by - 182 - linguists), should not only supply a set of primitives which are appropriate for the application domain but should also contain within themselves sufficient apparatus to enable the user to create new abstractions which can be tuned to a particular view of the data.",
        "We have therefore paid particular attention to a construct which in ud we call a relational abstraction, a generalisation of PATR-II templates which can take arguments and which allow multiple, recursive definition.",

        "To meet this need, ud provides a powerful abstraction mechanism which is notationally similar to a Prolog procedure, but having a strictly declarative interpretation.",

        "The desc, cond and ind attributes are intended to be mnemonics for, respectively, 'description', (a list of) 'conditions' and 'indeterminate'.)",

        "Merge-all does all the hard work, making sure that all the indeterminates are consistent and recursively combining together the condition lists.",
        "Although these definitions look suspiciously like pieces of Prolog, to which we are clearly indebted for the notation, the important difference, which we already referred to above, is that the interpretation of Merge and Merge-all is strictly declarative.",
        "The best examples of the practical advantages of this kind of abstraction tend to be in the lexicon, typically used to decouple the great complexity of lexically oriented descriptions from the intuitive definitions often expected from dictionary coders.",
        "As illustration, without entering into discussion of the underlying complexity, for which we unfortunately do not have space here, we give an external form of a lexical entry for some of the senses of the German verb traeumen.",
        "This is a real entry taken from an HPSG-inspired analysis mapping into a quite sophisticated situation semantics representation.",
        "All of the necessary information is encoded into the four lines of the entry; the expansions of Pref, Loctype and Subcat are all themselves written in ud.",

        "We cope with this by defining an argument to the unifier as a pair <I,K>, consisting of an information structure belonging to one of the types listed in section 2, plus an agenda which holds the set of as yet unresolved constraints K which potentially hold over I.

        "In very many circumstances it may well be legitimate to take no further action - for example where the output from a linguistic processor will be passed to some other device for further treatment, or where one solution is adequate and at least one of the Ki is empty.",

        "(Incidentally, they can be introduced, as in ud, without compromising declarativeness and monotonicity, which are arguably, from a practical point of view, more important considerations.)",
        "On a more pragmatic note, ud has been running now without observable error for almost a year on descriptions of substantial subsets of French and German, and we have only once had to intervene on the depth bound, which defaults to zero (this was when someone tried to use it to run Prolog programs).",
        "In practice, users seem to need the extra power very sparingly, perhaps in one or two abstractions in their entire description, but then it seems to be crucially important to the clarity and elegance of the whole descriptive structure (list appending operations, as in HPSG, for example, may be a typical case).",

        "We have also implemented a fully generalised disjunction (as oppposed to the atomic value disjunction described in section 2) using the same lazy strategy to avoid exploding alternatives unnecessarily.",
