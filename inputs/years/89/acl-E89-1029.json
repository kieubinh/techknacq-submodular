        "Much recent work on specifying grammars for fragments of natural languages, and on producing computational systems which make use of these grammars, has used partial descriptions of complex feature structures (Gazdar 1988).",
        "Grammars are specified in terms of partial descriptions of syntactic structures; programs that depend on these grammars perform some variant of unification in order to investigate the relationship between specific strings of words and the syntactic structures permitted by the grammar – is some sentence grammatical, what actually is its syntactic structure, how can some partially specified structure be realised as a string of words, and so on.",
        "Nearly all existing unification grammars of this kind use either term unification (the kind of unification used in resolution theorem provers, and hence provided as a primitive in PROLOG) or some version of the graph unification proposed by Kay (1985) and Shieber (1984).",
        "We propose an extension to the languages used by Kay and Shieber for describing graphs, and to the specification of the conditions under which graphs unify.",
        "This extension enables us to write concise descriptions of syntactic phenomena which would be awkward to specify using the original notations.",
        "We do not argue that our extension makes it possible to de.",
        "scribe any phenomena which could not have bees described at all using the existing notations, just that the descriptions using the extension are more concise."

        "The syntax of GSL has been kept as close as possible to that of FUG (Kay 1985) in order to facilitat, comparisons.",
        "It is not, unfortunately, possible ti keep it close to both FUG and PATR (Shiebe: 1984), but it should be possible for readers familiar with PATR to see roughly what the relatioi between the two is.",
        "A node descriptor consists of either an atomi symbol, e.g. agr, cat, bar, or of two atomi symbols separated by a slash, e.g. cat/C head/OBJECT.",
        "In the first case the symbol is th, value of the described node, in the second the symbol before the slash is the node's value and th symbol after it is its name.",
        "We will generally us lower case words for values and upper case one for names, but the distinction between upper an■ lower case has no significance in GSL.",

        "A set of paths with identical initial segments may be specified by writing the initial segment just once and including the divergent tails within nested brackets, so that A=B=C=(X=Y, W=(V=U, Q=R)) is a shorthand form for: A=B=C=X=Y, A=B=C=W=V=U, A – B C – W – QR The sub-graph governed by a path is the set of all terminal sequences of paths whose initial sequence matches the given path.",
        "The last node in the given path is called the root of the sub-graph governed by the path.",

        "The major differences between GSL and the languages used by Kay and Shieber are that GSL distinguishes between optional and mandatory nodes, and that names (which function as the constraints for turning trees into graphs) can be attached to non-terminal nodes.",
        "GSL also differs from FUG in that it does not provide a facility for disjunctive graphs – disjunction is catered for by requiring the grammar and lexicon to contain explicit alternatives, rather than by permitting graphs themselves to contain options.",

        "All the paths which appear in any of these extensions must also be included in E. Again if the sub-graph associated with any such name fails to have a common extension with either G1 or G2 then G1 and G2 themselves do not unify.",
        "(ii) Suppose V appears as the value of one or more initial nodes in G1 but of none in G2.",
        "Then if V is a mandatory terminal node of any path in G1 of which it is the initial node then G1 and G2 do not have a common extension (since V is mandatory in 01, but does not appear as an initial node of any path in G2).",
        "Otherwise the common extension of 01 and G2, if it exists, must include all the paths in G1 for which V is an initial node.",
        "The same condition applies if V is the value of one or more initial nodes in G2 but of none in 01.",

        "We will illustrate the use of GSL with elements of a categorial grammar for a fragment of English.",
        "GSL is not specifically designed for categorial grammar, but the complexity of the category structures of any non-trivial categorial grammar means that such grammars provide a good testbed for notations for describing categories.",
        "Although categorial grammars have recently received considerable attention (Pareschi & Steedman (1987), Klein & van Benthem (1987), Oehrle, Bach & Wheeler (1987)), computational treatments have been hindered by the need to develop and manipulate large category descriptions.",
        "The expressive power of GSL is therefore well illustrated by the ease with which we can develop the category descriptions required for a non-trivial categorial grammar.",
        "We start with the basic categorial rules: (major/X, minor/Y, subcat/SUB, slash/SLASH)",
        "(HEAD=(major/X, minor/Y, subcat/SUB, slash/SLASH), LSLASH=(major/X1, minor/Y1, subcat/SUB1, slash/SLASH), slash/SLASH) The first of these is an extended version of the normal categorial rule for combining something which requires an argument to its right with an argument of the appropriate type, namely: A A/B B We have been forced to complicate this rule, as have others trying to produce categorial grammars for non-trivial fragments, in order to take into account intrinsic syntactic functions such as case and number agreement, and to deal with the fine details of sub-categorisation rules.",
        "In our extended version of the basic rule, the A of the basic version is replaced by (major/X, minor/Y, subcat/SUB, slash/SLASH) and the B of the basic version by (major/X1, minor/Y/, subcat/SUB1, slash/SLASH).",
        "The major features of a category are simply its main category (noun, verb, preposition, conj) and its bar level (zero, one, two).",
        "The minor features are the intrinsic syntactic features such as agr and aux.",
        "subcat specifies what arguments (Islas!\" and rslash) are required and what the head (head) of the local tree described by the rule is like.",
        "slash, as usual in unification grammars, carries information about unbounded dependencies.",
        "The category A/B of the basic rule is replaced by: (HEAD.",

        "This describes a structure which will join with a (major/X, minor/Y, subcat/SUB, slash/SLASH, to its right to make a (major/X1, minor/Y/, subcat/SUB1, slash/SLASH).",
        "We have made very little use of the extra facilities provided by GSL in specifying this rule, beyond the convenience of the abbreviations HEAD for subcat=head and RSLASH for subcat=rslash.",
        "Apart from that, we have used names for specifying constraints, but that could easily have been done in any of the standard formalisms; and we have used the exclamation mark to constrain the value of slash on the first element of the right hand side to be null.",
        "The second of the basic rules is sufficiently similar that it requires no further discussion.",
        "To show how the extra power of GSL can help us construct concise descriptions, we will consider two specific examples.",
        "The first is the definition - 214 - of the lexical entry for an auxiliary.",
        "This requires he rt,lh nv in g three macro definitions:",
        "The definition of AUX says that it is a special type of VERB, namely one that will combine with a VP to its right.",
        "The head of the AUX inherits any constraints on the subject of its own rslash.",
        "The definition of VERB says that it is something which does not require anything to its left, and that it will participate in local trees dominated by objects of type VP, with the constraint that the VERB has the same minor features as the VP.",
        "The definition of VP is fairly similar, but it does make use of the facility for placing names in nonterminal positions to enforce two constraints – one between the entire set of minor features of the VP and the minor features of its head, and another between the agr features of the VP and the agr features of its subject.",
        "Although this set of abbreviations appears only to call upon the facility for including names for non-terminal nodes once, we can see that if we were to expand the macros inside the definition of AUX there would be two other places where this was done (the definition below still has some macros unexpanded to help keep it readable): AUX (V, 0, minor/X=aux=yes!, LSLASH=null!, H=(V, I, minor/X=vform=agr/AGR, RSLASH=nuIll, H=(S,minor/X), LSLASH/SUBJ=minor=agr/AGR), RSLASH=(VP, LSLASH/SUBJ)) It is worth noting that nowhere in either the expanded definition or in the three abbreviations is the major category of the subject specified.",
        "This information may be inherited from the main verb of the VP argument of the auxiliary, but otherwise its major category is unconstrained, in order to permit sentences like Eating people is going out of fashion and For me to eat you would he the height of impropriety.",
        "It is assumed that the lexical entries for verbs will sub-categorise for NP, VP or S subjects as required, just as they sub-categorise for complements.",
        "The second example of the use of GSL features comes from a group of rules which describe alternative sub-categorisation frames – rules which say, for instance, that a typical ditransitive verb has a case frame requiring two NP's rather than an NP and a PP.",
        "The rule below generates the \"auxinverted\" case frame for AUX's: (V, 0, minor=vform/VFORM=agr/AGR, RSLASH=(NP,minor=(SUBJ, agr/AGR), slash=null!",
        "), HEAD=(major=cat=partial!, RSLASH/A2, HEAD=(S, minor=(vform/VFORM, mood=interrogative!))))",
        "(AUX, minor=(vform/VFORM=finite=tensed!",
        "), RSLASH/A2) This rule again specifies names for non-terminal nodes, with VFORM twice being used as a name for a non-terminal node.",
        "The effect of this is to constrain the relevant item to be tensed and to share the same value for agr as its \"inverted\" subject.",
        "The rule also contains a number of mandatory features.",
        "The path mi-nor=vform=finite =tensed!, for instance, restricts the rule to cases of tensed auxiliaries.",
        "We cannot use examples to \"prove\" that GSL makes it possible to write more concise specifications than we could write in FUG or PATR.",
        "This is particularly clear when the examples are culled from a grammar whose overall structure imposes constraints which can only be motivated by considering the grammar as a whole (which we do not have space for), rather than by looking at the examples in isolation.",
        "The best we can hope for is that the examples do seem to describe the constructions they are aimed at fairly concisely; and perhaps that it is not all that obvious how you would describe them in PATR or FUG.",

        "Quoting times for analysing specific texts is a fairly meaningless way of comparing parsers, let alone unification algorithms, since there are so many unspecified parameters – size of the grammar, degree of ambiguity in the lexicon, speed of the basic machine, ... All I can say is that left-corner chart parsing with categorial rules specified via GSL descriptions of categories is markedly quicker than naive top-down left-right parsing of grammars of comparable coverage written as DCGs."
