        "Another aspect is that it ought to be able to keep up also with piecemeal changes of previous input.",
        "For example, in changing one word in the beginning of some utterance(s), one would not want all the input (either from the beginning or from the change point) to be completely reanalysed.",
        "From the perspective of efficiency as well as of modelling intelligent behaviour, the amount of processing required to analyse an update ought to be somehow correlated with the difficulty of this update.",
        "Thus, a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for realizing a real-time parsing system as suggested above is an interactive and incremental parsing system.",

        "According to this view, an incremental parser constructs the analysis of an utterance bit by bit (typically from left to right), rather than in one go when it has come to an end.",
        "The other sense of \"incremental\" stresses the necessity of efficiently handling arbitrary changes within current input.",
        "Thus, according to this view, an incremental parser should be able to efficiently handle not only piecemeal additions to a sentence, but, more generally, arbitrary insertions and deletions in it.",
        "This view of incremental parsing is typical of research on interactive programming environments, e.g. Lindstrom (1970), Earley and Caizergues (1972), Ghezzi and Mandrioli (1979, 1980), Reps and Teitelbaum (1987).",
