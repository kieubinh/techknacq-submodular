        "In the version of categorial grammar (henceforth, CG) developed by Bar-Hillel (Bar-Hillel 1953), categories encode both constituency and linear precedence.",
        "Linear precedence is encoded by (a) ordering valencies in a list and (b) using directional slashes indicating whether the argument is to be found to the left or to the right of the functor.",
        "A similar approach is adopted in Unification Categorial Grammar (UCG) (Zeevat, Klein and Calder 1987) as regards word order whereby the directional slash is replaced by a binary Order feature with value pre or post.",
        "Thus, S/NP\\NP in normal CG translates as S/NP:pre/NP:post in UCG, wherepre indicates that the functor must precede the argument and post that it should follow it.",
        "Our work on French syntax supports the claim that the complicated pattern of French linearity phenomena can be treated in a framework closely related to UCG but which departs from it in two ways.",
        "First, there is no rigid assignment of an order value (pre or post) to verb valencies.",
        "Second, following (Gunji 1986) verbal valencies are viewed as forming a set rather than a list.",
        "As",
        "a result, the syntactic behaviour of constituents is dissociated from surface ordering.",
        "Constraints on word order are described by a system of features as advocated in (Uszkoreit 1987) and (Karttunen 1986)."

        "In UCG, the phonological, categorial, semantic and order information associated with a word is contained in a single grammar structure called a sign.",
        "This can be represented as follows.",
        "Phonology :Category :Semantics :Order where colons separate the different fields of the sign.",
        "We need not concern ourselves here with the Semantics and the Phonology fields of the sign.",
        "More interesting for our purpose are the Category and the Order attributes.",
        "Following the categorial tradition, categories can be basic or complex.",
        "Basic categories are of the form Head^Features where Head is one of the atomic symbols n(oun), np or s(entence) and Features is a list of feature values.",
        "Complex categories are of the form C/Sign, where C is either atomic or complex and Sign is a sign, so that departing from traditional CG' s, a functor places constraints on the whole sign of the argument rather than on its syntactic category only.",
        "The part of a complex category which omits the HeadAFeatures information constitutes the active part of the sign.",
        "The first accessible sign in the active part is called the active sign, the idea being that e.g. verb valencies are ordered in a list so that each time a valency is consumed, the next sign in the active part becomes the new active sign.",
        "The Order attribute places constraints on the combination rule that may apply to a functor : pre on an argument sign Y indicates that the functor X/Y must precede the argument, while post indicates that the functor must follow the argument.",
        "Using terms and term unification, the forward version' of functional application can then be stated as follows.",

        "were upper letters indicate Prolog variables.",
        "In effect, the rule requires that the active part of the functor sign term unifies with the argument sign.",
        "The Result is a sign identical to the functor sign, but where the complex category is stripped from its active part and where variables shared by the active part of the functor and the rest of the functor sign may have become ground as a result of the active part unifying with the argument.",
        "The resulting phonology consists of the phonology of the functor followed by the phonology of the argument.",
        "An illustrative combination is given in (3) below for the sentence Jean marche.",
