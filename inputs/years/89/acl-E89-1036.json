        "In devising a machine translation system of telephone dialogues, one of the problems is how to adequately translate the underlying meaning of the source utterance, or the speaker's intention, into the target language.",
        "Such a concern is rarely observed in conventional machine translation research, which has focused on strictly grammatical translation divorced from consideration of the speaker's situation and intentions (Tsujii and Nagao 1988).",
        "However, in dialogue, smoothness of communication depends on perceiving the speaker's intention.",
        "Especially when dealing with different language family pairs such as Japanese and English, it is necessary to have a methodology of treating language-specific communication strategies in a universal framework.",

        "Extra-grammatical sentence patterns such as intra-sentential correction, stammering, and inversion are not treated either.",
        "Our framework for translating speaker's intention is based on twc notions, Illocutionary Force Types (IFTs), i.e. e classification of the .speaker's intentions, and Decision Parameters (DPs), i.e. feature, representing different factors relevant to speech-act-related expressions.",
        "Though plan-based approaches to speech acts such as Allen and Perrault (1980) are ideal, too little is known in this field to apply it to actual natural languagE processing.",
        "Therefore, we adopt here a moderate intrasentential, syntactic method that can servE as further input to plan-based approaches.",
        "In section 2 of this paper we discuss the relation between intention and speech-act indirectness, and call intention thus describec \"speaker's meaning.\"",
        "In section 3 we define IFTs In section 4 we fully utilize syntactic constraint, in Japanese in order to extract Ins from input utterances.",
