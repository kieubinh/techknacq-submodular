Seit as a German preposition in one of its readings is linked into U MG as a concept that specializes a more general relation `g-spatio-temporar in UMG• The UMG 'g-spatiotemporal' is further linked, by the preparatory mapping already defined between the English and German upper models, to a UME concept 'static-spatial' and this UME category guides the responses to Penman's inquiries to consider all the grammatical constructs and lexical items of English that Nigel has available for realizing this concept.",
