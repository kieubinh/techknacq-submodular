        "Theoretical research as part of machine translation often aims at finding an appropriate formalism.",

        "In other words, the question is in what way the idea of compositionality is to be defined within a particular formalism.",
        "An answer to this question from an interlingual perspective is given in the literature on the Rosetta system (e.g. Landsbergen 1985).",
        "The CAT frame work (e.g. Arnold et al.",
        "1986) was meant to be an answer to the same question, this time for a transfer system viz. the Eurotra system.",
        "The MiMo formalism is a re action to the CAT framework and tries to solve severs translation problems by formulating an alternative definition of compositionality.",
        "Phenomena involving anaphor 1 such as wh-movement and the coindexation of pronomi nals often cause problems for strictly compositional system since translation of one word depends on (the translatioi of) another word, one which can be quite far away in the sentence.",
        "Rosetta tackles this problem by distinguishing between rules that are significant with respect to the corn positionality of translation, so-called meaningful rules, am rules that are not, referred to as transformations (Appel∎ et al.",
        "1987); in this way the system is not compositional ii the strict sense anymore.",
        "The notion of compositionalit: MiMo adheres to is defined in such a way that anaphoric relations can be translated compositionally as well.",
        "In thi paper we will introduce the anaphoric component of till MiMo formalism.",
        "It is used to define linguistic phenomena such as wh-movement, the binding of reflexives and pro nouns, the passive and control phenomena monolingually The formalism will be discussed by means of an extensive description of a possible analysis of wh-movement.",
        "In the next section, we will first discuss and motivate some of the more fundamental characteristics of the MiMo translation system.",
        "Section two will sketch the MiMo formalisn",
        "as far as necessary for understanding what will follow.",
        "The component that deals with the treatment of anaphora will be discussed in section 3.",
        "In the fourth section the actual working of the component will be shown by an elaborate discussion of wh-movement.",

        "In this paper we showed the need for a non-standard notion of compositionality in translation.",

        "In MiMo, anaphoric relations are defined by a separate type of rule.",
        "This enables linguists to define anaphoric relations in a declarative and modular way.",
        "It appeared that linguistic generalizations can be defined quite naturally and generally.",
        "It is up to the linguist to decide which generalizations are to be preferred and how they can best be expressed.",
        "We chose to formulate principles in a general way.",
        "The relation 'subjacent' was meant to serve all languages.",
        "Restrictions, e.g. by semantic features, can be added freely.",
        "The definitions relate to information that is encoded in the language-specific lexicon.",
        "This produces the variations that exist across languages.",
        "The use of a separate type of rule enables a compositional definition of the translation of anaphoric relations because the applied rules are still visible - as annotations - in the structure to be translated.",
        "The translation of an I-object was defined as the translation of the I-structure to which the translations of the anaphoric rules applied.",
        "The translation of an anaphoric rule is the target equivalent of that rule.",
        "This point of view poses problems in cases where the source language is less restrictive than the target language.",
        "In that case, special rules have to be written to assign a translation nonetheless.",
        "When a particular relation (read also : interpretation) has been established in the source language, it should be present in the target language.",
        "All interpretations should be translated of course.",
        "This is not yet possible in the current system when unboundedly deep relations need to be seen in the transfer component."
