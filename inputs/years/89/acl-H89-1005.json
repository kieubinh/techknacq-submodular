        "Speaker independent phonetic transcription of fluent speech is performed using an ergodic continuously variable duration hidden Markov model (CVDHMM) to represent the acoustic, phonetic and phonotac tic structure of speech.",
        "An important property of the model is that each of its fifty-one states is uniquely identified with a single phonetic unit.",
        "Thus, for any spoken utterance, a phonetic transcription is obtained from a dynamic programming (DP) procedure for finding the state sequence of maximum likelihood.",
        "A model has been constructed based on 4020 sentences from the TIMIT database.",
        "When tested on 180 different sentences from this database, phonetic accuracy was observed to be 56% with 9% insertions.",
        "A speaker dependent version of the model was also constructed.",
        "The transcription algorithm was then combined with lexical access and parsing routines to form a complete recognition system.",
        "When tested on sentences from the DARPA resource management task spoken over the local switched telephone network, phonetic accuracy of 64% with 8% insertions and word accuracy of 87% with 3% insertions was measured.",
        "This system is presently operating in an on-line mode over the local switched telephone network in less than ten times real time on an Alliant FX-80."

      "heading": "INTRODUCTION",
      "text": [
        "Though rarely explicitly stated, a fundamental assumption on which many speech recognition systems are implicitly based is that speech is literate.",
        "That is, it is a code for communication having a small number of discrete phonetic symbols in its alphabet.",
        "These symbols are, however, merely mental constructs and, as such, are not directly accessible but are, instead, observable only in their highly variable acoustic manifestation.",
        "It is also well-known but equally seldom expressed that a hidden Markov model comprises a finite set of discrete inaccessible states observable only via a set of random processes, one associated with each hidden state.",
        "When these two simple ideas are juxtaposed, it seems to us inescapable that the most natural representation of speech by a hidden Markov model is one in which the hypothetical phonetic symbols are identified with the hidden states of the Markov chain and the variability of the measurable acoustic signal is captured by the observable, state-dependent random processes.",
        "The mathematical details of just such a model are given in [6].",
        "Its application to a small-vocabulary continuous speech recognition system and a large-vocabulary isolated word recognition system are described in [7] and [8], respectively.",
        "Here we present a brief overview of the use of this approach in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition and some preliminary results of two experiments performed with it on the TIMIT [4] and DARPA [9] databases."

      "text": [
        "We have constructed two models, a 51 state model on which the speaker-independent phonetic transcription results are based, and a 43 state model on which the speaker-dependent recognition of sentences from the DARPA resource management task are founded.",
        "The 51 states in the first model correspond to 51 of the phonetic symbols used in the standard transcriptions of the TIMIT sentences.",
        "The 43 states of the second model are associated with the 43 symbols used in the pronunciation guide of the Collins English dictionary [1].",
        "The phonetic units are listed in figure 1.",
        "Flap and closure units are not included in the 43 state model.",
        "Both models are of the same form, CVDHMM, as described in the reference cited earlier.",
        "The state transition matrices define ergodic Markov chains and weakly capture the phonotactic structure of English.",
        "The acoustic measurements are represented by 26-dimensional Gaussian density functions.",
        "The first twelve coordinates are LPC based cepstra; the second twelve, delta-cepstra [2], and the last two, log energy and its time-derivative, respectively.",
        "The temporal structure of the acoustic signal is reflected in the durational densities which are of the two-parameter gamma family.",
        "Because of the presence of the durational densities, self-transitions are forbidden."

      "heading": "PARAMETER ESTIMATION",

        "The parameters for both the 51 and 43 state models were estimated in the same way although on different training data.",
        "In both cases, the state transition matrix was computed from bigram statistics extracted from the Collins dictionary.",
        "No attempt was made to count bigrams resulting from word junctures.",
        "Also, in both cases, the respective databases were segmented by hand and labeled with respect to the appropriate phonetic alphabet.",
        "Acoustic observations were sorted into sets corresponding to the phonetic symbols.",
        "The necessary parameters, spectral means and covariances and durational means and standard deviations, were then calculated for each set independently.",
        "No parameter optimization was applied to these estimates.",
        "The 51 state speaker-independent model was trained on 4200 sentences of TIMIT data.",
        "Ten different sentences were selected from each of 402 different speakers.",
        "The 43 state speaker-dependent model was trained on one reading of the 450 sentences in the TIMIT phonetically balanced list by a single male speaker.",
        "These utterances were recorded over the local switched telephone network with a conventional telephone handset.",
        "At this writing, we have yet to train a speaker-independent model using the DARPA training material.",
        "Although we expect to do so, we are concerned about its utility since the phonetic contexts in this database are rather restrictive compared with those of the TIMIT sentences."

        "We define the likelihood of a word on an observation subsequence to be the joint likelihood of the standard phonetic transcription for that word as given in the lexicon and the phonetic transcription of that subsequence provided by the transcription algorithm.",
