        "As part of another DARPA program, we have been working since 1982 on a more advanced speech recognition system based on using Hidden Markov Models.",

        "The two features that have made the largest improvements in recognition accuracy since 1982 were the use of robust context-dependent phonetic models, and the addition of derivative spectral parameters in multiple codebooks.",

        "The BYBLOS system uses context-dependent hidden Markov models (HMM) of phonemes to provide a robust model of coarticulation [1, 21.",
        "Each phoneme is typically modeled as a HMM with three states that correspond roughly to the acoustics of the beginning, middle, and end of the phoneme.",
        "To model the acoustic coarticulation between phonemes, we define a separate HMM for each phoneme in each of its possible contexts.",
        "Since many of these phonetic contexts do not occur frequently enough to allow robust estimation of model parameters, we interpolate the detailed context-dependent phonetic models with models of the same phoneme that are dependent on less context.",
        "In this way we derive the benefit of word-based models for words with sufficient training and the generality of phoneme-based models for the rest.",
        "For example, we use triphone models that depend jointly on the preceding and following phonemes, we use diphone models that depend separately on the preceding or following",
        "context, and we use context-independent models that are pooled across all instances of the phoneme.",
        "We have also experimented with models of the phoneme that depend on the particular word that the phoneme is in [3].",
        "We average the probabilities of the different context-dependent models with weights that depend on the state within the phoneme and on the number of occurrences of each type of context in the training set.",
        "With each state of the HMM we associate a conditional probability density of the spectral features given that state.",
        "The basic spectral features are mel-scaled cepstral coefficients (MFCC) [4] and the log of the normalized total energy.",
        "We derive the MFCC by warping the log power spectrum of each frame of speech before computing the cepstrum (by inverse Fourier transform).",
        "A portion of the training set of MFCC vectors is clustered to produce a codebook of spectral prototypes [5].",
        "We typically use a codebook with 256 prototypes.",
        "Then for each frame we find the index of the nearest vector quantizer (VQ) prototype.",
        "The discrete probability density is therefore represented as a vector of 256 numbers indicating the probability of each VQ index given the state.",
        "The decoding algorithm used in the BYBLOS system has been described in [2].",
        "The algorithm is a time-synchronous beam search for the most likely sequence of words, given the observed speech parameters.",
        "The algorithm is similar to the commonly used Viterbi algorithm with the exception that, when performing the state update within a word, the probability of being in a particular state is derived from the sum of the probabilities at each of the preceding states.",
        "This is contrasted with the standard Viterbi algorithm, in which we use the maximum over the preceding states.",
        "This algorithm more nearly computes the correct likelihood function for each sequence of words and was found to result in a small but consistent improvement over the standard Viterbi algorithm.",
        "As with the Viterbi algorithm, the search can be constrained by any finite-state grammar.",

        "During the past year we modified the BYBLOS system to use multiple sets of features.",
