        "Contextual knowledge has traditionally been used in multi-sentential textual understanding systems.",
        "In contrast, this paper describes a new approach toward using contextual, dialog-based knowledge for speech recognition.",
        "To demonstrate this approach, we have built MINDS, a system which uses contextual knowledge to predictively generate expectations about the conceptual content that may be expressed in a system user's next utterance.",
        "These expectations are expanded to constrain the possible words which may be matched from an incoming speech signal.",
        "To prevent system rigidity and allow for diverse user behavior, the system creates layered predictions which range from very specific to very general.",
        "Each time new information becomes available from the ongoing dialog, MINDS generates a different set of layered predictions for processing the next utterance.",
        "The predictions contain constraints derived from the contextual, dialog level knowledge sources and each prediction is translated into a grammar usable by our speech recognizer, SPHINX.",
        "Since speech recognizers use grammars to dictate legal word sequences and to constrain the recognition process, the dynamically generated grammars reduce the number of word candidates considered by the recognizer.",
        "The results demonstrate that speech recognition accuracy is greatly enhanced through the use of predictions."

      "text": [
        "One of the primary problems in speech recognition research is effectively analyzing very large, complex search spaces.",
        "As search space size increases, recognition accuracy decreases.",
        "Previous research in the speech recognition area illustrates that knowledge can compensate for search by constraining the exponential growth of a search space and thus increasing recognition accuracy [12, 4, 8].",
        "The most common approach to constraining a search space is to use a. grammar.",
        "The grammars used for speech recognition dictate legal word sequences.",
        "Normally they are used in a strict left to right fashion and embody syntactic and semantic constraints on individual sentences.",
        "These constraints are represented in some form of probabilistic or semantic network which does not change from utterance to utterance [2, 8].",
        "Today, state-of-the-art speech recognizers can achieve word accuracy rates in excess of 95% when using grammars of perplexity 30 - 60.",
        "As the number of word alternatives at each point in time increases (or as perplexity increases) performance of these systems decreases rapidly.",
        "Given this level of performance, recently researchers have begun using speech in computer problem solving applications.",
        "Using speech as an input medium for computer applications has resulted in two important findings.",
        "First, the grammars necessary to ensure some minimal coverage of a user's language have perplexities which are an order of magnitude larger than those used in today's high performing speech systems [18].",
        "Second, the use of speech in problem solving tasks permits knowledge sources beyond the sentence level to be used to compensate for the extra search entailed by the increased perplexities.",
        "There are two reasons why higher level, contextual knowledge sources can be used to reduce the effective search space: first, the input does not consist of isolated, spoken sentences; second, all input is goal directed.",
        "There are many knowledge 'This research was conducted with the help of Alexander G. Hauptmann, Wayne H. Ward, Edward T. Smith and Philip Werner.",

        "sources above the sentence level.",
        "Some of these include inferring plans, using context across clausal and sentence boundaries, determining local and global constraints on utterances and dealing with definite and pronominal reference.",
        "Work in the natural language community has shown that these knowledge sources are important for understanding language.",
        "The representation and use of goals and the plans to accomplish them have received much attention in the artificial intelligence literature [13, 14, 5].",
        "Furthermore, natural language research has demonstrated that goals, plans and context are important for understanding implied and unexpected information as well as for providing helpful responses [16, 3, 1, 11, 7].",
        "While the importance of contextual, dialog-level knowledge sources has been recognized in the natural language community, these knowledge sources have never been applied to the actual speech recognition process.",
        "In the past, contextual, dialog level knowledge sources were used in speech to either correct speech recognition errors [6] or to disambiguate spoken input and perform inferences required for understanding [10, 15, 17].",
        "In these systems, dialog knowledge was applied only to the output of the recognizer.",
        "In this paper, we describe the use of contextual, dialog based knowledge sources to reduce the effective search space for words in a speech signal and report results which illustrate their effect on recognition accuracy.",
        "Our approach uses predictions derived from the contextual knowledge sources to delimit the possible content of an incoming utterance.",
        "These knowledge sources are integrated into a robust speaker-independent, large-vocabulary speech recognition system.",
        "The knowledge sources are used predictively, and are used in conjunction with traditional syntax and semantics to constrain the recognition process by eliminating large portions of the search space for the earliest acoustic phonetic analysis.",
        "At each point in a dialog, we predict the concepts which are likely to occur.",
        "The concepts are expanded into possible word sequences which are combined with syntactic networks to produce a semantic grammar.",
        "To avoid system rigidity which could result from unfulfilled predictions, we generate predictions at different levels of specificity by using our knowledge sources opportunistically.",
        "This results in a flexible robust system which displays graceful recognition degradation.",
        "Our approach is demonstrated in a system called MINDS.",
        "MINDS works in a resource management domain, featuring information obtained from a database of facts about ships in the United States Navy.",
        "The basic problem scenario involves determining what to do about a disabled ship which is performing a specific mission.",
        "The user must determine the impact of the damage on the mission and then determine whether to replace the ship, replace the damaged equipment, delay the mission, etc.",
        "These decisions are made based upon the availability of other ships, which is determined by querying the database.",
        "The paper begins with a description of the knowledge sources used in the MINDS system and their representation.",
        "Then the use of the knowledge sources by the recognizer is addressed.",
        "Finally, results which show the effect of the knowledge sources on speech recognition accuracy are presented."
