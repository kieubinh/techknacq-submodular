        "As systems become more habitable and allow users to speak naturally, speech recognizers and parsers are going to have to deal with events not present in written text or read speech.",
        "Spontaneous speech contains a number of phenomena that cause problems for current systems.",
        "• filled pauses - noises made by the speaker that don't correspond to words (ah, uh, um, etc).",
        "• restarts - repeating a word or phrase.",
        "The original word or phrase may be complete or truncated.",
        "• interjections - extraneous phrases as in \"on line thirty, I guess it is\".",
        "• unknown or mispronounced words • ellipsis • ungrammatical constructions - Users make errors of agreement (sub-verb, number, etc) and may use constituents in unusual orders (\"to the utilities cell add fifty dollars\").",
        "These phenomena violate constraints currently used by speech recognizers to increase performance.",
        "This can cause complete recognition failure for an utterance.",
        "In his paper on habitability, Watt (1968) characterizes the problem as a difference between COMPETENCE and PERFORMANCE.",
        "We must recognize what people say, not what they think is grammatical.",
        "In real dialogs, much can be understood from context and is left out of utterances.",
        "Ellipsis is very common.",
        "Many elliptical utterances are not just deletions from expected well-formed sentences.",
        "Consider the utterances \"okay .. expenses .. mortgage seven forty eight point fifty seven .. car payment .",
        "two forty three .",
        "point twenty seven .",
        "bank surcharge .",
        "fifteen dollars\".",
        "The focus is the information to be transferred, a label specification and an amount.",
        "Each utterance is the simplest expression of the neccessary information with no other embroidery.",
        "The solution to this problem must involve both parsing and recognition strategies.",
        "It must resolve the competeing aims of reducing search space and remaining flexible to the unexpected.",
        "Our approach is a combination of specific modelling of acoustic properties and a flexible control structure."

      "text": [
        "Current state-of-the-art speech recognition systems make several assumptions about the input in order to increase performance:",
        "• A single well-formed sentence is spoken.",
        "Well-formed means acceptable to the system's language model.",
        "• Only words in the system's lexicon are used.",
        "• The sentence is delimited by pauses with no internal pauses.",
        "• There is no extraneous noise.",
        "Every part of the input should be matched against a word model.",
        "These assumptions allow the system to enforce constraints of continuity and gramaticallity.",
        "That is, they attempt to find a grammatical sequence of words that spans the entire utterance.",
        "Some word model (or silence) must be matched against all areas of the input.",
        "The input is searched left-to-right for legal sequences of words.",
        "Previously recognized word boundaries are used as the starting point for subsequent words and only words constituting legal extensions of current paths are considered.",
        "Legal word sequences are defined by a language model.",
        "This model may be a grammar or sequence transition probabilities derived from a corpus.",
        "If the recognizer does not correctly recognize a portion of the input, for subsequent portions of the input it is no longer searching for the correct words at the correct boundaries.",
        "This leads to misrecognition, and the user has no option but to repeat the sentence, perhaps rephrasing it.",
        "These constraints serve to reduce the search space for an utterance.",
        "Giving up grammar constraints during recognition may allow the system to recover more quickly after an error, but there will be more errors in well-formed utterances due to lesser constraint and the resulting strings must still be parsed.",
        "Likewise, word-spotting (starting every word at every frame) to produce a word lattice is not enough.",
        "Words must still be joined into sequences to form a sentence.",
        "It is neccessary to allow interruptions in the grammar and in the recognition.",
        "The recognizer must be allowed to search for words that do not form grammatical extensions of a current hypothesis.",
        "It must also allow some areas to go unmatched (in the case of an unknown word)."

        "Semantic components or cases can be compared instead of syntactic structures.",
        "\"In brief, the encoding of domain semantics and canonical structure for multiple surface manifestations makes case frame instantiation a much better basis for robust resolution than semantic grammars.\"",
        "The general idea is to isolate the error and use recognized areas on both sides to give more information as to what is missing or repeated.",
        "The entire utterance is parsed, filling in as much of the case frame as possible.",
        "If there is unparsed input and the frame is complete, the input can be treated as spurious.",
        "If there is a gap in the structure (unfilled elements) then the unrecognized element was probably a filler for that component.",
        "If the same case is filled by more than one element, then the first can be ignored.",
        "The user should be made aware of any of these conditions.",
        "If there is a gap in the semantics, the system must engage in a clarification dialog with the user.",
        "This interaction can be very focused since the system now has an expectation of the semantic type that is missing.",
        "Unfortunately, we cannot use their recovery strategies directly.",
        "We wish to use grammar predictively to constrain the word search.",
        "In speech the correct input string is not known and only strings that are searched for are produced.",
        "For example, it is obvious in a typed interface when the system is given an unknown word.",
        "A speech recognizer will never produce a word not in its lexicon.",
        "The effect of an unknown word in the input is that all words in the system lexicon that are legal extensions of current paths are matched against that area of the input.",
        "Those that match sufficiently well will extend their paths across the area, but the correct word will of course not be searched for.",
        "Unless some other word has an acceptable acoustic match and similar grammatical role, no path will be correctly aligned with the input.",
        "Similarly, such a system will never produce a restart sequence unless it is specifically searched for.",
        "As in the text input systems, we wish to use sentence fragments on both sides of a problem area to help determine what is missing.",
        "This means being able to recognize portions of the utterance that follow an unrecognized region.",
