        "For slightly over a year, we have focused our research effort on the development of a phonetically-based spoken language understanding system called SUMMIT.",
        "Our approach is based on the belief that advanced human/machine communication systems must build on our understanding of the human communication process.",
        "Despite recent development of some speech recognition systems with high accuracy, the performance of such systems typically falls far short of human capabilities.",
        "We are placing heavy emphasis on designing systems that can make use of the knowledge gained over the past four decades on human communication, in the hope that such systems will one day have a performance approaching that of humans.",
        "We are basing the design of our system on the premise that robust speech recognition is tied to our ability to successfully extract the linguistic information from the speech signal and discard those aspects that are extralinguistic.",
        "Like others before us, we have chosen phonemes and other related descriptors such as distinctive features and syllables as the units to relate words in the lexicon to the speech signal.",
        "However, there are several aspects that collectively distinguish our approach from those pursued by others.",
        "First, we believe that many of the acoustic cues for phonetic contrast are encoded at specific times in the speech signal.",
        "Therefore, one must explicitly establish acoustic landmarks in the speech signal in order to fully utilize these acoustic attributes.",
        "Second, unlike previous attempts at explicit utilization of speech knowledge by heuristic means, we seek to make use of the available speech knowledge by embedding such knowledge in a formal framework whereby powerful mathematical tools can be utilized to optimize its use.",
        "Third, the system must have a stochastic component to deal with the present state of ignorance in our understanding of the human communication process and its inherent variabilities throughout.",
        "It is our belief that speech-specific knowledge will enable us to build more sophisticated stochastic models than what is currently being attempted, and to reduce the amount of training data necessary for high performance.",
        "Finally, the ultimate goal of our research is the understanding of the spoken message, and the subsequent accomplishment of a task based on this understanding.",
        "To achieve this goal, we must fully integrate the speech recognition part of the problem with natural language processing so that higher level linguistic constraints can be utilized.",
        "This paper describes those parts of our system dealing with acoustic segmentation, phonetic classification, and lexical access, and documents its current performance on the DARPA Resource Management task [1]."

        "The first stage is a bank of linear filters, equally spaced on a critical-band scale.",
        "This is followed by a nonlinear stage that models the transduction process of the hair cells and the nerve synapses.",
        "The output of the second stage bifurcates, one branch corresponding to the mean firing rate of an auditory nerve fiber, and the other measuring the synchrony of the signal to the fiber's characteristic frequency.",
        "The outputs from various stages of this model are appropriate for different operations in our subsystem.",
        "The nonlinearities of the second stage produce sharper onsets and offsets than are achieved through simple linear filtering.",
        "In addition, irrelevant acoustic information is often masked or suppressed.",
        "These properties make such a representation well-suited for the detection of acoustic landmarks.",
        "The synchrony response, on the other hand, provides enhanced spectral peaks.",
        "Since these peaks often correspond to formant frequencies in vowel and sonorant consonant regions, we surmise that the synchrony representation may be particularly useful for performing fine phonetic distinctions.",

        "Since some of the phonemes can have more than one stable acoustic region, the mapping between phonemes and acoustic region cannot be one-to-one.",
        "Currently, we allow up to two acoustic regions to represent a single phoneme.",
        "This is implemented by creating an acoustic-phonetic (AP) network from the dendrogram that includes all single and paired regions.",

        "To account for the fact that certain paths through the AP network are more likely to occur than others, each segment is assigned a weight.",

        "We believe that the procedure described above is an example of successful knowledge engineering in which the human provides the knowledge and intuition, and the machine provides the computational power.",
        "Frequently, the settings result in a parameter that agrees with our phonetic intuitions.",
        "In this example, the optimal settings for this property detector result in an attribute that closely follows the second formant, which is known to be important for the front/back distinction.",

        "The aggregate of these dimensions describes the contextual variations, which can then be captured in the mapping between the classes and the lexicon.",
        "Our experience indicates that such an approach leads to rapid convergence in the models with only a small number of training tokens for each label.",
        "The current scheme for scoring the N classes begins with N(N – 1)/2 pairwise Gaussian classifiers, each of which uses a subset of the acoustic attributes selected to optimize the discrimination of the pair.",

        "Our evaluation results on phonetic classification indicate that performance is much better for a single speaker than for multiple, unknown speakers.",
        "This result should not be surprising, since the acoustic variability across speakers is much larger than that within a speaker.",
        "One way to assess these results is to compare them to human performance on a similar task.",
        "We have conducted some preliminary listening tests in which subjects were asked to identify a phoneme excised from the same database of multiple speakers with minimal contextual information.",
        "The results suggest that human performance may be at the 60 to 70% level.",
        "An area where further research is definitely needed is the appropriate representation for acoustic-to-lexical mapping.",
        "This includes a more flexible association of phonemes with acoustic segments than is currently allowed, a different choice for the intermediate phonetic representation, and the development of context-dependent models.",
        "Presently the choice of the classes in the first layer of the classifier is somewhat arbitrary.",
        "We believe that an inventory of classes that is based on distinctive feature theory may be more appropriate.",
        "In the first place, the pairwise discrimination analysis is well-suited to a binary feature representation, where phonetic units with contrasting feature values logically define the two sets to be discriminated.",
        "Similarly, context-dependent lexical labels in the second stage could also be mapped to a feature-based form to take into account allophonic variations.",
        "For example, an /x/ followed by a nasal and an /x/ followed by an alveolar would be marked with the right context [+ nasalized] and [+ alveolar], respectively.",
        "Thus, the vowel in the word \"can\" would be pooled with all other instances of /x/ followed by nasals, and, separately, with all other instances of /x/ followed by alveolars (/s,t,d/, etc.",
        "), to form two distinct second-layer mappings.",
        "This approach may provide an elegant way to incorporate context dependency into our recognition system.",
        "It may also help to overcome the sparse data problems inherent in very specific context-dependent models.",
        "The RULE system developed by SRI for phonological expansion has been very useful in providing networks of alternate pronunciations.",
        "Nevertheless, we have recently initiated an effort to develop a pronunciation expansion program that allows researchers to write phonological rules more efficiently and flexibly, and to conform to the architecture of other parts of the SUMMIT system.",
        "We expect that it will be completed within the next two months.",
        "The use of lexical weights was found experimentally to improve the performance of the recognition system by a significant amount.",
        "Note that a similar procedure could be used incrementally to allow the system to adapt to a particular speaker's pronunciation preferences.",
        "One still-unresolved issue has to do with how to combine the scores for the individual matches to form a total score for lexical decoding.",
        "One possibility is to assign equal weight for equal time.",
        "Such a scheme results in an inordinately large weight for long sustained vowels as compared with rapid nonstatic sounds such as stop releases.",
        "Within the segmental framework, we have the capability to explore several alternative approaches.",
        "With a time-normalization scheme, the system can accept a very short erroneous phoneme with a terrible score, but with a per-phoneme weight a reverse effect can occur, where a very long badly-matching phoneme can survive because it gets such little weight.",
        "We have come up with an approach which essentially accumulates a total score without any normalization, but adds to the log-probability estimate with each",
        "update an offset factor that tends to keep the correct answer near zero.",
        "This strategy compared favorably with others that we tried, and also required less computation.",
        "The Viterbi search algorithm is a very efficient mechanism for pruning paths when they merge with better-scoring competitors.",
        "However, it loses a great deal of its advantage when a true language model capable of natural language understanding is incorporated, because many fewer paths can be collapsed into a single equivalent class.",
        "Our hope, however, is that a Viterbi-like pruning strategy can be incorporated into a hierarchical structure representing a syntactic analysis by keeping a record of equivalent subparses locally with each node in the hierarchy.",
        "We plan to pursue this kind of strategy when we join our recognizer with a natural language component.",
        "The word recognition performance of SUMMIT is fairly consistent across test sets.",
        "While it is always difficult to compare the performance of recognition systems directly, the establishment of standard datasets, language model, and evaluation guidelines has made the task a lot easier.",
        "For example, the SPHINX system developed at CMU [14], when evaluated on the '87 Test Set using the word-pair grammar, achieved a word recognition rate of 84% and 93% using 48 and 1000 models.",
        "Our result of 87% on 75 models is quite competitive, using a very different approach to speech recognition than hidden Markov modelling.",
        "However, it is sobering to note that these results fall far short of human performance.",
        "For example, we found that the human word recognition rate for the '89 Test Set was approximately 99.9% for a single listener.",
