        "The present paper argues that the notion of \"intonational structure\" as formulated by Pierrehumbert, Selkirk, and others, can be subsumed under the generalised notion of syntactic surface structure that emerges from a theory of grammar based on a \"Combinatory\" extension to Catego-rial Grammar.",
        "According to this theory, the syntactic structures and the intonation structures of English are identical, and have the same grammar.",
        "Some simplifications appear to follow for the problem of integrating syntax and other high-level modules in spoken language systems.",
        "Phrasal intonation is notorious for structuring the words of spoken utterances into groups which frequently violate orthodox notions of constituency.",
        "For example, the normal prosody for the answer (b) to the following question (a) imposes the intonational constituency indicated by the brackets (stress is indicated by capitals, and an indication of the perceived contour is given): *I am grateful to Julia Hirschberg, Aravind Joshi, Mitch Marcus, Janet Pierrehumbert, and Bonnie Lynn Webber for comments and advice.",
        "They should not be held responsible for any errors in the translation of their advice into the present framework.",
        "The present paper is a revised version of one that appears in the preliminary papers of the March 1989 AAAI symposium on Spoken Language Systems, Stanford CA.",

        "b.",
        "(LEGumes are a good source of) VITamins.",
        "Such a grouping cuts right across the traditional syntactic structure of the sentence.",
        "The presence of two apparently uncoupled levels of structure in natural language grammar appears to complicate the path from speech to interpretation unreasonably, and to thereby threaten a number of computational applications.",
        "Nevertheless, intonational structure is strongly constrained by meaning.",
        "Contours imposing bracketings like the following are not allowed: (2) # Three doctors (in ten prefer cats) Halliday [5] seems to have been the first to identify this phenomenon, which Selkirk [12] has called the \"Sense Unit Condition\", and to observe that this constraint seems to follow from the function of phrasal intonation, which is to convey distinctions of focus, information, and propositional attitude towards entities in the discourse.",
        "These entities are more diverse than mere nounphrase or propositional referents, but they do not include such non-concepts as \"in ten prefer cats.\"",
        "One discourse category that they do include is what E. Prince [11] calls \"open propositions\".",
        "Open propositions are most easily understood as being that which is introduced into the discourse context by a Wh-question.",
        "So for example the question in (1), What are legumes a good source of?",
        "introduces an open proposition which it is most natural to think of as a functional abstraction,",
        "which would be written as follows in the notation of the A-calculus:",
        "(3) Ax[good (source' x) legumes'] (Primes indicate interpretations whose detailed semantics is of no direct concern here.)",
        "When this function or concept is supplied with an argument vitamins', it reduces to give a proposition, with the same function argument relations as the canonical sentence: (4) good'(source' vitaminsTegumes'",
        "It is the presence of the above open proposition that makes the intonation contour in (1) felicitous.",
        "(I am not claiming that its presence determines this response, nor that its presence is necessary for interpreting the response.)",
        "All natural languages include syntactic constructions whose semantics is also reminiscent of functional abstraction.",
        "The most obvious and tractable class are Wh-constructions themselves, in which exactly the same fragments that can be delineated by a single intonation contour appear as the residue of the subordinate clause.",
        "But another and much more problematic class are the fragments that result from coordinate constructions.",
        "It is striking that the residues of wh-movement and conjunction reduction are also subject to something like a \"sense unit condition\".",
        "For example, strings like \"in ten prefer cats\" are not conjoin-able:",
        "(5) *Three doctors in ten prefer cats, and in twenty eat carrots.",
        "While coordinate constructions have constituted another major source of complexity for natural language understanding by machine, it is tempting to think that this conspiracy between syntax and prosody might point to a unified notion of structure that is somewhat different from traditional surface constituency."

        "An entirely unconstrained combinatory grammar would in fact allow more or less any bracketing on a sentence.",
        "However, the actual grammars we write for con-figurational languages like English are heavily constrained by local conditions.",
        "(An example would be a condition on the composition rule that is tacitly assumed here, forbidding the variable Y to be instantiated as NP, thus excluding constituents like *[eat the]vpiN)â€¢ The claim of the present paper is simply that particular surface structures that are induced by the specific combinatory grammar that was introduced to explain coordination in English are identical to the intonational structures that are required to specify the possible intonation contours for those same sentences of English.",
        "More specifically, the claim is that that in spoken utterance, intonation largely determines which of the many possible bracketings permitted by the combinatory syntax of English is intended, and that the interpretations of the constituents are related to distinctions of focus among the concepts and open propositions that the speaker has in mind.",
        "Thus, whatever problems for parsing written text arise from the profusion of equivalent alternative surface structures engendered by this theory, these \"spurious\" ambiguities seem to be to a great extent resolved by prosody in spoken language.",
        "The theory therefore offers the possibility that phonology and parsing can be merged into a single unitary process.",
        "The proof of this claim lies in showing that the rules of combinatory grammar can be annotated with intonation contour schemata, which limit their application in spoken discourse, and to",
        "showing that the major constituents of intonated utterances like (1)b, under the analyses that these rules permit correspond to the focus structure of the context to which they are appropriate, such as (1)a. I shall use a notation which is based on the theory of Pierrehumbert [8], as modified in more recent work by Selkirk [12], Beckman and Pierrehumbert [1], [9], and Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg [10].",
        "I have tried as far as possible to take my examples and the associated intonational annotations from those authors.",
        "I follow Pierrehumbert in assuming two abstract pitch levels, and three types of tones, as follows.",
        "There are two phrasal tones, written H and L, denoting high or low \"simple\" tones â€“ that is, level functions of pitch against time.",
        "There are also two boundary tones, written H% and L%, denoting an intonational phrase-final rise or fall.",
        "Of Pier-rhumberts six pitch accent tones, I shall only be concerned with two, the accent and the L+H*.",
        "The phonetic or acoustic realisation of pitch accents is a complex matter.",
        "Roughly speaking, the L+H* pitch accent that is extensively discussed below in the context of the L+H* LH% melody generally appears as a maximum which is preceded by a distinctive low level, and peaks later than the corresponding il* pitch accent when the same sequence is spoken with the L melody that goes with \"new\" information, and which is the other melody considered below.",
        "In the more recent versions of the theory, Pierrehumbert and her colleagues distinguish two levels of prosodic phrase that include a pitch accent tone.",
        "They are the intonational phrase proper, and the \"intermediate phrase\".",
        "Both end in a phrasal tone, but only intonational phrases have additional boundary tones H% and L%.",
        "Intermediate phrases are bounded on the right by their phrasal tone alone, and do not appear to be characterised in F0 by the same kind of final rise or fall that is characteristic of true intonational phrases.",
        "The distinction does not play an active role in the prosent account, but I shall follow the more recent notation of prosodic phrase boundaries in the examples, without further comment on the distinction.",
        "There may also be parts of prosodic phrases where the fundamental frequency is merely interpolated between tones, notably the region between pitch accent and phrasal tone, and the region before a pitch accent.",
        "In Pierrehumbert's notation, such substrings bear no indication of abstract tone whatsoever.",
        "A crucial feature of this theory for present purposes is that the position and shape of a given pitch accent in a prosodic phrase, and of its phrase accent and the associated right-hand boundary, are essentially invariant.",
        "If the constituent is very short - say, a monosyllabic nounphrase - then the whole intonational contour may be squeezed onto that one syllable.",
        "If the constituent is longer, then the pitch accent will appear at its left edge, the phrasal tone and boundary tone if any will appear at its right edge, and the intervening pitch contour will merely be interpolated.",
        "In this way, the tune can be spread over longer or shorter strings, in order to mark the corresponding constituents for the particular distinction of focus and propositional attitude that the melody denotes.",

        "33] discussion of this example.)",
        "In the second example (15) above, the pitch accents are reversed: this time Fred is L+H* and beans is H*.",
        "The assignment of these tones seem to reflect the fact that (as Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg point out) H* is used to mark information that the speaker believes to be new to the",

        "(If the information were merely given, it would receive no tone in Pierrehumbert's terms â€“ or be left out altogether.)",
        "Thus in (15), the L+H* LH% phrase including this accent is spread across the phrase Fred ate.2 Similarly, in (14), the same tune is confined to the object of the open proposition ate the beans, because the intonation of the original question indicates that eating beans as opposed to some other comestible is the new topic."
