        "Recent theories of focusing and reference rely crucially on discourse structure to constrain the availability of discourse entities for reference, but deriving the structure of an arbitrary discourse has proved to be a significant problem ([Webber 88]).",
        "While progress has been made in identifying the means by which speakers and writers mark structure ([Grosz 86], [Hirschberg 87], [Schiffrin 87], [Webber 88]), much work remains to be done in this area.",
        "As is well known, initial progress in computational approaches to syntax and semantics was facilitated by reducing the problem space to discourses in technical sublanguages, in simplified registers, in restricted domains'.",
        "For Computational Pragmatics, the analysis of explicitly-structured discourse can provide a similar level of problem reduction.",
        "By removing the theoretical obstacle of deriving discourse structure, we can more readily evaluate the effect of this structure on focusing and reference.",
        "In this paper we consider a genre of explicitly-structured discourse, namely the 'form', in which each labelled box and the response within it constitute a discourse segment.",
        "From the perspective of discourse understanding, the study of forms-discourse offers considerable advantages: the structure of the form is predefined and constant across discourses, and it is possible to study patterns of reference in narrative responses without excessive reliance on intuition.",
        "The particular form which we consider here is the Trouble and Failure Report (TFR).",
        "We first discuss the results of an analysis of 331 TFRs, and then describe the implementation of a TFR analysis module using the PUNDIT natural-language processing system.",
        "THE TROUBLE AND FAILURE REPORT TFRs are used to report problems with hardware, software, or documentation on equipment on board Trident and Poseidon submarines.",
        "These reports originate on board the submarine, and those concerning the Navigational Subsystem (which is managed by the Unisys.",
        "Logistics Group) are routed to Unisys for analysis and response.",
        "The TFR contains a formatted section and up to 99 lines of free text.",
        "The formatted section includes coded information identifying the message originator, date, equipment, and failed part.",
        "The free text is divided into 5 sections, labelled A-E, each of which documents a specific aspect of the problem being reported.",
        "A sample hardware TFR is given below2: <Formatted lines...>",
        "TFRs are stored in a historical database.",
        "Although the formatted data can be mapped to specific fields of database records, which can then be accessed by a query language, the free-text portions are stored as undigested blocks of text.",
        "Currently, keyword search is the only method by which the text can be accessed.",
        "Problems with keyword search as a method of information retrieval are well-known3, and this is an area in which NLP techniques can be applied, with potential benefits of increasing the efficiency and accuracy of information retrieval.",
        "As part of an internally and DARPA-funded R&D project, we applied PUNDIT ([Grishman 86a], [Dahl 87], [Dahl 86]) to the analysis of TFRs.",
        "Previous applications of PUNDIT to the analysis of the Remarks field of Navy messages had required only a superficial level of discourse processing above the paragraph.",
        "But the richer discourse structure of TFRs required a more sophisticated approach, including a discourse interpretation module and a segment-based approach to focusing.",
        "But although the discourse structure of TFRs forced a number of issues, the fact that this structure is explicit and constant across discourses greatly facilitated the analysis of TFR discourse, to which we now turn."

        "The Role of the Message Header.",

        "These facts lead us to assign these three entities the distinguished status of global foci: entities which are always salient in the discourse context at the beginning of each new discourse segment.",
        "Sections A-E. To determine whether each of these sections (First indication of trouble, Part failure, Probable cause, Action taken, Remarks) constitutes a discourse segment, we studied patterns of pronominal reference in the responses.",
        "The results were striking.",
        "In 804 occurrences of referential pronouns (707 of which were zero-subjects6), we found that only zero-subjects, I, we, and this refer beyond the boundary of the current request-response pair.",
        "95% of the zero-subjects and all of the occurrences of I refer to the speaker.",
        "The remaining 5% of zero-subjects are distributed between reference to one of the global foci and segment-internal reference, with a slight bias towards the latter.",
        "It, he, they, these, those were found to refer purely locally (that did not occur).",
        "With the exception of this and the indexicals, pronominal reference is sensitive to the boundary of the request-response pair, and we conclude that each such pair is indeed a discourse segment.",
        "In the demonstrative this, however, we found unexpected evidence for additional implicit structure: when occurring in segment E (Remarks), this can refer to the failure, or problem, described in segments AD.",
        "Now, [Webber 88] argues that demonstrative reference of this type is sensitive to the right frontier of the discourse tree: that is, 'the set of nodes comprising the most recent closed segment and all currently open segments' (Webber 1988:114).",
        "If, as we had assumed, segments A-E are sisters, then segment D (Action taken) is the most recently closed segment, and there are no segments open other than the current segment, E. But none of the occurrences of this in segment E refer to segment D. To make sense of the data, we were led to the conclusion that segments AD form an unlabelled, implicit segment: the failure.",
        "The Remarks segment is then the sister of this implicit segment; after closing segment D, this higher segment is closed, and thus lies on the right frontier when E is opened.",

        "Under the covers, however, the approach is quite different: the data-collection program is in fact a discourse manager, controlling and interpreting a dialogue between itself and the user.",
