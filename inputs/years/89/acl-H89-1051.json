      "text": [
        "This paper describes our experiences porting the PUNDIT natural language processing system to the Resource Management domain.",
        "PUNDIT has previously been applied to a range of messages",
        "Reports by C. Ball (appearing in this volume), and also [Hirschman1989].",
        "However, it had not not been tested on any significant corpus of queries, such as that represented by the Resource Management corpus.",
        "Our goal was to assess PUNDIT's portability, and to determine its coverage of syntax over this domain.",
        "Time constraints precluded testing of the semantic component, but we plan to report on this at subsequent meetings.",
        "We performed this port with the intention of coupling PUNDIT to the MIT SUMMIT speech recognition system.",
        "This work is described in another paper in this volume, Reducing Search by Partitioning the Word Network, by J. Dowding.",
        "Our philosophy in porting has been to tune the system to a new domain, rather than rewriting the grammar or building the grammar from scratch.",
        "The rationale for this approach is to continue to develop the coverage of PUNDIT's grammar; each new application should motivate principled extensions to the system that can also apply to other domains.",
        "Thus, over time, the coverage of PUNDIT has grown to cover a very large portion of English, and each succeeding port requires less effort.",
        "The disadvantage of this approach is that as the coverage grows, the grammar becomes \"looser\" -- the number of parses for any given word sequence tends to increase and also the grammar tends to overgenerate, letting through constructions that are not grammatical.",
        "This philosophy is quite different from the \"language modeling\" approach taken by some groups working in speech recognition.",
        "The language modeling approach has as its goal the development of a minimal covering grammar needed to describe the phenomena observed in the particular corpus.",
        "The benefit of the language modeling approach is that it produces a very tight, highly constrained grammar.",
        "The disadvantage is the porting cost, and a very fragile system, whose syntactic boundaries are very easy to exceed.",
        "Our approach to lexicon development has the same focus as our approach to syntactic coverage: to try to capture the general English definitions, rather than to limit ourselves to the particular domain-specific usages encountered in the training data.",
        "The rationale is also similar to that used in the syntactic component: generation of lexical entries is a time-consuming process; our goal is to develop a broad coverage system, so when entering a word in the lexicon, we enter the general English categories for the word.",
        "In many cases, this provides a much more general definition than * This work has been supported in part by DARPA under contract N00014-85-C-0012, administered by the Office of Naval Research; and in part by internal Unisys R&D funding.",
        "what is specifically required by an application.",
        "For example, the 'word alert occurs exclusively as a noun in the Resource Management domain.",
        "However, it must be classified as an adjective and a verb if the entry is made general to English.",
        "The challenge for the broad-coverage grammar/lexicon approach is to develop methods of tuning the grammar and the lexicon to the particular corpus.",
        "It is clear that integration of PUNDIT with a speech recognition system will require that we bring to bear as many constraints as possible, in an attempt to prune the explosive search space that results from indeterminacy in analyzing the acoustic signal.",
        "We discuss several possible approaches to tuning both the grammar and the lexicon in the final section of the paper.",
        "What these results provide is a solid indication that our porting strategy is successful: only a very modest effort was required to obtain reasonable results in the Resource Management domain (85% of the training sentences and 76% of the test sentences received a correct parse, given a porting effort of 10 person-weeks).",
        "The next steps will be to add semantics and pragmatics, and to develop techniques for (semi-) automatically tuning the grammar to a new domain."

        "As mentioned above, in this initial experiment, we undertook only the syntactic processing of the Resource Management training and test corpus.",
        "In the PUNDIT system, the syntactic stage consists of the generation of a detailed surface parse tree and the construction of a regularized Intermediate Syntactic Representation or ISR.",
        "The ISR uses an operator/argument notation to represent the regularized syntax.",
        "The regularization includes insertion of omitted constituents in relative clause constructions or as a result of various raising and equi operations.",

        "The fact that the grammar already contained these constructions made the port possible.",

        "This procedure used PUNDIT's Selection Pattern Query and Response (SPQR) component [Lang1988].",
        "We first used SPQR in acquisition mode, to collect semantic patterns, These patterns were then used to constrain search in parsing the test sentences.",
        "The acquisition procedure queries the \"domain expert\" during parsing, whenever it finds a new pattern, such as a new subject-verb-object pattern, or a new adjective-noun pattern.",
        "The expert declares that the pattern is valid, allowing parsing to continue, or that the pattern is invalid, which causes backtracking to find a different analysis (and associated pattern).",
        "Information about valid and invalid patterns is stored in a pattern database; as the parser generates each phrase, it checks",
        "the pattern database to see whether the expert has ruled on this pattern; if the user has already classified the pattern, then the user need not be queried again.",
        "Thus the system \"learns\" as it parses more sentences.",
        "Following the acquisition (or training) phase, the system can be run in one of two modes: allowing any unknown pattern to succeed (which will overgenerate, assuming that the set of patterns is incomplete), or forcing unknown patterns to fail, which will undergenerate.",
        "To try to obtain maximum coverage of patterns, we generalized the patterns to semantic class patterns, rather than patterns of actual words.",
        "For example, the subject-verb-object word pattern",
        "can be generalized (using the taxonomy provided by the knowledge base) to the semantic class pattern (the suffix _C stands for concept): jplatform_C,change_C,transient_ship_attribute_CJ.",
        "Previous experience had shown that use of word-level selectional patterns reduced the search by 20%, and the number of parses by a factor of three.",

        "We therefore plan to complete our pattern collection on the full training set and rerun our experiment.",

        "The sentences (training and test) were run on PUNDIT, under Quintus Prolog 2.2 on a Sun 3/60 with 8 MB of memory.",
        "Because PUNDIT normally produces many parses, especially when run without selectional constraints, we allowed the system to run to a maximum of 15 parses per sentence.",
        "We report several results below, for purposes of comparison with other groups presenting parsing results.",
        "The first result is the number of sentences obtaining a parse.",
        "We believe that this is not a meaningful figure, however, since it is possible for a sentence to obtain a parse, but never to obtain a correct parse.",
