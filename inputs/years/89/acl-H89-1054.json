        "A common method for modeling local word dependencies is by means of second order Markov models (also known as trigram models).",
        "In such a model the context for predicting word wi at position i in a text consists of the two words wi_2 that precede it.",
        "The model is built from conditional probabilities: P(wi I wi_1, wi-2).",
        "The parameters of a part of speech (POS) model are of the form: P(wi I Ci) x P(Ci I Ci_1, Ci-2).",
        "That is, for word wi a POS category Ci is first predicted, based on the POS categories of the two previous words.",
        "The word wi is then predicted in terms of Ci.",
        "If the vocabulary consists of the set of N words {v1, v2...vN}, then wi_1 and wi_2 range over the elements of this set.",
        "For a model containing M parts of speech, { , S2 ...Sm}, the variables Ci, Ci_1 and Ci _ 2 likewise range over the M elements.",
        "POS language models have been used in speech recognition systems (Dumouchel, Gupta, Lennig and Mermelstein, 1988; Shikano, 1987) and for phoneme-to-text transcription (Derouault and Merialdo, 1986).",
        "In these systems the parameters are obtained from the analysis of an annotated training corpus.",
        "To create the training corpus a set of POS categories is first defined.",
        "A word in the vocabulary may be associated with several POS categories depending on the roles it can play in a sentence.",
        "A suitably large corpus of training text is then manually analyzed and each word of the corpus is annotated with an unambiguous POS category according to its function in the text.",
        "The Brown Corpus has been analyzed this way, using a set of 87 main categories (Francis and Kucera, 1982).",
        "To obtain the parameters of a language model, frequency counts are made and normalized to produce the required sets of parameters.",
        "The problem of training a model, and the reliability of the resulting parameters rests on a laborious manual annotation of a necessarily large amount of training text.",
        "To reduce this burden, a bootstrap method can be used (Derouault and Merialdo, 1986).",
        "First a relatively small amount of text is annotated, to create a partial model.",
        "The partial model is then used to automatically annotate more text, which is then corrected manually, and used to retrain the model.",
        "Here, an alternative approach has been taken to the training problem, which is based on work by Jelinek (Jelinek, 1985a).",
        "In this approach, a POS language model is viewed as a Hidden Markov model (HMM).",
        "That is, a word sequence reflects an underlying sequence of parts of speech, which is hidden from the observer.",
        "The advantage of considering the model in such terms is that the need for an annotated training corpus is eliminated, resulting in greater flexibility.",
        "The model can be trained with alternative sets of POS categories, and can accommodate special POS categories that are defined for specialized domains.",
        "Another advantage is that the method can be applied to other languages.",
        "To train a model requires the following:",
        "1.",
        "A suitably large training corpus of text (that is not annotated).",
        "2.",
        "A vocabulary of words occurring in the corpus, where each word is associated with a list of all the possible parts of speech it can assume.",
        "3.",
        "Estimates of the frequency of occurrence P(vi)...P(vN) of the words in the vocabulary.",
        "These are used to set initial probability values in the model.",
        "The HMM used for the work is based on the implementation of Rabiner, Levinson and Sondhi (Rabiner et al., 1983).",
        "A first order HMM was used as a starting point because the resources required to train it are significantly less than for a second order model, and thus facilitate experimentation.",
        "Twenty-one parts of speech were used, corresponding to traditional POS categories such as determiner, adverb, preposition, noun, noun-plural, verb-progressive, verb-past-participle etc.",
        "In the model described here, the elements of the output matrix have been assigned to word equivalence classes rather than individual words.",
        "This is due to the observation that in unrestricted domains, the number N of different word types that can occur is so large it precludes practical estimation of the required number of parameters P(wi I Ci).",
        "Words are partitioned into L equivalence classes All words that can function as a noun only are in one equivalence class, and all words that can function as either a noun or adjective are in another class, and so on.",
        "A total of L = 129 equivalence classes were used in the model.",
        "Each equivalence class has an index in the output matrix.",
        "Words have an uneven distribution within these classes, e.g. in the dictionary that was used the word \"more\" is the only member of the class noun-or-comparative-adjective-or-adverb.",
        "Prior to training, initial values of probabilities in all the matrices must be chosen.",
        "The transition matrix is set so that all the transitions from a state are equiprobable.",
        "Word occurrence probabilities P(vi) are used to obtain the initial output matrix probabilities.",
        "They are first converted to probabilities of word equivalence classes P(Wk).",
        "The probability of each equivalence class Wk is then divided equally among the POS categories that are in the equivalence class, to give weights F(Wk, CO.",
        "This reflects the assumption that all words in an equivalence class can initially function equiprobably as any POS category of the class.",
        "The output matrix elements for each state are constructed using the various F(Wk, Ci).",
        "For each state, the elements are then normalized to sum to unity.",
        "The process of training a HMM is to statistically infer parameters that maximize the likelihood of the training text, and the Baum-Welch algorithm (Baum, 1972) was used for this purpose.",
        "Typically, the model is trained on several iterations over the training data, until the parameter estimates converge.",
        "Then, for any given test sentence, the Viterbi algorithm (Viterbi, 1967) can be used to find the most likely state sequence through the model, which maximizes the probability of seeing the test sentence.",
        "The state sequence is used as the annotation for the sentence.",
        "A text corpus containing 1,180,000 words was used for training and testing the model.",
        "The corpus is a",
        "I THINK THAT IT IS A FAR subj-pro verb conj pro verb det adj noun adj noun noun adverb pro adverb det MORE COMPLICATED ISSUE THAN YOU SEEM TO comp-adj adj noun conj pro verb prep adverb past part verb adverb noun THINK TO PUT IN ELEMENTARY FUNCTIONS verb prep verb prep adj noun-plural adverb adj verb 3rd person noun adverb",
        "collection of electronic mail messages concerning the design of the Common Lisp programming language.",
        "It contains 23,190 different words, of which 8,300 only occur once.",
        "A dictionary of approximately 30,000 words was also available, each word tagged with its possible parts of speech.",
        "An annotated corpus vocabulary was constructed by intersecting the dictionary with the corpus.",
        "This resulted in 90% coverage of the total number of words in the corpus, and 45% coverage of the total word types that appear in the corpus.",
        "Words that did not have vocabulary entries giving their parts of speech were marked with a special POS category called unlabeled.",
        "A total of 21 POS categories were used initially, resulting in 441 transitions.",
        "The output matrix contained 129 elements per state (corresponding to the number of word equivalence classes in the annotated corpus vocabulary).",
        "The model was trained initially on 3000 sentences from the corpus, using 10 iterations.",
        "Preliminary results are good, even for a first order model.",
        "An example of annotation of a sentence is shown in Figure 2.",
        "The annotation provided by the Viterbi algorithm is shown in bold on the line below the words of the sentence.",
        "The other possible parts of speech present in the dictionary are shown below the annotation.",
        "It can be seen that the major dependencies have been inferred correctly; the main difference from the preferred annotation lies in the substitution of adjectival for adverbial categories."

        "A frequency ordered list of words occurring in a corpus represents a static word cache.",
        "In this type of word cache the overall probability of occurrence of a word related to a specific topic tends to be small, as a large corpus of text may be composed of material on a large number of diverse topics.",

        "A type cache contains the previous n different words (i.e. word types) found, and can be implemented as a linked list of words.",
        "When a word is encountered that is already in the cache, the word is simply moved to the front of the list.",
        "When a new word type is seen it is placed at the front of the list.",

        "Table 1 shows the coverage given over the whole corpus by the two kinds of cache, for various n. For cache sizes from 90 to 4000 words the dynamic type cache gave slightly better coverage than the optimum frequency ordered cache.",
        "This characteristic was also observed when using subsections of the corpus.",
        "The dynamic cache does not give 100% coverage when its size is equal to the vocabulary, because at the outset it is empty.",
        "Words entering the cache for the first time are not covered.",
        "The dynamic type cache has the advantage that it is adaptable over different domains whereas the optimum contents of a static cache must be determined by prior analysis.",
        "A dynamic token cache was also compared, and it gave inferior performance to either of the other kinds of cache because space in the cache is occupied by multiple tokens of the same word type.",
        "Dynamic type caches have been considered as a means of vocabulary personalization (Jelinek, 1985b).",
        "In conjunction with interactive word entry, they have also been viewed as a way of obtaining high coverage in a speech recognition system using a very large vocabulary (Merialdo, 1988).",
