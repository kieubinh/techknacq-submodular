        "Prosodic information can mark lexical stress, identify phrasing breaks, and provide information useful for semantic interpretation.",
        "Each of these aspects of prosody can benefit a spoken language system (SLS).",
        "We concentrate in this report on the use of prosody in parsing, through perceptual studies and through modeling the correlation of duration patterns with stress patterns and with syntactic structures.",
        "It is rare that prosody alone disambiguates otherwise phonetically identical phrases.",
        "However, it is also rare that any one source of information (spectral or temporal) is the sole feature that separates one phrase from all competitors.",
        "We argue here that prosody can provide information useful to a parser.",
        "Taking advantage of this information in parsing can make a spoken language system more accurate and more efficient, if prosodic-syntactic mismatches, or unlikely matches, can be pruned out.",
        "There is a vast literature on the perception and production of prosodic information.",
        "Our goal is to show that at least some of this information can be automatically extracted and used to improve speech recognition and understanding.",
        "Figure represents a strategy for using prosody to improve speech understanding.",
        "Prosodic features extracted from speech will be analysed by the prosody module which will communicate both with the speech recognition component and with the language processing component.",
        "For example, phone durations from the speech recognition module can be used by the prosodic module to hypothesize stress patterns and prosodic structure, which in turn can be checked in the speech recognition component for consistency with the dictionary's lexical stress patterns and with the application of phonological rules in the hypothesized word strings.",
        "Similarly, the consistency of syntactic, semantic and discourse structures from the language processing component can be verified against the prosodic structures hypothesized.",
        "The complete integration of the prosodic module with speech and language components is an ambitious goal.",
        "Our strategy for attaining this goal is to 1) assess the potential of various types of prosodic information through perceptual experiments and through analysis of recognition and parsing errors, 2) for those aspects of prosody that appear to have the greatest potential, develop computational models using linguistic theory to help determine the units and structure of the models, and using statistical models to help account for variability and to allow for automatic training, and 3) evaluate the models and algorithms by comparing the model's output with hand labels, by comparing human discrimination with the system's performance, and by assessing the accuracy and speed of an SLS with and without the prosodic module.",
        "We report here on our initial experiments involving a) the perception of various types of syntactic structures marked by prosody, b) the coding of prosodic information for parsing, and c) the automatic labeling of prosodic structures."

        "Further, there are likely some types of syntactic structures that are not typically marked prosodically.",
        "In order to help focus our study on syntactic structures that correlate well with prosody, we designed a perceptual experiment involving phonetically-ambiguous, structurally-different pairs of sentences.",
        "The sentence pairs were read by a professional radio announcer in disambiguating contexts.",
        "In order to discourage unnatural exaggerations of any differences between sentences, the materials were recorded in different sessions with several days in between.",

        "The listeners were all native speakers of English, naive with respect to the purpose of the study.",
        "Again, two different listening sessions with several weeks in between were used, and only one member of each sentence pair occurred in the same session.",
        "Seven types of structural ambiguity were investigated: 1) parentheticals, 2) apposition, 3) main-main vs. main subordinate clauses, 4) tags, 5) near vs. far attachment, 6) left vs. right attachment, and 7) particles vs. prepositions.",
        "Each type of ambiguity was represented by five pairs of sentences.",
        "We list a sample from each class with their disambiguating contexts in the Appendix.",
        "In each case, the \"a\" member of the sentence-pairs has at least one location with a more major break than the corresponding location in the \"b\" version.",

        "The table also indicates differences related to the \"a\" and \"b\" versions by structural category.",

        "Prepositions are very frequent (about 75% of the Resource Management sentences (Price et al.",
        "1988 ) have one or more prepositional phrases), and nearly all sentences with prepositional phrases are syntactically ambiguous.",
        "The perceptual results indicate that it may be possible to help resolve syntactic ambiguity on the basis of prosodic information.",
