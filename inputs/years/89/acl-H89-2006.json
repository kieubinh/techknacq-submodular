      "text": [
        "Over the past year work on semantic interpretation in the BBN Spoken Language System has shifted from a Montague Grammar (Montague, 1973) style rule-for-rule approach to one which attempts to carry out semantic interpretation directly in the unification grammar rules themselves.",
        "This is accomplished by adding semantic features to the grammar rules, placing them on the same footing as the existing syntactic features.",
        "Meaning representations are thereby constructed, and semantic filtering constraints applied, as part of parsing the utterance.",
        "We view such a move as having essentially three advantages:",
        "• more information is available to semantic interpretation, so it is possible to gain higher coverage • syntax and semantics are integrated, so semantic filtering constraints can be applied as constituents are built and attached • this integration is simple and does not require any complex engineering of cooperating software modules",
        "All three of these advantages are important ones for a spoken language system.",
        "The HARC system has the following overall organization.",
        "Spoken input is initially analyzed by the \"N-best\" algorithm(Chow and Schwartz, 1989), converting it into-a rank-ordered set of N best word-sequence hypotheses (for a given value of N).",
        "These N hypotheses are then analyzed by the parser, using the combined syntactic/semantic grammar.",
        "Those hypotheses which are syntactically and semantically allowed emerge from the parser as initial logical forms in which quantifiers are interpreted \"in place\".",
        "Next, the quantifier module assigns scopes and passes the translation to the anaphora component, which then resolves the referent of intra-and extra-sentential pronouns.",
        "The completed logical form is then passed to the back-end component whose responsibility is to compute the appropriate response to the user's input.",
        "The present paper confines itself to a description of the combined syntactic/semantic grammar, along with some discussion of the parsing algorithm.",
        "We will first consider the representational framework in which the grammar is written."

        "The BBN grammar formalism, described in detail in (Boisen et al., 1989), is most closely related to Definite Clause Grammar (Pereira and Warren, 1980).",
        "Rules consist of a single left-hand term and zero or more right hand terms.",
        "Terms can have features, whose values are themselves terms.",
        "Variables, indicated by the \":\" prefix, indicate identity between different slots in and among terms.",
        "Here is an example of a simple grammar rule written in this formalism: (VP (AGR :P :N) :MOOD (WH-) :TRX :TRY) --+ (V :CONTRACT (TRANSITIVE) :P :N :MOOD) (NP :NSUBCATFRAME (WH-) :TRX :TRY)",
        "This rule says that a VP can derive a transitive verb followed by an object NP.",
        "The person, number and mood of the VP – indicated by the variables :P, :N and :MOOD respectively – must be the same as the person, number and mood of the verb.",
        "The distinguishing feature of the BBN formalism, in which it differs from DCG, is its strict system of typing.",
        "Each functor that can head a term is associated with a type and a fixed set of argument positions that are also typed.",
        "For example, the functor \"AGR\" has the type AGREEMENT, and the argument types PERSON and NUMBER.",
        "Variables are also typed; for example the variable :P has the type PERSON and the variable :N has the type NUMBER.",
        "A given grammar written in the formalism, then, has two components: a set of functor type declarations and a set of grammar rules.",
        "This typing feature enables the the grammar rules to be statically checked against the type declarations.",
        "A large class of errors in the grammar – such as accidentally ommitted features, transpositions or mispellings – can be caught when the grammar is loaded into the computer instead of through runtime debugging.",
        "This capability has proven very useful indeed in the course of creating and modifying a large (pa00 rule) grammar."

        "We can think of this rule in functional terms as taking semantic arguments :SUBJ and :OBJ and returning as a value the wff (HIRE' :SUBJ :OBJ).",
        "Note the placement of semantic arguments to the verb inside the subcatego-rization term (headed by the functor \"TRANSITIVE\") instead of at the top-level of the \"V\".",
        "This means that a verb with a differing number of arguments, such as \"give\", has a different subcategorization functor with a corresponding number of argument places for the semantic translations of these arguments.",
        "Like Definite Clause Grammar, the BBN formalism does not require that every term on the right-hand side of the rule derive a non-empty string.",
        "This is necce-sary to handle traces.",
        "But empty-deriving terms are also made use of in some grammar rules as so-called \"constraint nodes\".",
        "These do not generate a real constituent of the parse tree, but instead stipulate that a particular relationship hold between these constituents.",
        "For example, in the rule turning a PP into a (post-copular) VP, we require that the PP semantics be construable as a specifying a predication on the subject of the VP:",
        "PREDICATIVE-PP is a constraint clause, taking the semantics of an NP and a PP and returning a wff that is a predication that the PP may be construed as making of the NP.",
        "As the rule shows, the wff returned is passed up as the translation of the VP.",
        "Constraint nodes are used not only to impose a stipulation on the constituents of a rule but also to allow for multiple ways to satisfy these constituents.",
        "For example, the PP \"in the Information Sciences Division\" can apply differently to different subjects: to a person, in which case it indicates that the person is an employee of the Information Sciences Division, or to a department, in which it indicates that the department is one of those making up the Information Sciences Division.",
