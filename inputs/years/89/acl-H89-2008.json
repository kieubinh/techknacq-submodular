        "Recently, we have been directing our research effort towards spoken language understanding as part of the DARPA Spoken Language System program.",

        "That is, in addition to converting the speech signal to text, the computer must also understand the linguistic structure of a sentence in order to generate the correct response.",
        "We have focused our attention on three main issues.",
        "First, the system must integrate speech recognition with natural language in order to achieve speech understanding.",
        "Second, the system must have a realistic application domain, and be able to translate spoken input into appropriate actions.",
        "Finally, the system must begin to deal with spontaneous speech, since people do not always utter grammatically well-formed sentences during a spoken dialogue.",
        "Over the past six months, we have constructed the skeleton of a spoken language system.",
        "The purpose of this paper is to describe the various components of this system.",
        "In related activities, we have collected a sizeable spontaneous speech database, and have used the data for analyses, system training and evaluation.",
        "The collection and analysis of the spontaneous speech database, and the preliminary evaluation of our spoken language system are described in two companion papers that appear elsewhere in these proceedings [1,2]."

        "The system, which we call VOYAGER, currently focuses on the the city of Cambridge, Massachusetts, between MIT and Harvard University, as shown in Figure 1.",
        "It can answer a number of different types of questions about certain hotels, restaurants, hospitals, and other objects within this region.",
        "At the moment, VOYAGER has a vocabulary of 324 words.",

        "The system then trains the next iteration of phonetic models based on the matches between lexical arcs and phonetic segments in the forced alignments.",

        "Typically, several independent hypotheses are simultaneously active, and parameter modifications include protection of shared information, such that a parallel implementation would be possible.",
        "Efficient memory use is achieved through a recycling mechanism for the node structures, such that they become available in a resource pool whenever their current assignment is completed.",
        "These issues will become important as we move towards a fully integrated system.",

        "For instance, all occurrences of SUBJECT are pooled together for probability assignments on their children, regardless of the structural positions of these occurrences within a clause.",

        "Building such a tight grammar not only leads to a very low perplexity for the recognizer, but also virtually eliminates the problem of multiple parses.",
        "This is because all parses that are syntactically legitimate but semantically anomalous are weeded out.",
        "It has the added benefit of improving computation time, if the semantic constraints are integrated early in the parsing process, more or less at the first chance of resolution.",
        "We also wanted to maintain our criterion that a node should only have access to information locally available to it by default.",
        "That is, it should not be allowed to hunt back through the parse tree looking for a resolution of, for example, number agreement.",
        "By default, all nodes pass along the parameters passed to them by near relatives.",
        "The hard part is to come up with a compact representation that contains all information necessary to carry out the constraints.",
        "In terms of syntax, there are patterns describing properties such as person, number, case, and determiner.",
        "Semantics are represented by patterns that include an automatic hierarchical inheritance of broader properties from more specific ones.",
        "Thus for example the semantic category Restaurant automatically acquires Building and Place as additional semantic features.",
        "In addition to the syntactic features, nodes also pass along semantic features that are automatically reset by designated nodes, such as terminal vocabulary entries.",
        "The two slots, Current-Focus and Float-Object that are used for dealing with gaps, turned out to also be very useful for providing semantic constraint.",
        "In fact, we decided to take the approach of only using these two parameters for semantic filtering, to see whether in fact that would be adequate.",
        "Their use in the gap mechanism is described elsewhere [7], but for clarification we will briefly review it here.",

        "Absorbers can accept the Float-Object as their subparse, in place of something from the input stream.",
        "The net result of this mechanism, aside from its intended use in gap resolution, is that it provides a second-order memory system for identifying the semantic categories of certain key content words in the history.",

        ".",
        "The Q-Subject places \"what street\" into the Current-Focus slot, but this unit is activated to Float-Object status by the following Be-Question.",
        "The Subject node refills the now empty Current-Focus with \"the Hyatt.\"",
        "The node A-Street, an absorber, can accept the Float-Object as a solution, but only if there is tight agreement in semantics, i.e., it requires the identifier Street.",
        "Thus a sentence such as \"(What restaurant)i is the Hyatt on (ti)\" would fail on semantic grounds.",
        "Furthermore, the node On-Street imposes semantic restrictions on the Current-Focus.",

        "The Current-Focus always contains the subject whenever a verb is proposed, and therefore it is easy to specify filtering constraints for subject-verb relationships.",
        "Thus for example, the verb \"intersect\" demands that its subject be Street and the verb \"eat\" demands person.",
        "We have not yet incorporated probabilities into the semantic predictions, mainly because our domain is simple enough that they don't seem necessary.",
        "However, in principle probabilities could be added.",
        "Furthermore, these probabilities could be acquired automatically by parsing a collection of sentences and counting semantic co-occurrence patterns.",
