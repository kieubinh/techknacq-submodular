      "text": [
        "The determination of part-of-speech categories for words is an important problem in language modeling, because both the syntactic and semantic roles of words depend on their part-of-speech category (henceforth simply termed \"category\").",
        "Application areas include speech recognition/synthesis and information retrieval.",
        "Several workers have addressed the problem of tagging text.",
        "Methods have ranged from locally-operating rules (Greene and Rubin, 1971), to statistical methods (Church, 1989; DeRose, 1988; Garside, Leech and Sampson, 1987; Jelinek, 1985) and back-propagation (Benello, Mackie and Anderson, 1989; Nakamura and Shikano, 1989).",
        "The statistical methods can be described in terms of Markov models.",
        "States in a model represent categories {ci...cri} (n is the number of different categories used).",
        "In a first order model, Ci and Ci_1 are random variables denoting the categories of the words at position i and (i â€“ 1) in a text.",
        "The transition probability P(Ci = cs I Ci_i = cy) linking two states cs and cy, represents the probability of category cs following category Cy.",
        "A word at position i is represented by the random variable Wi, which ranges over the vocabulary {tvi...w,} (v is the number of words in the vocabulary).",
        "State-dependent probabilities of the form P(Wi = = cz) represent the probability that word tvc, is seen, given category cc.",
        "For instance, the word \"dog\" can be seen in the states noun and verb, and only has a non-zero probability in those states.",
        "A word sequence is considered as being generated from an underlying sequence of categories.",
        "Of all the possible category sequences from which a given word sequence can be generated, the one which maximizes the probability of the words is used.",
        "The Viterbi algorithm (Viterbi, 1967) will find this category sequence.",
        "The systems previously mentioned require a pre-tagged training corpus in order to collect word counts or to perform back-propagation.",
        "The Brown Corpus (Francis and Kucera, 1982) is a notable example of such a corpus, and is used by many of the systems cited above.",
        "An alternative approach taken by Jelinek, (Jelinek, 1985) is to view the training problem in terms of a \"hidden\" Markov model: that is, only the words of the training text are available, their corresponding categories are not known.",
        "In this situation, the Baum-Welch algorithm (Baum, 1972) can be used to estimate the model parameters.",
        "This has the great advantage of eliminating the pre-tagged corpus.",
        "It minimizes the resources required, facilitates experimentation with different word categories, and is easily adapted for use with other languages.",
        "The work described here also makes use of a hidden Markov model.",
        "One aim of the work is to investigate the quality and performance of models with minimal parameter descriptions.",
        "In this regard, word equivalence",
        "classes were used (Kupiec, 1989).",
        "There it is assumed that the distribution of the use of a word depends on the set of categories it can assume, and words are partitioned accordingly.",
        "Thus the words \"play\" and \"touch\" are considered to behave identically, as members of the class noun-or-verb, and \"clay\" and \"zinc\"are members of the class noun.",
        "This partitioning drastically reduces the number of parameters required in the model, and aids reliable estimation using moderate amounts of training data.",
        "Equivalence classes {Eqvi...Eqvm,} replace the words {wi...tv,} (m < v) and P(Eqvi I Ci) replace the parameters P(Wi Ci).",
        "In the 21 category model reported in Kupiec (1989) only 129 equivalence classes were required to cover a 30,000 word dictionary.",
        "In fact, the number of equivalence classes is essentially independent of the size of the dictionary, enabling new words to be added without any modification to the model.",
        "Obviously, a trade-off is involved.",
        "For example, \"dog\" is more likely to be a noun than a verb and \"see\" is more likely to be a verb than a noun.",
        "However they are both members of the equivalence class noun-or-verb, and so are considered to behave identically.",
        "It is then local word context (embodied in the transition probabilities) which must aid disambiguation of the word.",
        "In practice, word context provides significant constraint, so the trade-off appears to be a remarkably favorable one.",
        "The Basic Model The development of the model was guided by evaluation against a simple basic model (much of the development of the model was prompted by an analysis of the errors in its behaviour).",
        "The basic model contained states representing the following categories:",
        "Verb Uninflected Verb 3rd Pers.",
        "Sing.",
        "Auxiliary Present Participle Past Participle Question Word Unknown Lisp To-inf.",
        "Sentence Boundary Including mass nouns Coordinating and subordinating Including comparative and superlative Am, is, was, has, have, should, must, can, might, etc.",
        "Including gerund Including past tense When, what, why, etc.",
        "Words whose stems could not be found in dictionary.",
        "Used to tag common symbols in the the Lisp programming language (see below:) \"To\" acting as an infinitive marker The above states were arranged in a first-order, fully connected network, each state having a transition to every other state, allowing all possible sequences of categories.",
        "The training corpus was a collection of electronic mail messages concerning the design of the Common-Lisp programming language - a somewhat less than ideal representation of English.",
        "Many Lisp-specific words were not in the vocabulary, and thus tagged as unknown, however the lisp category was nevertheless created for frequently occurring Lisp symbols in an attempt to reduce bias in the estimation.",
        "It is interesting to note that the model performs very well, despite such \"noisy\" training data.",
        "The training was sentence-based, and the model was trained using 6,000 sentences from the corpus.",
        "Eight iterations of the Baum-Welch algorithm were used.",
        "The implementation of the hidden Markov model is based on that of Rabiner, Levinson and Sondhi (1983).",
        "By exploiting the fact that the matrix of probabilities P(Eqvi Ci) is sparse, a considerable improvement can be gained over the basic training algorithm in which iterations are made over all states.",
        "The initial values of the model parameters are calculated from word occurrence probabilities, such that words are initially",
        "assumed to function equally probably as any of their possible categories.",
        "Superlative and comparative adjectives were collapsed into a single adjective category, to economize on the overall number of categories.",
        "(If desired, after tagging the finer category can be replaced).",
        "In the basic model all punctuation except sentence boundaries was ignored.",
        "An interesting observation is worth noting with regard to words that can act both as auxiliary and main verbs.",
        "Modal auxiliaries were consistently tagged as auxiliary whereas the tagging for other auxiliaries (e.g. \"is\" \"have\" etc.)",
        "was more variable.",
        "This indicates that modal auxiliaries can be recognized as a natural class via their pattern of usage."

        "The most frequent 100 words of the corpus were assigned individually in the model, thereby enabling them to have different distributions over their categories.",

        "A common error in the basic model was the assignment of the word \"to\" to the to-inf category (\"to\" acting as an infinitive marker) instead of preposition before noun phrases.",
        "This is not surprising, because \"to\" is the only member of the to-inf category, P(Wi = \"to\" ICz = to-inf) = 1.0.",
        "In contrast, P(Wi = \"to\" I Ca = preposition) = 0.086, because many other words share the preposition state.",
        "Unless transition probabilities are highly constraining, the higher probability paths will tend to go through the to-inf state.",
        "This situation may be addressed in several ways, the simplest being to initially assign zero transition probabilities from the to-inf state to states other than verbs and the adverb state.",
        "Augmenting the Model by Use of Networks The basic model consists of a first-order fully connected network.",
        "The lexical context available for modeling a word's category is solely the category of the preceding word (expressed via the transition probabilities P(Ci Ci_1).",
        "Such limited context does not adequately model the constraint present in local word context.",
        "A straightforward method of extending the context is to use second-order conditioning which takes account of the previous two word categories.",
        "Transition probabilities are then of the form P(Ci Ci_l, Ci_2).",
        "For an n category model this requires n3 transition probabilities.",
        "Increasing the order of the conditioning requires exponentially more parameters.",
        "In practice, models have been limited to second-order, and smoothing methods are normally required to deal with the problem of estimation with limited data.",
        "The conditioning just described is uniform - all possible two-category contexts are modeled.",
        "Many of these neither contribute to the performance of the model, nor occur frequently enough to be estimated properly: e.g. P(Ci = determiner Ci â€“ i An alternative to uniformly increasing the order of the conditioning is to extend it selectively.",
        "Mixed higher-order context can be modeled by introducing explicit state sequences.",
        "In the arrangement the basic first-order network remains, permitting all possible category sequences, and modeling first-order dependency.",
        "The basic network is then augmented with the extra state sequences which model certain category sequences in more detail.",
        "The design of the augmented network has been based on linguistic considerations and also upon an analysis of tagging errors made by the basic network.",
        "As an example, we may consider a systematic error made by the basic model.",
        "It concerns the disambiguation of the equivalence class adjective-or-noun following a determiner.",
        "The error is exemplified by the sentence fragment \"The period of...\", where \"period\" is tagged as an adjective.",
        "To model the context necessary to correct the error, two extra states are used, as shown in Figure 1.",
        "The \"augmented network\" uniquely models all second-order dependencies of the type determiner - noun - X, and determiner - adjective - X (X ranges over {ci...c0).",
        "Training a hidden Markov model having this topology corrected all nine instances of the error in the test data.",
        "An important point to note is that improving the model detail in this manner does not forcibly correct the error.",
        "The actual patterns of category usage must be distinct in the language.",
        "To complete the description of the augmented model it is necessary to mention tying of the model states (Jelinek and Mercer, 1980).",
        "Whenever a transition is made to a state, the state-dependent probability distribution P(Egvi I Ci) is used to obtain the probability of the observed equivalence class.",
        "A state is generally used in several places (E.g. in Figure 1. there are two noun states, and two adjective states: one of each in the augmented network, and in the basic network).",
        "The distributions P(Egvi I co are considered to be the same for every instance of the same state.",
        "Their estimates are pooled and reassigned identically after each iteration of the Baum-Welch algorithm."

        "Critical examination of the tagging provided by the augmented model showed 168 word tagging errors, whereas the basic model gave 215 erroneous word tags.",
        "The former represents 95.6% correct word tagging on the text as a whole (ignoring unknown words), and 89% on the ambiguous words.",
        "The performance of a tagging program depends on the choice and number of categories used, and the correct tag assignment for words is not always obvious.",
