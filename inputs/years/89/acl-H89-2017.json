        "We have collected, transcribed and analyzed over 8 hours of human-human interactive problem solving dialogue in the air travel planning domain, including traveler-agent dialogues and the more constrained agent-airline dialogues.",
        "We have used this data to define and test an initial vocabulary, and to design an appropriate interlace for the air travel planning domain.",
        "The initial interface design was tested via simulation, using 44 subjects solving air travel problems.",
        "Our data analysis reveals great differences between the traveler-agent interactions and the agent-airline interactions, with the traveler-simulation interactions falling somewhat in between."

        "Spoken language systems must, obviously, deal with spontaneous speech.",
        "However, most research to date has dealt primarily with read speech, because read speech is much easier to collect in a controlled manner.",
        "There are, however, substantial differences between read speech and spontaneous speech.",
        "Differences include the many phenomena that are less likely to occur in read speech (pauses, speech and grammatical false starts, filler words, non-standard grammar), as well as important phonological phenomena, such as the frequency of deletions (Bernstein and Baldwin, 1985).",
        "On the other hand, it is possible that both the speech and the language of human-machine interactions in a restricted domain will be more constrained and more predictable than those occurring in human-human spontaneous interactions.",
        "The goal of the preliminary work presented here is to collect and analyze spontaneous, goal-directed speech and language in the interest of designing and evaluating eventual spoken language systems.",
        "Perhaps the greatest variable affecting performance in current and future systems is the human involved in the human-machine interface.",
        "It is therefore important to assess systems over many different subjects.",
        "We have chosen the domain of air travel planning because it provides a natural problem-solving domain familiar to many people (120 SRI employees per day on average use spoken interactions to solve travel planning problems).",
        "This has greatly facilitated the task of collecting data.",
        "Further, the domain can be constrained as desired for initial development (as we have done by allowing only one-way travel between two cities), or expanded naturally to include a great deal of complex problem-solving for future SLSs (inclusion of data on connections, classes of seats, and restrictions on fares, availability of fares, hotels, car rentals, expert system reasoning, etc.).",
        "In addition, the air travel planning domain has the advantage of large, real databases in the public domain.",
        "We initially studied human-human interactions, to gain insight into how interactive problem solving is currently used in this domain.",
        "We noted that database queries were rare, and that more typically the traveler expresses a few constraints, and then the agent takes the lead and asks questions.",
        "We wondered how adaptable subjects would be in a simulated machine interaction: would their travel planning task be more difficult if they were forced to use only database queries?",
        "We, simulated an SLS in two conditions: one that permitted the expression of constraints but that were not strictly database queries (\"I",
        "need to be there before 3 pm\"), and one which accepted only database queries (responding \"cannot handle that request\" to any other type of utterance).",
        "The system responds, in both conditions, with graphics placed on the user's screen (shared information, schedule tables, fare tables, etc.).",
        "The goal of this initial work is to assess human-human problems solving in the air travel domain, and to assess possible differences between human-human and human-machine interactions.",
        "It is clear that people are very adaptable, far more so than our current technology.",
        "It is not so clear how adaptable they will be and on what dimensions in human-machine interactions.",
        "What aspects of the interaction will require a technological solution and what aspects can be handled via a human factors solution?",
        "If, for example, it is desirable to handle only database queries, how difficult is it for humans to adapt to this restriction?",
        "This is but one example of a myriad of similar questions that could be asked using such simulations.",
        "The answers to these questions will expedite the design of efficient human-machine collaborative systems."

        "We collected more than 12 hours (over 100 conversations) of on-site tape recordings of 6 travel agents at a travel agency interacting with clients and with airline agents via telephone.",
        "Tape recording equipment was out of the sight of the agent.",
        "Both parties knew their voices were being recorded.",
        "However, after a few brief interchanges, conversations proceeded as usual.",
        "Data collection occurred at the busiest time of day.",
        "The tape recorder stayed on for 45-minute durations, except when personal calls interrupted.",
        "For each reservation a client makes, agents estimated that the client calls an average of three times: to ask information, to book a flight, and to ticket the flight or make slight changes.",
        "We were most interested in first-time calls in which clients booked a flight, although we included data from all three types of calls in our analysis."

        "To simulate an air travel planning spoken language system, we combined a database retrieval program and a human speech-recognizer/database-accessor, the \"wizard.\"",
        "The experiments involved two computer consoles.",
        "One Sun 4 graphics console displayed three windows for the subject: a template window of shared information (fields for departure city, arrival city, date, earliest departure time, latest departure time, earliest arrival time, and latest arrival time), a flights schedule window, and a fare window.",
        "The wizard could also send a limited number of messages to the subject: \"Cannot handle that request\", \"Would you please repeat that?",
        "\", and \"Ready for more speech input.\"",

        "A current total of 44 subjects (26 men, 18 women) participated in the simulated human-machine interactive experiment.",
        "Electronic failure caused the loss of data from one (male) subject, leaving 43 who successfully completed their tasks.",
        "Two travel planning tasks (one more constrained by fare and the other by schedule, described further below) were assigned each subject counterbalanced with two interaction conditions (database queries only or \"regular' -- expressing constraints such as \"I can't leave till 3 pm\" allowed).",
        "The order cycled every four subjects.",
        "One quarter of the subjects participated in each of the following test orders:",
        "1. fare task in database query condition, schedule task in regular condition, 2. schedule task in regular condition, fare task in database query condition, 3. fare task in regular condition, schedule task in database query condition, and 4. schedule in database query condition, fare task in regular condition.",

        "General examples of acceptable and unacceptable utterances were provided.",
        "The subject was requested to end the session by saying, \"ok, book that one.\"",
        "The subject was also told that as the system received information, it would begin to display pieces of information in the template display window.",
        "The experimenter then read instructions describing the assigned travel-planning task to the subject, allowing the subject to take notes.",
        "This was to avoid any poisoning of the data that might be induced if the subjects simply read the task description.",
        "The experimenter then explained the condition to the subject (database query only or regular).",
        "Examples of acceptable and unacceptable database queries were given for the relevant condition, and the idea that a database query is a sentence that results in a database retrieval was explained.",
        "The subject was also told what types of information the system could provide.",
        "The tasks, which each took about 5 minutes to complete, are described below : A.",
        "Book a one-way flight from San Francisco to Los Angeles, for <date>, leaving after <time>, arriving before <time>, subject to the following ordered constraints:",

        "The flight information database used is a subset of the Official Airline Guide (OAG) database obtained from the OAG in May 1989.",

        "The vocabulary size also changes significantly between types of user, though this is more difficult to assess given the smaller data set.",
        "However, our intuitions, based on looking at these data, is that the vocabulary is substantially more restricted for the agent-agent dialogues for two reasons: the travel agent does not try to gain the sympathy of the airline agent (which travelers often do and which opens up the vocabulary tremendously), and both agents know very well what the other can do (which reduces the vocabulary significantly).",
        "Humans interacting with machines will not be likely to try to gain the machine's sympathy, but they will use a much larger vocabulary than otherwise if they are unsure about just what capabilities the system has.",
        "We have observed this phenomena in our human-machine simulations.",
        "Another measure of efficiency is the frequency of pause fillers , which differs in the two conditions by a factor of 2.",
        "Expert users are more concise, following a well-practiced script.",
        "Both parties have a clear idea of what each can do for the other and both want an efficient, brief conversation.",
        "Pause fillers occur in these conversations primarily when the conversation is focused on new or unknown material such as a client's seat number or an unusual regulation.",
        "In the human-human data, when the traveler is unsure of the capabilities of the the agent, the agent takes an active role in guiding the traveler.",
        "Interactive conversation, as opposed to one-way communication, increases the efficiency of problem-solving (Oviatt & Cohen, 1988).",
        "This will likely be important in designing efficient SLSs for naive, untrained users.",
        "We classified 30 conversations from the data in terms of general type of query used.",
        "Five of the 30 conversations were database query-oriented; most of the observed were not strictly database queries, but, rather, expressed constraints related to the problem to be solved .",
        "Four of the five database style",
        "conversations are from information-only calls, where no booking was made.",
        "Information calls from the human-human transcripts usually don't involve all pieces of information necessary for booking a trip.",

        "Specific flight information and seating arrangements are left for later.",
        "In assessing the design of initial vocabulary, we took 10 dialogues, filled out the items syntactically and semantically, and added a list of function words we had for other purposes.",
        "The percent of new words observed in each successive dialogue (where those observed are added to the pool) declines substantially as new dialogues are included.",
        "It does not, however, appear to dip below about 3% even after 48 dialogues.",

        "We found it useful to collect both human-human data and simulated human-machine data in the initial design stages of an SLS.",
        "We found that subjects could perform the air travel planning tasks when they were constrained to use only database queries, and when they were allowed a little more flexibility.",
        "Several of the subjects who started out with the DBQ condition used database queries even in the less constrained condition.",
        "Since users were familiar with database queries by the time they reached the second condition, they chose the shortest possible solution.",
        "Practice is a major factor in improving the efficiency and accuracy of completing a flight reservation, both for the human-human data and for the human-machine data.",
        "It is important to note that subjects who believed the system was fully automated did not always use simple and clear speech.",
        "Several of the subjects said that they were impressed by the superior capability of our 'automated' system.",
        "Perhaps this overestimation of technological capability is what allowed these subjects to slip into more complex communication (larger vocabulary, more indirect requests, wandering train-of-thought utterances, more complex grammatical constructions).",
        "It is difficult to underestimate the effect of the wizard's reactions on the resulting data.",
        "Future directions Our data collection effort will diverge at this point.",
        "One effort will be aimed at efficient elicitation of database queries for SLS kernel evaluation.",
        "Our major effort,however, will be aimed at designing an appropriate interface for the air travel planning domain.",
        "Both efforts will involve the design and evaluation of short training sessions.",
        "We intend to run a large number of subjects on the simulation in order to assess various ideas we have about the proper interface.",
        "User friendliness becomes more of an issue as systems become more complex and replace human-human interaction.",
        "Subjects in our human-machine experiment and subjects in other simulations (van Katwijk et al.",
        "1979), after participating in the experiment, expressed similar frustration when the system gave a vague or inadequate error message to a multi-word and sometimes complex utterance.",
        "Subjects would like error messages to address specific reasons for rejecting an utterance: for example, inability to recognize or parse correctly, or receiving a request that the database cannot handle.",
        "It may be possible to distinguish some categories of \"errors\" in near-term systems, but we suggest that knowing why a request cannot be handled in many cases is nearly as difficult as handling it in the first place.",
        "Not telling the subject why a request could not be handled often results in a series of variations that have nothing to do with the real reason the request was not handled.",
        "It also causes the subjects to limit their utterances to constructions that appear to work.",
        "For these reasons, we believe it is important to consider short training",
        "sessions for subjects.",
        "Initial systems can also be constructed to mitigate the problem of the user not knowing much about the system in the same way that travel agents deal with the same problem: by taking a more active role in guiding the dialogue."
