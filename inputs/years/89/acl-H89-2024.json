        "There has been a recent upsurge of interest in computational studies of large bodies of text.",
        "The aim of such studies varies widely, from lexicography and studies of language change to automatic indexing methods and statistical models for improving the performance of speech recognition systems and optical character readers.",
        "In general, corpus-based studies are critical for the development of adequate models of linguistic structure and for insights into the nature of language use.",
        "However, research workers have been severely hampered by the lack of appropriate materials, and specifically by the lack of a large enough body of text on which published results can be replicated or extended by others.",
        "Recognizing this problem, the Association for Computational Linguistics has established the ACL Data Collection Initiative (ACL/DCI).",
        "It provides the aegis of a not-for-profit scientific society to oversee the acquisition and preparation of a large text corpus to be made available for scientific research at cost and without royalties.",
        "All materials submitted for inclusion in the collection will remain the exclusive property of the copyright holders (if any) for all other purposes.",
        "Each applicant for data from the ACL/DCI will be required to sign an agreement not to redistribute the data or make any direct commercial use; however, commercial application of \"analytical materials\" derived from the text, such as statistical tables or grammar rules, is explicitly permitted.",
        "There may be special restrictions on some materials, but only if the restrictions do not compromise the central objective of providing general longterm access for research.",
        "The material in the ACL/DCI text corpus will be coded in a standard form based on SGML, the Standard Generalized Markup Language.",
        "Over time, we hope to be able to incorporate annotations reflecting consensually approved linguistic features like part of speech and various aspects of syntactic and perhaps semantic structure.",
        "Both the coding and the annotations will be coordinated with the work of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), a project to develop standards for coding and tagging a broad range of different classes of texts to facilitate data interchange and further both research and the language industries.",
        "The TEI is jointly sponsored by the ACL, the Association for Computers and the Humanities, and the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing.",
        "Although our initial efforts will concentrate on the collection of American English, we are interacting with groups in other countries with respect to British English and other European languages, and we hope to extend the effort to other language families as well."

        "efforts of the committee members.",
        "Most business has been transacted by email or telephone, thus avoiding travel expenses, and various small out-of-pocket expenses (such as the cost of tapes) have been donated by individual members.",

        "We have been given the right to distribute (the 1979 edition of) the Collins English Dictionary in electronic form.",
        "Now that we have a fairly large quantity of text, we are beginning to turn our attention to issues of balance in style, genre and topic: what Don Walker calls the \"ecology of language.\"",
        "Although what we have is quite diverse, there is obviously a lot left out -- we have no business letters, for instance; no repair manuals; no tabloid newspapers; no movie scripts; no poetry.",

        "Of course, we will include the source code to the compression/uncompression programs.",
        "CD-ROM is probably the most appropriate format for distribution of the full database, although 8-mm digital tape also has some fans.",
        "We also would like to establish a clearing house for distributing appropriate results of research based on the collection; one promising example is the prospective \"tree bank\" project at the University of Pennsylvania, which Mitch Marcus is describing at this workshop.",

        "In addition to the positive value of having a standard, generally available collection of text (and eventually speech), it's nice to avoid duplicating the often-painful process of obtaining and cleaning text materials.",
        "Obtaining the text in the first place may require quite bit of negotiating, once the right person to negotiate with is found.",
        "Even if permission is easy to get, actually getting the tapes made and sent may require some pestering and pleading.",
        "Once the material arrives, it can sometimes be quite a bit of work to make it usable: the tapes are typically in an undocumented and somewhat complex format, and the text itself may be encoded in an undocumented (and usually proprietary) typesetting language.",
        "Also, the correspondance between the logical structure of the text and its typographical structure is often approximate and errorful, so that some intelligence is required if the logical structure is to be recovered.",
        "In Appendix B, I've documented one example where decrypting the donated material was a nontrivial task, namely the Penta dump format of the Library of America volumes.",
        "Luckily, most cases are much more straightforward than this; but even in more ordinary examples, the donated text must usually be massaged quite a bit (by programs, of course!",

      "heading": "What is SGML?",
      "text": [
        "SGML stands for Standard Generalized Markup Language.",
        "As in the famous joke about the Holy Roman Empire, one may question whether SGML is truly standard, generalized, etc.",
        "It is, at least, designated as an international standard by ISO: specifically, ISO 8879.",
        "It's designed to allow structural information to be added to a document by embedding user-defined sequences of text characters within the text stream.",
        "\"Markup\" is the term used to describe codes added to electronically prepared text to define the structure of the text or the format in which it is to appear.",
        "\"Generalized markup\" rises above the details of font definition, type size, exact page layout, etc., to specify more structural concepts such as \"heading,\" \"footnote,\" \"emphasis,\" etc.",
        "SGML also makes it possible to define the characters used in a document.",
        "Overall, SGML provides not so much a system for markup as a framework for defining such systems: it is almost infinitely flexible, with the benefits and drawbacks that this entails.",
        "The standard itself is far too complex and abstract to permit a brief description -- even its syntax is almost arbitrarily redefinable.",
        "It descends towards mortal ken in the form of a reference concrete syntax defined in ISO 8879, and one version has acquired the beginnings of a semantics though the publication of proposed tag sets and document type declarations (DTD's) by the Association of American Publishers.",
        "In the examples appended to this paper, the relevent aspects of SGML are mainly its default method for encoding labeled brackets, and its default set of representations for characters outside the ascii (actually ISO 646) set.",
        "The start of unit of type foo is coded as <foo>, and its end (in full form we will avoid the thorny issue of shortrefs) is </foo>.",
        "This obviously makes it easy to find fool in a text, at least for a computer, and a simple computer program can transform such a representation into other formats that are easier for humans to read, if desired, as exemplified in samples 3 and 4.",
        "Character sequences of the form \"&X;\" (where X is some ascii string not containing ';') are used to encode non-ascii characters.",
        "Thus 'e' with an acute accent is \"é\": there are plenty of such examples in the French part of sample 8.",
        "At a minimum, SGML provides a useful interchange format; each researcher can easily write programs to transform such materials into his or her preferred local form.",
        "In association with the TEI, we hope to provide a consistent, complete, and well documented tag set, extending the AAP set; this has certainly not yet been done, however."

        "In inquiries so general as our present one, the inaccuracy is not material; no confusion of thought will occur.",
        "Nature, in the common sense, refers to essences unchanged by man; space, the air, the river, the leaf.",
        "Art is applied to the mixture of his will with the same things, as in a house, a canal, a statue, a picture.",
        "But his operations taken together are so insignificant, a little chipping, baking, patching, and washing, that in an impression so grand as that of the world on the human mind, they do not vary the result.",
        "The workshop was held to collect current data on the experience with primary water stress corrosion cracking (PWSCC) of steam generator tubing and the related laboratory investigations.",
        "Thirty-two presentations were given covering field experience, correlations of laboratory data on the field, and relationship of material microstructure, stress, and environment to PWSCC.",
        "The emphasis of the workshop was more on the fundamentals associated with PWSCC yet culminated with several presentations on remedial measures.",
        "The /sup 252/Cf neutron spectrum has been measured at high energies with a miniature ionization chamber and two different NE213 neutron detectors.",
        "The {gamma}-ray background and the main cosmic background were suppressed by applying an efficient pulse shape n/({gamma},{mu}) discrimination.",
        "On the basis of the two-dimensional spectroscopy of neutron time-of-flight and scintillation pulse height, the sliding bias method has been used to minimize experimental uncertainties.",
        "The experimental data corrected for several systematic influences confirm earlier results which show a trend similar to the NBS evaluation.",
        "However, the final spectra obtained for both neutron detectors exhibit negative deviations (up to -10%) from the NBS curve in the 6-12 MeV range.",
        "Finally, the experimental results of this work are compared with various statistical-model approaches to the /sup 252/Cf(sf) neutron spectrum.",

        "The effects of ion-implantation on the surface mechanical properties of ceramics is investigated.",
        "Changes in hardness and indentation fracture that occur in reaction-bonded silicon carbide, sialon, partially stabilized zirconia and WC are all described.",
        "These modifications are correlated to the structural changes brought about by the implantation process.",
        "A vertical fracture type reservoir is assumed with a production well, for studying the effect of heat conduction to the response curve of the tracer using a mathematical model.",
        "With the inlet and outlet of the model located on the center axis of the fracture, flow in the fracture is always stationary.",
        "The tracer moves along the flow while dispersing mixedly.",
        "Inflow rate is 4 kg/s with an assumed inpermeable temperature boundary rock of 1 (5 m) thickness around the fracture.",
        "Tracer responses are calculated with distributed temperatures and even temperature in the fracture.",
        "The width of flow inlet does not influence tracer response.",
        "However, the height of the flow inlet and temperature distribution in the fracture greatly affect the response.",
        "(18 refs, 9 figs, 2 tabs) Tools, equipment and weapons contaminated with radioactive, toxin, biological and/or chemical contaminants are deposited in a cleaning chamber and are sprayed with a solvent under high pressure.",
        "The solvent dislodges particulate contaminants and dissolves chemical agent contaminants and the solvent so sprayed containing both suspended and dissolved contaminants is drained to a distillation means.",
        "Within the distillation means there is a neutralizing agent which deactivates the biological and toxin contaminants and chemically oxidizes the chemical contaminants removed from the item being decontaminated in the cleaning chamber.",
        "Pure solvent vapor generated in the distillation means is condensed to a solvent tank for reuse in the spraying operation for further decontamination.",
        "Drying of the tool, equipment or weapon being decontaminated is accomplished by circulating hot, unsaturated solvent vapor through the cleaning chamber and about the item being decontaminated.",
        "We have studied the growth and metabolism of Syntrophomonas wolfei in pure culture with crotonate as the energy source.",
        "S. wolfei grows in crotonate mineral salts medium without rumen fluid with cobala-min, thymine, lipoic acid and biotin added.",
        "However, after four to six transfers in this medium, growth ceases, indicating that another vitamin is required.",
        "The chemically defined medium allows large batches of S. wolfei to be grown for enzyme purification.",
        "All the enzymes involved in the oxidation of crotonyl-CoA to acetate have been detected.",
        "The pure culture of S. wolfei or coculture of S. wolfei grown with crotonate contain high activities of a crotonate: acetyl-CoA CoA-transferase activity.",
        "This activity is not detected in cocultures grown with butyrate...",
        "I have two individuals that work for me, one by the name of Roger Boisjoly, B-o-i-s-j-o-l-y.",
        "Mr. Boisjoly is on my staff, and for the last many months has been given the specific assignment of working very closely with the SRM seals.",
        "I also have another individual, Mr Arnold Thompson, who is a section supervisor under me who is directly responsible for the structural analysis and design of the case.",
        "These two individuals have been very involved in the seal work for about six months to a year, even prior to that, but intensively for the last year.",
        "Because of their experience level, both of which are in the area of 30 years, I have not personally been as vitally involved in that area as I might if a more junior engineer had been involved.",
        "Now, having said that, about 3:45 on the afternoon of the 27th of January, Mr. Arnold Thompson, one of my section supervisors, come into my office and indicated to me that they had been meeting most of the afternoon and that they had some very serious concerns about the temperatures that were predicted at the Cape, they being primarily the 0-ring task force that had been set up to investigate this problem and develop solutions.",
        "He give me about a 15-minute synopsis of what his concerns were, indicating that the decision had been made to take those concerns to higher management.",
