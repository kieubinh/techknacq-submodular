        "This is a proposed specification for an interface between an acoustic matcher, such as a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) Continuous Speech Recognizer (CSR), and a grammatical component such as a natural language parser (NLP).",
        "Its purpose is to allow independently developed CSR and NLP systems to be interconnected by a well specified and well structured interface.",
        "It can also be used to provide a simulated SLS environment for developing a CSR or NLP by providing an interface to a simulator of the other component.",
        "After initial independent component development has been completed, the interface specification will guarantee that the real components can be interconnected for operation or joint development.",
        "It might also be used for NLP evaluation testing by providing a common (simulated) acoustic recognizer to use in conjunction with the NLPs under test.",
        "The fundamental purpose of this specification is to provide an interface specification for connecting the two components so that independent sites can join their modules together.",
        "It is hoped that sites which can produce both components internally will consider this specification on its own merit and the potential value of being able to interface to modules developed at other sites.",
        "'This work was sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.",
        "This specification provides for two modes of operation: integrated and decoupled.",
        "In the integrated mode, both the CSR and the NLP contribute to the search control.",
        "If (or when) the CSR and NLP technologies are sufficiently mature, this will probably be the preferred mode.",
        "The decoupled mode allows the CSR, component to output a list of possible sentences with acoustic match likelihoods.",
        "The NLP can then process this list as it sees fit.",
        "Since information flow in the decoupled mode is strictly feed-forward, no NL information is available to help constrain the search in the CSR component.",
        "The specification contains overall control architecture and interface definitions.",
        "The resulting system consists of a combined stack-controller/CSR (SC-CSR) and NLP interconnected by UNIX pipes.",
        "Simulators for each component will be provided to allow sites which are developing only one of the components to work within the context of a full SLS system and to allow sites which are developing both components to perform independent development of both modules if they so wish.",
        "The basic algorithmic constraints required by this interface are fairly mild: the interprocess interface uses UNIX pipes, and both the CSR and NLP components operate left-to-right on their respective input data.",
        "(However, the decoupled mode allows the NLP to use non-left-to-right strategies such as island-driven.",
