        "We have, in the past, reported our work in speaker adaptation for large vocabulary continuous speech recognition using a probabilistic spectral mapping [5].",
        "In that work we transformed well-trained phonetic hidden Markov models of a single reference speaker so that they were appropriate for a new (target) speaker.",
        "This method reduced the recognition error rate by about a factor of five relative to a cross-speaker model (trained on one speaker, tested on another).",
        "However, the resulting error rate was still 2 to 3 times that obtained with a speaker-dependent model for the target speakers.",
        "In recent years several researchers have demonstrated speaker-independent recognition using essentially the same recognition algorithms used for speaker-dependent recognition, but with a model derived by simply pooling the training speech of over 100 speakers as if it all were produced by one speaker.",
        "For these systems, the error rate is again 2 to 3 times that of speaker-dependent models.",
        "This shows that there is value in simple pooling of data from many speakers.",
        "The logical extension of these two results would be to use the pooled speaker-independent model as a reference model for speaker adaptation.",
        "However, we know that pooled training yields a model that has very broad (less dis-' criminating) distributions compared to those produced by speaker-dependent training.",
        "Since the adaptation procedures that we have investigated also smooth the original model, we expect that a straightforward application of them to a pooled speaker-independent model will fail to yield improvements due to excessive smoothing.",
        "The approach we propose here consists of three steps:",
        "1) To reduce the smearing of the model distributions, we estimate and apply a deterministic spectral transformation to each reference speaker so that their speech parameters lie in a single common space.",
        "2) We then treat all the transformed speech as if it came from one speaker for training the reference HMM.",
        "3) Finally, we estimate and apply our usual probabilistic spectrum transformation to the pooled reference HMM to model a new target speaker.",
        "In the next section, we describe our basic speaker-adaptation system in terms of its two primary speaker-transformation strategies; speech normalization and PDF mapping.",
        "Section 3 contains experimental results which establish our current performance for a single reference speaker system and introduce preliminary evidence in support of our proposal for using multiple reference speakers."
