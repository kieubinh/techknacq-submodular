        "The field of large vocabulary, continuous speech recognition has advanced to the point where there are several systems capable of attaining between 90 and 95% word accuracy for speaker independent recognition of a 1000 word vocabulary, spoken fluently for a task with a perplexity (average word branching factor) of about 60.",
        "There are several factors which account for the high performance achieved by these systems, including the use of hidden Markov models (HMM) for acoustic modeling, the use of context dependent sub-word units, the representation of between-word phonemic variation, and the use of corrective training techniques to emphasize differences between acoustically similar words in the vocabulary.",
        "In this paper we describe one of the large vocabulary speech recognition systems which is being developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories, and discuss the methods used to provide high word recognition accuracy.",
        "In particular, we focus on the techniques used to obtain acoustic models of the sub-word units (both context independent and context dependent units), and discuss the resulting system performance as a function of the type of acoustic modeling used."

        "In the past few years there have been proposed a number of systems for large vocabulary speech recognition which have achieved high word recognition accuracy .",
        "Although a couple of the systems have concentrated on either isolated word input [6], or have been trained to individual speakers [5,6], most current large vocabulary recognition systems have the goal of performing speech recognition on fluent input (continuous speech) by any talker (speaker independent systems).",
        "The approach to large vocabulary speech recognition we adopt in this study is a pattern recognition based approach.",
        "For a detailed description of the system we have developed, the reader is referred to [7].",
        "The basic speech units in the system are modeled acoustically based on a lexical description of words in the vocabulary.",
        "No assumption is made, a priori, about the mapping between acoustic measurements and phonemes; such a mapping is entirely learned via a finite training set of utterances.",
        "The resulting speech units, which we call phone-like units (PLU's) are essentially acoustic descriptions of linguistically-based units as represented in the words occurring in the given training set.",
        "The focus of this paper is a discussion of various methods used to create a set of acoustic models for characterizing the PLU's used in large vocabulary recognition (LVR).",
        "The set of context independent (CI) units we used in this study is a fixed set of 47 phone-like units (PLU's), in which each PLU is associated with a linguistically defined phoneme symbol.",
        "We model each CI PLU using a continuous density hidden Markov model (CDHMM) with a Gaussian mixture state observation density.",
        "Each word model is defined as the concatenation of the PLU models according to a fixed lexicon defined by the set of 47 associated phoneme symbols.",
        "We also consider a set of context dependent (CD) units which includes PLUs' defined by left, right and both left and right context.",
        "t On leave from CSELT, Torino, Italy.",
        "We tested the recognition system on the DARPA Naval Resource Management task using the word-pair (WP) grammar in a speaker independent mode.",
        "In the case of context independent acoustic modeling, we varied the maximum number of mixtures in each state from 1 to 256 and found that the word accuracy increased from 61% to 90% which indicates that sufficient acoustic resolution is essential for improved performance.",
        "The 90% word accuracy is the highest performance reported based on context independent units.",
        "When intraword context dependency modeling is incorporated, we improved out performance to 93% word accuracy."

        "However, the use of CI PLU's also leads to two serious problems, namely: (1) the CI PLU's do not represent the unit well in all contexts, and (2) the CI PLU's do not provide high recognition performance for large vocabulary recognition tasks, i.e. no one has achieved over 90% word recognition accuracy for vocabularies of 1000 or more words based solely on using context independent PLU's.",
        "There are at least three reasonable solutions to the above problems, namely: (1) improve the acoustic resolution of the context independent PLU models by either modifying the model structure or by using more mixture components in each state, (2) increase the number of models for each context independent PLU thereby reducing the acoustic variability within each model.",

        "The more general case of both left and right context dependent PLU's represents each phone p --> pLp pR where pi, is the preceding phone (possibly silence) and PR is the following phone (possibly silence).",
        "For the time being, we assume that we do not cross word boundaries when creating CD models.",
        "The way in which we create CD PLU models is as follows: we first convert the lexicon from CI units to CD units, we then train the set of CD PLU's using the same procedure as used for the CI PLU's, i.e. use the segmental k-means training on the expanded set of PLU's until convergence.",
        "The above training procedure leads to one major problem, namely that the number of occurrences of some of the CD units is insufficient to generate a statistically reliable model.",
        "There are several ways of dealing with this problem.",
        "Perhaps the simplest way is to use a unit reduction rule of the form: if c(pLp pR) < T, then",

        "PL PPR > $ P PR if c($PPR) > T 2.",
        "PLP PR >-PLP$, if c(PLP$) > T 3.",
        "PLP PR --->-$ P $",
        "where c (p 2 1,3) is the count in the training set associated with the ordered triplet (pi, p2, p 3) ($ is a don't care or wild card phone), and T is the count threshold for applying the reduction rule sequentially through the 3 cases.",
        "To illustrate the sensitivity of the CD PLU set to the threshold of occurrences, T, Table 1 shows the counts of left and right context PLU's, left context PLU's, right context PLU's, and context independent PLU's for the 109 talker DARPA training set of 4360 sentences, as a function of 7'.",
        "It can be seen that for a threshold of 50, which is generally adequate for estimating the HMNI parameters, there are only 365 intraword left and right context PLU's (out of a possible 103,823 combinations), and even for a threshold of 1, there are only 1778 intraword left and right context PLU's; hence only a very small percentage of the possible left and right context PLU's occur in this 4360 sentence set.",
        "A second way of handling the insufficiency of the data for creating statistically reliable CD PLU's is to smooth the CD models with CI models via a technique like deleted interpolation [10].",
        "In order to use",
        "deleted interpolation both the CD and the CI models need to be created based on a common codebook (e.g. discrete observation probabilities) or based on a common set of Gaussian densities (e.g. the mixed density method).",
        "If this is the case then if we denote the spectral density for the CI unit $p $ in state j as B?, and the spectraldensity for the CD unit PL p PR in state j as Br, then we create the smoothed spectral density Bj as a linear combination of Brand BT.",
        "The weight is estimated directly from training data which is deleted (withheld) from the training data used to create Brand BY I.",
        "The forward-backward algorithm can be used directly to estimate the weight A [10].",
        "The key to the success of the deleted interpolation procedure is the commonality of the spectral densities used for the CD and CI units.",
        "A slightly different way of exploiting this type of smoothing is to use the mixed density method but localized to each CI PLU.",
        "Thus for designing each CD PLU, we assume that within each state the means and covariances of each mixture are the same as those used for the CI FLU model; however we adjust the mixture gains based on the actual occurrences of each CD FLU in the training set.",
        "We can also then apply a form of interpolation which is similar to that of deleted interpolation to the mixture gains by smoothing them with the CI mixture gains, i.e. = cionr P PR + (1-2)C i(171)$-P-$ (1) where A is again estimated from counts of training tokens where the CD model provides a better fit than the CI model.",
        "This type of smoothing is especially effective for models created from a small number of training tokens (e.g. less than 30).",
        "We have therefore considered two types of modeling algorithms for creating CD PLU's, based on the above discussion.",
        "The first procedure, which we refer to as CD!, sets a threshold on the minimum number of CD PLU occurrences in the training set and then, independent of the CI phone set, builds a new set of CD models.",
        "The second procedure, which we refer to as CD2, uses the modified training/smoothing procedure to tie the mixture means and covariances, and allows the use of a simple interpolation scheme (Eq.",

        "Since a large number of research groups are using the DARPA Resource Management Task as a standard training/test set, it is relatively straightforward to make direct comparisons of performance scores.",
        "However, before doing so, it is appropriate to point out that, aside from system differences, there are often a number of methodology differences that could significantly affect the results.",
        "When appropriate we will point out these differences.",
        "For TS1 (150) the most appropriate comparison is the results of Lee and his colleagues at CMU, since Lee essentially defined the data that went into TS1 [1].",
        "The SPHINX System, which uses a multiple VQ front end (i.e. a discrete observation density rather than the continuous mixture density used here), has been in development for about 5 years, and has learned how to exploit durational information (words) as well as function word dependent phones.",
        "The SPHINX system also uses a somewhat larger",
        "training set (105 talkers, 4200 sentences) than used here.",
        "Based on the results presented in [1], using 3 codebooks, duration, function word phones, and generalized triphones (similar to CD PLU's discussed here), Lee obtained 93.7% word accuracy with the WP grammar on TS1 (150), and 70.6% word accuracy with the NO grammar [1].",
        "These results are comparable to the 93.3% word accuracy obtained for a 1759 CD PLU set on TS1 with the WP grammar and 72.1% word accuracy obtained for a 2340 CD PLU set with the NO grammar, as shown in Table 4.",
        "More recently, Lee at al.",
        "[13] have incorporated between-word training of the context dependent units (as well as between-word decoding) and a form of corrective training (a word discrimination procedure) to significantly improve recognition performance.",
        "Their current results are 96.2% word accuracy for TS1 with the WP grammar and 81.9% with the NG grammar using all the above techniques.",
        "This performance represents the highest-to-date reported word accuracy on any fluent speech, speaker independent, large vocabulary task.",
        "For comparisons of performance on the TS2 (FEB 89) test set, performance scores from CMU (Lee at al.",
        "), SRI (Murveit et a/.",

        "We need to significantly improve modeling of function words which involve on the order of 60-75% of the substitution, insertion and deletion errors that are made.",
        "The problems here are numerous in that the function words are extremely context sensitive.",
        "Several possibilities will have to be investigated including function word dependent PLU's (as used by Lee [1]), inter-word training of CD PLU's, multiple models of function word PLU's, and finally multiple lexical entries for these words."

        "We showed that for a basic set of 47 context independent phone-like units, word accuracies on the order of 86-90% could be obtained on a 1000 word vocabulary, in a speaker independent mode, for a grammar with a perplexity of 60, on independent test sets.",
        "When we increased the basic set of units to include context dependent units, we were able to achieve word recognition accuracies of from 91 to 93% on the same test sets.",
        "Based on outside results and some of our own preliminary evaluations, it seems clear that we can increase word recognition accuracies by about 2-3% based on known modeling techniques.",
        "The challenge for the immediate future is to learn how to increase word recognition accuracies to the 99% range, thereby making such systems useful for simple database management tasks."
