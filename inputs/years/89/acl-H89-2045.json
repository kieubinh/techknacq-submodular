        "Speech recognition systems are very sensitive to differences between the testing and training conditions.",
        "In particular, systems that are trained on high quality speech degrade drastically in noisy environments.",
        "One of several commonly used methods for handling this problem is to supplement the acoustic front-end of the recognizer with a statistical estimator.",
        "This paper introduces a novel estimation algorithm for a filter-bank based front-end, and describes recognition experiments with noisy speech.",
        "Estimation algorithms that have been used in filter-bank based systems can be classified by their estimation method – minimum mean square error (MMSE) versus subtraction – and by the features they estimate – DFT coefficients versus the filter-bank output energies.",
        "Boll [1] and Macaulay and Malpass [2] used spectral subtraction; Ephraim and Malah [3],[4] and Porter and Boll [5] used MMSE estimation of various functionals of the DFT coefficients; Van Compernolle used filter energy subtraction [6] and MMSE estimation of filter-bank log energies [7].",
        "The latter MMSE algorithm lacks, however, the degree of precision that has been incorporated by Porter and Boll in their statistical modeling and was not compared to their algorithm.",
        "A common deficiency of all of the above algorithms is that they estimate different frequency channels (whether DFT coefficients or filter output energies) independently.",
        "However, for a speech recognition system which is based on a distance metric, whether for template matching or vector quantization, the estimation should strive to minimize the average distortion as measured by the distance metric.",
        "For euclidean distance this criterion yields the following estimator",
        "where S is the clean speech feature vector and P (S I S') is the aposteriori probability of the clean speech given the noisy observation.",
        "This estimator is considerably more complex than the independent MMSE of individual components (denoted by Sk),",
        "since Eq.",
        "(1) involves the estimation of multidimensional probability distributions and multidimensional integrations, whereas Eq.",
        "(2) is a relatively simple one dimensional integral.",
        "Both Eqs.",
        "(1) and (2) can in principle be computed using Bayes's rule, which than requires the conditioned probability P(S'IS) of the noisy observation S' given that the clean speech was S, and the clean speech probability distribution P(S).",
        "Most HMM systems use probability densities or distance metrics in a transformed domain.",
        "For example, our recognizer uses a weighted euclidean distance on the cepstral transform of the filter-bank energies.",
        "Since the optimal estimation criterion cannot be easily satisfied for such a metric, the practical question is which features and what computationally feasible estimation scheme will best approximate the optimal estimator.",
        "We argue that the filter-bank log energies are more attractive to estimate relative to either the DFT or the cepstral coefficients.",
        "They are more attractive than DFT coefficients since (a) the euclidean distance between filter-bank energies vectors is a better approximation to the cepstral distance than a euclidean distance between any functional of the DFT coefficients, and (b), the estimation of typically 20-25 filter-bank energies is computationally easier than the estimation of typically 200 DFT coefficients.",
        "They are more attractive than the cepstral coefficients since the ■•■ conditioned probability P(S'IS) can be modeled accurately for gaussian type noise in the frequency domain but not in the cepstral domain.",
        "In the present work we achieved three objectives.",
        "First, we derived an MMSE estimator for filter-bank log-energies based on a more accurate statistical model than the one derived by Van Compemolle [7], and compared its performance to that achieved with the DFT estimator of Porter and Boll [5].",
        "Second, we improved over the independent MMSE estimation of individual filter energies by computing an approximation to the minimum-distortion estimator, Eq.(1).",
        "Third, the estimation algorithm was evaluated with SRI's DECIPHER continuous speech recognition system [8] on the NBS \"Resource management task\" speech database [9] with both additive white gaussian noise, and with desktop microphone recordings."
