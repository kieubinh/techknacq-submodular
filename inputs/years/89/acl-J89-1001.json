      "text": [
        "While natural language parsing has come to be a very serious and respectable field (almost as much as the theory of compilers, according to Martin Kay), a lot of new realizations that appear as variations of consolidated approaches continue to emerge in an unordered way._Although all this causes a lot of redundance and noise, we believe that it is important to maintain this experimental attitude, provided that it is complemented by a correct acknowledgment of the state of the art.",
        "In our own work we have followed a set of ideas in the belief that, at this stage, it was better to see them realized in a \"closed\" world (one in which we do not adopt an external formalism, but rather one in which things are conceived and realized autonomously) that still could lead to a convergence with other more widely accepted currents of lexicon privileging parsing, such as lexical-functional grammar (LFG).",
        "The best machines that actually parse NL (human beings) are able to dynamically disambiguate a sentence and to make sense of partial parsings, and they take advantage of this ability in their normal activities.",
        "Machines that do not do that: a) are bound to have problems in communicating with the machines cited above; and b) will give limited support to our understanding of those machines.",
        "While these statements may be readily endorsed by all those working with an \"integrated\" or \"semantics driven\" approach, things are less clear when we consider research in which the emphasis is on the role of a strong syntactic component that, per se, may lead only to a shallow semantic representation.",
        "Although we belong to this latter sub-community, we nonetheless believe that parsing as such must deal with the above statements.",
        "In recent years work on a number of languages other than English, the renewed interest in nontransforma-tional grammars, and the taking into account of the experience in parsing have influenced the appearance of new linguistic theories, such as lexical-functional grammar (Kaplan and Bresnan 1982), generalized phrase structure grammar (GPSG) (Gazdar and Pullum 1982), functional unification grammar (FUG) (Kay 1979), definite clause grammar (DCG) (Pereira and Warren 1980), and tree adjoining grammar (TAG) (Joshi and Levy 1982).",
        "The appearance of these theories has likewise meant a strong interest in the development and refinement of some techniques that are well suited to processing data expressed within the abstract formalisms characterizing all these approaches, namely feature structures.",
        "In particular, unification has become the basic idea (Shieber 1986), even if with a large number of variations on the formal character (for instance, one may compare Prolog-based unification for DCG, specialized unification for particular data types in FUG, equation resolution for LFG), and on overall strategies.",
        "Often unification is combined with tabular methods derived from techniques used for parsing programming languages.",
        "These methods are naturally suited for parsing nondeterministically context-free languages, allowing for the drastic reduction of the complexity of a nondeterministic algorithm to acceptable polynomial figures (Aho and Ullman 1972).",
        "Given the present tendency to emphasize the reducibility of natural language to tractable formal languages (see, for instance, Joshi and Levy 1982), and the high level of ambiguity typical of natural language, this is a fairly natural choice.",
        "The most relevant of these techniques for natural language is chart parsing (Kay 1980, Kaplan 1973).",
        "See also another interesting and efficient technique in Tomita (1985).",
        "Shieber et al.",
        "(1983) and Kart-tunen (1986) introduce a neutral tool, usable with a number of different formalisms all based on chart and unification.",
        "It is worth noting that while in some of the referred works there is an explicit interest in the human dynamics of parsing, for most of them the effort is devoted to building clean and efficient mechanisms that are able to associate syntactic descriptions or mappings of structures to input sentences.",
        "Our parser was developed with two purposes in mind: 1) understanding more fully the nature of language understanding and trying out our ideas concerning it; and 2) having an adequate tool for processing the Italian language.",
        "With regard to point 1, our view of syntax is twofold, namely as: a. a set of specifications and constraints that, in parsing, guide the search for, and the linking together of, pieces of semantic representation, at the same time delivering an overall functional description.",
        "This is expressed basically in the lexicon.",
        "b. imposing restrictions on the spaces of search for pieces to be linked together, possibly taking into account general criteria of linear precedence.",
        "As far as point 2 is concerned, Italian is a freer word order language than English (e.g., subject-verb-object is only the most likely order in simple declarative sentences â€“ the other five permutations of subject verb and object may occur as well, even in written Italian) and it has a richer morphology.",
        "Therefore the role of syntax specified in (b) above is somewhat reduced, while constraints and specifications due to the lexicon, of the kind specified in (a) above are richer.",
        "Of course, also, morphological analysis is an inescapable aspect that must be combined with syntax.",
        "In particular, in Italian, you can find words like rifacendogliene, which stands for \"while making some (of them) for him again.\"",
        "The lexicon in our system includes a large quantity of information, represented in a particular form of feature structure, one in which alternative subcategorizations are presented in a compact way.",
        "There is a simple centralized component that deals with distributional aspects of language.",
        "In our approach we can state all the variations of word ordering: from obligatory positions of a constituent in the string, to an obligatory position in relation to another constituent, to a preferred position, all the way down to simply admittable positions.",
        "Parsing is the process of building an internal representation of the sentence, while disambiguating in local conditions of uncertainty.",
        "In this sense we follow a non-deterministic approach that results in a particular realization of the idea of chart parsing, such that the process goes bottom-up but with strict top-down confirmation.",
        "The concept of \"sleeping edge\" guarantees that all needed edges are introduced, whatever the order of the operations, but also that not too many superfluous edges are introduced.",
        "Chart parsing is combined with dynamic unification.",
        "The main idea is that unification is not carried on in a second phase, after chart parsing has yielded a constituent structure (as in the basic LFG implementation), but also that it must not be flatly incremental (as in PROLOG-based systems).",
        "Our strategy, embodied in the so-called Principle of the Good Clerk, is that unification is (asymmetrically) carried out after the main element of the constituent has been analyzed.",
        "This does not mean that unification here does not maintain its highly desirable qualities, such as order independence and monotonicity.",
        "This is true also here, only that the application of unification is not continuous; our strategy seems reasonable and advantageous especially with languages in which considerable freedom is allowed in ordering the constituents.",
        "We would like to emphasize the fact that while the fundamental role of a particular word class for a given constituent (often called the \"head\") is a well-established concept in many linguistic theories, a similarly privileged role within the process of parsing is not common.",
        "The parser is also designed for online interaction with a semantic context and therefore any particular data structure that it builds is a shallow semantic representation, i.e., a logical form of the analyzed portions of the sentence.",
        "This approach is also a good starting point for recognizing idioms.",
        "Most parsers are either devoted to idiom recognition, do not treat idioms at all, or else have a very special separate device for that purpose.",
        "In the present work instead, we propose a view of the idiom recognition process as completely integrated with the parser, so that, in particular, idiom recognition can take advantage of the flexibility of the approach without redundancy.",
        "We think this is important, because idioms are on a continuum with literal language and share the \"normal\" characteristics, including the flexibility, of the particular language involved.",
        "The treatment of idiom recognition does not differ from the literal process until a threshold of activation of a flexible pattern is crossed.",
        "At that point a new idiomatic process is added.",
        "Another salient point is that within our approach, given the fact that the algorithm is of a multiprocessing type, one can consider what strategies may be introduced in order to select dynamically the tasks that have better chances to lead to the (preferable) final analysis.",
        "These heuristics can also rely on measures of likelihood associated with each partial analysis.",
        "An integrated",
        "Oliviero Stock Parsing with Flexibility, Dynamic Strategies, and Idioms in Mind interactive environment has been built up to experiment with these ideas.",
        "Besides aspects present in other environments, e.g., D-PATR and the LFG workbench, our environment provides scope for the cognitive scientist, or the application-minded one dealing with a restricted sublanguage, to explore and define processing behaviour.",
        "In this paper, after an introductory example, we first outline the characteristics of linguistic knowledge for our parser and give an overview of the parser itself.",
        "Following that we describe the particular kind of unification used.",
        "The way non-determinism and disambiguation work is then discussed.",
        "This is followed by a brief description of our treatment of long-distance dependencies.",
        "After that comes a description of syntax-based idiom recognition, in our view one of the most relevant features of our work.",
        "A description of the environment built around the parser and of experiments carried on in defining dynamic strategies concludes the paper."

        "We shall begin with an informal example to give the flavour of a basic part of our approach.",

        "The sentence is topicalized, resulting in a quite common construction.",
        "The representations for the first noun phrase (NP) and the prepositional phrase (PP) are built up as parsing proceeds.",
        "The building includes both a functional and a semantic representation of the constituents, drawn from information explicited in the lexical entries.",
        "At the level of the subject (S) constituent being built, no commitment is taken for what will be the subject, even when the auxiliary ha is dealt with.",
        "The verb prescritto instead causes the merging of information available so far.",
        "Therefore some of the functions specified with the verb will find their values (notably the oblique object and the direct object functions).",
        "The constituent un itinerario molto noioso fails to be chosen as a subject, by virtue of the result of the interaction of the parser with a (separate, and not described in this paper) semantic component that is questioned at the moment of building a new semantic representation.",
        "In fact here the meaning of the proposed subject would not be compatible with the agent role for the verb; therefore the only possibility becomes the goal role.",
        "Note that interaction with semantics is possible because we have partial representations available at this point.",
        "After that, the analysis is guided by the context that has been built so far.",
        "There could be two possible constituents whose construction may begin with the word la (this word is ambiguous â€“ one reading is an article, the other reading a clitic): an S and an NP.",
        "But these bottom-up proposals are checked and, as only an NP is expected, only that interpretation is carried out, and is ultimately unified with the previous representation to produce a complete representation of the sentence, with la guida as subject.",
        "With an algorithm that yields constituent structures at an initial stage and performs unification at a later stage, things would have been different.",
        "The dynamic interaction with semantics-based disambiguation, when the object is chosen, the selection of the correct interpretation of la guida later in the process would not have been straightforward; moreover, positional flexibility could have been achieved only at further cost and, finally, there would have been more redundancy.",
        "An approach based on strictly incremental unification would have needed instead either a lot of redundancy at the level of descriptive patterns or a useless tentative commitment to binding the first NP to information carried by the auxiliary."

        "We shall now begin describing our parser, called WEDNESDAY 2 and implemented in Interlisp-D on a Xerox AI-Processor.",
        "In the first place we shall give a brief description of how linguistic knowledge is encoded.",
        "WEDNESDAY 2 is based on the assumption that most linguistic knowledge can be conveniently distributed through the lexicon.",
        "The lexicon includes in a compact form a lot of information that is normally stored in a grammar.",
        "This information includes semantics, syntactic \"static\" specifications such as category, mood and tense, case marking, the specification of the relation between semantic objects and syntactic objects, such as grammatical functions, but also some more detailed specifications of constraints in binding these objects to other objects that can occur in the sentence.",
        "These specifications describe in disjunctive form sets of features that include different aspects: beside the usual ones (syntactic category, generic features, such as gender, number, person, case marking), relative positions of the entities in the string combined with a measure of likelihood of these positions, cospe-cification of co-occurring phenomena (such as the equinp in a subordinate clause), and measures of likelihood of the obligatoriness of the actual finding of one such entity to be unified with.",
        "A characteristic aspect of lexical representation in WEDNESDAY 2 is that semantic objects are part of the value of linguistic functions.",
        "The only centralized component of the system, in the form of a simple (recursive) transition network, deals with aspects of distribution of constituents.",
        "The treatment of rather free word order languages becomes quite natural within this approach, and, in particular, the centralized network then becomes very simple.",
        "The important thing to note is that the network does not support operations of structure building (like in an ATN: Woods 1970) nor free annotations, including occurrence of equations (such as in LFG rules).",
        "It is the Computational Linguistics, Volume 15, Number 1, March 1989 3 Oliviero Stock Parsing with Flexibility, Dynamic Strategies, and Idioms in Mind lexicon that bears feature sets: the network merely has the role of restricting the space where unification can be carried on.",
        "Each entry in the lexicon may include:",
        "1.",

        "They can be seen as a set of propositions that use semantic predicates and arguments.",
        "Of course, every format has its own operational modality.",
        "For instance, unification in a semantic network is carried on as a node merging operation: two or more nodes in one or more net shreds collapse into a single node, producing a new net configuration, that nonetheless subsumes the previous ones.",

        "It is worth noting that the Main constitutes a concept that bears some similarity with the concept of \"head\" in some linguistic theories.",
        "The most relevant difference, and the one that justifies the use of a different term, is that the value of the Main is an object in the semantic representation, integrated with syntactic specifications.",
        "c. category d. mood and tense.",
        "Syntactic data here are supplemented by other dynamic syntactic information, kept separate from them for the sake of clarity.",
        "The latter consists of sets of constraints on variables but a good metaphor would be to view them as impulses to connect fragments of semantic information, guided by syntactic constraints.",
        "Yet, impulses are in a declarative format and are actually interpreted by the parsing algorithm.",
        "Impulses specify characteristics of an entity to be identified in a given search space.",
        "They have alternatives (for instance, the word \"tell\" has an impulse to merge its object node with the Main of either an NP or a subordinate clause).",
        "An alternative includes: a contextual condition of applicability, a category, features, case marking, side effects (through which, for example, coreference between sub",
        "ject of a subordinate clause and a function of the main clause can be indicated).",
        "Impulses may also be directed to a different search space than the normal one.",
        "Furthermore, there can be also impulses that do not involve operations on the semantic representation: they set markings or features for linguistic functions or for the Main.",
        "Measures of likelihood can also be specified a. for one alternative to be considered; b. for which relative position the entity sought should be in with respect to the present word; c. for the overall necessity of finding the entity.",
        "These measures processed together with other ones will give a quantitative account of the likelihood of an analysis and will dynamically play a heuristic role.",

        "As we use a semantic network format, the n's are called nodes.",
        "Besides the three arguments of the predicate, there is a node, nl, that stands for the instantiation of the involved predicate.",

        "The number is singular and the case marking nominative.",
        "The initial t indicates that no further condition must be obeyed.",
        "The object function",
        "Oliviero Stock Parsing with Flexibility, Dynamic Strategies, and Idioms in Mind necessarily requires one of the alternatives: a noun phrase, a simple subordinate clause, or an infinitive clause.",
        "This last alternative specifies that the infinitive occurs with likelihood 0.1 before the present word (and with likelihood 0.9 after it) and must be marked with a di case.",
        "Moreover the subject of the infinitive is to be made coreferent with the oblique object of the present clause, at the same time as object unification.",
        "We have briefly referred to the only centralized data structures in WEDNESDAY 2 that handle the distribution of constituents and, in operating terms, the restriction of the space where unification can take place.",
        "We say that this part is concerned with opening, closing and maintaining search spaces, where entities sought by impulses are possibly found.",
        "It is realized with very simple space management transition networks (SMTNs), in which $EXP, a distinguished symbol on an arc, indicates that only the occurrence of something expected by the preceding context (i.e., for which an impulse was set up) may allow the transition.",
        "SMTNs can impose generalized linear precedence on labeled substrings.",
        "They encode information that could be expressed by rewriting rules, factorizing fragments that are common to different rules more perspicaciously.",
        "In particular for Italian, which has a substantially freer word order language than English, such networks are very simple.",
        "Only locally do they impose an ordering (for instance, prepositions come before what they mark).",
        "More often they only exclude intraposition of a constituent not belonging to the current space.",
        "It should be noted also that a set of acceptable verbal moods and tenses may be specified on entry points in the SMTNs.",
        "For instance, a (main) sentence needs a verb in a finite tense.",
        "It is worth noting that SMTNs are converted into an internal format that includes also a table of first transition cross references, i.e., for each space type T, F(T), the set of initial states that allow for transition on T, or, recursively on a space type subsumed by a state in F(T).",

        "Furthermore, to be more precise, stems are put in hierarchies of prototypes: the result is that linguistic data are much less redundant than appeared in our introductory description.",
        "The process leans heavily on the idea of chart (Kay 1980, Kaplan 1973).",
        "Chart parsing is a very general concept for non-deterministic parsing (see, for instance, Thompson 1981 and Ritchie and Thompson 1984), historically",
        "inspired by Earley's (1970) work on CFL parsing.",

        "For an inactive edge there is a specification of the category of the constituent.",
        "In the case of an active edge, a rewriting rule in the grammar and a position on the right hand side of that rule are provided, thus indicating what is still in order to complete the recognition of the constituent.",

        "Computer-based environments for the linguist are conceived as sophisticated workbenches, built on AI workstations around a specific parser, where the linguist can try out his/her ideas about a grammar for a certain natural language.",
        "In doing so, he/she can take advantage of rich and easy-to-use graphic interfaces that \"know\" about linguistics.",
        "Of course, behind all this lies the idea that cooperation with linguists will provide better results in NLP.",
        "To substantiate this assumption it may be recalled that some of the most interesting recent ideas on syntax have been developed by means of joint contributions from linguists and computational linguists.",
        "Instances of the tools introduced above are the LFG environment, which was probably the first of its kind, an environment built by Ron Kaplan for lexical-functional grammars, D-PATR, built by Lauri Karttunen (Karttunen 1986) and conceived as an environment that would suit linguists of a number of different schools all committed to a view of parsing as a process that makes use of a unification algorithm.",
        "The environment we have developed has a somewhat different purpose.",
        "Besides a number of tools for entering data in graphic mode and inspecting resulting structures, it provides a means for experimenting with strategies in the course of the parsing process.",
        "We think that this can be a valuable tool for gaining insight into the cognitive aspects of language processing as well as for tailoring the behaviour of the processor when used with a particular sublanguage.",
        "In this way an attempt can be made to answer basic questions in the course of a nondeterministic approach: what heuristics to apply when facing a certain choice point, what to do when facing a failure point, i.e., which of the pending processes to activate, taking account of information resulting from the failure?",
        "Of course this kind of environment makes sense only because the parser it works on has some characteristics that make it a psychologically interesting realization.",
        "Psychologically motivated parsers may be put in three main categories.",
        "First, those that embody a strong claim on the specification of the general control structure of the human parsing mechanism.",
        "The authors usually consider the level of basic control of the system as the level they are simulating and are not concerned with more particular heuristics.",
        "An instance of this class of parsers in Marcus's parser (Marcus 1979), based on the claim that, basically, parsing is a deterministic process: only sentences that we perceive as surprising (the so-called \"garden paths\") actually imply backtracking.",
        "Connectionist parsers are also instances of this category.",
        "The second category refers to general linguistic performance notions such as the Lexical Preference Principle and the Final Argument Principle (Fodor, Bresnan, and Kaplan 1982).",
        "It includes theories of processing like the one expressed by Wanner and Maratsos for ATNs in the mid-'70s.",
        "In this category the arguments are at the level of general structural preference analysis.",
        "A third category tends, at every stage of the parsing process, to consider the full complexity of the data and the hypothetical partial internal representation of the sentence, including, at least in principle, interaction with knowledge of the world, aspects of memory, and particular task-oriented behavior.",
        "Worth mentioning here are Church and Patil (1982) and Barton et al.",
        "(1987), who attempt to put some order in the chaos of complexity and computational load.",
        "Our parser lies between the second and the third of the above categories.",
        "The parser is seen as a nondeterministic apparatus that disambiguates and gives a \"shallow\" interpretation and an incremental functional representation of each processed fragment of the sentence, and allows choices to be made among alternatives in a cognitively meaningful way.",
        "We shall briefly describe the environment and, by way of example, illustrate its behavior by analyzing oscillating sentences, i.e., sentences in which one first perceives a fragment in one way, then changes one's mind and takes it in a different way, then, as further input comes in, goes back to the previous pattern (and possibly continuing like this till the end of the sentence)."

        "Moreover, we have been reversing the process for the purpose of generation (Caraceni and Stock 1987).",
        "We think that, beside the interest of generation per se and the usefulness of having a generator based on the same principles and data of the parser, this is, paradoxically, the real test for our parser.",

        "As a word reading is a complex object for WEDNESDAY 2, entering a new word can be greatly facilitated by a set of subwindows, each specialized in one aspect of the word, \"knowing\" what it may be like and facilitating editing.",
        "The lexicon is a lexicon of stems: a morphological analyzer and a lexicon manager are integrated in the system.",
        "Let us briefly describe this point.",
        "A lexicalist theory such as ours requires that a large quantity of information be included in the lexicon.",
        "This information has different origins: some comes from the stem and some from the affixes.",
        "All the information must be put into a coherent data structure, through a particularly constrained unification-based process.",
        "Furthermore, we must emphasize the fact that, just as in LFG, phenomena such as passivization are treated in the lexicon (the Subject and Object functions and the related impulses attached to the active form are rearranged).",
        "This is something that the morphological analyzer must deal with.",
        "The internal behavior of the morphological analyzer is beyond the scope of the present paper.",
        "We shall instead briefly discuss the lexicon manager, the role of which will be emphasized here.",
        "The lexicon manager deals with the complex process of entering data, maintaining, and preprocessing the lexicon.",
        "One notable aspect is that we have arranged the lexicon on a hierachical basis according to inheritance, so that properties of a particular word can be inherited from a word class and a word class can inherit aspects from another class.",
        "One consequence of this is that we",
        "can introduce a graphic aspect (Figure 10) and the user can browse through the lattice (the lexicon appears as a tree of classes where one has specialized editors at each level).",
        "What is even more relevant is the fact that one can factorize knowledge that is in the lexicon, so that if one particular phenomenon needs to be treated differently, the change of information is immediate for the words concerned.",
        "Of course, this also means that there is a space gain: the same information does not need to be duplicated â€“ complete word data are reconstructed when required.",

        "â€¢ a window graphically displaying the semantic interpretation of an edge as a semantic net or, if one prefers (this is usually the case when the net is too complex), in logical format; â€¢ a window where one can manipulate the agenda (Figure 11).",
        "Attached to this window we have a menu including a set of functions that the tasks included in the agenda to be manipulated: \"move before\", \"move after\", \"delete\", \"switch\", \"undo\", etc.",
        "One just points to the two particular tasks one wishes to operate on with the mouse and then to the menu entry, thus obtaining the desired effect.",
        "The same effect could be obtained by applying a different scheduling function: the tasks will be picked up in the order here prescribed by manual scheduling.",
        "This tool, when the parser is in the stepping modality, provides a very easy way of altering the default behavior of the system and of trying out new strategies.",
        "The manual scheduling mode is supplemented by a series of counters that provide control over the penetrance of these strategies.",
        "(The penetrance of a nondeterministic algorithm is the ratio between the",
        "steps that lead to the solution and the overall steps carried out in trying to obtain the solution.",
        "Of course this measure lies between 0 and 1).",
        "Dynamically, it is attempted to find sensible strategies, by interacting with the agenda.",

        "It should also be noted that the surprise seems to be caused not by a heavy computational load, but by a sudden readjustment of the weights of the hypotheses.",
        "In a sense it is a matter of memory, rather than computation.",
        "We have succeeded in getting WEDNESDAY 2 to perform naturally in such situations, taking advantage of the environment.",

        "The likelihood of an edge depends on: 1. the likelihood of the included edges; 2. the level of obligatoriness of the filled impulses; 3. the likelihood of a particular relative position of an argument in the string; 4. the likelihood of that transition in the network, given the previous transition.",
        "The critical points in the sentence are the following (note that we distinguish between a PP and a \"marked NP\" possible argument of a verb, where the preposition has no associated semantics): i.",
        "At the beginning: only the PP edge is expanded, (not the one including a marked NP) because of static preference for the former expressed in the lexicon and in the transition network.",

        "iii.",
        "After the object Roma: when the preposition a comes in, the edge that can extend the sentence with a PP on the one hand, and on the other hand a cycling active edge that is a promising satisfaction for an impulse are compared.",
        "Since this relative position of the argument is so favorable for the particular verb preferisco (.9 to .1 for this position compared to the preceding one), the parser proceeds with the alternative view, taking a Napoli, as a modifier, and so on, after reentering the working hypothesis.",
        "The object is already there, analyzed for the other reading and does not need to be reanalyzed.",

        "We have focused on some important features of a parser, e.g., able to perform unification while working on structures, able to analyze idiomatic forms, providing a good testbed for ideas about dynamic strategies.",
        "The parser we have introduced is based on linguistic knowledge distributed fundamentally through the lexicon and uses a chart with unification activity developed when new edges are established.",
        "Especially if word order is flexible, it is important to avoid redundancy and detect useless hypotheses at an early stage.",
        "Here, chart",
        "parsing is based on a bottom up with left context confirmation strategy and unification is based on the Principle of the Good Clerk.",
        "Also, we have proposed a view of the idiom recognition process that is completely integrated with the parser, so that, in particular, idiom recognition can take advantage of the flexibility of the approach without redundancy.",
        "We think that this is important, because idioms are on a continuum with literal language, and, share the \"normal\" characteristics, including the flexibility, of the particular language involved.",
        "Moreover, given that the algorithm is of a multiprocessing type, one can consider what strategies can be introduced in order to select dynamically the tasks that have best chances of leading to the (preferable) final analysis.",
        "These heuristics can also take advantage of measures of likelihood associated with each partial analysis.",
        "An integrated interactive environment has been built to experiment with these ideas, which can also be used to define sublanguages and select strategies for particular applications."
