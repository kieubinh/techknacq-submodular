        "Parsing a sentence requires information about the parts of speech of its words.",

        "For example, the EPISTLE system (Jensen 1983, Heidorn 1982) employs a 130,000- word dictionary.",
        "Although a small dictionary of 200-300 words suffices for the function words (e.g., prepositions, pronouns), being able to identify nouns and verbs has required much larger dictionaries.",
        "Locating the verbs in a sentence is particularly useful to specifying prosody, because pauses often occur immediately before or after a verb group.",
        "The system described in this paper recognizes all function words and some content words, and uses syntactic constraints to estimate which words are likely to form phrases.",
        "It is compared to similar systems using dictionaries in excess of 2,000 words, which have been only partially described in the literature (Dewar 1969, Bachenko 1986).",
        "To the author's knowledge, these latter systems are the only other ones that have attempted parsing on arbitrary text with dictionaries of fewer than 10,000 words.",
        "Because the parser described here has access only to a very small dictionary, it cannot exploit many of the advances in parsing in recent years.",
        "What is explained below, however, is that accurate parsing need not require large dictionaries."

        "Such a system can use a very limited grammar in formulating the syntactic structure of the output speech (\"concept to speech\": Young 1979).",
        "In some future systems, the queries may be in the form of speech, and automatic speech recognizers will extract prosody and syntax patterns, which can in turn be of assistance in synthesizing responses.",
        "A more immediate synthesis application is automatic text to speech synthesis (Klatt 1987).",
        "The conversion of arbitrary English text to speech is useful in aids for the blind and in general voice response systems.",
        "Visually handicapped people (few of whom know Braille) can have direct access to the vast wealth of printed information via an optical character reader and a text to speech synthesizer.",
        "Concerning voice response, much information in data bases is in the form of text; with an automatic text to speech system, people could telephone a remote data base and hear a vocal version of the information.",
        "The queries must be entered through",
        "the telephone keypad or via speech of isolated words (where prosody and syntax plays no role), but the output speech can be in the form of sentences.",
        "In synthesis from a text of English sentences, the naturalness and intelligibility of the output speech is highly dependent upon realistic prosodic patterns (O'Shaughnessy 1983a).",
        "Current synthesizers have difficulty obtaining sufficient linguistic information from an input text to specify prosody properly.",
        "The syntactic structure of the text, in particular, is a major factor in determining where a speaker should pause, which words to stress, and how to use pitch rises and falls.",
        "However, the problem of parsing natural English, even using a large dictionary indicating parts of speech for all possible words, is as yet unsolved.",
        "English allows many syntactic constructions, which one recognizes when reading a text aloud.",
        "Text to speech systems, especially when pronouncing sentences with few punctuation marks, perform much more poorly than humans do.",
        "In some systems, the problem is further complicated because the number of entries in the dictionary must be minimized for economy.",
        "Such systems usually employ letter to phoneme rules, and a small dictionary to pronounce words for which the rules are inadequate.",
        "For certain words, knowledge of their syntactic role is imperative for proper pronunciation; e.g., refuse, wind, lives, separate use different sounds depending on whether they act as noun, verb, or adjective.",
        "Very little work on parsing sentences for speech synthesis purposes has been reported.",
        "This paper is the first to give parsing details specifically for synthesis while using a dictionary of fewer than 300 words.",
        "In most other references, the parsing problem is only mentioned in passing (Flanagan 1970; Coker 1973; Klatt 1987).",
        "The most documented system, MITalk-79 (Allen 1987), uses a large dictionary and treats parsing only on a local basis, ignoring important syntactic structures that encompass the entire sentence.",
        "Restricting the dictionary to a few hundred entries limits the ability of a parser to correctly analyze all texts.",
        "For text to speech, however, it is unnecessary to have a complete parse of the text to be spoken.",
        "The dictionary and pronunciation rules must be powerful enough to avoid mistakes in the translation of letters into phonemes, of course.",
        "But syntactic structure is useful mostly in specifying prosody, e.g., when to pause, which words to stress, and whether to raise or lower pitch at the end of a sentence.",
        "Syntactic information sufficient to specify prosody rarely requires a complete parse.",
        "Positions of major syntactic boundaries and identification of stressed words are of major concern.",
        "Confusions between nouns and adjectives, for instance, have little bearing on prosody.",
        "Using a flexible parser, moreover, minimizes the chance of meeting an unparsable text (Weischedel 1980).",
        "A parsing failure in synthesis systems is only serious if it results in an incorrect prosodic assignment that adversely affects the intelligibility or correct interpretation of the output speech.",
        "Whille a local parsing error in one part of a sentence may lead to errors elsewhere in the sentence, many minor errors that occur in our parser due to use of a small dictionary have little effect on the important aspects of the global sentence parse."

        "The relationship between a text and its prosody is complex.",
        "Speakers vary pitch, duration, and intensity (the aspects of prosody) primarily to highlight certain words for the listener and to partition the utterance into short segments for easier perceptual processing (O'Shaughnessy 1983b).",
        "Speakers tend to pause at major syntactic boundaries, but the frequency and duration of the pauses also reflect the length of the phrases (measured by the number of words or syllables) between pauses (Gee 1983).",
        "Syntactic boundaries are also often cued, in addition to pauses, by a pitch rise and lengthening of the final syllable prior to the boundary.",
        "Speakers have much freedom in choosing where and how long to pause and which words to emphasize; such choices are motivated by their desire to communicate meaning to a listener.",
        "Thus the semantics of a text is as important for specifying prosody as its syntactic structure (Selkirk 1984).",
        "Unfortunately, automatic semantic analysis of arbitrary text is very difficult and not feasible for text to speech (for concept to speech synthesis, on the other hand, semantics may be more readily obtained).",
        "Since syntactic structure correlates well with prosody in speech spoken at a normal rate, without emotional and other contextual influences, the parse of a text is a feasible alternative to semantic analysis for text to speech prosody.",
        "Besides indicating likely pause locations, the other major way that syntax influences prosody is that speakers stress important words, i.e., words that are unexpected by listeners and add most to the information content of an utterance.",
        "Thus most function words are not stressed.",
        "A dictionary that identifies the function words can cue a synthesizer to stress all other words.",
        "The amount of stress a word receives is proportional to its importance (or its unexpectedness).",
        "Small function words occurring in syntactically restricted (and thus somewhat redundant) positions rarely have semantic importance.",
        "As far as part of speech is concerned, however, the words with the greatest stress are included in our dictionary: sentential adverbs, not, modal verbs, quantifiers, and interrogative words tend to be more stressed than nouns, verbs, and adjectives (O'Shaughnessy 1983b).",
        "Among the unidentified words, there is no large variance in stress due to part of speech, and therefore no need to further specify them for stress purposes.",
        "Due to the large prosodic effects at pauses, however, we must try to specify the syntactic role of such words sufficiently to find pause locations.",

      "text": [
        "For text to speech, the primary task for a parser is to segment a sentence into phrasal units each containing a few words.",
        "Such units often act as prosodic (intona-tional) groups.",
        "Pauses are usually restricted to come at the boundaries of these units, and the final word (among others) in each unit is usually stressed.",
        "Determining the higher-level syntactic structure that links these phrasal units together is often more difficult.",
        "Thus parsing for speech synthesis can employ two strategies: local and global.",
        "The local strategy typically operates first and goes left to right through each sentence, i.e., as the words enter the system.",
        "For real time applications, it may be important to output parsing results even before the final words of a sentence are available.",
        "Since a global strategy may require examining as much as the entire sentence, it may revise the parse of the early parts of a sentence as later words are analyzed.",
        "The global analysis should also attempt left to right (real time) analysis; this is adequate for most sentences, but ones with complex syntactic structure (e.g., unpunctuated subordinate clauses) often require examination of the entire sentence for a correct parse.",
        "Sentence-final punctuation (!",
        "?)",
        "can significantly affect the sentence's prosody (and parse, to a lesser extent).",
        "In the case of long sentences with such final punctuation, however, the prosodic changes due to the punctuation primarily affect only the last clause.",
        "Locally, our parser groups words likely to act as prosodic units.",
        "This means composing various phrases (perhaps smaller than traditional linguistic units) out of component words: 1. noun group (NG), which consists of a noun and its immediately preceding words (e.g., article, quantifier); 2. verb group (VG), which consists of a verbal word optionally preceded by modal and auxiliary verbs; 3. prepositional phrase (PP), which consists of a preposition followed by a NG; 4. adjectival phrase (AdjP), which consists of an adjective, possibly preceded by an adverb; 5. adverbial phrase (AdvP) (see Appendix 1).",
        "(This list is similar to that in Bachenko 1986.)",
        "For the purposes of local parsing, NGs and VGs are more useful units than noun phrases (NPs), which consist of an NG followed by PPs or AdjPs, and verb phrases (VPs), which consist of a VG followed by its complement(s).",
        "Pauses are rare within word sequences corresponding to the five basic phrasal units noted here, but often occur within an NP or VP.",
        "To help locate phrase boundaries, the parser exploits constraints on word order in NGs and VGs; when normal order appears to have been violated, it is likely that a phrase boundary has occurred at the point of deviation.",
        "The problem of sentence segmentation is assisted by punctuation marks (e.g., commas), which often occur at clause boundaries.",
        "However, many sentences have little internal punctuation.",
        "The word sequences that colons and semicolons delimit can be treated as sentences for prosodic purposes.",
        "Left marks (quotes, parentheses, brackets, braces) act as phrase-introducing marks, and corresponding right marks terminate phrases.",
        "Both dashes and commas tend to partition the sentence into clauses and phrases, and are likely places for pauses and prosodic marking, especially as the lengths of the phrases they delimit increase in size.",
        "However, commas are not restricted to delimiting major syntactic units.",
        "In lists of two or more units (of similar syntactic identity), commas are often internal to major phrases (e.g., \"foxes, mice, and birds\" forms a single NP).",
        "Although the words just prior to such commas are often prosodically marked with pitch rises, pauses are usually reserved for boundaries between long or major phrases.",
        "Furthermore, lists of words containing commas do not always employ a coordinate conjunction (e.g., \"a slimy, round, large, red fish\").",
        "It often makes little difference to the prosody of such phrases whether the commas are present or not; thus one cannot treat each comma as a syntactic boundary."

        "The parts of speech that the parser employs can be grouped into classes, which are subdivided according to the useful parsing features that distinguish words.",
        "The dictionary contains about 60% function words and 40% content words.",
        "The largest classes of function words are the prepositions and conjunctions, each having about 13% of the dictionary words.",
        "They are followed (in order of decreasing size) by auxiliary verbs, pronouns, numerals, quantifiers, and articles.",
        "The dictionary content words are dominated by the adverbs (25% of the dictionary), with common verbs making up most of the rest.",
        "The remaining thousands of words that are not in the dictionary fall into four classes: noun, adjective, verb, and adverb.",
        "Adverbs not in the dictionary end in -ly and are thus identified by their suffix.",
        "Hence words not recognized by the dictionary are limited to act as verbs or nouns.",
        "(In terms of parsing for prosody, little is lost by treating adjectives as nouns, since they often occur interchangeably in similar positions, e.g., as a complement after a verb or as modifiers in an NG.)",
        "The role of the dictionary then is to specify the syntactic functions of all words that belong to small classes of words.",
        "A word dictionary of 300 entries, augmented by a suffix analyzer (described in Section 5) using fewer than 60 suffixes, is sufficient to identify all words except those acting as nouns, adjectives, and verbs.",
        "These latter classes are open and contain a theoretically unlimited number of words.",
        "The power of the parser can be increased by including some of these words (e.g., verbs with irregular endings or which take two objects), but the dictionary rapidly increases in size in such cases with only limited benefits for prosody.",

        "When the new word is syntactically incompatible with prior words (for reasons described below), a new phrasal unit is started.",

        "While relative pronouns (where, that) and adjectives (whose) can act as conjunctions in starting clauses, such clauses function as NPs (and serve as a subject or object in a clause for the higher-level parse), whereas clauses introduced by other conjunctions are riot directly linked to adjacent words.",
