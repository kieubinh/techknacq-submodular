        "We introduce a new approach to representing and manipulating various types of non-singular concepts in natural language discourse.",
        "The representation we describe is based on a partially ordered structure of levels in which the objects of the same relative singularity are assigned to the same level.",
        "Our choice of the representation has been motivated by the following main concerns: 1.",
        "The representation should systematically distinguish between those language terms that are used to refer to objects of different singularity, that is, those classified within different but related levels of the model; 2.",
        "The representation should capture certain types of inter-sentential dependencies in discourse, most notably anaphoric-type cohesive links; 3.",
        "Finally, the representation should serve as a basis for defining a formal semantics of discourse paragraphs that would allow for capturing the exact truth conditions of sentences involving non-singular terms, and for computing interlevel inferences.",
        "In this paper we discuss (1) and (2) only.",
        "(3) is currently under investigation and will be the topic of a forthcoming article.",
        "We believe that our approach promotes computational feasibility, because we avoid the identification of general terms, like \"temperature,\" \"water,\" etc., with intensions, that is, functions over possible worlds.",
        "In our theory, the concept of non-singularity has a local (often subjective) character."

        "Treating non-singular concepts is a difficult representation problem in natural language research.",
        "Non-singular concepts, as we shall understand them here, are often abstract entities created to embrace a variety of smaller or larger collections of \"instances\" or \"specimen.\" They are usually referred to using bare plural noun phrases (such as birds, alligators, presidents), or definite singular noun phrases with \"generic\" interpretation (the alligator, the president).",
        "The literature describes numerous forms of non-singular concepts and corresponding to them non-singular terms that can be found in natural language discourse, including intensional (or functional), mass, generic, habitual, abstract, and more; see, for example, Montague (1974a), Lewis (1976), Barwise and Perry (1983), Quine (1960), Donnel-lan (1971), Vendler (1971), and Kripke (1972).",
        "In these and other writings, various treatments for the phenomenon are suggested, but many of them do not properly capture the distinction between singular and non-singular interpretation of linguistic descriptions.",
        "With the exception of intensional concepts, other forms of non-singularity have not been given satisfactory formal representations that would account for their role in natural language discourse.",
        "Perhaps the most successful treatment of non-singular terms in language thus far has been presented by Montague (1974a-d) with his formalization of intension, which can be traced back to the Fregean notion of sense.",
        "Unfortunately, the concept of intension does not capture all aspects of non-singu",
        "larity, for example, bare plurals denoting kinds cannot be adequately represented in Montague's intensional logic (IL) without some superficial, and often unplausi-ble, extensions (Carlson 1977, 1982).",
        "In addition, the enormous complexity of any non-trivial system of possible worlds has proven to be disadvantageous for developing a computationally oriented application of Montague's theory (Strzalkowski and Cercone 1986).1 In this paper we do not attempt to improve on Mon-tague's grammar; in fact, our approach does, in part, rely on Montague's method of coupling the syntactic and semantic processing in order to assign to a sentence its meaning or at least a meaning-representing formula.",
        "Nonetheless, we also perceive the limitations of Mon-tague's method.",
        "It is not our intention here to build an alternative formal system for a fragment of English that would replace that of Montague's. Instead, we propose a computationally oriented approach to certain problems with which Montague dealt only marginally or not at all.",
        "However informal our presentation may be, we make some effort to put things into a clear, semiformal setting.",
        "As various aspects of out theory crystalize, we expect a more formal version to emerge.",
        "We introduce a fragment of a new and, we believe, computationally feasible theory of names and descriptions, which offers a uniform treatment for many types of non-singular concepts found in natural language discourse.",
        "Although we limit our presentation to nominal phrase constructions, the approach can be further extended to cover other types of phrases.",
        "We present the formal definition of non-singularity with respect to a particular discourse situation involving a discourse message; a number of individuals (parties); and their knowledge, beliefs, awareness, etc.",
        "We introduce a layered model of reality (the universe) as perceived by a discourse participant, and define relative singularity of objects in this universe as an abstraction class of the layer-membership relation.",
        "Subsequently, linguistic descriptions and names are classified as singular, measurably singular, or non-singular depending upon what they are assumed to denote in the universe.",
        "The relationship between objects referred to in discourse and classified into different layers (levels) of the universe model has a particular significance for resolution of certain types of cohesive links in text.",
        "We call these links remote references because they cross level boundaries.",
        "In order to adequately explain the phenomenon of a remote reference, we propose a fairly general theory of names and descriptions in discourse.",
        "Although the theory lacks a complete formal specification at this time, we introduce a number of notions, such as a superobject and a coordinate, that, we believe, will prove helpful in further formalization of various intuitions presented here.",
        "In its present form, our theory focuses entirely on the problems of non-singularity and remote references in discourse that are created by the use of definite descriptions, bare plurals, and proper names.",
        "We do not describe in detail how one could actually compute remote references in discourse, except for two general rules introduced in Section 6.",
        "These rules, and perhaps some others yet to be developed, create a natural expansion of the system for computing intersentential anaphoric references described in Strzalkowski and Cercone (1986).",
        "Except for a brief overview in Section 2, we do not discuss many related phenomena, such as non-remote (or single level) references, opaque readings, non-referential interpretations, use of personal pronouns, and the like.",
        "The more general theory of stratified meaning representation (Strzalkowski 1986) addresses all of these concerns, as well as the problems of discourse coherence, selecting proper cohesive links in discourse, and building a discourse model."

        "A first step toward automating the process of discourse understanding is to grasp the meaning contents of the discourse message, at least the literal meaning.",
        "A discourse normally consists of more than a single utterance, and although every utterance may be assumed to contribute something to the discourse meaning as a whole, this latter can only rarely be regarded as a simple sum of meanings of component utterances.",
        "Utterances, or sentences, making up a discourse are usually involved in complicated mutual dependencies, that often go beyond the text itself.",
        "A careful study of these extrasentential and intersentential dependencies in discourse is necessary before a more successful attempt to design an automated discourse understanding system can be undertaken.",
        "In Strzalkowski (1986) and Strzalkowski and Cercone (1986) we introduced a rigorous method for handling certain cases of extrasentential dependencies in discourse, within a general framework, which we call the Stratified Model.",
        "The Stratified Model comprises a collection of disambiguating transformations that are applied to a discourse fragment before it can be assigned a final representation.",
        "These transformations include morphological analysis, lexical disambiguation, syntactic parsing, computing extrasentential dependencies, and pragmatic evaluation in discourse context.",
        "In order to compute anaphoric, and other, dependencies between sentences in a discourse fragment, we first translate each sentence in the fragment into an intermediate, formal representation language.",
        "We call these translations literal or \"context-less\" because they are derived based solely on sentences' syntactic structure.",
        "In fact, this transformation is done Montague-style (Montague 1974d) except for the intermediate representation, which, in the Stratified Model, is a A-categorial language A, rather than an intensional logic.",
        "For this presentation it is enough to say that A is a typed predicate-calculus language with A-operator.",
        "A formal definition of A is given in Strzalkowski and Cercone (1986).",
        "Next, we",
        "proceed to compute various contextual dependencies of sentences, including extrasentential anaphoric links.",
        "Let L be a language of parse structures obtained in some grammar of a fragment of English.",
        "For the purpose of this presentation, L is identified with the set of phrase markers that can be generated from English sentences with a categorial grammar CAT similar to that of Montague (1974).",
        "Although some other syntactic system may be more suitable in practical application, we select CAT here for its relative simplicity and elegance.",
        "We concentrate on the translation of some example expressions, sentences, and paragraphs of L into a representation in a A-categorial language A that would capture both a sentence's logical form and its cohesive links to the surrounding discourse.",
        "In particular, we shall look closely at the cohesive links created by inter-sentential anaphoric references appearing in different contextual situations.",
        "A possesses adequate expressive power to represent the meaning of a considerable spectrum of linguistic constructs found in a natural language discourse.",
        "What is of a particular interest to us, A provides a natural and uniform means for computing and representing extrasentential dependencies.",
        "As we shall see in the next section, a meaning representation language so-defined is still inadequate for capturing some more difficult cases, which we call remote co-references.",
        "Our present effort is to describe a transformation ISD such that ISD C L x A, and whenever a source expression in L consists of more than one sentence, a class of intersentential dependencies within this fragment is identified and resolved, if possible.",
        "It must be noted here that ISD represents a semantic process that is entirely independent .",
        "of any pragmatic or domain related factors.",
        "As a result a substantial amount of domain oriented ambiguity may be left unresolved.",
        "In any practical application, this transformation must be accompanied by a pragmatic process, as described in Strzalkowski (1986).",
        "ISD consists of a collection of translation rules {R1, R2, .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "}, such that each rule is responsible for translating a specific type of dependency.",
        "Actually, only Rule 1 works directly on expressions of L, translating them into literal representations in A, independent of one another.",
        "Rules numbered 2 and up will take these literal translations and try to relate them pairwise looking, among other things, for unresolved anaphoric references.",
        "Most of these rules can be written in terms of two distinguished expressions of A, Si and S2, which we call the context-setting sentence and the current sentence, respectively.",
        "Expression S1 is a A-representation of the linguistic context in which the sentence with translation S2 is to be evaluated.",
        "Neither Si nor S2 must correspond to surface sentences, though.",
        "S1 may represent a larger part of discourse, perhaps an entire paragraph; on the other hand, S2 may constitute only a subclause of S1 in which case we would talk of intra-sentential dependency.",
        "It should be noted here that the potentially explosive number of possibilities will be in fact limited by the actual structure of the discourse under consideration (see, among others, Grosz and Sidner 1985), as well as by the pragmatic and domain related information, not discussed here.",
        "Let us now consider a two sentence paragraph given below: S1: John interviewed a candidate.",
        "S2: The guy had impressive references.",
        "In the most natural reading of this paragraph, the anaphor of \"the guy\" is resolved against \"a candidate\" in the first sentence, so that the second sentence actually means: \"the guy whom John interviewed had impressive references.\" When considered separately from one another, S1 and S2 obtain the following translations into A.",
        "In the translation of S2, C is a free predicate variable that needs to be bound by the sentence's context.",
        "The context variable is introduced into the translation of a definite noun phrase containing a definite article, such as \"the,\" by Rule 1 (Strzalkowski 1986, Strzalkowski and Cercone 1986).",
        "This rule generates literal translations of sentences without considering their context, and does so in PTQ-style, that is, by assigning to each syntactic operation in CAT a formula formatting operation in A (Montague 1974a).",
        "The next step is to resolve context references; we must find a binding for C occurring in S2 in the context provided by SI in order to obtain the final translation of the former.",
        "This intersentential dependency is captured by the translation Rule 2, which operates on the literal translations of both sentences delivered by Rule 1 (Strzalkowski and Cercone 1986).",
        "In the example above, the second sentence obtains the desired translation as shown below.",
        "If the context-setting sentence S1 has a referential interpretation in the form",
        "and the current sentence S2 contains an unresolved definite anaphor, that is,",
        "then this anaphor can be resolved against S1, and the resulting translation of S2 is obtained as",
        "A somewhat different problem arises when we consider a fragment with a possible non-referential interpretation, as in Computational Linguistics, Volume 15, Number 3, September 1989 173 Tomek Strzalkowski and Nick Cercone Non-Singular Concepts in Natural Language Discourse John wants to marry a princess.",
        "The girl must be rich and pretty.",
        "Now, Rule 2 can compute the anaphoric link between \"the girl\" and \"a princess\" only if both sentences receive their referential interpretations.",
        "In a case where both sentences are understood non-referentially, we have to use Rule 3, given below.",
        "No other combinations are possible.",
        "where imp is an imperfect operator, and the current sentence S2, also in a non-referential interpretation, contains a definite anaphor which occurs in scope of an imperfect operator imps i.e.,",
        "then this anaphor can be resolved against S1, with the resulting translation of S2 derived as",
        "Rule 3 encompasses a large class of non-referential contexts, which we call imperfect contexts, and which involve constructs including propositional attitudes (want, try, wish), intensional verbs (seek, conceive, think about), other complement-taking verbs (go, come), modal verbs (must, can, will), as well as progressive tense forms.",
        "In Rule 3, all this is reduced to the formula with the imp operator which translates compound phrases, such as \"John wants,\" or \"John will.\" Thus, in the example given above, Rule 3 is applicable when both sentences contain a wide scope imp operator.",
        "In this case, the second sentence of the fragment obtains the full translation with the following formula:",
        "Other studied cases of intersentential anaphora (see Strzalkowski 1986a-c, Strzalkowski and Cercone 1986) include non-referential interpretation of discourse fragments involving attitude report verbs (believe, know, disagree).",
        "These cannot be translated with Rule 3, and a new rule, Rule 4, is developed to compute anaphoric links in texts similar to the one given below.",
        "John believes that a unicorn lives in the park.",
        "He thinks the creature has a long horn.",
        "Rules 5, 6, and 7 account for the pronominal anaphora, Rule 10 deals with certain instances of attributive use of definite noun phrases.",
        "Rules 8 and 9 are used when the antecedent of an anaphor is a proper name rather than a description.",
        "This is the situation where an interesting type of referential ambiguity occurs whose resolution",
        "where ICI is the predicative use of name N. In the following fragment, Sylvester tries to catch a bird.",
        "The cat is clumsy.",
        "there are two possible ways of linking \"the cat\" with \"Sylvester.\" In one reading, not very different from those processed with Rule 2, the definite anaphor refers primarily to the entity that can be described as \"the one who tries to catch a bird,\" and only contingently to its name.",
        "In this case we acquire some new information about Sylvester, namely that it is a cat.",
        "In the other possible reading, the anaphor refers to the name only, and thus may draw on some context that is different from the first sentence in the fragment.",
        "This latter situation is handled by Rule 9.",
        "In the above fragment, Rule 9 would produce the following translation for \"the cat is clumsy\" (S is an individual constant denoting the individual named Sylvester, and Syl(x) means that x's name is Sylvester):",
        "There are more aspects of ISD transformation that merit attention.",
        "These include rules for dealing with other kinds of anaphora not discussed here, elliptical constructions, enumerably singular (plural) terms, intrasentential anaphora, and non-anaphoric dependencies, as well as indirect and forward reference cases where access to the speaker/hearer knowledge base may be required.",

        "The extent of such participation is not clear, but in general it can be observed that certain predications true of complexes of different kind are not preserved for their parts or elements, and vice versa.",
        "To represent this new kind of intersentential dependency we introduce a multilevel model for interpreting natural language expressions, such that the levels in the model would correspond (roughly) to the levels of reference in discourse.",

        "The individual alligator, which at some period of its life is owned by John is, therefore, singular in the same way John is, but this will not be the case when we consider the time slice of this alligator (an alligator stage, in Carlson's words) while it was owned by John.",
        "This latter appears only an instance of the individual alligator at some time interval.",
        "By the same token, if John owns many different alligators at different times (but, arguably, never more than one at a time) then we may risk to refer to John's alligator, an abstract object that generalizes over all alligator stages of all individual alligators ever owned by John (for example, \"John always walks his alligator in the morning\").",

        "To understand its influence on the form of the reference-making sentence, compare Example 7 with Example 8 below.",
        "Example 8 8a.",
        "The tiger lives in the jungle.",
        "8b.",
        "My pet is a tiger.",
        "Unlike (8b), in the \"story\" of the president the local context allows (and requires) us to use \"the\" in (7b) because there may be at most one instance of the general term at a given discourse situation (in this case, the President of the U.S.).",
        "This is not the case when more than one value of the coordinate T satisfied the selector condition.",
        "The use of a definite description in such a context suggests, therefore, that a single instance of a general term is being picked up by the selector.",
        "This means, in turn, that except for a main \"remote refer-ence\" in cross-level referencing, another local reference is being made at these levels where the definite description is used to denote some object.",
        "The remote reference itself does not need a definite description to be used for establishing a connection between an instance and the general term.",
        "The fact that we use a definite article when referring to an instance of a general concept, as in (7b), implies only that the local context SL contains (or is expected to contain) exactly one instance of the general object.",
        "Notice that the temporal aspect of this local context is extremely influential.9 When we decompose a general object with respect to a time coordinate, we are more likely to obtain a unique instantiation in a local context.",
        "However, when a coordinate does not contain a time element, as in (8a,b), we cannot, in general, exclude the possibility that instances other than the one we intend to refer to in subsequent statements may be present in a local context.",
        "Thus a definite description is not used until the local context is properly narrowed.",
        "In the case of (8a,b) above, for example, we may continue the discourse at the lower level, saying \"The animal is quite friendly,\" and meaning \"The animal which is my pet tiger is quite friendly.\" This discussion strongly supports our theory of names and descriptions, particularly the existence of levels and coordinates.",
        "Having established a higher-level object (or superobject), we can freely discuss its instances across various coordinates.",
        "The local references can be accounted for by singular translation rules, which we discuss in Strzalkowski and Cercone (1986).",

        "In some part of a discourse, a certain (general) object X is addressed; that is, there is some part, Si, of the discourse (presented as a single sentence in our examples, Computational Linguistics, Volume 15, Number 3, September 1989 181 Tomek Strzalkowski and Nick Cercone Non-Singular Concepts in Natural Language Discourse for simplicity), such that S, predicates something of X – that is S1(X), where X is a description that refers to X.",
        "In a subsequent part of the discourse, however, the discourse changes the level of reference and only some instance(s) of X with respect to some coordinate T is addressed; that is, there is some t E T such that S2((X t)), where S2 is this new part of the discourse.",
        "Apparently, the discourse internal cohesion would be compromised if we did not allow the higher level object X be a target of a remote reference by a description (X t) denoting one of its instances.",
        "In such a case we say that S1(X) creates a supercontext for (X t).",
        "We can further say that X and (X t) are remotely co-referential.",
        "By analogy, if S1 contains a reference to an instance of an object X, that is, we have 51((X t)) for some coordinate T where t E T, and S2 contains a reference to X, that is, S2(X), then 51((X t)) is a subcontext for X.",
        "In this case too, X and (X t) are remotely co-referential.",
        "We have just arrived at a very important property of a natural language discourse, which influences both coherence and cohesion, and is absolutely essential in proper representation of discourse meaning content.",
        "The following translation rule specifies how such a representation should be derived.10 The approach presented here is entirely original, although the problem of the \"general term/an instance\" connection has been known for a long time and other, less general, solutions have been suggested (see Partee 1972 and Montague 1974).",

        "One may wonder whether the use of the definite description in (9b) is always necessary to maintain the remote reference, since we rejected such a necessity in supercontexts.",

        "We presented an approach to representing various kinds of non-singular concepts in natural language clis-course.13 The major observation of our theory is that",
        "reality, as perceived by an intelligent individual, can be regarded as a partially ordered structure of levels such that each level contains only those objects that are considered relatively singular.",
        "Observe that there are virtually no restrictions imposed upon the notion of relative singularity, so that the distribution of objects between levels of the world model may differ among different individuals.",
        "Non-singular objects, called superobjects, are placed at a number of higher levels, which are related to the current level with various coordinates.",
        "Conversely, a singular object may be decomposed along a coordinate, and new objects, so obtained, will be placed at some lower level.",
        "This same coordinate can be used then to obtain instances of other objects at this lower level, so that the relative singularity of objects within each level is maintained.",
        "This theory also contributes to a better understanding of discourse internal cohesion by introducing the notion of remote reference in text.",
        "We believe that our approach promotes computational tractability of some more difficult properties of natural language discourse.",
        "Among these, the notion of intension as formalized by Montague (1974a-d) has long been considered difficult for a practical realization, and a more tractable alternative has been sought ever since.",
        "Our theory of names and descriptions takes us a step in this direction, although an implementation or a formal complexity evaluation have yet to be attempted.",
        "Observe that with the concept of superobject and coordinate, we no longer have to identify general terms like \"temperature,\" \"president,\" or \"water\" with intensions, that is, functions over possible worlds.",
        "Superobjects are not some mysterious, extra-world entities, but they acquire a concrete status which makes them as comprehensible as ordinary objects.",
        "In a simplified account, our notion of coordinate can be loosely related to the possible world theory's concept of index.",
        "The coordinate is, however, far more selective than the index.",
        "In a particular discourse situation, we can pick up that aspect of intensionality of some concept that is, at present, relevant to our understanding of the discourse.",
        "Our freedom in selecting that or another coordinate is all important.",
        "Note also that structures of coordinates may vary considerably.",
        "For example, a pure time coordinate may consist of time points as well as consists of time periods, and time periods are of much greater significance in practice (examine \"the president\" example).",
        "Coordinates connote more than indices.",
        "They can be used to define a non-singular status of an object which is otherwise purely extensional (the examples of \"water\" from the last section).",
        "In this sense, the concept of non-singularity has a local, and often subjective, character."
