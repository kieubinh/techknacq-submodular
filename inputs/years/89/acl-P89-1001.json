        "We propose a new model for transfer in machine translation of dialogues.",
        "The goal is twofold: to develop a linguistically-based theory for transfer, and to develop a computer formalism with which we can implement such a theory, and which can be integrated with a unification-based parser.",
        "The desired properties of the grammar are (1) to accept as input a feature structure, (2) to produce as output a feature structure, (3) to be reversible, (4) to be as close as possible to current theories and formalisms used for linguistic description.",
        "From (1) and (2), we need a rewriting formalism where a rule takes a feature structure as input and gives a feature structure as output.",
        "From (3), this formalism should be in the class of unification-based formalisms such as PROLOG, and there should be no distinction between input and output.",
        "From (4), as the theoretical basis of grammar development in ATR is IPSO [Pollard and Sag 1987], we want the formalism to be as close as possible to HPSG.",
        "To meet these requirements, a rewriting system for typed feature structures, based on the semantics of typed feature structures described in [Alt-Kaci 84], has been implemented at ATR by Martin Emele and the author [Emele and Zajac 89].",
        "The type system has a lattice structure, and inheritance is achieved through the rewriting mechanism.",
        "Type definitions are applied by the interpreter on the input structure (a typed feature structure) using typed unification in a non-deterministic and monotonic way, until no constraint can be applied.",
        "Thus, the result is a set of all possible transfer pairs.",
        "compatible with the input and with the constraints expressed by the grammar.",
        "Thanks to the properties of the rewriting formalism, the transfer grammar is reversible, and can even generate all possible pairs for We give an outline of the model on a very simple example.",
        "The type inheritance mechanism is mainly used to classify common properties of the bilingual lexicon (sect.",
        "1), and rewriting is fully exploited to describe the relation between a surface structure produced by a unification-based parser and the abstract structure used for transfer (sect.",
        "2), and to describe the relation between Japanese and English structures (sect.",
        "3).",

        "The type system is used to describe a hierarchy of concepts, where a sub-concept inherits all of the properties of its super-concepts.",
        "The use of type inheritance to describe the hierarchy of lexical types is advocated for example in [Pollard and Sag 1987, chap.8].",
        "We use a type hierarchy to describe properties which are common to bilingual classes of the bilingual lexicon.",
        "The level of description of the bilingual lexicon is the logico-semantic level: a verb for example has a relational role and links different objects through semantic relations (agent, recipient, space-location,...).",
        "Semantic relations in the bilingual lexicon are common to English and Japanese.",
        "Predicates can be classified according to the semantic relations they establish between objects.",
        "For example, predicates which have only an agent case are defined as Agent-Verbs, and verbs which also have a recipient role are defined as Agent-Recipient-Verbs, a subclass of Agent-Verbs.",
        "On the leaves of the hierarchy, we find the actual bilingual entries, which describe only idiosyncratic properties, and thus are very simple.",

        "This definition can be read: an Agent-Verb is-a Verb which has-properties agent for Japanese and English.",
        "We need to express how the arguments of a relation are translated.",
        "This is specified using a translate-ag slot with type symbol PROP, which will be used during the rewriting process (see details in sect.",
        "3 and 4).",
        "Symbols prefixed with # are tags, which are used to represent co-references (sharing) of structures.",
        "In this definition, we have a one-to-one mapping between the agent argument, and at this level of representation (semantic relations), this simple case arises frequently.",
        "However, we must also describe mappings between structures which do not have such simple correspondence, such as idiomatic expressions.",
        "In that case, we have to describe the relation between predicate-argument structures in a more complex way, as shown for example in sect.4.",
        "Actual bilingual entries are very simple thanks to the inheritance of types.",
        "The type system is interpreted using the rewriting mechanism described in [Ait-ICaci 84], which gives an operational semantics for type inheritance: a feature structure which has a type AG-V for example is unified with the definition of this type: [ japane.se : [agent : #j-ag] ,",
        "and the type symbol AG-17 is replaced with the super-type vERB in the result of the unification.",
        "If type VERB has a definition, the structure is further rewritten, thus achieving the operational interpretation of inheritance.",
        "Disjunctions like PROP create a non-deterministic choice for further rewriting: the symbol PROP is replaced with the disjunction of symbols of the right-hand-side creating alternative paths in the rewriting process.",
        "This process of rewriting is applied on every",
        "substructure of a structure to be evaluated, until no type symbol can be rewritten.",
        "As the rewriting system does not have any explicit control mechanism for rule application, whenever several rules are applicable all paths are explored, and all solutions are produced in a non deterministic way.",
        "This could be a drawback for a practical machine translation system, as only one translation should be produced in the end, and due to the non deterministic behavior of the system, this could also lead to severe efficiency problems.",
        "However, the system is primarily intended to be used as a tool for developing a linguistic model, and thus the production of all possible solutions is necessary in order to make a detailed study of ambiguities.",
        "Furthermore, according to the principles of second generation MT systems [Ynvge 57, Vauquois 75, Isabelle and Macklovitch 86], a transfer grammar should be purely contrastive, and should not include specific source or target language knowledge.",
        "As a result, the synthesis grammar should implement all necessary language specific constraints in order to rule out ungrammatical structures that could be produced after transfer, and make appropriate pragmatic decisions."

      "text": [
        "The rewriting formalism has been implemented in LISP by Martin Emele and the author at ATR in order to develop transfer and generation models of dialogues for a machine translation prototype [Emele and Zajac 89].",
        "The two main characteristics of the formalism are (1) type inheritance which provides a clean way of defining classes and subclasses of objects, (2) the rewriting mechanism based on typed unification of feature structures which provide a powerful and semantically clear means of specifying (and computing) relations between classPs of objects.",
        "This later behavior is somehow similar to the PROLOG mechanism, and grammars can be written to be reversible, which is the case for our transfer grammar.",
        "We hope this feature will be useful in the future development of the grammar, allowing for a precise constrastive analysis of Japanese and English.",
        "At present, the transfer grammar is in a very early stage of development but nevertheless, capable of translating a few elementary sentences.",
        "It covers basic sentence patterns; compound noun phrases and coordination of noun phrases; verb phrases including auxiliaries, modals and adverbs; sentence adverbials; conditionals.",
        "The transfer module and the generation module [Emele 891 use the same formalism and integration is thus simple to achieve.",
        "As for efficiency considerations, the transfer and generation of the sentence in Figure 2 takes approximately 5 seconds on a Symbolics with our current implementation.",
        "However, this figure is not very meaningful because our dictionaries and grammars are still very small, and the implementation of the interpreter itself is still evolving.",
        "Full integration with the analysis module (a unification-based parser which produces a set of feature structures) remains to be worked out, but should not cause major problems.",
        "In this respect, the closest related works are a transfer model proposed by [Isabelle and Macklovitch 86] and a model in the LFG framework proposed by [Kudo and Nomura 861 (see also [Beaven and Whitelock 88).",
        "There are two major topics for further research: 1) the extension of the formalism to include full logical expressions, as described for example in [SmoLka 88], and some kind of control mechanism in order to treat default values and prune some solutions (when an idiomatic expression is found for example); (2) the development of a transfer grammar for a larger language fragment, using outputs of the parser already available described in [Yoshirnoto and Kogure 1988]."
