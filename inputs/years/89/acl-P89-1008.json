        "Why should we think that whenever a conversationally relevant description is used an implicature always exists?",

        "Discourse consists of a sequence of utterances that are tied together in ways that make",
        "sense.",
        "Typically, there are reasons why a speaker says what he says in the order and manner that he says it, and in general a hearer must have a clue as to what these reasons are (this is why plan recognition is so important for plan-based theories of speech acts).",

        "As Allen, Cohen, Gross, Perrault, and Sidner have pointed out [Allen 1978; Perrault and Cohen 1978; Allen and Perrault 1978; Allen and Perrault 1980; Grosz and Sidner 1986; Sidner 1983; Sidner 19851, the recognition of what the speaker is 'up to' contributes to coherence and comprehensibility of the discourse and is essential for the hearer's generation of an appropriate response.",
        "Now, the unstated reasons whose recognition is required for discourse coherence are by definition implicated, since they must be inferred in order to preserve the assumption that the speaker is being cooperative.",
        "This is precisely what an implicature is.",
        "Moreover, turning to conversationally relevant descriptions, we should observe that by their very nature, they cannot be merely functionally relevant.",
        "That is, the assumption that they are intended merely as tools for identification is not enough to make the discourse coherent.",
        "This, after all, is precisely what distinguishes functionally relevant descriptions from the conversationally relevant ones.",
        "Hence, additional assumptions are required in order to make sense of the way the speaker uses the latter descriptions.",

        "The content of implicatures that accompany such descriptions depends on circumstances, but they all share a rather specific form.",

        "Such a derivation is an essential part of an explanation of why (9) is true.",
        "It also contributes to the coherence of our experience: what science provides us with, among other things, is the reassuring knowledge that natural phenomena do not just happen to occur, but follow a general scheme that provides the basis for both explanation and prediction.",
        "Thus, our confidence in the truth of (9) is not merely the result of examining a large sample of basketballs.",
        "We also have a theory that explains why they do not just happen to come down whenever dropped, but, in a sense, must do so.",

        "generalisation such as \"All A's are F' would rely on the fact that all, or most, or a good sample of the things with the property A have been examined and were found to have property F. In such a case there would not be any attempt to explain why this is so, only a claim that as things stand, all A's do, in fact, have the property F. An intensional justification of a universal generalization, on the other hand, would attempt to show that anything with the property of being A must have the property of being F, because of a more general principle or theory from which the generalization can be derived.",
        "The distinction I have just described is obviously not restricted to science, nor am I interested in elucidating different scientific methods of corroboration.",

        "Nor do they exhaust the types of justification one can use.",
        "Thus, the justification of the most fundamental principles of any theory (scientific or otherwise), although clearly not extensional, would not be intensional either, since",
        "by definition they are not derivable from any other principles (they would still support counterfactuals, though).",
        "However, apart from such fundamental axioms, the justification of any universal generalization, if it is not extensional, must be intensional Now back to the universality condition that the speaker asserts when he uses a conversationally relevant description.",
        "As mentioned already, the hearer may not know why the speaker believes the generalization, but from the hearer's point of view it stands to reason that the speaker's justification is intensional, because of the uniqueness condition.",
        "If the uniqueness condition is presupposed, an extensional justification of the universal generalisation amounts to no more than this: there is evidence that the referent happens to have the property F. But if this were all that the speaker had in mind, it would be very misleading to give the impression that a universal generalization was meant.",
        "To see why, consider a case in which an author tells you that all his books are published by Cambridge University Press.",
        "If later you are to find out that he has published only one book, you would surely be puzzled, although as things are, his statement was technically true.",
        "In other words, if the uniqueness condition is presupposed, it makes little sense to assert a universal generalization, unless the speaker believes that the generalisation must be true whether the uniqueness condition is true or not.",
        "Thus, if the speaker has intensional justification for what he says, the uniqueness condition no longer interferes with universality.",

        "The 46-year-old Chicago clergyman has not said whether he wants the second spot on the Democratic ticket... (New York Times, June 28, 1988) Since the name 'Jackson' is already available as the best functionally relevant referring expression, it should be obvious to the reader that the description 'the 46-yew-old Chicago clergyman' is conversationally relevant.",
        "But if the reader were to go through the steps outlined above, he would reach a dead end.",
        "There is nothing in view of which it must be the case that any 46 year old Chicago clergyman has not said whether he wants the second spot on the democratic ticket.",
        "Thus, the implicature that usually accompanies a conversationally relevant description is ruled out.",
        "Nor is there an obvious implicit description that is used to convey a similar implicature.",
        "The reader is then forced to search for other explanations, and one obvious possibility is that the author wants to inform the reader (or remind him) that Jackson is a 46 year old clergyman from Chicago."

        "Hence, indefinite descriptions can obviously serve as referring expressions, and the distinction between functional and conversational relevance should apply to them as well.",
        "Usually, a use of an indefinite description as a referring expression signals to the hearer that the identity of the referent is not important (e.g., 'A policeman gave me a speeding ticket\").",
        "Some uses of indefinite descriptions, however, are clearly made with the intention that the hearer identify whom the speaker has in mind.",
        "For example, 23 A person I know did not take out the garbage as he had promised...",

        "Since I heard it from a doctor, I'm inclined to believe it [Dahl 1984].",
        "Clearly, an accurate interpretation of °a doctor' would connect the referent with Dr. Smith.",
        "At the same time, the use of the indefinite description highlights a property of Smith which is conversationally relevant.",
        "Note that the indefinite description is used to implicate a universal generalisation, namely, that in view of what doctors know, any doctor who gives you an advice, should (other things being equal) be listened to.",
        "This is very similar in structure to the implicature that is typically associated with conversationally relevant definite descriptions.",
