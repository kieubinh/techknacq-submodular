        "The proposed statistical description has a large number of potentially important applications, including: (a) constraining the language model both for speech recognition and optical character recognition (OCR), (b) providing disambiguation cues for parsing highly ambiguous syntactic structures such as noun compounds, conjunctions, and prepositional phrases, (c) retrieving texts from large databases (e.g., newspapers, patents), (d) enhancing the productivity of computational linguists in compiling lexicons of lexico-syntactic facts, and (e) enhancing the productivity of lexicographers in identifying normal and conventional usage.",
        "Consider the optical character recognizer (OCR) application.",
        "Suppose that we have an OCR device such as [Kahan, Pavlidis, Baird (1987)], and it has assigned about equal probability to having recognized \"farm\" and \"form,\" where the context is either: (1) \"federal credit\" or (2) \"some of.\" The proposed association measure can make use of the fact that \"farm\" is much more likely in the first context and \"form\" is much more likely in the second to resolve the ambiguity.",
        "Note that alternative disambiguation methods based on syntactic constraints such as part of speech are unlikely to help in this case since both \"form\" and \"farm\" are commonly used as nouns.",

        "experiments in which subjects either (a) classified successive strings of letters as words and nonwords, or (b) pronounced the strings.",
        "Both types of response to words (e.g., BUTTER) were consistently faster when preceded by associated words (e.g., BREAD) rather than unassociated words (e.g. NURSE).\" (Meyer, Schvaneveldt and Ruddy (1975), p. 98) Much of this psycholinguistic research is based on empirical estimates of word association norms such as [Palermo and Jenkins (1964)], perhaps the most influential study of its kind, though extremely small and somewhat dated.",
        "This study measured 200 words by asking a few thousand subjects to write down a word after each of the 200 words to be measured.",
        "Results are reported in tabular form, indicating which words were written down, and by how many subjects, factored by grade level and sex.",
        "The word \"doctor,\" for example, is reported on pp.",
        "98-100, to be most often associated with \"nurse,\" followed by \"sick,\" \"health,\" \"medicine,\" \"hospital,\" \"man,\" \"sickness,\" \"lawyer,\" and about 70 more words.",
        "We propose an alternative measure, the association ratio, for measuring word association norms, based on the information theoretic concept of mutual information.",
        "The proposed measure is more objective and less costly than the subjective method employed in (Palermo and Jenkins (1964)].",
        "The association ratio can be scaled up to provide robust estimates of word association norms for a large portion of the language.",
        "Using the association ratio measure, the five most associated words are (in order): \"dentists,\" \"nurses,\" \"treating,\" \"treat,\" and \"hospitals.\" What is \"mutual information\"?",
        "According to [Fano (1961), p. 28], if two points (words), x and y, have probabilities P(x) and P(y), then their mutual information, 1(x ,y), is defined to be",
        "Informally, mutual information compares the probability of observing x and y together (the joint probability) with the probabilities of observing x and y independently (chance).",
        "If there is a genuine association between x and y, then the joint probability P(x,y) will be much larger than chance P(x) P(y), and consequently 1(x,y) >> 0.",
        "If there is no interesting relationship between x and y, then P(x,y) P(x) PO), and thus, 1(x,y)2-- 0.",
        "If x and y are in complementary distribution, then P(x,y) will be much less than P(x) P(Y), forcing 1(x,y) << 0.",
        "In our application, word probabilities, P(x) and P(y), are estimated by counting the number of observations of x and y in a corpus, f(x) and f(y), and normalizing by N, the size of the corpus.",
        "(Our examples use a number of different corpora with different sizes: 15 million words for the 1987 AP corpus, 36 million words for the 1988 AP corpus, and 8.6 million tokens for the tagged corpus.)",
        "Joint probabilities, P(x,y), are estimated by counting the number of times that x is followed by y in a window of w words, f(x,y), and normalizing by N. The window size parameter allows us to look at different scales.",
        "Smaller window sizes will identify fixed expressions (idioms) and other relations that hold over short ranges; larger window sizes will highlight semantic concepts and other relationships that hold over larger scales.",
        "For the remainder of this paper, the window size, w, will be set to 5 words as a compromise; this setting is large enough to show some of the constraints between verbs and arguments, but not so large that it would wash out constraints that make use of strict adjacency.1 Since the association ratio becomes unstable when the counts are very small, we will not discuss word pairs with f(x ,y) s 5.",
        "An improvement would make use of t-scores, and throw out pairs that were not significant.",
        "Unfortunately, this requires an estimate of the variance of f(x,y), which goes beyond the scope of this paper.",
        "For the remainder of this paper, we will adopt the simple but arbitrary threshold, and ignore pairs with small counts.",
        "Technically, the association ratio is different from mutual information in two respects.",
        "First, joint probabilities are supposed to be symmetric: P(x,y)= P(y,x), and thus, mutual information is also symmetric: /(x,y) = 1(y ,x).",
        "However, the association ratio is not symmetric, since f(x,y) encodes linear precedence.",
        "(Recall that f(x,y) denotes the number of times that word x appears before y in the window of w words, not the number of times the two words appear in either order.)",
        "Although we could fix this problem by redefining f(x,y) to be symmetric (by averaging the matrix with its transpose), we have decided not to do so, since order information appears to be very interesting.",
        "Notice the asymmetry in the pairs below (computed from 36 million words of 1988 AP text), illustrating a wide variety of biases ranging",
        "from sexism to syntax.",
        "Some Uninteresting Associations with \"Doctor\" Asymmetry in 1988 AP Corpus (N = 36 million) f(x,Y) f(y, x) doctors nurses 81 10 man woman 209 42 doctors lawyers 25 16 bread butter 14 0 save life 106 8 save money 155 8 save from 144 16 supposed to 982 21 Secondly, one might expect f(x,y)-f(x) and f(x ,Y) f(Y), but the way we have been counting, this needn't be the case if x and y happen to appear several times in the window.",
        "For example, given the sentence, \"Library workers were prohibited from saving books from this heap of ruins,\" which appeared in an AP story on April 1, 1988, f(prohibited) = 1 and f(prohibited, front) = 2.",
        "This problem can be fixed by dividing f(x,y) by w – 1 (which has the consequence of subtracting log2(W – I) 2 from our association ratio scores).",
        "This adjustment has the additional benefit of assuring that f(x,y) = f(x) = f(y) = N. When 1(x ,y) is large, the association ratio produces very credible results not unlike those reported in [Palermo and Jenkins (1964)], as illustrated in the table below.",
        "In contrast, when 1(x,y)=-' 0, the pairs less interesting.",
        "(As a very rough rule of thumb, we have observed that pairs with 1(x,y)> 3 tend to be interesting, and pairs with smaller 1(x,y) are generally not.",
        "One can make this statement precise by calibrating the measure with subjective measures.",
        "Alternatively, one could make estimates of the variance and then make statements about confidence levels, e.g., with 95% confidence, P(x,y) > P(x) P(y).)",

        "If 1(x ,y) << 0, we would predict that x and y are in complementary distribution.",
        "However, we are rarely able to observe 1(x,y)<<0 because our corpora are too small (and our measurement techniques are too crude).",
        "Suppose, for example, that both x and y appear about 10 times per million words of text.",
        "Then, P(x) P(y) 10-5 and - chance is P(x)P(x) 10i0.",
        "Thus, to say that /(x,y) is much less than 0, we need to say that P(x,y) is much less than 10-1°, a statement that is hard to make with much confidence given the size of presently available corpora.",
        "In fact, we cannot (easily) observe a probability less than 1/N 10-7, and therefore, it is hard to know if I(x,y) is much less than chance or not, unless chance is very large.",
        "(In fact, the pair (a, doctors) above, appears significantly less often than chance.",
        "But to justify this statement, we need to compensate for the window size (which shifts the score downward by 2.0, e.g. from 0.96 down to – 1.04) and we need to estimate the standard deviation, using a method such as [Good (1953)].)",
        "Although the psycholinguistic literature documents the significance of noun/noun word associations such as doctor/nurse in considerable detail, relatively little is said about associations among verbs, function words, adjectives, and other non-nouns.",
        "In addition to identifying semantic relations of the doctor/nurse variety, we believe the association ratio can also be used to search for interesting lexico-syntactic relationships between verbs and typical arguments/adjuncts.",
        "The proposed association ratio can be viewed as a formalization of Sinclair's argument: \"How common are the phrasal verbs with set?",
        "Set is particularly rich in making combinations with words like about.",
        "in.",
        "up, out.",
        "on, off, and these words are themselves very common.",
        "How likely is set off to occur?",
        "Both are frequent words; (set occurs approximately 250 times in a million words and) off occurs approximately 556 times in a million words... [The question we are asking can be roughly rephrased as follows: how likely is off to occur immediately after set?",
        "...",
        "This is 0.00025 x0.00055 [P(s) P(y)], which gives us the tiny figure of 0.0000001375 ...",
        "The assumption behind this calculation is that the words are distributed at random in a text [at chance, in our terminology).",
        "It is obvious to a linguist that this is not so, and a rough measure of how much set and off attract each other is to compare the probability with what actually",
        "happens... Set off occurs nearly 70 times in the 7.3 million word corpus [P(x,y).0701(7.3 106) >> P(x) P(y)].",
        "That is enough to show its main patterning and it suggests that in currently-held corpora there will be found sufficient evidence for the descliption of a substantial collection of phrases... [Sinclair (1987)e. pp.",
        "151-152] It happens that set ... off was found 177 times in the 1987 AP Corpus of approximately 15 million words, about the same number of occurrences per million as Sinclair found in his (mainly British) corpus.",
        "Quantitatively, 1( set ,o ff ) = 5.9982, indicating that the probability of set ... off is almost 64 times greater than chance.",
        "This association is relatively strong; the other particles that Sinclair mentions have association ratios of: about (1.4), in (2.9), up (6.9), out (4.5), on (3.3)in the 1987 AP Corpus.",
        "As Sinclair suggests, the approach is well suited for identifying phrasal verbs.",
        "However, phrasal verbs involving the preposition to raise an interesting problem because of the possible confusion with the infinitive marker to.",
        "We have found that if we first tag every word in the corpus with a part of speech using a method such as [Church (1988)], and then measure associations between tagged words, we can identify interesting contrasts between verbs associated with a following preposition to/in and verbs associated with a following infinitive marker to/to.",
        "(Part of speech notation is borrowed from [Francis and Kucera (1982)]; in = preposition; to = infinitive marker; vb = bare verb; vbg = verb + ing; vbd = verb + ed; vbz = verb + s; vbn = verb + en.)",
        "The association ratio identifies quite a number of verbs associated in an interesting way with to; restricting our attention to pairs with a score of 3.0 or more, there are 768 verbs associated with the preposition to/in and 551 verbs with the infinitive marker to/to.",
        "The ten verbs found to be most associated before to/in are:",
        "• to/in: alluding/vbg, adhere/vb, amounted/vbn, relating/vbg , amounting/vbg, revert/vb, reverted/vbn, resorting/vbg, relegatecUvbn • to/to: obligateci/vbn, trying/vbg, compelled/vbn, enables/vbz, supposed/vbn, intends/vbz, vowing/vbg, tried/vbd, enabling/vbg, tends/vbz, tend/vb, intend/vb, tries/vbz",
        "Thus, we see there is considerable leverage to be gained by preprocessing the corpus and manipulating the inventory of tokens.",
        "For measuring syntactic constraints, it may be useful to include some part of speech information and to exclude much of the internal structure of noun phrases.",
        "For other purposes, it may be helpful to tag items and/or phrases with semantic labels such as *person*, *place*, *time*, *body-part*, *bad*, etc.",
        "Hindle (personal communication) has found it helpful to preprocess the input with the Fidditch parser [Hindle (1983a,b)] in order to identify associations between verbs and arguments, and postulate semantic classes for nouns on this basis."

        "Despite the fact that a concordance is indexed by a single word, often lexicographers actually use a second word such as \"from\" or an equally common semantic concept such as a time adverbial to decide how to categorize concordance lines.",
        "In other words, they use two words to triangulate in on a word sense.",
        "This triangulation approach clusters concordance lines together into word senses based primarily on usage (distributional evidence), as opposed to intuitive notions of meaning.",
        "Thus, the question of what is a word sense can be addressed with syntactic methods (symbol pushing), and need not address semantics (interpretation), even though the inventory of tags may appear to have semantic values.",
        "The triangulation approach requires \"art.\" How does the lexicographer decide which potential cut points are \"interesting\" and which are merely due to chance?",
        "The proposed association ratio score provides a practical and objective measure which is often a fairly good approximation to the \"art.\" Since the proposed measure is objective, it can be applied in a systematic way over a large body of material, steadily improving consistency and productivity.",
        "But on the other hand, the objective score can be misleading.",
        "The score takes only distributional evidence into account.",
        "For example, the measure favors \"set ... for\" over \"set ... down\"; it doesn't know that the former is less interesting because its semantics are compositional.",
        "In addition, the measure is extremely superficial; it cannot cluster words into appropriate syntactic classes without an explicit preprocess such as Church's parts program 'or Hindle's parser.",
        "Neither of these preprocesses, though, can help highlight the \"natural\" similarity between nouns such as \"picture\" and \"photograph.\" Although one might imagine a preprocess that would help in this particular case, there will probably always be a class of generalizations that are obvious to an intelligent lexicographer, but lie hopelessly beyond the objectivity of a computer.",
        "Despite these problems, the association ratio could be an important tool to aid the lexicographer, rather like an index to the concordances.",
        "It can help us decide what to look for; it provides a quick summary of what company our words do keep."
