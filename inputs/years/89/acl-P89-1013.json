        "We argue for the usefulness of an active chart as the basis of a system that searches for the globally most plausible explanation of failure to syntactically parse a given input.",
        "We suggest semantics-free, grammar-independent techniques for parsing inputs displaying simple kinds of ill-formedness and discuss the search issues involved.",
        "THE PROBLEM Although the ultimate solution to the problem of processing ill-formed input must take into account semantic and pragmatic factors, nevertheless it is important to understand the limits of recovery strategies that are based entirely on syntax and which are independent of any particular grammar.",
        "The aim of this work is therefore to explore purely syntactic and grammar-independent techniques to enable a parser to recover from simple kinds of ill-formedness in textual inputs.",
        "Accordingly, we present a generalised parsing strategy based on an active chart which is capable of diagnosing simple errors (unknown/misspelled words, omitted words, extra noise words) in sentences (from languages described by context free phrase structure grammars without e-productions).",
        "This strategy has the advantage that the recovery process can run after a standard (active chart) parser has terminated unsuccessfully, without causing existing work to be repeated or the original parser to be slowed down in any way, and that, unlike previous systems, it allows the full syntactic context to be exploited in the determination of a \"best\" parse for an ill-formed sentence."

        "Weischedel and Sondheimer (1983) present an approach to processing ill-formed input based on a modified AIN parser.",
        "The basic idea is, when an initial parse fails, to select the incomplete parsing path that consumes the longest initial portion of the input, apply a special rule to allow the blocked parse to continue, and then to iterate this process until a successful parse is generated.",
        "The result is a \"hillclimbing\" search for the \"best\" parse, relying at each point on the \"longest path\" heuristic.",
        "Unfortunately, sometimes this heuristic will yield several possible parses, for instance with the sentence: The snow blocks T te road (no partial parse getting past the point shown) where the parser can fail expecting either a verb or a determiner.",
        "Moreover, sometimes the heuristic will cause the most \"obvious\" error to be missed: He said that the snow the road T The paper will T the best news is the Times where we might suspect that there is a missing verb and a misspelled \"with\" respectively.",
        "In all these cases, the \"longest path\" heuristic fails to indicate unambiguously the minimal change that would be necessary to make the whole input acceptable as a sentence.",
        "This is not surprising, as the left-right bias of an AIN parser allows the system to take no account of the right context of a possible problem element.",
        "Weischedel and Sondheimer's use of the \"longest path\" heuristic is similar to the use of locally least-cost error recovery in Anderson and Backhouse's (1981) scheme for compilers.",
        "It seems to be generally accepted that any form of globally \"minimum-distance\" error correction will be too costly to implement (Aho and Ullman, 1977).",
        "Such work has, however, not considered heuristic approaches, such as the one we are developing.",
        "Another feature of Weischedel and Sondheimer's system is the use of grammar-specific recovery rules (\"meta-rules\" in their terminology).",
        "The same is true of many other systems for dealing with ill-formed input (e.g. Carbonell and Hayes (1983), Jensen et al.",
        "(1983)).",
        "Although grammar-specific recovery rules are likely in the end always to be more powerful than grammar-independent rules, it does seem to be worth investigating how far one can get with rules that only depend on the grammar formalism used.",
        "ir the T gardener T collects T manure T if T the T autumn 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 <Need S from 0 to 7> <Need NP+VP from 0 to 7> <Need VP from 2 to 7> <Need VP+PP from 2 to 7> <Need PP from 4 to 7> <Need P+NP from 4 to 7> <Need P from 4 to 5> (hypothesis) (by top-down rule) (by fundamental rule with NP found bottom-up) (by top-down rule) (by fundamental rule with VP found bottom-up) (by top-down rule) (by fundamental rule with NP found bottom-up)",
        "In adapting an AIN parser to compare partial parses, Weischedel and Sondheimer have already introduced machinery to represent several alternative partial parses simultaneously.",
        "From this, it is a relatively small step to introduce a well-formed substring table, or even an active chart, which allows for a global assessment of the state of the parser.",
        "If the grammar formalism is also changed to a declarative formalism (e.g. CF-PSGs, DCGs (Pereira and Warren 1980), Patr-II (Shieber 1984)), then there is a possibility of constructing other partial parses that do not start at the beginning of the input.",
        "In this way, right context can play a role in the determination of the \"best\" parse WHAT A CHART PARSER LEAVES BEHIND The information that an active chart parser leaves behind for consideration by a \"post mortem\" obviously depends on the parsing strategy used (Kay 1980, Gazdar and Mellish 1989).",
        "Active edges are particularly important from the point of view of diagnosing errors, as an unsatisfied active edge suggests a place where an input error may have occurred.",
        "So we might expect to combine violated expectations with found constituents to hypothesise complete parses.",
        "For simplicity, we assume here that the grammar is a simple CF-PSG, although there are obvious generalisations.",
        "(Left-right) top-down parsing is guaranteed to create active edges for each kind of phrase that could continue a partial parse starting at the beginning of the input On the other hand, bottom-up parsing (by which we mean left corner parsing without top-down filtering) is guaranteed to find all complete constituents of every possible parse.",
        "In addition, whenever a non-empty initial segment of a rule RHS has been found, the parser will create active edges for the kind of phrase predicted to occur after this segment.",
        "Top-down parsing will always create an edge for a phrase that is needed for a parse, and so it will always indicate by the presence of an unsatisfied active edge the first error point, if there is one.",
        "If a subsequent error is present, top-down parsing will not always create an active edge corresponding to it, because the second may occur within a constituent that will not be predicted until the first error is corrected.",
        "Similarly, right-to-left top-down parsing will always indicate the last error point, and a combination of the two will find the first and last, but not necessarily any error points in between.",
        "On the other hand, bottom-up parsing will only create an active edge for each error point that comes immediately after a sequence of phrases corresponding to an initial segment of the RHS of a grammar rule.",
        "Moreover, it will not necessarily refine its predictions to the most detailed level (e.g. having found an NP, it may predict the existence of a following VP, but not the existence of types of phrases that can start a VP).",
        "Weischedel and Sondheimer's approach can be seen as an incremental top-down parsing, where at each stage the rightmost unsatisfied active edge is artificially allowed to be satisfied in some way.",
        "As we have seen, there is no guarantee that this sort of hill-climbing will find the \"best\" solution for multiple errors, or even for single errors.",
        "How can we combine bottom-up and top-down parsing for a more effective solution?",
        "FOCUSING ON AN ERROR Our basic strategy is to run a bottom-up parser over the input and then, if this fails to find a complete parse, to run a modified top-down parser over the resulting chart to hypothesise possible complete parses.",
        "The modified top-down parser attempts to find the minimal errors that, when taken account of, enable a complete parse to be constructed.",
        "Imagine that a bottom-up parser has already run over the input \"the gardener collects manure if the autumn\".",
        "Then Figure 1 shows (informally) how a top-down parser might focus on a possible error.",
        "To implement this kind of reasoning, we need a top-down parsing rule that knows how to refine a set of global needs and a",
        "fundamental rule that is able to incorporate found constituents from either direction.",
        "When we may encounter multiple errors, however, we need to express multiple needs (e.g. <Need N from 3 to 4 and PP from 8 to 10>).",
        "We also need to have a fundamental rule that can absorb found phrases from anywhere in a relevant portion of the chart (e.g. given a rule \"NP â€“ > Det Adj N\" and a sequence \"as marvellous sihgt\", we need to be able to hypothesise that \"as\" should be a Det and \"sihgt\" a N).",
        "To save repeating work, we need a version of the top-down rule that stops when it reaches an appropriate category that has already been found bottom-up.",
        "Finally, we need to handle both \"anchored\" and \"unanchored\" needs.",
        "In an anchored need (e.g. <Need NP from 0 to 4>) we know the beginning and end of the portion of the chart within which the search is to take place.",
        "In looking for a NP VP sequence in \"the happy blageon smupled the bait\", however, we can't initially find a complete (initial) NP or (final) VP and hence don't know where in the chart these phrases meet.",
        "We express this by <Need NP from 0 to *, VP from * to 6>, the symbol \"*\" denoting a position in the chart that remains to be determined."

        "If we adopt a chart parsing strategy with only edges that carry information about global needs, there will be considerable duplicated effort.",
        "For instance, the further refinement of the two edges: <Need NP from 0 to 3 and V from 9 to 10> <Need NP from 0 to 3 and Adj from 10 to 11> can lead to any analysis of possible NPs between 0 and 3 being done twice.",
        "Restricting the possible format of edges in this way would be similar to allowing the \"functional composition rule\" (Steedman 1987) in standard chart parsing, and in general this is not done for efficiency reasons.",
        "Instead, we need to produce a single edge that is \"in charge\" of the computation looking for NPs between 0 and 3.",
        "When possible NPs are then found, these then need to be combined with the original edges by an appropriate form of the fundamental rule.",
        "We are thus led to the following form for a generalised edge in our chart parser: <C from S to E needs CSI nom si to el, c32 from s2 to e2, cs from sa to ea> where C is a category, the csi are lists of categories (which we will show inside square brackets), S. E, the si and the ei are positions in the chart (or the special symbol \"*\").",
        "The presence of an edge of this kind in the chart indicates that the parser is attempting to find a phrase of category C covering the portion of the chart from S to E, but that in order to succeed it must still satisfy all the needs listed.",
        "Each need specifies a sequence of categories csi that must be found contiguously to occupy the portion of the chart extending from si to e. Now that the format of the edges is defined, we can be precise about the parsing rules used.",
        "Our modified chart parsing rules are shown in Figure 2.",
        "The modified top-down rule allows us to refine a need into a more precise one, using a rule of the grammar (the extra conditions on the rule prevent further refinement where a phrase of a given category has already been found within the precise part of the chart being considered).",
        "The modified fundamental rule allows a need to be satisfied by an edge that is completely satisfied (i.e. an inactive edge, in the standard terminology).",
        "A new rule, the simplification rule, is now required to do the relevant housekeeping when one of an edge's needs has been completely satisfied.",
        "One way that these rules could run would be as follows.",
        "The chart starts off with the inactive edges left by bottom-up parsing, together with a single \"seed\" edge for the top-down phase <GOAL from 0 to n needs (S] from 0 to n>, where n is the final position in the chart.",
        "At any point the fundamental rule is run as much as possible.",
        "When we can proceed no further, the first need is refined by the top-down rule (hopefully search now being anchored).",
        "The fundamental rule may well again apply, taking account of smaller phrases that have already been found.",
        "When this has run, the top-down rule may then further refine the system's expectations about the parts of the phrase that cannot be found.",
        "And so on.",
        "This is just the kind of \"focusing\" that we discussed in the last section..",
        "If an edge expresses needs in several separate places, the first will eventually get resolved, the simplification rule will then apply and the rest of the needs will then be worked on.",
        "For this all to make sense, we must assume that all hypothesised needs can eventually be resolved (otherwise the rules do not suffice for more than one error to be narrowed down).",
        "We can ensure this by introducing special rules for recognising the most primitive kinds of errors.",
        "The results of these rules must obviously be scored in some way, so that errors are not wildly hypothesised in all sorts of places."

        "In general, an attempt to find an instance of a given category in a given portion of the chart must produce a penalty score if the bottom-up parsing phase has not yielded an inactive edge of the correct kind within that portion.",
        "Finally, the fact that the grammar is assumed to have no e-productions means that an attempt to find a long sequence of categories in a short piece of chart is doomed to produce a penalty score; similarly a sequence of lexical categories cannot be found without penalty in a portion of chart that is too long.",
        "Some of the above scoring parameters score an edge according what sorts of parses it could contribute to, not just according to how internally plausible it seems.",
        "This is desirable, as we wish the construction of globally most plausible solutions to drive the parsing.",
        "On the other hand, it introduces a number of problems for chart organisation.",
        "As the same edge (apart from its score) may be generated in different ways, we may end up with multiple possible scores for it.",
        "It would make sense at each point to consider the best of the possible scores associated with an edge to be the current score.",
        "In this way we would not have to repeat work for every differently scored version of an edge.",

        "It was important to have an implementation-independent measure of the amount of work done by the parser, and for this we used the concept of a \"cycle\" of the chart parser.",

        "quickly because the presence of an unknown word allows the estimation of penalty scores to be quite accurate (the system still has to work out whether the word can be an addition and for what categories it can substitute for an instance of, however).",
        "We have not yet considered multiple errors in a sentence, and we can expect the behaviour to worsten dramatically as the number of errors increases.",

        "It is noticeable that errors towards the end of a sentence are harder to diagnose than those at the start.",
