        "One of the most serious obstacles to developing parsers to effectively analyze unrestricted English is the difficulty of creating sufficiently comprehensive grammars.",
        "While it is possible to develop toy grammars for particular theoretically interesting problems, the sheer variety of forms in English together with the complexity of interaction that arises in a typical syntactic analyzer makes each enhancement of parser coverage increasingly difficult.",
        "There is no question that we are still quite far from syntactic analyzers that even begin to adequately model the grammatical variety of English.",
        "To go beyond the current generation of hand built grammars for syntactic analysis it will be necessary to develop means of acquiring some of the needed grammatical information from the regularities that appear in large corpora of naturally occurring text.",
        "This paper describes an implemented training procedure for automatically acquiring symbolic rules for a deterministic parser on the basis of unrestricted textual input.",
        "In particular, I describe experiments in automatically acquiring a set of rules for disambiguation of lexical category (part of speech).",
        "Performance of the acquired rule set is much better than the set of rules for lexical disambiguation written for the parser by hand over a period of several rules; the error rate is approximately half that of the hand written rules.",
        "Furthermore, the error rate is comparable to recent probabilistic approaches such as Church (1987) and Garside, Leech and Sampson (1987).",
        "The current approach has the added advantage that, since the rules acquired depend on the parser's grammar in general, independent improvements in other modules of the parser can lead to improvement in the performance of the disambiguation component."

      "text": [
        "Ambiguity of part of speech is a pervasive characteristic of English; more than a third of the word tokens in the million-word \"Brown Corpus\" of written English (Francis and Kucera 1982) are categorially ambiguous.",
        "It is possible to construct sentences in which every word is ambiguous, such as the following,",
        "(1) Her hand had come to rest on that very book.",
        "But even without such contrived exaggeration, ambiguity of lexical category is not a trivial problem.",
        "Nor can part of speech ambiguity be ignored in constructing models of natural language processing, since syntactic analysis (as well as higher levels of analysis) depends on correctly disambiguating the lexical category of both content words and function words like to and that.",
        "It may seem that disambiguating lexical category should depend on complex reasoning about a variety of factors known to influence ambiguity in general, including semantic and pragmatic factors.",
        "No doubt some aspects of disambiguating lexical category can be expressed in terms of such higher level decisions.",
        "But if disambiguation in fact depends on such higher level reasoning, there is little hope of succeeding in disambiguation on unrestricted text.",
        "Fortunately, there is reason to believe that lexical disambiguation can proceed on more limited syntactic patterns.",
        "Indeed, recent increased interest in the problem of disambiguating lexical category in English has led to significant progress in developing effective programs for assigning lexical category in unrestricted text.",
        "The most successful and comprehensive of these are based on probabilistic modeling of category sequence and word category (Church 1987; Garside, Leech and Sampson 1987; DeRose 1988).",
        "These stochastic methods show impressive performance.",
        "Church reports a success rate of 95 to 99%, and shows a sample text with an error rate of less than one percent.",
        "What may seem particularly surprising is that these methods succeed essentially without reference to syntactic structure; purely surface lexical patterns are involved.",
        "In contrast to these recent stochastic methods, earlier methods based on categorical rules for surface patterns achieved only moderate success.",
        "Thus for example, Klein and Simmons (1963) and Greene and Rubin (1971) report success rates considerably below recent stochastic approaches.",
        "It is tempting to conclude from this contrast that robust handling of unrestricted text demands general probabilistic methods in preference to deeper linguistic knowledge.",
        "The Lancaster (UCREL) group explicitly takes this position, suggesting: \"... if we analyse quantitatively a sufficiently large amount of language data, we will be able to compensate for the computer's lack of sophisticated knowledge and powers of inference, at least to a considerable extent.\" (Garside, Leech and Sampson 1987:3).",
        "In this paper, I want to emphasize a somewhat different view of the role of large text corpora in building robust models of natural language.",
        "In particular, I will show that that large corpora of naturally occurring text can be used together with the rule-based syntactic analyzers we have today to build more effective linguistic analyzers.",
        "As the information derived from text is incorporated into our models, it will help increase the sophistication of our linguistic models.",
        "I suggest that in order to move from our current impoverished natural language processing systems to more comprehensive and robust linguistic models we must ask Can we acquire the linguistic information needed on the basis of text?",
        "If we can answer this question affirmatively – and this paper presents evidence that we can – then there is hope that we can make some progress in constructing more adequate natural language processing systems.",
        "It is important to emphasize that the question whether we can acquire linguistic information from text is independent of whether the model is probabilistic, categorical, or some combination of the two.",
        "The issue is not, I believe, symbolic versus probabilistic rules, but rather whether we can acquire the necessary linguistic information instead of building systems completely by hand.",
        "No algorithm, symbolic or otherwise, will succeed in large scale processing of natural text unless it can acquire some of the needed knowledge from samples of naturally occurring text."

        "The key features of this niodel of parsing relevant to acquisition are: • because the parser is deterministic and has a limited window of attention, failure (and therefore the need for a new rule) can be localized.",
        "• because the rules of the parser correspond closely to the instantaneous description of the state of the parser, it is easy to determine the form of the new rule.",

        "A second source of failure of the acquired disambiguation rules is that the acquisition algorithm is not paying enough attention to the information the parser provides.",
        "The large difference in accuracy between the training set and the test set suggests that the acquired set of disambiguation rules are matching idiosyncratic properties of the training set rather than general extensible properties; the rules are too powerful.",
        "It seems that the rules that refer to all three items in the buffer are the culprit.",
        "For example, the acquired rule (5) [N][PREP-1-TNS] = TNS = v applies to such cases as (6) Shall we flip a coin to see which of us goes first?",
        "In effect, this rule duplicates the action of another rule (7) [PREP±TNS] = TNS [N-0/1 = v In short, the rule set does not have appropriate shift invariance.",
        "The problem with disambiguation rule (5) is that it refers to three items that are not in fact syntactically related: in sentence (6), there is no structural relation between the noun coin and the infinitive phrase to see.",
        "It would be appropriate to only acquire rules that refer to constituents that occur in construction with each other, since the predictability of part of speech from local context arises because of structural relations among words; there should be no predictability across words that are not structurally related.",
        "We should therefore be able to improve the set of disambiguation rules by restricting new rules to only those involving elements that are in the same structure.",
        "We use the grammar as implemented in the parser to decide what elements are related and thus to restrict the set of rules acquired.",
        "Specifically, the following restriction on the acquisition of new rules is proposed.",
        "All the buffer elements referred to by a disambiguation rule must appear together in some other single rule.",
        "This rules out examples like rule (5) because no single parser grammar rule ever refers to the noun, the to and the following verb at the same time.",
        "However, a rule like (7) is accepted because the parser grammar rule for infinitives does refer to to and the following verb at the same time.",
        "For training, an additional escape for rules was added: if the first element of the buffer is ambiguous a rule may use the second element to disambiguate it whether or not there is any parser rule that refers to the two together.",
        "In these cases, if no new rule were added, the default disambiguation rules, which are notably ineffective, would match.",
        "(The default rules have a success rate of only 55% compared to over 94% for the disambiguation rules that depend on context.)",
        "Since the parser is not sufficiently complete to recognize all cases where words are related, this escape admits some local",
        "context even in the absence of parser internal reasons to do so.",
        "The training procedure was applied with this new constraint on rules, parsing the training set five times to acquire a new rule set.",
        "Restricting the rules to related elements had three notable effects.",
        "First, the number of disambiguation rules acquired was cut to nearly one third the number for the unrestricted rule set (about 12000 rules).",
        "Second, the difference between the training set and the test set is reduced; the error rate differs by only one percent.",
        "Finally, the performance of the restricted rule set is if anything slightly better than the unrestricted set (3427 errors for the restricted rules versus 3492 errors for the larger rule set).",
        "These results show the power of using the grammatical information encoded in the parser to direct the attention of the disambiguation rules."

        "I have described a training algorithm that uses an existing deterministic parser together with a corpus of tagged text to acquiring rules for disambiguating lexical category.",
        "Performance of the trained set of rules is much better than the previous handwritten rule set (error rate reduced by half).",
        "The success of the disambiguation procedure depends on the linguistic knowledge embodied in the parser in a number of ways.",
        "• It uses the data structures and linguistic categories of the parser, focusing the rule acquisition mechanism on relevant elements.",
        "• It is embedded in the parsing process so that parser actions can set things up for acquisition (for example, adverbs are in effect removed within elements of the auxiliary, restoring the contiguity of auxiliary elements).",
        "• It uses the grammar rules to identify words that are grammatically related, and are therefore relevant to disambiguation.",
        "• It can use rough models of complementation and modification to help identify words that are related.",
        "• Finally, the parser always provides a default",

        "This permits the incremental improvement of the parser, since it can take advantage of more specific information when it is available, but it will always disambiguate somehow, no matter whether it has acquired the appropriate rules or not.",
        "This work demonstrates the feasibility of acquiring the linguistic information needed to analyze unrestricted text from text itself.",
        "Further improvements in syntactic analyzers will depend on such automatic acquisition of grammatical and lexical facts."
