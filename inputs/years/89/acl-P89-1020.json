        "This approach has the advantage of utilizing the system's existing machinery to process comparative structures which are very complex and diverse; in this way a minimal amount of effort results in extensive coverage.",

        "A relative-clause type of comparative structure such as Sentence 5a.",
        "would be analyzed as a relative clause than we invited 0 adjoined to more guests.",
        "Those constructions that are unique to the comparative, as shown in Sentences 8 through 11, have to be uniquely defined.",
        "For example, the comparative clause in Sentence 8 is defined as a clause where the predicate is omitted, whereas the comparative clause in Sentence 9 is defined as a measure phrase.",
        "Although the comparative syntactically resembles other structures, this type of similarity does not carry over to the underlying structure or to the semantics of the comparative, as will be discussed shortly.",
        "There are also some syntactic differences between the comparative and the structures it resembles.",

        "For example, the underlying form for a relative-clause-like comparative, such as Sentence 5a.",
        "is: N1 [N1 guests visited us] > N2 [we invited N2 guests] The underlying form for a sentence such as a man taller than John visited us is slightly different because the comparative structure itself is embedded in a noun phrase.",

        "• Regularization procedures can be written to transform all comparative structures into one standard form consisting of a comparative operator and two complete clauses which specify the quantities being compared.",
        "• In the standard form, each clause of the",
        "comparative operator is a simpler structure which can be processed using basically the usual procedures of the system.",
        "This means that further processing does not have to be modified for the comparative.",
        "This process can be illustrated by a simple example.",
        "When the sentence more guests than we invited visited us is regularized, a structure consisting of an operator connecting two complete clauses is obtained: (> (visited (er guests) (us)) (invited (we) (than guests))) The symbols er and than, shown above, roughly correspond to quantities being compared, and in subsequent processing they are each interpreted as denoting a certain type of quantity.",
        "Notice that each clause of the comparative is also in operator-operand form where generally the verb of a sentence is considered the operator and the subject and object (and sometimes sentence adjunct phrases) are considered the operands3.",
        "Each of the two clauses can be processed in the usual manner provided that er and than are treated appropriately.",
        "This will be described further in Section 5 which contains a discussion of semantics and the comparative.",
        "The regularization process was modified to be a two phase process.",
        "The first phase uses ordinary compositional translation rules to perform the standard regularization so that the surface analysis is transformed into a uniform operator-operand form.",
        "The compositional regularization procedure is effective for fairly basic sentence structures but not for complex ones such as the comparative.",
        "The compositional rules associated with comparative structures only include labels categorizing the type of comparative structure.",
        "The second phase, written specifically for the comparative, completes the regularization process by filling in the missing elements, permuting the structures to obtain the correct operator-operand form, and supplying the appropriate quantifiers er and than to the items being comparativized.",
        "An example of this process is shown for the relative-clause type of comparative in more guests than we invited visited us, where the comparative clause than We invited is analyzed syntactically as being a right adjunct modifier of guests.",
        "3However, if the predicate is an adjectival phrase, the adjective is considered the operator and the verb be the tense carrier.",
        "Thus, ignoring tense information, the regularized form of John is tall is: (tall (John)).",
        "There are a few key points that should be made concerning the regularization procedures.",
        "The Montague-style translation rules could not readily be used to regularize the comparative constructions as they were defined in the context-free component.",
        "To use the rules, the grammar would have to be modified substantially because the translation of the comparative is different and more complex than that of the structures it resembles.",
        "In particular, it would then not be possible to use the general conjunction mechanism to obtain coverage of that type of comparative structure.",
        "In the case of the usual relative clause, the regularized form is also substantially different from the regularized form of the relative-clause type of comparative shown above.",
        "For a typical relative clause, such as that we invited ()in guests that we invited visited us, the regularized form occurs as a clause embedded in the main clause as follows: (visited (guests (invited (we) 0)) (us)) The second important point is that because of regularization further processing of sentences containing a comparative is significantly simplified and only minor changes are required specifically for the comparative.",
        "In Proteus QAS, as well as other NLP Systems, several other processing components are needed after syntactic regularization until the final result is obtained.",
        "Therefore a significant result of our approach is that subsequent components do not have to be modified for the comparative.",
        "As long as the underlying system can handle adjectives, degree expressions, quantifiers, and adverbs, the remainder of the processing of sentences with the comparative is basically no different than the processing of ordinary sentences because at that point the comparative is represented as being composed of fundamental linguistic entities."

        "The remainder of the processing is done as usual except for minor modifications.",
        "The treatment of the comparative that we have presented is more extensive and general than that of other NLP Systems to date, and also is simple to implement.",
        "Only a small number of productions of the BNF component were changed to cover the comparative structures described in this paper.",
        "In addition, three restrictions were modified for the comparative, and a set of separate add-on restrictions were included to handle comparative zeroing patterns and scope marker requirements.",
        "Special regularization procedures were written to regularize the different comparative forms so that the standard Montague-style compositional translation rules could be used prior to the comparative regularization phase.",
        "Although we can process many forms of the comparative, there is still substantial work that remains which involves comparative sentences where the comparative clause itself has been omitted, as in New York banks are starting to offer higher interest rates.",
        "In some cases the comparison is between two different time periods; in other cases the comparison involves different types of like objects, such as the interest rates of New York banks compared to the interest rates of Florida banks.",
        "The context can often be an aid in helping to recover the missing information, but the recovery problem is still quite a challenge.",
        "Sentences with this type of anaphora are very interesting because they occur surprisingly regularly in language, and yet the recovery possibilities are more limited and more controlled than those occurring in discourse in general.",
        "Possibly these type of sentences can provide us with clues as to what elements are significant for the recovery of the missing information."
