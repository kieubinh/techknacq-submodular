        "Comparative expressions (CEs) such as \"bigger than\" and \"more oranges than\" are highly ambiguous, and their meaning is context dependent.",

        "To resolve these ambiguities our natural language interface interacts with the user, finding out which of the possible interpretations was intended.",

      "text": [
        "Although there has been considerable work on the development of natural language database interfaces, many difficult language interpretation problems remain.",
        "One of these is the semantic interpretation of comparative expressions such as those shown in sentences (1) through (3).",
        "(1) Does ACME construct better buildings than ACE?",
        "(2) Does ACME construct buildings faster than ACE?",
        "(3) Are more oranges than apples exported by Mexico?",
        "To interpret a comparative expression (CE) a natural language processor must determine (1) the entities to be compared, and (2) the attribute(s) of those entities to consider in performing the comparison.",
        "The selection of comparison attributes is made difficult by the high level of lexical ambiguity exhibited by comparative predicates.",
        "For example, what pieces of data should be compared to answer query (1)?",
        "If the database contains information about foundation type, structural characteristics, wiring, and insulation, any of these attributes could be used.",
        "Similarly, when comparing orange and apple exports as in query (3), we might compare numeric quantity, weight, volume, or monetary value.",
        "To further complicate matters, the plausible comparison attributes for a comparative predicate change with the arguments to which that predicate is applied.",
        "Table 1 shows several examples of likely comparison attributes to use with the predicate \"bigger\" depending on the types of entity that are being compared.",
        "Since the system must determine for a comparative predicate the lexical definition intended by the user, this problem is, at heart, one of lexical ambiguity resolution.",
        "The problems discussed so far are similar to the well known vagueness and context sensitivity of adjectives (although they occur here even in sentences without adjectives such as (3)).",
        "Any proposed method of CE interpretation should also treat several other phenomena that are unique to comparatives.",
        "These are bipredicational comparisons, cross-class comparisons, and pairability constraints.",
        "Bipredicational comparisons involve two predicates, as shown in example (4) (the",
        "predicates are in boldface), and they use a different comparison attribute for each argument of the comparative.",
        "(4) John's car is wider than Mary's car is long.",
        "Bipredicational CEs have strong pairability constraints (Hale 1970).",
        "That is, there are restrictions on the pairing of predicates in a bipredicational CE.",
        "Example (5) gives a sentence that is semantically anomalous because it violates pairability constraints.",
        "(5) ?",
        "Bob's car is wider than it is heavy.",
        "A cross-class comparison involves arguments of radically different types as shown in (6)."

        "The attribute describing the length of a party is not comparable to any of the attributes describing the length of a car.",
        "When faced with ambiguous input a natural language interface has two options.",
        "In the first one, it guesses at what the user wants and provides the answer corresponding to that guess.",
        "In the second, it interacts with the user to obtain a more completely specified query.",
        "Although Option 1 is easier to implement, it is also inflexible and can lead to miscommunication between the user and the interface.",
        "With Option 2, the system lets the user select the desired interpretation, re-suiting in greater flexibility and less chance of misunderstanding.",
        "It is the second option that we are exploring.",
        "To carry out Option 2 for CE interpretation the system must present to the user a list of the permissible comparison attribute pairs for the given CE.",
        "In Section 3 we will see how pairability constraints can be used to delimit these pairs.",
        "Comparatives add significant expressive power to an interface (Ballard 1988), and it is therefore important that reliable techniques be developed to resolve the lexical ambiguities that occur in CEs."

        "semantics for adjectival comparatives based on primitive grading relations that order the domain with respect to gradable adjectives.",

        "It contains analogs of our Codomain Agreement Principle, mappings and base orders.",
        "The main difference is that whereas Cresswell always uses degrees, we also allow base orders to be defined directly on the domain entities.",
        "Most of the work done on lexical ambiguity resolution (e.g. (Hirst 1984) and (Wilks 1975)) has focussed on homonymy (when words have a small number of unrelated meanings) rather than polysemy (when words have many closely related meanings) as occurs with CEs.",
        "The techniques developed for homonymy depend on large semantic differences between meanings and thus are not as useful for CEs.",

        "The subject mapping is a mapping from the domain of the denotation of the subject of the CE to the domain of the base order (e.g. the mapping from a rectangle to its length).",

        "We call this the Codomain Agreement Principle, and it is through this principle that pairability constraints are enforced.",
        "For example, when interpreting the CE in sentence (5), we must find a subject mapping for the width of Bob's car and an object mapping for its weight, and these mappings must have the same codomain.",
        "However, this is impossible since all width mappings will have LENGTH as a codomain, and all weight mappings will have WEIGHT as a codomain.",
        "The Codomain Agreement Principle also helps explain the interpretation of sentences (6) and (7).",
        "Before concluding this section we consider the semantic description of CEs in TEAM ((Grosz, Haas, Hendrix, Hobbs, Martin, Moore, Robinson, and Ftosenschein 1982) and (Martin, Appelt, and Pereira 1983)), comparing it to ours.",
        "Since comparative expressions were not the main focus in these papers, we must piece together TEAM's treatment of CEs from the examples that are given.",

        "This implies that TEAM requires the same mapping to be used for both the subject and object of the comparative.",
        "That would not work well for bipredicational CEs, and could also lead to problems for cross-class comparisons.",
        "In (Martin, Appelt, and Pereira 1983) the examples contain predicates (e.g. salary-of and earn) which, on the surface, are similar to mappings.",

        "This works well as long as either (a) the system almost always selects the mapping intended by the user, or (b) the cost of an incorrect choice (i.e. the wasted query time) is small.",
        "If the system frequently makes a poor choice and wastes a lot of time, this approach could be quite annoying to a user.",
        "Crucial to the success of this automatic approach is the ability to reliably predict the resources required to perform a query so that the risk of guessing can be weighed against the benefits.",
        "A similar issue was pointed out by an anonymous reviewer.",
        "We noted in Section 1 that for sentence (3) (repeated here as (8)) (8) Are more oranges than apples exported by Mexico?",
        "the comparison could be based on quantity, weight, volume, or value.",
        "If the answer is the same regardless of the basis for comparison, a \"friendly\" system would realize this and not require the user to choose comparison attributes.",
        "Unfortunately, this realization is based on extensional rather than intentional equivalence, and hence, the system must perform all four (in this case) queries and compare the answers.",
        "The extra cost could be prohibitive.",
        "Again, the system must predict query performance resource requirements to know whether this approach is worthwhile for a particular query.",
        "See (Olawsky 1989) for more information on further work.",
        "To summarize, we have examined a number of issues associated with the semantic interpretation of comparative expressions and have developed techniques for representing the semantics of CEs and for interacting with the user to resolve comparison attribute ambiguities.",
        "These techniques will work for adjectival, adverbial, and adnominal comparatives and for both numerically and non-numerically based comparisons (see (Olawsky 1989) for more on this).",
        "We are presently completing the implementation of our approach in Common Lisp using the SunViewl° window system as a medium for user interaction.",
        "Most previous techniques for handling lexical ambiguity work best with homonymy since they depend on large semantic differences between the possible interpretations of a lexical item.",
        "Our approach, on the other hand, does not depend solely on these semantic differences and handles polysemy well."
