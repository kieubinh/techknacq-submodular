        "word meaning is learned directly by observation of the surrounding non-linguistic context.",
        "While this hypothesis ultimately only begs the question, it also runs into immediate substantive difficulties here, since there is usually looking going on at the same time as seeing and vice versa.",
        "But how can one learn that these verbs differ in that look is an active verb and see is stative?",
        "This difference, although difficult to observe in the environment, is clearly marked in the different syntactic frames the two verbs are found in.",
        "For example, see, being a stative perception verb, can take a sentence complement:",
        "(1) John saw that Mary was reading.",
        "while look cannot: (2)* John looked that Mary was reading.",

        "As this example shows, there are clear semantic differences between verbs that are reflected in the syntax, but not obvious by observation alone.",
        "The fact that children are able to correctly learn the meanings of look and see, as well as hundreds of other verbs, with minimal exposure suggests that there is some correlation between syntax and semantics that facilitates the learning of word meaning.",

        "In this paper, we will present a computational model of verb acquisition which uses what we will call the principle of structured overcommitment to eliminate the need for such negative evidence.",
        "In essence, our learner learns by initially jumping to the strongest conclusions it can, simply assuming that everything within its descriptive system that it hasn't seen will never occur, and then later weakening its hypotheses when faced with contradictory evidence.",
        "Thus, the learner escapes from the need to be told that certain possibilities cannot occur (i.e. are\"ungrammaticar) by the simple expedient of assuming that all properties it has observed are either always obligatory or always forbidden.",
        "If and when the learner discovers that it was wrong about such a strong assumption, it reclassifies the property from either obligatory or forbidden to merely optional.",
        "Note that this learning principal requires that no intermediate analysis is ever abandoned; analyses are only further refined by the weakening of universals (X ALWAYS has property P) to existen-tials (X SOMETIMES has property P).",
        "It is in this sense that the overcommitment iestructured.\" For such a learning strategy to work, it must be the case that the set of features which underlies the learning process are surface observable; the learner must be able to determine of a particular instance of (in this case) a verb structure whether some property is true or false of it.",
        "This would seem to imply, as far as we can tell, a commitment to the notion of em learning as selection widely presupposed in the linguistic study of generative grammar (as surveyed, for example, in Berwick(1985).",
        "Thus, we propose that the problem of learning the category of a verb does not require that a natural language understanding system synthesize em de novo a new structure to represent its semantic class, but rather that it determine to which of a predefined, presumably innate set of verb categories a given verb belongs.",
        "In what follows below, we argue that a relevant classification of verb categories can be represented by simple conjunctions of a finite number of predefined quasi-independent features with no need for disjunction or complex boolean combinations of features.",
        "Given such a feature set, the Principal of Structured Overcommitment defines a partial ordering (or, if one prefers, a tangled hierarchy) of verbs as follows: At the highest level of the hierarchy is a set of verb classes where all the primary four features, where defined, are either obligatory or forbidden.",
        "Under each of these\"primary\" categories there are those categories which differ from it only in that some category which is obligatory or forbidden in the higher class is optional in the lower class.",
        "Note that both obligatory and forbidden categories at one level lead to the same optional category at the next level down.",
        "The learning system, upon encountering a verb for the first time, will necessarily classify that verb into one of the ten top-level categories.",
        "This is because the learner assumes, for example, that if a verb is used with an object upon first encounter.",
        "that it always has an object; if it has no object, that it never has an object, etc.",
        "The learner will leave each verb classification unchanged upon encountering new verb instances until a usage occurs that falsifies at least one of the current feature values.",
        "When encountering such a usage i.e. a verb frame in which a property that is marked obligatory is missing, or a property that is marked forbidden is present (there are no other possibilities) - then the learner reclassifies the verb by moving down the hierarchy at least one level replacing the OBLIGATORY or FORBIDDEN value of that feature with OPTIONAL.",
        "Note that, for each verb, the learner's classification moves monotonically lower on this hierarchy, until it eventually remains unchanged because the learner has arrived at the correct value.",

        "This may be seen as begging the question of verb acquisition, because, it may be asked, how could an intelligent learner know what entities function as agent, patient, etc.",
        "without understanding the meaning of the verb?",
        "Our model in fact presupposes that a learner can distinguish between such general categories as animate, inanimate, instrument, and locative from direct observation of the environment, without explicit support from verb meaning; i.e. that it will be clear from observation em who is acting on em what em where.",
        "This assumption is not unreasonable; there is strong experimental evidence that children do in fact perceive even something as subtle as the difference between animate and inanimate motion well before the two word stage (see Golinkoff et al., 1984).",
        "This notion that agent, patient and the like can be derived from direct observation (perhaps focussed by what NPs",
        "appear in the sentence) is a weak form of what is sometimes called the em semantic bootstrapping hypothesis (Pinker(1984)).",
        "The theory that we present here is actually a combination of this weak form of semantic bootstrapping with what is called em syntactic bootstrapping, the notion that syntactic frames alone offer enough information to classify verbs (see Naigles, Gleitman, and Gleitman (in press) and Fisher, Gleitman and Gleitman(1988).)",
        "With this preliminary out of the way, let's turn to a simple example.",
        "Suppose the learner encounters the verb \"break\", never seen before, in the context (6) The window broke.",
        "The learner sees that the referent of \"the window\" is inanimate, and thus is the theme.",
        "Given this and the syntactic frame of (6), the learner can see that em break (a) does not take an object, in this case, (b) does not take an agent, and (c) takes a patient.",
        "By Structured Overcommitment, the learner therefore assumes that em break em never takes an object, em never takes a subject, and em always takes a patient.",
        "Thus, it classifies em break as {OBJ: â€“ , AGT: â€“ , THEME:+, TAO: â€“ } (if TAO is undefined, it is assigned \" â€“ \").",
        "It also assumes that em break is {DAT: â€“ , LOC: â€“ , INST: â€“ , } for similar reasons.",
