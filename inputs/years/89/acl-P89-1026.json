        "Full natural language systems must recognize speakers' intentions in an utterance.",
        "They must know when the speaker is asserting, asking, or making a social or official gesture [Searle 69, Searle 75], in addition to its content.",
        "For instance, the ordinary sentence",
        "(1) Can you open the door?",
        "might in context be a question, a request, or even an offer.",
        "Several kinds of information complicate the recognition process.",
        "Literal meaning, lexical and syntactic choices, agents' beliefs, the immediate situation, and general knowledge about human behavior all clarify what the ordinary speaker is after.",
        "Given an utterance and context, we model how the utterance changes the hearer's state.",
        "Previous work falls roughly into three approaches, each with characteristic weaknesses: the idiom approach, the plan based approach, and the descriptive approach.",
        "The idiom approach is motivated by pat phrases like:",
        "(2) a: Can you please X?",
        "b: Would you kindly X?",
        "c: I'd like X. d: May I X?",
        "e: How about X?",
        "They are literally questions or statements, but often used as requests or in (e), suggestions.",
        "The system could look for these particular strings, and build the corresponding speech act using the complement as a parameter value.",
        "But such sentences are not true idioms, because the literal meaning is also possible in many contexts.",
        "Also, one can respond to the literal and nonliteral acts: \"Sure, it's the 9th.\" The idiom approaches are too inflexible to choose the literal reading or to accommodate ambiguity.",
        "They lack a theory connecting the nonliteral and literal readings.",
        "Another problem is that some classic examples are not even pat phrases:",
        "(3) a: It's cold in here.",
        "b: Do you have a watch on?",
        "In context, (a) may be a request to close the window.",
        "Sentence (b) may be asking what time it is or requesting to borrow the watch.",
        "The idiom approach allows neither for context nor the reasoning connecting utterance and desired action.",
        "The plan based approach [Allen 83, McCafferty 86, Perrault 80, Sidner 81] presumes a mechanism modelling human problem solving abilities, including reasoning about other agents and inferring their intentions.",
        "The system has a model of the current situation and the ability to choose a course of action.",
        "It can relate uttered propositions to the current situation: being cold in here is a bad state, and so you probably want me to do something about it; the obvious solution is for me to close the window, so, I understand, you mean for me to close the window.",
        "The plan based approach provides a tidy, independently motivated theory for speech act interpretation.",
        "It does not use language-specific information, however.",
        "Consider",
        "(4) a: Can you speak Spanish?",
        "b: Can you speak Spanish, please?",
        "Here the addition of a word alters an utterance which is a yes/no question in typical circumstances to a request.",
        "This is not peculiar to \"please\":",
        "(5) a: Can you open the door?",
        "b: Are you able to open the door?",
        "Here two sentences, generally considered to have the same semantics, differ in force: the first may be a question, an offer, or a request, the second, only a question.",
        "Further, different languages realize speech acts in different ways: greetings, for example (or see [Horn 84]).",
        "(6) a: You want to cook dinner.",
        "b: You wanna toss your coats in there?",
        "The declarative sentence (a) can be a request, idiomatic to Hebrew, while the nearest American expression is interrogative (b).",
        "Neither is a request in British English.",
        "The plan based approach has nothing to say about these differences.",
        "Neither does it explain the psycholinguistic [Gibbs 84] finding that people access idiomatic interpretations in context more quickly than literal ones.",
        "Psycholinguistically plausible models cannot derive idiomatic meanings from literal meanings.",
        "Descriptive approaches cover large amounts of data.",
        "[Brown 80] recognized the diversity of speech act phenomena and included the first computational model with wide coverage, but lacked theoretical claims and did not handle the language-specific cases well.",
        "[Gordon 75] expresses some very nice",
        "generalizations, but lacks motivation and sufficient detail.",
        "It does not account for examples like numbers 3, 4, 6 or 7.",
        "In number 3, for example, one asks a question by asking literally whether the hearer knows the answer.",
        "A plan-based approach would argue that knowing the answer is a precondition for stating it, and this logical connection enables identification of the real question.",
        "But Gordon and Lakoff write off this one, because their sincerity conditions are inadequate.",
        "We augment the plan-based approach with a linguistic component: compositional rules associating linguistic features with partial speech act descriptions.",
        "The rules express linguistic conventions that are often motivated by planning theory, but they also allow for an element of arbitrariness in just which forms are idiomatic to a language, and just which words and features mark it.",
        "For this reason, conventions of use cannot be handled directly by the plan reasoning mechanism.",
        "They require an interpretation process paralleling syntactic and semantic interpretation, with the same provisions for merging of partial interpretations and postponement of ambiguity resolution.",
        "The compositionality of partial speech act interpretations and use of ambiguity are both original to our approach.",
        "Once the utterances have been interpreted by our conventional rules to produce a set of candidate conventional interpretations, these interpretations are filtered by the plan reasoner.",
        "Plan reasoning processes unconventional forms in the same spirit as earlier plan-based models, finding non-conventional interpretations and motivating many conventional ones.",
        "We propose a limited version of plan reasoning, based on an original claim about conversational implicature, which is adequate for filtering conventional interpretations.",
