        "Stated differently, the adjoining sequence at the root is independent of other nodes in the tree in spite of the coindexing.",
        "This is due to the fact that as the feature structure of the foot of /31 gets instantiated on adjoining, this value is simply substituted (and not unified) for the value of the comp feature of the root node.",
        "Thus, the comp feature is being used just as any other feature that can be used to give tree addresses (except that comp indicates dominance at the functional level rather than at the tree structure level).",
        "In [10], we have formalized this notion by introducing graph adjoining grammars which generate exactly the same languages as TAGs.",
        "In a graph adjoining grammar, this represented as shown in Figure 4.",
        "Notice that in this representation the comp feature is like the features 1-and 2 (which indicate the left and right daughters of a node) and therefore not used explicitly."
