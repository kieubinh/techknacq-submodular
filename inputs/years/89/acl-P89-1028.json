        "There is a trend in unification-based grammar formalisms towards using a single grammar structure to contain the phonological, syntactic and semantic information associated with a linguistic expression.",
        "Adopting'the terminology used by Pollard and Sag (1987), this grammar structure is called a sign.",
        "Grammar rules, guided by the syntactic information contained in signs, are used to derive signs associated with complex expressions from those of their constituent expressions.",
        "The relationship between the signs and the complex signs derived from grammar rule application can be expressed in derivational structures.",
        "These structures both explicitly illustrate relations that are implicit in the syntax of the signs and express relations that are present in the grammar rules.",
        "Tree unification grammar (TUG) is a formalism which uses function-argument (FA) specifications as its primary grammar structures.",
        "These specifications resemble partially specified derivational structures of sign-based formalisms like head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG) (Pollard and Sag, 1987) and unification categorial grammar (UCG) (Zeevat, Klein and Calder, 1987).",
        "TUG uses FA specifications as lexical entries and possesses a single grammar rule which combines these specifications to obtain a specification for the complex expression being analysed.",
        "The use of FA specifications allows generalisations that are often captured in grammar rules to be captured in the lexicon."

        "The development of TUG was a consequence of investigating •xtensions to the UCG framework.",

        "Calder (1987), UCG is a grammar formalism which combines somc of t!..9, notions of categorial grammar with those of unification-based formalisms like I-MSG and PATR-II (Shieber et.al., 1983).",
        "The rematch reported in this pager was carried ma at the University of Edinburgh under the support of • British Cammonwealth Scholarship and at Simon Fraser University under an Advance Systems institute Research Fellowship.",
        "Spacial thanks to the Centre for Systems SC71031:0 and the Laboratory for Ccenputer and Conammications Research at Simon Fraser University for additional support.",
        "I would like to thank Dan Faso and the ACL reviewers fort their comments and siggertiens.",
        "Like HPSG, the fundamental construction used in UCG is the sign.",
        "A UCG sign has attributes for phonology, category, semantics and order.",
        "Consider the sign for the expression Mary walks shown in (1).",
        "(1) Mary-walks",
        "sent(fin) fe 1 I llflImary(fl), [el] walk(e 1 ,11 )1 – The phonology attribute of this sign (ie.",
        "Mary-walks) represents a phonological specification of the linguistic expression associated with the sign.",
        "For our needs we will use a simple sequence of words separated by hyphens.",
        "The category structure of a sign is very similar to that used by categorial grammar.",
        "There are three primitive categories, namely sent, np, and noun.",
        "Complex categories are of the form A I B, where B is a sign and A is a category (either primitive or complex).",
        "The semantic representation uses a language called InL (Zeevat, Klein and Calder 1987) which incorporates many of the features of discourse representation theory (Kamp 1981).",
        "An InL formula is of the form (ajCondition where Condition consists of a predicate name followed by its argument list.",
        "Each element of the argument list is either a variable (ie.",
        "discourse marker) or an InL fommla.",
        "The variable a preceding Condition is the index of the formula.",
        "The order attribute of a sign contains information which is used to determine the ordering of the phonology of components during rule application.",
        "If an argument possesses pre as its order, then the phonology of the functor precedes that of the argument in that of the result.",
        "The value past describes the opposite situation.",
        "There is no restriction on the order of (1) as indicated by the appearance of the 'don't care' variable '_' in the order attribute.",
        "InL variables are assigned sorts.",
        "A sort can be thought of as a collection of features based on factors like gender and number.",
        "Unification of variables of incompatible sorts will fail, thus providing a mechanism by which semantic information can restrict possible derivations.",
        "There are different sorts for events, states and objects.",
        "Variables of the object sort may be further specified with respect to gender (masculine, feminine, or neuter), and number.",
        "Unsorted variables will be denoted by the letter a, events by e, states by s, and genderless objects by x, y, and z.",
        "The letter m will be used to represent variables corresponding to a masculine object, f for feminine, and a for neuter.",
        "Unique identifiers which will be used to distinguish variables will appear as numbers following the variable names (ie.",
        "nl , ml, s2).",
        "Signs may be underspecified and through the application of the grammar rules they may become increasingly specified by the merging of information.",
        "Only two grammar rules are proposed in (7_eevat, Klein and Calder, 1987):",
        "(2) W1-W2: C: S: _ – s W1: C/(W2:C2:S2:pre): S: W .S pre 2' 2' 2' (3) C: S: _ W2:C2:S2:post, WI: C/(V/2:C2:S2:post): S: _",
        "They correspond to forward (2) and backward (3) functional application, the two rules in basic categorial grammar.",
        "Capital letters are used to denote variables that are associated with unspecified values which will be instantiated during a derivation.",
        "Colons are used to separate the different attributes of the sign when the sign is displayed in a horizontal rather than vertical manner.",
        "Consider the result of applying rule (3) to the two signs associated with Mary and walks which are shown below.",
        "(4) Mary: np: mary(f1): _ (5) walks",
        "– The result of rule application is the sign that was introduced in (1).",
        "Rule application builds up the semantics of an expression by instantiating unspecified components, like S in the lexical entry for walks (5), that have been placed into the semantic structure.",
        "Associated with every linguistic expression is a derivation tree which describes how the sign corresponding to the complete expression is derived from grammar rules operating over signs associated with lexical entries.",
        "The leaves of this binary tree are labelled with signs for individual words, the root is labelled by the sign for the complete expression, while the other nonterminal nodes are associated with intermediate expressions.",
        "Each nontenninal node is labelled with the result obtained by applying a grammar rule to the signs which are referred to by its two daughter nodes.",
        "The edges to the daughters of a nontemrinal node are designated funaor and argument depending on the role that the sign at the daughter node plays during grammar rule application.",
        "As an example, the derivation tree provided in Figure 1 illustrates how backward functional application (BFA) (3) relates the signs for Mary (4) and walks (5) to the sign associated with Mary-walks (1).",
        "The functor edge of a nontenninal node is represented by a line darker than that of the argument edge.",
        "Rule application combines signs and builds derivation trees as a side effect.",
        "A more general form of this operation would be to combine trees to yield trees directly.",
        "Partial descriptions of a complete derivation tree could be combined to yield an increasingly further specified derivation tree.",
        "The principle advantage of combining partial descriptions lies in the ease with which certain dependencies between different constituents can be described.",
        "Consider the general case in UCG where a functor is applied to an argument to produce a result.",
        "Each of these three constituents possesses its own set of features which describes the phonological, syntactic and semantic information associated with it (Bourns, Koenig and Usricoreit, 1988).",
        "The relationship between these constituents is outlined in Figure 2.",
        "The information F associated with the functor can be dependent on the information G associated with the argument; the dependency relation is shown by the arc labelled in Figure 2.",
        "Such a dependency can be captured in the lexical entry for the functor since the functor contains the information associated with the argument in its own category name (as highlighted in bold in Figure 2).",
        "We have already seen an example of such a dependency in Figure 1 - the semantic information of the functor is dependent on that of the argument.",
        "While the dependency marked by 41 can be captured in the lexicon in UCG, the dependency marked by p must be captured by the grammar rule; the grammar rule must state how the information F associated with the result is obtained from that of the functor and that of the argument.",
        "If we adopt the premise that F=F.",
        "then p becomes an identity relation and there is no need for introducing additional grammar rules to capture a more complicated relation p. Unfortunately, there are cases where the condition F=F' does not apply.",
        "For instance, Bourne (1988) argues for the need of a lax feature which would distinguish lexical elements from phrases; a lexical functor and its result would have different values for this feature (+lex and lax respectively).",
        "Similarly, if one wanted to encode bar level information (Jackendoff, 1977) into the different constituents then there would be numerous cases where the bar level of a functor and that of its argument would not be the same.",
        "Most importantly though, we can provide a straightforward account of reflexivisation if we are not subject to the requirement that F=F as we shall see shortly.",
        "By using a partial description of a derivation tree as a lexical entry, dependencies corresponding to p in Figure 2 are captured in the lexical instead of in the grammar rules.",
        "For instance, the BFA grammar rule states that the phonology of the resulting constituent consists of the phonology of the argument followed by that of the functor.",
        "The lexical entry for walks (5) implicitly describes such a relationship through the presence of the post feature.",
        "This feature is interpreted by the grammar rule, with the relation being explicitly represented in the result.",
        "If a partial description like the one introduced for walks in Figure 3 is used as a lexical entry, this relation is explicitly represented and the presence of a post feature is actually not necessary.",
        "Furthermore, local relationships other than those corresponding to 4) and p can be captured explicitly in the lexical entry.",
        "For instance, the features associated with an argument can be dependent on those of its funaor and information associated with the result can be directly related to that of the argument.",
        "One could even have a more long distance dependency, say between an argument and a subconstituent of its functor, stated directly in the lexical entry.",
        "Most importantly, the use of FA specifications similar to those introduced in Figure 3 allows us to capture the restrictions associated with reflexivisation in the lexicon, without requiring the introduction of additional grammar rules or principles."

        "The subcategorisation information that is contained in the UCG sign is not present in the TUG sign; it is represented in the tree structures of the framework instead.",
        "On a point of temrinology, the second attribute of the TUG sign is referred to as the syntax instead of the category, since it contains more than just categorial information.",
        "Finally, the TUG sign will also contain an attribute for binding information.",
        "For now, however, we will restrict our discussion to only the first three attributes of a TUG sign.",
        "In TUG, a binary tree called an FA specification is associated with every linguistic expression.",
        "These specifications resemble partial descriptions of derivation trees.",
        "Each node of this binary tree is labelled with a sign.",

        "Each nonterminal node dominates a ftmctor node and an argument node.",
        "The terms functor-sign and argument-sign will be used to refer to the signs associated with the functor and argument nodes respectively.",
        "The left-to-right ordering of functor and argument edges is not relevant!",
        "To refer to the sign of the root node of a tree, the term root-sign will be used.",
        "The trees rooted at nonterminal nodes of an FA specification will be called subtrees.",
        "An FA specification contains an auxiliary list which specifies subtrees of the FA specification with which other FA specifications must be unified.",
        "It is represented as a list of labels contained in angle brackets appearing to the left of the FA specification as illustrated in the lexical entries introduced in Figure 3.",
        "Observe that there are two edges leading from the functor-sign of the FA specification for every which do not lead to any nodes.",
        "These hanging edges are associated with nodes whose terminal or nonterminal status has not yet been established.",
        "So an FA specification may either state that a constituent has no subconstituents (terminal node sign), it may state that it has subconstituents (nontermihal node sign), or it may say nothing about whether or not a constituent possesses subconstituents (node with hanging edges).",

        "The result of this rule is a more fully instantiated version of the primary tree, H. The result's auxiliary list will consist of all but the first element of the auxiliary list of the primary tree.",
        "Viewed procedurally, this rule states how to construct a new FA specification from two preexisting FA specifications.",

        "To illustrate how FA specifications are manipulated by this single grammar rule we will trace the construction of the FA specification associated with the sentence Every man walks, using the lexical entries introduced in Figure 3.",
        "The lexical entry for every requires an auxiliary tree to be unified at the location marked by a.",
        "For the moment, let us examine the subtree associated with the argument of the lexical entry.",
        "This subtree describes a functor-argument relation between two linguistic expressions.",
        "One is a functor noun of unspecified case C possessing an index compatible with the 'entity' sort, as designated by the presence of x, while the other is an argument determiner with phonology every.",
        "Alternatively, one could view the determiner as a functor over the noun as suggested in (Popowich, 1988).",
        "However, treating the noun as the functor allows a uniform treatment of nouns with possessive determiners and those with 'regular' determiners.",
        "This is the same treatment that has been adopted in HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1987).",
        "We will propose that for any subtree the functor-sign and the root-sign will generally possess the same syntactic category information, except for bar level information (Popowich, 1988), in a manner reminiscent of the head feature convention of GPSG (Gazdar et.al., 1985).",
        "Observe that the phonology of the root-sign of this subtree is that of the argument-sign followed by that of the functor-sign.",
        "The argument-sign introduces a semantic index of the 'state' sort which will also be the index of the InL formula of any constituent which possesses a universally quantified noun phrase as its argument.",
        "This means that sentences like Every man walks will describe a state, even though the word walks describes an event.",
        "This argument-sign also introduces the semantic connective impl which is associated with the universal quantifier.",
        "When the FA specification for man is treated as a (depth zero) auxiliary tree which is unified with a from the lexical entry for every, we get a more instantiated FA specification which is associated with every man.",

        "It also differs from the lexical entry for every in that it does not possess any labelled subtrees with which an auxiliary tree could be unified.",
        "As an abbreviatory convention, the index preceding a predicate which contains the index as its first argument will be omitted.",
        "So man(ml) is actually an abbreviation for [ml]man(m1) and walk(el,x) is an abbreviation for (el fwalk(el,x).",
        "The FA specification for every man can act as an auxiliary tree to be unified with f1 from the lexical entry for walks shown in Figure 3.",
        "Any potential auxiliary tree must have an argument-sign whose syntax is compatible with the 'nominative noun phrase' specification.",
        "No restrictions are placed on the indices of the root and argument signs; these indices will be specified by the auxiliary tree.",
        "The lexical entry for walks states how the semantics of the root-sign is formed from that of its functor and argument signs.",
        "When the FA specification for every man is combined with this primary tree, P of the primary tree is unified with impl of the auxiliary tree, x is instantiated to ml, and S is unified with trean(m1).",

        "The resulting FA specification is shown in Figure 5.",

        "Eventually, these constraints will describe the final FA structure(s).",
        "Thus we distinguish between information structures and the descriptions of those structures in a manner similar to the approach proposed by Kaplan and Bresnan (1982) and discussed in detail by Johnson (1987).",
        "An FA specification can be interpreted as describing a set of FA structures.",

        "These languages allow descriptions for which there may not be associated structures.",
        "FA specifications are actually higher order descriptions which may be defined in terms of these description languages.",
        "They are intended to (transparently) describe structures associated with linguistic expressions; they are not intended to be a powerful language for describing feature structures in general.",
        "Instead of using FA specifications to describe FA structures, we could use one of these lower level description languages in conjunction with a restriction requiring a wellformed description to describe at least one structure.",
        "In TUG, many local dependencies between grammatical constituents and some other bounded relationships can be stipulated explicitly in lexical entries.",
        "This is because FA specifications for one lexical entry can directly access information contained in the sign associated with a different linguistic expression.",

        "Two grammar roles, for forward and backward functional application, are used to form new constituents.",
        "CUG is similar to PATR-II in that it could serve as a language into which TUGs could be translated.",
        "A potential disadvantage of CUG is that it might be too unrestricted in the type of operations that it allows (van Benthem, 1987).",
        "In addition, the type of structures allowed in TUG is very restricted (binary trees containing only a fixed number of attributes) while those allowed in CUG are much less restricted.",
        "The structures used by TUG, UCG and other formalisms can be translated into a low-level format consisting of CUG DAGs.",
        "A major shortcoming of using CUG or PATR-II as a linguistic formalism is that the dependencies that are necessary for determining anaphoric relationships are 'hidden' in the DAG describing the linguistic expression; information is distributed in a flat graph structure with no higher order grouping expressed.",
        "Although this may be beneficial with respect to implementing grammars, it can make it difficult to work with the structures.",
        "The advantage of the FA structure is that it is an explicitly hierarchical representation structure - a tree with structured .nodes - instead of a graph of simple nodes.",
        "This hierarchical structure allows many linguistic generalisations, particularly those associated with reflexivisation, to be stated easily and transparently.",
        "Tree adjoining grammars AGs) (Joshi, Levy and Takahashi, 1975, Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1988) possess trees as basic grammar structures, and grammar roles are used to alter the structure of these trees.",

        "The leaves of an auxiliary tree are all terminal symbols except for a single nontenninal, the foot, which is of the same category as the root of the tree.",
        "These two types of trees comprise the class of elementary trees.",
        "There is a tree adjoining operation which is used to form derived trees.",
        "Application of this rule results in the insertion of auxiliary trees into the middle of initial trees or other derived trees, subject to specific restrictions.",
        "TAGs are fundamentally different from TUGs since the adjoining operation alters the structure of the tree instead of merely further instantiating it.",
        "Adjoining involves the insertion of trees at internal nodes while the TUG operation can be viewed as the overlaying of trees to form larger structures.",
        "The TAG framework has fully specified trees that are modified by other fully specified trees in order to obtain more complex fully specified trees.",
        "In TUG, partially specified trees are combined (not modified) in order to obtain a more fully specified complex tree.",
        "Feature structure based TAGs (FrAGs) (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1988) are more closely related to TUG than traditional TAGs.",

        "The descriptions are organised so that additional trees may be adjoined at specific locations.",
        "After all the required adjoining operations have been performed, these gaps in the tree structure are closed via unification.",
        "In TUG tree descriptions (FA specifications) the internal tree structure is fixed; the fringe nodes of the FA specification are the only ones for which tree structure information may not be specified (as designated by the hanging edges described earlier).",
