        "Discourse entities (DEs) are descriptions of objects, groups of objects, events, etc.",
        "from the real world or from hypothesized or possible worlds that are evoked in a discourse.",
        "Any communicative act, be it spoken, written, gestured, or system-initiated, can give rise to DEs.",
        "As a discourse progresses, an adequate discourse model must represent the relevant entities, and the relationships between them (Grosz and Sidner, 1986).",
        "A speaker may then felicitously refer anaphorically to an object (subject to focusing or centering constraints (Grosz et al., 1983, Sidner 1981, 1983, Brennan et al.",
        "1987) ) if there is an existing DE representing it, or if a corresponding DE may be directly inferred from an existing DE.",
        "For example, the utterance \"Every senior in Milford High School has a car\" gives rise to at least 3 entities, describable in English as \"the seniors in Milford High School\", \"Milford High School\", and \"the set of cars each of which is owned by some senior in Milford High School\".",
        "These entities may then be accessed by the following next utterances, respectively: \"They graduate in June.\" \"It's a good school.\" \"They completely fill the parking lot.\" Webber (1978, 1983) addressed the question of determining what discourse entities are introduced by a text.",
        "She defined rules which produce \"initial descriptions\" (IDs) of new entities stemming from noun phrases, given a meaning representation of a text.",
        "An ID is a logical expression that denotes the corresponding object and uses only information from the text's meaning representation.",
        "The declarative nature of Webber's rules and the fact that they relied solely on the structure of the meaning representation, made her approach well suited for implementation.",
        "The present work recasts her rules in Janus's intensional logic framework (described in section 2).",
        "Two goals guided our approach: (1) that our DE representations be semantically clear and correct according to the formal definitions of our language, and (2) that these representations be amenable to the processing required in an interactive environment such as ours, where each reference needs to be fully resolved against the current context.",
        "In the following sections, we first present the representational requirements for this approach, and introduce our logical language (section 2).",
        "Then we discuss issues that arose in trying to formalize the logical representation of DEs with respect to (1) the context dependence of their denotations, and (2) the indeterminacy of denotation that arises with indefinite NPs.",
        "For context dependence, we use an intensional logic expression indexed by time and world indices (discussed in section 3).",
        "This required us to extend Webber's rules to detect modal and other index-binding contexts.",
        "In representing DEs for indefinites (appearing as existential formulae in our meaning representation), we replaced Webber's EVOKE predicate with skolem constants for the independent case, where it does not contain a variable bound by a higher FORALL quantifier (section 4), and do not use EVOKE at all in the dependent case.",
        "In section 5 we introduce a generalized version of the rules for generating DEs for dependent quantifiers stemming from indefinite and definite NPs which overcomes some difficulties in capturing dependencies between discourse entities.",
        "In our multi-modal interface environment, it is important to represent the information on the computer screen as part of the discourse context, and allow references to screen entities that are not explicitly introduced via the text input.",
        "Section 6 briefly discusses some of these issues and shows how pointing actions are handled in Janus by generating appropriate discourse entities that are then used like other DEs.",
        ".",
        ".",
        "Finally, section 7 concludes and presents plans for future work.",
        "This is, to our knowledge, the first implementation of Webber's DE generation ideas.",
        "We designed the",
        "algorithms and structures necessary to generate discourse entities from our logical representation of the meaning of utterances, and from pointing gestures, and currently use them in Janus's (Weischedel et al., 1987, BBN, 1988) pronoun resolution component, which applies centering techniques (Grosz et al., 1983, Sidner 1981, 1983, Brennan et al.",

        "Webber found that appropriate discourse entities could be generated from the meaning representation of a sentence by applying rules to the representation that are strictly structural in nature, as long as the representation reflects certain crucial aspects of the sentence.",
        "This has the attractive feature that any syntactic formalism may be used if an appropriate semantic representation is produced.",
        "Some of the requirements (described in (Webber 1978, 1983)) on the representation are: (1) it must distinguish between definite and indefinite NPs and between singular and plural NPs, (2) it must specify quantifier scope, (3) it must distinguish between distributive and collective readings, (4) it must have resolved elided verb phrases, and (5) it must reflect the modifier structure of the NPs (e.g., via restricted quantification).",
        "An important implied constraint is that the representation must show one recognizable construct (a quantifier, for example) per DE-invoking noun phrase.",
        "These constructs are what trigger the DE generation rules.",
        "Insofar as a semantic representation reflects all of the above in its structure, structural rules will suffice for generating appropriate DEs, but otherwise information from syntax or other sources may be necessary.",
        "There is a trade-off between using a level of representation that shows the required distinctions, and the need to stay relatively close to the English structure in order to only generate DEs that are justified by the text.",
        "For example, in Janus, in addition to quantifiers from NPs, the semantic representation has quantifiers for verbs (events), and possibly extra quantifiers introduced in representing deeper meaning or by the collective/distributive processing.",
        "Therefore, we check the syntactic source of the quantifiers to ensure that we only generate entities for quantifiers that arose from NPs (using the bound variable as an index into the parse tree).",
        "Other than the caveat just discussed, the Janus meaning representation language WML (for World Model Language) (Hinrichs et al., 1987) meets all the other constraints for DE generation.",

        "Connection to prior discourse knowledge or information from further discourse may be necessary to establish a unique referent, or determining the referent may not even be necessary.",

        "For example, the logical form for the DE corresponding to \"the cat\" in our system is ((INTENSION (IOTA x cats T) ) time world) where time, if unfilled, defaults to the present, and world defaults to the real world and current discourse state.",

        "For example, \"Are they deployed?\" must have \"they\" refer to the ships that were combat ready on 12/1/88, not at the time of the latter utterance.",
        "In order to derive the proper time and world context for the discourse entities, we added structural rules that recognize intensional and index-binding logical contexts.",

        "The purpose of EVOKE was to make clear that although more than one cat may have been seen, the \"a\" picks out one in particular (which one we do not know except that it is the one mentioned in the utterance), and this is the cat which makes the EVOKE true.",
        "Any subsequent reference then picks out the same cat because it will access this DE.",
        "The semantics of the EVOKE predicate and the type of the S argument (which is syntactic in nature) were unclear, so we looked for a different formulation with better understood semantics.",
        "Predicate logic already provides us with a mechanism for selecting arbitrary individuals from the domain via skolem functions (used as a mechanism for removing existentials from a formula while preserving satisfiability).",
        "Skolem functions have been used in computational linguistics to indicate quantifier scope, for example (VanLehn, 1978).",
        "Following a suggestion by R. Scha, we use skolem functions in the logical form of the DE for the \"indefinite individuals\" introduced by independent existentials (Scha et al., 1987).",
        "For clarity and consistency with the rest of the language, we use a sorted skolem form, where the range of the function is specified.",

        "This type rule says that when the first argument of SKOLEM is of type INTEGER, and the second is a set with elements of type a, then the type of the SKOLEM expression is a.",
        "Therefore, the type of the above example is cats.",
        "The explicit connection to the originating sentence which the EVOKE predicate provided is found in our scheme outside of the logical 2t 5 representation by having a pointer in the DE's structure to the parse tree NP constituent, and to the structure representing the communicative act performed by the utterance (in the fields \"corresponding-constituent\" and \"originating-communicative-act\", respectively).",

        "When the evaluation component of Janus determines a successful value to use for the existential in the text's logical form, the appropriate function denotation for SKOLEM n gets defined, and the \"extension\" field is set for the discourse entity.",
        "Note that many interesting issues come up in the treatment of reference to these indefinite entities in a real system.",
        "For example, cooperative responses by the system introduce new entities that must be taken into account.",
        "If the user asks \"Is there a carrier within 50 miles of Hawaii?\", a cooperative \"There are two: Constellation and Kennedy\" (as opposed to just \"Yes\") must add those two carriers as entities, which now overshadow the singular skolem entity for \"a carrier within 50 miles of Hawaii\".",
        "On the other hand, a \"No\" answer should block any further reference to the carrier skolem, since its denotation is null, while still allowing a reference to a class entity derived from it, as in \"Is there one near San Diego?\" where one refers to the class carriers.",

        "where yi.•.yk are universal quantifiers over DEs as in R3 above, and S or R depend directly or indirectly on Yi ...Yk.",
        "The second and third extensions discussed in the previous section are needed here too: generalizing the quantifiers that outscope the inner existential, and keeping the dependencies among the DEs explicit to avoid underspecified sets.",
        "An example of an underspecified set arises when the dependent IOTA depends jointly on more than one outer variable; for example, in \"Every boy gave a girl he knew the peach they selected\", each peach depends on the selection by a boy and a girl together.",
        "Take a scenario analogous to that in the previous section, with the facts now as follows (replacing \"selected\" for \"wants\"):",
        "By an analogous argument as before, using R5, the set of peaches will incorrectly contain p2, given by a boy to a girl who selected it with him, but whom he did not know.",
        "The modified rule is analogous to R3\" in the previous section:",
        "Note that this problem of underspecified sets does not arise when the dependency inside the IOTA is on one variable, because the definite \"the\" forces a one-to-one mapping from the possible assignments of the single outer variable represented in the IOTA to the IOTA denotations.",
        "If we use the example, \"Every boy gave a girl he knew the peach she wanted\", with logical form:",
        "there is such a mapping between the set of girls in the appropriate DE2 (those who got the peach they wanted from a boy they knew) and the peaches in DE3 obtained via R5' (the peaches that some girl in DE2 wanted).",
        "Each girl wants exactly one peach, so facts 2 and 3, where the same girl receives two different peaches, cannot occur.",
        "So the definite ensures that no scenario can be constructed containing extra items, as long as there is only one outer variable in the inner iota.",
        "However in the joint dependency example above using \"selected\", the one-to-one mapping is between boy-girl pairs and peaches, so the relationship between the boys and the girls becomes an integral part of determining the correct DE3."
