        "Sentence (la) contains the word will coded ambiguously as an NP and an auxiliary, modal verb.",

        "In sentence (3a), hit is coded to be ambiguous between an NP (as in a baseball hit) and a verb.",

        "Sentence (5a) presents can ambiguously as an auxiliary, modal, and main verb, while fish is presented uniquely as an NP.",
        "Can is processed as the main verb of the sentence and results in the same structure as sentence (5b).",
        "Likewise, sentence (6a), which contains fish coded ambiguously as a verb/NP and can coded uniquely as an auxiliary verb, produces the same structure as sentence (6b).",
        "In the cases shown, the lexically ambiguous words were disambiguated and reasonable structures resulted.",
