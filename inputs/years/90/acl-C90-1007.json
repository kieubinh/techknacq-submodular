        "Natural language interfaces represent one of the most common applications of natural language processing.",
        "In the eighties, not only a considerable increase in natural language interface refinement has been achieved, but also methods for design and evaluation have been worked out [Mart 83, Schr 881.",
        "One might think that a natural language interface of the nineties would be properly described in terms of three parameters, viz.,",
        "(i) transportability (ii) modifiability by the user (iii) generality",
        "Our experience with THALES shows that none of these features is attainable in the near future.",
        "Rather, natural language interfaces based on well-defined subsets of languages and supplemented with possibly full semantics appear to be real candidates for applications in the following years.",
        "Requirements for transportability and generality run counter to the need to supply the interface with as full semantics as possible.",
        "Modifiability by the user can be maintained at a price that is hardly worth paying.",
        "If one lets the user tailor the interface to his/her needs, that natural language interface should provide this possibility by relaxing syntax or semantics.",
        "We do not consider this a real alternative.",
        "Neither does modifiability in the form of substitution of one expression by another on the basis of their semantic identity seem to be a realization of what the term \"modifiability by the user\" suggests (Cf. [JAKE 88]).",
        "However, there appear to be different parts of natural language interface design that may be reused in other applications.",
        "We shall refer to this possibility by the term \"specifiability\" -- a feature that merits thorough consideration."

        "A natural language interface establishes connection between the user and some other language or set of user-defined procedures.",
        "In constructing a natural language interface, the primary aim is to provide a means for the translation of natural language sentences into sentences of that other language or into procedure calls.",
        "The latter define the semantics of execution for the input sentence(s).",
        "When the value of a natural language interface is being assessed, transportability, modifiability and generality seem to he false starting points.",
        "These features would make a natural language interface truly valuable, were it not for the fact that they cannot be taken prima facie.",
        "A transportable natural language interface means some kind of over-generalization.",
        "For a natural language interface to be transportable, it is necessary that we have a sublanguage with too wide a coverage to carry specific information encoded in its semantics.",
        "That is why transportability is achieved only in highly identical domains (characteristically, interfaces to databases).",
        "A natural language interface can be modified by the user according to his/her specific purposes exceptionally in the lexicon.",
        "Hence, the semantics is prewired, the syntax is fixed, and what you gain is hardly more than a replacement of one or two mnemonics with some other character strings that you might prefer.",
        "The notion of generality of a natural language interface is too vague to deserve special attention.",
        "It might refer to syntactic and/or semantic coverage, it might imply the existence of a fairly large word stock, hut, we should think, it would hardly ever be taken to mean \"general\" in the sense that it could be applied in different domains.",
        "4.2.",
        "Specifiability of natural language interface architecture A basic question in designing natural language interfaces of the THALES type is that of assessing which parts can and which cannot he generated.",
        "An answer to this question would throw light on the problem of' transportability, modifiability and generality.",
        "We argue that those parts of a natural language interface which can be generated from some high level specification appear to closely satisfy the demand for transportability, modifiability and generality.",
        "It seems to he the case that the lexical, syntactic and static semantic analyzers arc suitable for generation on the basis of an attribute grammar description.",
        "It should be noted that the lexical analyzer also contains the morphological module.",
        "The syntactic parser processes a CF grammar.",
        "Dynamic semantics is also suitable for analysis by an attribute grammar description, but there are too many application-specific elements whose generation does not seem to he a realistic goal for the time being.",
        "Of crucial importance is the notion of static (compile time) semantics in the case of natural language interfaces like THALES.",
        "In a conventional programming language, we define its static semantics as the set of context-sensitive properties that can be evaluated, checked or calculated during compile time.",
        "The most important properties of this kind are a) the differentiation between defining and applied occurrences of variables b) the assessment of the scope of defining occurrences c) the problem of identification: finding the defining occurrences that match the applied occurrences 2 45 d) the question of type compatibility Conventional compilers contain a symbol table that will serve as a basis for the investigation of the questions raised above.",
        "Elements of the symbol table are built from objects of the types recognized by the language, supplemented with auxiliary information.",
        "During compilation the symbol table undergoes continuous modification, problems related to static semantics are solved on the basis of the actual state of the symbol table.",
        "If one compares static semantic analysis in the case of natural language interfaces like THALES, it appears that basic types correspond to objects with a hierarchic structure.",
        "E.g. a triangle is represented as having vertices, bisectors, altitudes etc.",
        "Again, e.g. altitudes have endpoints, a midpoint, length etc.",
        "Endpoints, in tum, have coordinates expressed as numbers.",
        "Such hierarchic structure can be ascribed to other natural language interfaces as well.",
        "A specification language [Ale 89] is used for type definition.",
        "In the course of specification, other data can also be incorporated (adjectival, prepositional co-occurrence restrictions etc).",
        "On the basis of this specification it is possible to generate procedures for symbol table manipulation.",
        "The symbol table can then serve as a tool for deciding type compatibility.",
        "For example, one can refer to the midpoint of an altitude due to the fact that an altitude is of segment type, and segments do have a midpoint.",
        "In the differentiation of defining and applied occurrences, determiners play a crucial role.",
        "While in conventional programming languages identification is resolved by a relatively simple algorithm, this problem in THALES-like natural language interfaces is much more complicated.",
        "Below we give a sample of the identification methodology used in THALES.",
        "This methodology can be extended on the specificational level or, vice versa, the application of some of the methods can be prohibited.",
        "The abbreviations ID, OBJ, and ADJ stand for identifier (a unique name of an object, denoted by '–' in THALES ), object (the name of an object, possibly a part of another object), and adjective, resp.",
        "OBJ ID - an object with a unique name to be found unambiguously, cf.",
