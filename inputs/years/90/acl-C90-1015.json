        "A sentence is considered as a stack of NPs In our Western grammar traditions, action is the main interest and we place verbs in a central position.",
        "But, in scientific texts, NPs are the main carrier of meaning, as they name concepts.",
        "They arc also used as terms for indexation.",
        "From the statistical point of view, too, nouns are by far the most numerous category.",
        "That is the reason why the basis for this parser is that the sentence is considered as a stack of NPs, with relations of determination between them.",
        "An initial NP is laid (it is often the focus of the sentence), and the following phrases precise and determine it.",
        "Here determination is considered as adding more data.",
        "These different NPs are connected in a more or less narrow way by \"links\":",
        "• \"non verbal links\": prepositions, co-ordinations, subordinating conjunctions, relative pronouns, • verbs in all their forms: conjugated, present and past participles, infinitives.",
        "Thus the processing of the verb is unified in such a manner that every verb, conjugated or not, of a main or subordinated clause, acts as an adjective (is a \"translate\" to adjective, according to Tesniere's concept, in [Tesniere 591), determines a NP and is a link in the \"chain\" of NPs.",
        "Therefore, the NP is considered as the basic and constitutive element of the sentence (as the cell is the basic and constitutive element of the living tissue).",
        "The inside and the outside of the NP are processed separately and differently, so we have:",
        "• a grammar of the NP, centered on a nominalized word (like the inside structure of the cell, centered on its nucleus), • and a grammar of the sentence, outside the NP, which is expressed in terms of NPs, each of them considered as a closed entity (like the structure of the tissue expressed as an architecture of cells).",
        "Let us name this grammar the \"NP stack grammar\" or \"NPSG\".",
        "Inside the noun phrase The internal grammar of the NP is centered on a nominalized word, a noun, a nominalized adjective or a verb.",
        "It reigns over its determinant and adjectives at the root of a dependency-determination tree.",
        "The branches of the tree are made of partitive, determinant, indefinite adjective, anteposed adjective (very rare in scientific texts) before the nominalized word, and contiguous or coordinated postposed adjectives, after the nominalized word.",
        "The nominalized word is determined and qualified by the other words of the NP.",
        "This grammar has been presented for instance in [Vergne 86] and developed in [Vergne 89].",
        "Outside the noun phrase The NP stack grammar or NPSG, is used to:",
        "• validate the sentence structure as a stack of NPs, • confirm the function of words external to NPs, • compute some tight relations external to NPs, such as verb-object.",
        "Valuation functions are used to compute other looser relations external to NPs, such as prepositional phrase attachment or co-ordinations.",
        "I propose to distinguish three types of relations: 1 relations internal to the NP (mainly the determination noun adjective).",
        "These relations are computed during the internal analysis of a NP.",
        "-2- relations external to the NP, but internal to a recognition pattern, as for instance, the relations subject verb and verb object in a SVO sentence.",
        "These relations are computed at the recognition time during the validation of the sentence at the NP level.",
        "This computation is algorithmic.",
        "Nota bene: to avoid the Chomsky's term governer, I propose the term reigner for Tesniere's concept \"regissant\" (in [Tesniere 59]).",
        "They have the same etymology, and both are verbal derivatives: the reigner reigns over its dependents.",
        "-3- relations external to the NP, and external to the recognition patterns, as for instance, the relations \"reigner\" prepositional phrase (PP): the PPs are recognized by a pattern of the form: preposition-NP, a pattern which does not contain the reigner, which is either a verbal \"link\", or a determined NP.",
        "These relations arc computed by valuation functions.",
        "The computation then is heuristic.",
        "The three types of relations are determination relations.",
        "They proceed from the tighter ones, inside the NP (-1-), to the looser ones, outside the NP, and outside the recognition patterns (-3-).",
        "The NP stack grammar Validating the NP stack pattern At the beginning of this step of the parsing, the sentence is represented by a pattern made of a sequence of letters, in which each letter represents either a NP, or a word external to the NP (preposition, verb, for instance).",
        "It is possible to imagine this pattern as an artichoke, made of leaves around the heart.",
        "Validating the pattern then consists in plucking off parts of it progressively:",
        "• the leaves are replaced or removed in a precise order, until the heart is reached: - leaves are replaced by context sensitive rules which erase negations, adverbs, auxiliaries; - leaves arc removed by context free rules which remove everything else but the heart; • simultaneously, each time a leaf is replaced or removed, the relations internal to this leaf are computed (relations of type 2 in the typology exposed above).",
        "That is the reason why I name this parser: \"plucking off parser\" or \"POP\".",
        "The final state of the pattern once plucked off must be one of the different possible hearts.",
        "They are:",
        "• a NP alone, • a NP determined by other NPs through a conjugated verb, • or a NP determined by an attribute, a past participle or a NP through an auxiliary \"Cite\".",
        "Transposing relations internal to a leaf by simulated reclothing Relations which are internal to a leaf pattern must be transposed into the entire NP level pattern.",
        "From the positions in a leaf pattern, we are able to compute the positions in the entire NP level pattern.",
        "To retrieve these absolute positions, we have only to simulate the reclothing of the heart, by using the historical account of the plucking off.",
        "After simulated reclothing (by applying the rules in the reverse order), we obtain the absolute positions in the entire NP level pattern.",
        "In a later step of the parsing, after the internal analysis of NPs, these relations will be transposed into the word level pattern.",
        "In such a way, all relations internal to a leaf pattern are computed inside the leaf pattern, then transposed by simulated reclothing into the entire NP level pattern, then at last transposed into the word level pattern.",
        "These two transpositions may be seen as reference point changes, from a relative position in the leaf pattern (NP level), to an absolute position in the entire pattern (word level).",
        "Valuation functions: an heuristic way to choose Valuation functions have been described in detail in Vergne 891.",
        "A valuation function is a clear and fine way to express an heuristic, when criteria are too fuzzy to make a choice with an algorithm (a binary tree of \"if then else\" for instance).",
        "The objective is to make an automatic choice without an algorithm.",
        "The principle is the following:",
        "• Determine the objects to valuate: the candidates distinguished from the non candidates.",
        "• Quantify valuation of the candidates, using criteria to discriminate them.",
        "The criteria represents the knowledge we have about the phenomenon.",
        "• The candidate who obtained the higher valuation is choosen.",
        "When to use valuation functions Valuation functions are used to compute the relations of type 3 :",
        "• to search for the \"reigner of a nominal or infinitive PP, of a present participle or of a gerundive introduced by \"en\", of a past participle, of a subordinated clause; • to search for the left coordinated of a NP, of a nominal or infinitive PP, of an infinitive, of an attribute, of a main or subordinated clause.",
        "; • to search for a referent which agrees with an anaphoric.",
        "Using valuation functions with formal criteria is based on the hypothesis of the high formal redundancy of natural language.",
        "Attaching prepositional phrases principle: At the beginning of the computation, a \"power to reign\" is affected to each word according to its category and its eventual verbal derivational origin.",
        "This computation is thought of as the simulation of the conflicts that words have between them to reign over other words.",
        "During this computation, powers are variable: cancelled, reduced, augmented or transmitted.",
        "the valuation formula: The function used to valuate a reigner-candidate is a linear function of its power and of its distance to the PP.",
        "The valuation is the apparent power of the reigner-candidate, when seen from the dependent.",
        "The apparent or relative dimension of an object depends on its absolute dimension, and on the distance between the object and the observer.",
        "It is possible to think too of the physical analogy of the field, a concept which gives an explanation of the influence of an object on the objects in the space around: the universal attraction (gravitation field), for instance, is governed by a rule in 1 / distance 2 .",
        "It is the purpose here to modelise the influence of a reigner over its dependents.",
        "The candidate is valuated according to the following formula: relative power = 2 * absolute power - 10 * distance error detection: If two valuations are very close, the higher is choosen, as usual, but marked as uncertain.",
        "final output: Then the reigner is lemmatized, and the relation is output, with its type.",
        "If the dependent is co-ordinated, the dependency of the right coordinated noun is output too.",
        "It has the same reigner as its left coordinate."
