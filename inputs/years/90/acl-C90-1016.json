      "text": [
        "Problems in translation of anaphoric expressions can be seen on three different but interactive levels of linguistic information: lexical, syntactic and pragmatic.",
        "The main problem on the lexical level is due to a difference in the language specific parameters in the pronominal system such as F features (person, gender, number, etc.).",
        "Surface forms of pronominals depend on the F features of their antecedents, so that the translation of a particular pronominal form cannot be determined sorely by the pronominal itself.",
        "For example, 'ship' in English is feminine, but its translation, 'hune', is neutral in Japanese.",
        "Thus, a profonn 'she' for 'ship' should not be translated as 'kanojo' (3rd, sing, fem), but as 'sore' (3rd, sing, neut).",
        "Problems on the syntactic level are mainly due to a difference in the distribution of anaphoric expressions.",
        "Mapping relations between English pronominals and their Japanese counterparts are shown below: The most crucial case is English overt pronouns.",
        "As Kuroda noted (1965:107), overt pronouns are not repeatable in Japanese, while they are in English.",

        "Resumptive pronouns are also problematic.",
        "Possessive relative pronoun 'whose' in English must be translated as a resumptive pronoun whose antecedent is the head NP of a relative clause in Japanese.",
        "The last set of problems is on the level of pragmatics.",
        "It has been known that in many languages certain types of pronominal expressions represent a focus in a discourse.",
        "For example, in English, overt pronouns play this role while zero pronouns (topic-zero) do the job in Japanese.",
        "In a certain discourse context, a discourse focus should be translated as a reflexive 'zibun' instead of a zero pronoun.",
        "Some cases may be induced to lexical properties of predicates and pronominals such as functional and psuedo-functional control cases and reflexivity.",
        "Nonetheless, most of the above problems arc not easily separable; they should better be solved in a unified model.",

        "In this paper, we will focus on the problems of translating English overt non-reflexive pronominals into Japanese.",

        "To explain some exceptions on locality conditions and ambiguous cases in anaphora resolution, recent studies have focused on the role of discourse (Grosz 1981; Sidner 1983; Joshi & Weinstein 1981; Kameyama 1985; Roberts 1986) and world knowledge.",
        "Discourse factors affecting anaphora resolution are discourse structure and discourse focus/center.",
        "This report concerns only the latter; in particular, the selection of focus and its maintenance.",
        "Following Grosz, we assume that a focus is the most salient NP in a sentence, and every sentence has one and only one focusl.",
        "Often a focus is marked by the use of pronominal, stress, thematic role and particular syntactic constructions such as clefting, question, passivization, etc.",
        "However, there seems no clear generalization on the organization of the focus marking factors.",
        "We simply assume the most marked NP with respect to the number of found factors (Asher & Wada 1989; Alshawi 1987).",
        "We have adopted the Discourse Representation Structure (Kamp 1981) to represent a current discourse structure which will be appended to an (- structure representing a sentence.",

        "Its characteristic is that it may not be bound in the current sentence, but must be bound by the focus in the previous discourse.",
        "In other words, when a pronominal cannot find its antecedent in the current DRS, we assume that it must be bound by the previous discourse focus unless the focus has been shifted, and in such a case we translate it as 0, a lexical zero pronominal."

        "However, we still need to determine which form should be used: pro, 'zibun', or overt pronominals.",
        "The selection should be syntactically made on the Japanese side since no additional information is available for the selection in the English f-structures.",

        "When the two shown above are anaphorically linked in a sentence, LFG offers a syntactic solution, namely, the Functional Uncertainty (Kaplan & Maxwell 1988)3.",
        "The link is represented by a functional-application equation (FU) such as follows: (2) < A /GF* \\GF PROFORM > < A PROFORM > In the above FU, the second GF after the right slash represents an f-structure that dominates a possible antecedent, and the first GF* after the left slash, f-commanding path to the antecedent from the current f-structure4.",
        "That is, the FU imposes a constraint such that the right-hand side of the equation in (2) represents an f-structure containing a pronominal, and if there is an f-structure within the path represented by the left-hand side of the equation, then it must be the case that their PROFORMs are unifiable5.",
        "For the generation of surface PROFORMs, we assume that a pronominal element possesses a lexically unspecified PROFORM, and it will be specified by its antecedent.",
        "In other words, given that a pronominal and its antecedent are coindexed, an FU such as follows should be satisfied.",
        "(3) < A GF* \\ GF* Ant > =c < A Desc >",
        "This equation can be solved only when the indices arc identical.",
        "Once the equation (3) is solved, PROFORM will be unified between the antecedent and the pronominal 6.",
        "Selection on pro and 'zibun' can be considered as solving particularly restricted FU equations.",
        "For example, 'zibun' will be selected when the following FU equation is satisfied7.",
        "(4) <A/GF(ADJUNCT)GF* \\SUBJ Ant> =c <A Desc > This equation says that if there exists a SUBJ that f-commands GF(s) that may contain an adjunct which includes an f-structure in which the current pro resides, then it must be the case that the Ant value of that SUBJ and Desc value of the pro are identical.",

        "In order to find the most salient NP, SLSTOR sets three kinds of filters among others such as grammatical function, use of pronominal, and syntactic construction (See Asher & Wada 1989), and check all of the NPs appeared in the current sentence with respect to the three filters.",
        "After the most salient element has been selected, SLSTOR checks whether the current focus has been shifted or retained by comparing the current SLSTOR value and the newly selected one.",
        "If their gender, number, person, etc.",
        "are unifiable, the discourse focus is considered to retain and SLSTOR keeps the previous NP in the storage.",

        "This module consists of three functions.",

        "In effect, we distinguish pronominals into three classes according SEARCH's result; 1) an antecedent found in the current DRS, 2) an antecedent not found in the current DRS, but controlled by a discourse focus, and 3) an antecedent not found in either in the current DRS or in the previous focus.",
        "The second function is LINK.",
