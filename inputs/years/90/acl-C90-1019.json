        "The objective of this system is to achieve a deep understanding of small reports dealing with a restricted domain (here, patient discharge summaries in a medical specialty).",
        "This means that HELENE should rely on an extensive description of all types of required knowledge.",
        "This implies of course a deep domain knowledge base, including the needed common sense knowledge.",
        "Precise understanding must not only rely on complete domain knowledge, but also on enough syntactic information.",
        "This is the reason why HELENE includes a full syntactic module, whose task is to provide the semantic construction module with the (deep) structures of sentences.",
        "One problem with syntactic processing is that it gives rise to numerous ambiguities.",
        "These ambiguities are filtered on semantic grounds by a disambiguation module that does not build any semantic representation.",
        "Semantic construction is concerned with the recognition of domain entities that can be expressed by word groups.",
        "We thus had to adopt a lexical semantics approach compatible with descriptions.",
        "Domain entities, once instantiated, provide the basis on which a model of the current state of the world (here, the patient state) is built.",
        "The same lexical semantic information is used both to help syntactic processing, and in a more extensive way to access domain models in order to build semantic representations.",
        "The prototype includes the following main modules:",
        "• The syntactic module implements the Lexical Functional Grammar formalism [7].",
        "The parser builds c-structure and f-structure bottom-up in parallel on a chart, so that f-structure validity can constrain c-structure construction.",
        "• Ambiguous attachments are submitted to evaluation and ranking by the disambiguation module.",
        "This module applies a set of general heuristic rules that operate on the semantic definition of the LFG predicates.",
        "• Semantic construction relies on dynamic domain models that integrate common sense.",
        "LFG predicates are characterized by semantic components that point to parts of the knowledge base.",
        "The prototype runs in Common Lisp (VAX Lisp) and K, a proprietary language embedded in Common Lisp.",
        "The remaining sections describe these modules in more detail."

        "We chose to implement the LFG framework *supported by AIM project 1003 and PRC Communication Homme-Machine, Pole Langage Naturel.",
        "for several reasons.",
        "Being a linguistic theory, 8 2 1 it should provide better foundations for principled syntactic coverage.",
        "A formalism with a context-free backbone was easier to implement.",
        "Furthermore, LFG extracts from a sentence a predicate-argument structure which consitutes a good starting point for semantic processing.",
        "Our implementation of LFG does not include yet a schema for long-distance dependencies (or functional uncertainty) and coordination.",
        "It allows cyclic f-structures.",
        "Our parser uses a chart to build both c-structure and f-structure.",
        "Incomplete and complete constituents are represented by active and inactive cs-edges, while incomplete and complete f.structures are placed on active and inactive fs-edges.",
        "The parsing strategy is bottom-up, left to right (left corner).",
        "Top-down parsing is also available, as well as right to left parsing.",
        "LFG schemas are evaluated as soon as possible.",
        "Equational (construction) schemas are evaluated when encountered, and constraint schemas (existential, equational and negation of those) are kept on fs-edges until they can be evaluated.",
        "When fs-edges are combined, remaining constraints are propagated to the resulting fs-edge.",
        "Each new active f-structure is tested for consistency and coherence.",
        "Furthermore, the value of a closed function is tested for completeness (this should be revised if a scheme for long-distance dependencies is implemented).",
        "When a constraint is violated, its fs-edge is flagged as invalid.",
        "Grammar rules are described as regular expressions which are compiled into (reversible) transition networks.",
        "Each arc of those networks is labelled with a category and a disjunction of conjunctions of schemas.",
        "A model of hierarchical lexical entry representation has been developed, with data-driven lexical rules.",
        "It is not currently coupled to the parser, and will not be presented here.",
        "The prototype uses a simple word list with what would be the result of this model as lexical entries.",
        "The prototype uses a small French grammar that contains 14 networks, equivalent to 90 rules.",
        "It was assembled by borrowing from the literature [3,10] and by completing with grammar manuals and real text confrontation.",
        "It has the particularity of building cyclic f-structures for constructions where a head plays a role inside an adjunct.",
        "This is how we process attributive adjectives, participial phrases, and (in a very limited way) relative phrases."

        "An ultimate test of semantic validity would consist in comparing complete semantic representations built for each attachment proposal [1].",

        "These concepts subsume important situations in the model and translate them into a higher description level, thus allowing output to the user for a trace of correct understanding.",
        "No deep understanding would be possible without a treatment, even partial, of common sense, which in this application is concerned mainly with part-whole relationships [5], reasoning about transitions and change, and elementary physical actions (e.g., removing, touching).",
        "Default knowledge on actions, roles and reference (e.g., used in the resolution of pragmatic anaphora) are associated to the common sense module.",
        "Common sense mechanisms are incorporated as production systems similar to those describing other active elements of the model, and can thus recombine freely with them in order to complete or modify existing representations.",
        "Domain representations are built from the assembly of lexical contents along the syntactic structure of the proposition.",
        "Words contain semantic components [8], which are markers referring to elements of the knowledge base or properties of these representations.",
        "The existence of explicit common sense concepts in the knowledge base makes it possible to decompose homogeneously technical and ordinary words.",
        "The lexical contents are assembled by heuristic rules to form candidate domain objects which are recognized as instances of prototypes in the representation.",
        "Lexical content itself is loosely structured; the association of the components is completed according to their type (which is derived from the type of entity they refer to) and the dependency (predicate-argument, predicate-adjunct) relations between the lexemes that contain such components, as provided by the LFG.",
        "As such elements of representation are recognized by the model, the reactive environment is triggered and interprets data until new information is analyzed.",
        "The prototype currently runs on a small set of 30 sentences taken from patient discharge summaries.",
