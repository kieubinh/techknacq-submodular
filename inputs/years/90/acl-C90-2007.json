        "The traditional framework for ambiguity resolution employs only 'static' knowledge, expressed generally as selectional restrictions or domain specific constraints, and makes no use of any specific knowledge manipulation mechanisms apart from the simple ability to match valences of structurally related words.",
        "In contrast, this paper suggests how a theory of lexical semantics making use of a knowledge representation framework offers a richer, more expressive vocabulary for lexical information.",
        "In particular, by performing specialized inference over the ways in which aspects of knowledge structures of words in context can be composed, mutually compatible and contextully relevant lexical components of words and phrases are highlighted.",

        "Our thesis below is that a theory of lexical semantics making use of a knowledge representation (KR) framework offers a richer, more expressive vocabulary for lexical information.",
        "Ultimately the goal of this research is to explain the creative use of language and highlight the role of a constantly evolving lexicon, while obviating the current prevalent views of 'static' lexicon design.",
        "A side effect of adopting such a theory as the basis of semantic interpretation is that some classically difficult problems in ambiguity -- in particular, lexical – are resolved by viewing them from a different perspective.",
        "In an implementation such as that proposed here, lexical ambiguity resolution is an integral part of the same procedure that produces the semantic interpretation of a sentence.",
        "There are several methodological motivations for wanting to import tools developed for computational representation and manipulation of knowledge into the study of word meaning, or lexical semantics.",
        "In particular, we believe that the goals of computational linguistics are the same as those of linguistics: to provide useful, testable and explanatory theories of the nature of language and its relation to human cognition as a whole.",
        "It follows that computational linguistics is linguistics as it should now be done, and that the computational tools developed and available in the larger context of Artificial Intelligence should not be ignored by linguists.",
        "Furthermore, 'shifting' the application area of KR formalisms from their traditional domain (general world knowledge) to a level below words (lexical knowledge), allows us to abstract the notion of lexical meaning away from world knowledge, as well as from other semantic influences (e.g. discourse and pragmatic factors); such a process of abstraction is a crucial prerequisite of any theory of lexical meaning.",
        "Bringing in KR tools provides us with several benefits, which are instrumental to enriching the semantics of lexical expressions.",
        "Firstly, it is now possible to systematically incorporate world knowledge into the lexical entry, while still maintaining an awareness of the boundary between lexical and common sense knowledge.",
        "Secondly, it is also possible to reason over that knowledge, facilitating the construction of richer semantic interpretations.",
        "Finally, having developed a theory incorporating generalizations about the systematic patterning of words, we have a formal language for expressing these generalizations.",
        "The interplay of these capabilities results in a generative language for expressing the meanings of words, while providing a different way of capturing multiple word senses through richer composition.",
        "Together with a set of principles for lexical decomposition, whose central tenet is that semantic expressions for word meaning (in context) are constructed by a fixed number of generative devices (cf. Pustejovsky [I.989bj), this language becomes a tool fbr expressing lexical knowledge, while not presupposing finite enumeration of word senses.",
        "Current dictionaries reflect, through their organization, the traditional view of word senses; in particular, they assume that the space of possible/allowable uses of a word is exhaustively carved out by an enumerable set of senses for that word.",
        "Computational lexicons, to date, generally tend to follow this orga",
        "nization.",
        "As a result, the natural language interpretation tasks these lexica support acquire (or inherit) similar view to lexical ambiguity, which then necessitates a particular approach to disambiguation.",
        "Furthermore, dictionaries and lexicons currently are of a distinctly static nature: the division into separate word senses not only precludes permeability; it also fails to account for the creative use of words in novel contexts.",
        "In contrast, rather than taking a 'snapshot' of language at any moment of time and freezing it into lists of word sense specifications, the model of the lexicon proposed here does not preclude extend-ability: it is open-ended in nature and accounts for the novel, creative, uses of words in a variety of contexts by positing procedures for generating semantic expressions for words on the basis of particular contexts.",
        "In the remainder of this paper we will illustrate a particular theory of lexical semantics, following Pustejovsky [forthcoming] which promotes the notion of a generative lexicon.",
        "In particular, we briefly discuss certain types of lexical ambiguity, demonstrate how traditional methods of ambiguity resolution fail to scale up for these (and other) cases, and then outline an approach to semantic interpretation embodying richer methods of compositionality, As we also show below, the lexical model we propose has the effect of greatly reducing the size of the lexicon.",
        "Moreover, it bears directly on issues of organization and content of computational lexicons, as the model now embodies strong assumptions about the kinds of lexical aspects of words essential for natural language processing.",
        "The generative theory of lexical semantics, then, imposes a strong focus on current efforts to extract lexical data from large on-line text resources (dictionaries and corpora): it not only offers a uniform representational framework for expressing the data extracted by the tools and methods of computational lexicography (cf. Boguraev and Briscoe, [1989]), but also offers guidance on the kinds of lexical data – or distinctions in the lexical behavior of words --- which should be sought in such resources (cf. Boguraev el al., [1990])."

        "Assuming a partitioning of the space of possible uses of a word into word senses -- as postulated and defined by the entry for that word -- the problem becomes that of selecting, on the basis of various contextual factors (typically subsumed by, but not necessarily limited to, the notion of selectional restrictions), the word sense closest to the use of the word in the given text.",
        "Computationally, this reduces to a search within a finite space of possibilities.",
        "Realistically, however, this approach fails on several accounts -- both in terms of what information is made available in a lexicon to drive the disambiguation process and how an automated sense selection procedure might make use of this information.",
        "Typically, external contextual factors alone are not sufficient for precise selection of a word sense; additionally, often the lexical entry does not provide enough reliable pointers to critically discriminate between word senses.",
        "Secondly, the search process becomes computationally expensive, if not in effect intractable, when it has to account for longer phrases made up of individually ambiguous words.",
        "Finally, the assumption that an exhaustive listing can be assigned to the different uses of a word lacks the explanatory power necessary for making generalizations and/or predictions about how words used in a novel way can be reconciled with their currently existing lexical definitions.",
        "To illustrate this last point, below we present some examples of problematic nature for current ambiguity resolution frameworks.",
        "Creative Use of Words Consider the ambiguity and context-dependence of adjectives such as fast and slow, where the meaning of the predicate varies depending on the head being modified.",
        "Typically, a lexicon requires an enumeration of different senses for such words, in order to account for the ambiguity illustrated below:",
        "1: a fast car: Ambiguous: a car driven quickly / one that is inherently fast.",
        "2: a fast typist: the person performs the act of typing quickly.",
        "3: a fast waltz: the motion of the dance is quick.",
        "4: a fast book: one that can be read in a short time.",
        "5: a fast reader: one who reads quickly.",

        "(Note that in a real lexicon, word senses would be further annotated with selectional restrictions; these are omitted here for brevity.)",
        "Upon closer analysis, each occurrence of fast above predicates in a slightly different way.",
        "In fact, any finite enumeration of word senses will not account for creative applications of this adjective in the language.",
        "For example, fast in the phrase a fast motorway refers to the ability of vehicles on the motorway to sustain high speed.",
        "As a novel use of fast, we are clearly looking at a new sense that is not covered by the enumeration above.",
        "Permeability of Word Senses Part of our argument for a different organization of the lexicon is based on a claim that the boundaries between the 2 37 word senses in the analysis of fast above are too rigid.",
        "Still, even if we assume that enumeration is adequate as a descriptive mechanism, it is not always obvious how to select the correct word sense in any given context: consider the systematic ambiguity of verbs like bake (discussed by Atkins et al., [1988j), which require discrimination with respect to change-of-state versus create readings:",
        "6: John baked the potato.",
        "7: John baked the cake.",
        "The problem here is that there is too much overlap in the 'core' semantic components of the different readings; hence, it is not possible to guarantee correct word sense selection on the basis of selectional restrictions alone.",
        "Furthermore, as language evolves, partial overlaps of core and peripheral components of different word meanings make the traditional notion of word sense, as implemented in current dictionaries, inadequate (see Atkins [1990] for a critique of the flat, linear enumeration-based organization of dictionary entries).",
        "The only feasible approach would be to employ considerably more refined distinctions in the semantic content of the complement than is conventionally provided by e.g. the mechanism of selectional restrictions.",
        "Difference in Syntactic Forms It is equally arbitrary to create separate word senses for a lexical item just because it can participate in distinct syntactic realizations – and yet this has been the only approach open to computational lexicons which assuine the ambiguity resolution framework outlined above.",
        "A striking example of this is provided by verbs such as believe and forget.",
        "Observe in (8-11) below that the syntactic realization of the complement determines both the factivity of the proposition in the complement or whether an NP is interpreted as a concealed question (see, for example, Grimshaw [1979]).",

        "Such a distinction could be easily accounted for by simply positing separate word senses for each syntactic type, but this misses the obvious relatedness between the two instances of forget.",
        "If it were possible to make the use of forget in (8) and (9) sensitive to the syntactic type of its complement, then we could also explain the parallel cases in (10) and (11).",

        "If, on the other hand, elaborate lexical meanings of e.g. verbs and adjectives could be made sensitive to components of equally elaborate decompositions of e.g. nouns, the notion of spreading the semantic load evenly across the lexicon becomes the key organizing principle in expressing the knowledge necessary for disambiguation.",
        "In order to be able to express the distinctions, at lexical level, required for analyzing the examples in the last section, it is necessary to go beyond viewing lexical decomposition as based only on a predetermined set of primitives; rather, what is needed is the conjunction of being able to specify (e.g. by means of sets of predicates) different levels, or perspectives, of lexical representation and being able to compose (via a fixed number of generative devices) these predicates.",
