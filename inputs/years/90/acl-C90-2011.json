        "In this paper, the conventional chart data structure has been augmented for efficient word lattice parsing to handle the high degree of ambiguities encountered in speech recognition applications.",
        "A word lattice is a set of word hypotheses produced by some acoustic signal processor in continuous speech recognition applications which possibly includes problems such as word boundary overlapping, lexical ambiguities, missing or extra phones, recognition uncertainty and errors, etc.",
        "The purpose of parsing such a word lattice is to efficiently and accurately obtain the most promising candidate sentence at acceptable computation complexity by means of grammatical constraints and appropriate data structure design.",
        "For example, in the process of continuous speech recognition, it happened very often that not only more than one words may be produced for a given segment of speech (such as homonyms, especially for some languages with large number of homonyms such as Chinese language (Lee, 1987) ), but many competing word hypotheses can be produced at overlapping, adjoining, or separate segments of the acoustic signal without a set of aligned word boundaries.",
        "This will result in huge number of sentence hypotheses, each of which formed by one combination of a sequence of word hypotheses, such that exhaustively parsing all these sentence hypotheses with a conventional text parser is computational inefficient or even prohibitively difficult.",
        "A really efficient approach is therefore desired.",
        "Several algorithms for parsing such word lattices had been proposed (Tomita, 1986;",
        "Chow, 1989).",
        "These algorithms had been shown to be very efficient in parsing less ambiguous natural languages such as English obtained in speech recognition.",
        "However, all of them are primarily strictly from left-to-right, thus with relatively limited applications for cases in which other strategies such as island-driven (Hayes, 1986) or even right-to-left are more useful (Huang, 1988), for example, corrupted word lattice with extra, missing or erroneous phones in speech recognition (Ward, 1988).",
        "On the other hand, chart has been an efficient working structure widely used in many natural language processing systems and has been shown to be a very effective approach (Kay, 1980), but it is basically designed to parse a sequence of fixed and known words instead of ambiguous word lattice.",
        "In this paper, the conventional chart is therefore extended or augmented such that it is able to represent a word lattice; while the conventional functions, operations and properties of a chart parser as well as some useful extensions such as the use of lexicalized grammars and island-driven parsing will not be affected by the augmentation at all.",
        "Therefore the augmented chart parsing proposed in this paper is a very efficient and attractive parsing scheme for many language processing problems in speech recognition applications.",
        "A word lattice parser based on the augmented chart data structure proposed here has been implemented and tested for Chinese language and the preliminary results are very encouraging.",
        "In the following, Section 2 introduces the concept of the augmented chart and Section 3 describes the mapping procedure to map an input word lattice to the augmented chart.",
        "The parsing scheme and some further extensions are discussed in Sections 4; while some preliminary experimental results are presented in Section 5.",
        "Concluding remarks are finally given in Section 6.",
        "2.",
        "The Augmented Chart The conventional chart parsing algorithm was designed to parse a sequence of words.",
        "In this section the chart is augmented for parsing word lattices.",
        "The purpose is to efficiently and accurately find out all grammatically valid sentence hypotheses and their sentence structures from a given word lattice based on a grammar.",
        "A word lattice W is a partially ordered set of word hypotheses, W = w1,wm } , where each word hypothesis wi, i=1,...,m, is characterized by begin, the beginning point, end, the ending point, cat, the category, phone, the associated phonemes, and name, the word name of the word hypothesis.",
        "These word hypotheses are sorted in the order of their ending points; that is, for every pair of word hypotheses wi and wi, i<j implies end(wi) <= end(wi).",
        "Also, two word hypotheses wi and wi are said to be connected if there is no other word hypothesis located exactly between the boundaries of the two word hypotheses, i.e., if wi wi and there does not exist any other word hypothesis wk such that wi wk LC.w.i, where wi wi iff end(w) <= begin(wi).",
        "A sentence hypothesis is then a sequence of connected word hypotheses selected from the given word lattice, and a sentence hypothesis is grammatical valid only if it can be generated by a grammar.",
        "As an example, a sample word lattice constructed for demonstration purpose is shown on the top of Fig. 1, in which only the word sequence \"Tad does this.\" is a valid sentence hypothesis.",
        "The augmented chart is a directed uncyclic graph specified by a two-tuple <V, E>, where V is a sequence of vertices and E is a set of edges.",
        "Each vertex in V represents an end point of some word hypotheses in the input word lattice, while the edge set",
        "is divided into three disjoint groups: inactive, active and jump edges.",
        "As were used in a conventional chart, an inactive edge is a data structure to represent a completed constituent, while an active edge represents an incomplete constituent which needs some other complete constituents to compose a larger one.",
        "A jump edge, however, is a functional edge which links two different edges to indicate their connection relation (described below) and guide the parser to search through all edges connected to each active edge during parsing.",
        "The partial ordering relation among the edges in the augmented chart can first be defined according to the order of the boundary vertices.",
        "Two edge Ei and Ei are then said to be connected (i.e. EConn(Ei, Ei) = true) only when the end vertex of one of them is the",
        "begin vertex of the other, or there exists a jump edge linking them together.",
        "For example, in the chart representation of the sample word lattice in Fig'.",
        "1 (on the bottom of the figure, the details will be explained in the next section), EConn(E3, E6) = true due to the existence of Jurnp3 linking E3 and E6, but EConn(Ei, Fig.1 In this figure, on the top is a set of overlapped word hypotheses which are assumed to be produced by an acoustic signal processor in speech recognition, where each rectangular shape denotes the time segment of the acoustic signal for the word hypothesis and above it is the 5-tuple information, from left to right, i.e., begin, end, cat, phone and name, respectively; on the middle are the sorted wbp's; and on the bottom is the resulting initial chart.",
        "62 E6) = false due to E3 and E4 existing in between.",
        "This jump edge and the new connection relation is the primary difference between the conventional chart and our augmented chart.",
        "3.",
        "The Mapping from a Word Lattice to the Augmented Chart",
        "Before parsing is performed, any input word lattice has to be mapped to the augmented chart.",
        "At the beginning of the mapping procedure, we have to first consider a situation in which additional word hypotheses should be inserted into the input lattice to avoid any important word being missed in the sentence.",
        "A good example for such situation is in Fig. 2 where the time segment for the word hypothesis wi (the word \"same\") is from 10 to 20, and that for wi (the word \"message\") is from 14 to 30.",
        "Apparently for this situation four cases are all possible: wi is a correct word but wj is not, wj is correct but wi is not, both wi and wj are correct because they share a common phoneme (m) in the co-articulated continuous acoustic signal, or both wi and wi are not correct.",
        "A simple approach to be used here is that two additional word hypotheses wii (also \"same\", but from 10 to 17) and",
        "Now, for each word hypothesis wi , an initial inactive edge can be constructed.",
        "The function Edge(w) for a word hypothesis wi is then exactly specified by the two vertices assigned to the two wbp's of wi , i.e.",
        "Edge(w)< Vertex(begin(wi)), Vertex(end(wi))>.",
        "Finally, for any pair of vertices viand vi, if there isn't any complete initial inactive edge existing between them, a jump edge from vi to vi is constructed to link viand vi.",
        "Using the above procedure, Fig. 1 also shows the mapping results of the sample word lattice.",
        "The sorted wbp's (specified by a time scale and whether it is a beginning or ending wbp) are on the middle of the figure, and the resulting initial chart is on the bottom.",
        "it can be shown that the above mapping procedure has the following nice properties: first, the ordering and connection relations among all word hypotheses in the word lattice can be completely preserved among the corresponding edges in the augmented chart; second, when the input word lattice can be reduced to a simple sequence of word hypotheses, the augmented chart representation can also be reduced to a conventional chart representation.",
        "4.",
        "The Augmented Chart Parsing and Some Further Extensions The fundamental principle of chart parsing is: Whenever an active edge A is connected to an inactive edge I which satisfies A's conditions for extensions, a new edge N covering both is built.",
        "Now, in the augmented chart parsing this principle is still held; except that the inactive edge I doesn't have to share the same vertex with the active edge A; instead it can be separated from the active edge A, as long as there exists a jump edge linking edges A and I.",
        "The augmented chart parsing scheme proposed here is not only very useful and efficient to rule-based grammar applications, but is equally useful and efficient in other applications such as a lexicalized grammar (e.g.",
        "HPSG(Pollard, 1987) ) in which the syntactical relationships are stated as part of the lexical description, and in the augmented chart the structures to be assigned to the input may be extended to attribute-value matrices (complex feature structures) instead of syntactic parsing trees and the recognition algorithm may rely on the head-driven slot and filler principle instead of derivation oriented recognition.",
        "Such an extension is in fact straightforward.",
        "Furthermore, in some other approaches to increase the flexibility of the slot and filler principle, such as island parsing (Stock, 1988) and discontinuous segmented parsing (Hellwig, 1988), the augmented chart proposed here can also be easily extended and applied."

        "In order to see how the above concept for augmented chart parsing works, a bottom-up and left-to-right parser based on the proposed augmented chart (also capable of performing conventional chart parsing) has been implemented and tested in some preliminary experiments.",
        "The test data base includes a large number of Chinese word lattices obtained from an acoustic signal processor which recognizes Mandarin speech.",
        "Due to the existence of large number of homonyms in Chinese language and uncertainty and errors in speech recognition, very high degree of lexical ambiguity exists in the input lattices.",
        "One example of such Chinese word lattice is in Fig. 4.",
        "The results show that, all possible constituents for the input word lattice can be constructed and no any constituent needs to be built more than once using the augmented chart parsing.",
        "According to the experimental results, the edge reduction ratio (the ratio of the total number of edges built in the augmented chart parsing to the total number of edges built in conventional chart parsing) is on the order of 1/30 1/80 for our input Chinese word lattices.",
        "Although this ratio depends seriously on the degree of ambiguity of the input word lattices, the computation complexity can always be reduced significantly.",

        "It is obtained from the Chinese sentence utterance: ni-3 'you' shr-4 'are' yi-2 'a' jia-4 'set' huei-4 'can' tieng-1 'listen to' guo-2 iu-3 'Mandarin' de-5 'which' dian-4 nan-3 'computer' (you are a computer which can listen to Mandarin, %t itt M niTE ), where the syllables are represented in Mandarin Phonetic Symbols II (MPS-II) with the integers (1 to 5) indicating the tone.",
        "The possible word hypotheses are shown above where the horizontal axis denotes the time ordering of the syllables and the vertical scale shows the corresponding word hypotheses for the syllables, in which only those denoted by \"*\" are correct words.",
        "In this example all the syllables are actually clearly identified and correctly recognized and therefore all word hypotheses are in fact well aligned in boundaries, except that two syllables (the first syllable ni-3 and the sixth syllable tieng-1) are confused by a second candidate (li-3 and tiang-1, respectively).",
        "Therefore the ambiguity is primarily due to the large number of homonyms in Chinese language.",
        "The line segments under each word hypothesis indicates whether the word hypothesis is composed of one or two syllables.",
