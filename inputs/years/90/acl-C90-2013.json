        "Syntactic constraints on antecedent-anaphor relations can be stated within the theory of Lexical Functional Grammar (henceforth LFG) through the use of functional uncertainty (Kaplan and Maxwell 1988; Halvorsen and Kaplan 1988; Kaplan and Zaenen 1989).",
        "In the following, we summarize the general characteristics of syntactic constraints on anaphoric binding.",
        "Next, we describe a variation of functional uncertainty called inside-out functional uncertainty and show how it can be used to model anaphoric binding.",
        "Finally, we discuss some binding constraints claimed to hold in natural language to exemplify the mechanism.",
        "We limit our attention throughout to coreference possibilities between definite antecedents and anaphoric elements and ignore interactions with quantifiers.",
        "We also limit our discussion to intrasentential relations.",
        "1 General characteristics of syntactic constraints on anaphoric binding The relation between an anaphor and its antecedent is semantic in nature.",
        "In the simple cases that we limit our attention to here, the two are coreferent.",
        "1 This semantic relation is subject to syntactic constraints, however, and it is the statement of these constraints that we focus on.",
        "In the LFG approach to these constraints proposed in Bresnan et al.",
        "(1985),2 binding conditions are stated as conditions on 1 structure configurations rather than conditions on c-structures.",
        "Two kinds of syntactic fac",
        "tors are shown to influence anaphoric binding possibilities: the grammatical function of the potential antecedent (in particular whether or not it is a subject) and the characteristics of the syntactic domain in which the potential antecedent and the anaphor are found (for example, whether that domain is tensed or whether it has a subject).",
        "In Bresnan et al.",
        "(1985), anaphors are consequently annotated for both domain and antecedent constraints.",
        "Som.e constraints are stated in positive terms: the antecedent must be found within a particular domain or have a particular function.",
        "In other cases the constraints are negative: the antecedent and the anaphor cannot both be part of a particular domain, or the antecedent cannot bear a particular grammatical function.",
        "Under such negative conditions, the anaphor is disjoint in reference from its antecedent.",
        "2 Modeling binding constraints with functional uncertainty F.-structure relations are in some cases not characterizable as a finite disjunction over paths: for example, dependencies between 'fillers' and `gaps' in, for example, relative clauses and wh-questions.",
        "Functional uncertainty was developed for the analysis of such dependencies.",
        "Kaplan and Maxwell (1988) and Kaplan and Zaenen (1989) develop a formal specification of relations involving disjunction over paths by allowing the argument position of functional equations to denote a set of strings.",
        "Suppose a is a (possibly infinite) set of symbol strings; then",
        "(1) (f a) = v holds if and only if a. f = v and e E a, or b.",
        "((f s) Suffis, a)) = v for some symbol s, where Suff(s, a) is the set of suffix strings y such that sy E a.",
        "An equation with a string-set argument holds if and only if it holds for some string in that set.",
        "This kind of equation is trivially unsatisfiable if a denotes the empty set.",
        "If a is a finite set, this formula is equivalent to a finite disjunction of equations over the strings in a.",
        "Passing from finite disjunction to existential quantification enables us to capture the intuition of unbounded uncertainty as an underspecification of exactly which choice of strings in a will be compatible with the functional information carried by the surrounding surface environment.",
        "Kaplan and Zaenen (1989) require that a be drawn from the class of regular languages.",
        "The characterization of uncertainty in a particular grammatical equation can then be stated as a regular expression over the vocabulary of grammatical function names.",
        "Functional uncertainty can also be used in the case of negative constraining equations.",
        "In that situation, the requirement is that there be no path picked out by the regular expression that makes the equation true.",
        "That is, the negation of an expression involving functional uncertainty has the effect of negating an existentially quantified expression.",
        "Kaplan and Zaenen (1989) consider only expressions of the form (f a) where a is a regular expression.",
        "In expressions such as these, a represents a path through the f-structure f. We refer to paths of this type as PathIn, and to functional uncertainty of this type as outside-in functional uncertainty.",
        "In Halvorsen and Kaplan (1988), expressions of the form (af) are introduced.",
        "We will refer to the path in expressions of this form as PathOut, and to functional uncertainty of this type as inside-out functional uncertainty.",
        "Expressions involving inside-out functional uncertainty are interpreted as denoting f-structures from which f is reachable over some path in a.",
        "More formally: (2) (a f) = g E {h ]s E a[(hs) =, f]}",
        "(a f) denotes some f-structure g through which there is a path in the set of strings a leading to f. The equation is a constraining equation checking for the existence of such an f-structure.",
        "Relations between anaphors and their antecedents are also in some cases not characterizable as a finite disjunction of paths within f-structures; for this reason, the use of functional uncertainty in characterizing the anaphor-antecedent relation seems appropriate.",
        "In our view, modeling anaphoric binding constraints consists of specifying a set of f-structure paths relating anaphors with elements that are either possible or disallowed antecedents.",
        "We use inside-out functional uncertainty to characterize the relation between an anaphor and these elements.",
        "To illustrate, the antecedent of the Norwegian anaphor seg must be a subject outside of the minimal complete clause nucleus3 in which seg appears; this antecedent can be at an indefinite distance away from the anaphor, as long as only the highest nucleus in the domain contains a tense marker (Henan 1988; p. 73): (3) Jon bad oss forsake a fa deg til Joni asked us to try to get you to a snakke pent om seg talk nicely about himi Under an LFG analysis, the path between the antecedent and the anaphor in (3) contains three XCOMPs, as diagrammed in Figure 1.",
        "Assume that TA denotes the f-structure for seg, the structure labeled 9 in Figure 1.",
        "The set of nested f-structures containing 9 is characterized by the regular expression",
        "(4) (XCOMP* OBJ IA)",
        "In Figure 1, this set consists of the structures labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.",
        "The expression in (5) designates the subjects of these four f-structures, those labeled 5, 6, 7 and 8:",
        "(5) ((XCOMP* OBJ IA) SUBJ)",
        "F-structures 5, 6, and 7 are the f-structures of the possible antecedents of seg: the subjects outside of the minimal clause nucleus in which seg appears.",
        "F-structure 8 is not a possible antecedent for seg, since it appears in the same minimal clause nucleus as seg; f-structure 8 will",
        "be excluded from the set of possible antecedents for seg by a negative constraint.",
        "More schematically, the set of possible antecedents of an anaphoric phrase can be characterized by an expression of the form in (6):",
        "(6) ((PathOut IA) PathIn)",
        "(PathOut IA) picks out the set of f-structures which contain the anaphor and in which the antecedent must be located.",
        "PathIn characterizes the functional role of the antecedent.",
        "It is a general constraint on antecedent-anaphor relations that the the antecedent, must f-command4 the anaphor; for this reason, the PathIn is always of length one.",
        "The Pathln, then, consists of (and constrains) the grammatical function borne by the antecedent.",
        "Conditions on the binding domain are formal-izable as conditions on the PathOut, since the PathOut characterizes the domain in which both the anaphor and its antecedent are found.",
        "We will look in detail at one such constraint; before doing so, however, we make a simplifying assumption about the semantics of the anaphor-antecedent relation.",
        "In the simple cases we are considering here, the relation is be represented as identity between the semantic content of the anaphor and its antecedent.",
        "Elaboration of this representation would require us to introduce the LFG mechanism of projections (Halvorsen and Kaplan 1988), which is beyond the scope of this paper.",
        "Here we will use the informal notation in (7):",
        "(7) < a > ((PathOut IA) PathIn)=< a >IA",
        "to indicate that the semantics of the anaphor, < o > IA, is to be identified with the semantics of its antecedent.",
        "The material in angle brackets stands for the mapping (not further specified) between the syntax and the semantics.",
        "To prevent the anaphoric element from being contained in its antecedent, we formulate the constraint in (8), where T ANT stands for the f-structure of the antecedent:",
        "(8) [(r ANT GF+) TA]",
        "The effect of this constraint is very similar to the i-within-i condition in Government-Binding Theory (Chomsky 1981).",
        "It has been argued that this constraint should be relaxed (see e.g. Hellan (1988)) but the correct analysis of putative counterexamples is not clear.",
        "We will assume here that the constraint can be maintained.",
        "We now describe how to model a domain constraint that holds of some anaphors: some anaphors must be bound within the minimal complete nucleus – the minimal nucleus containing a subject.",
        "Let F1 designate an f-structure containing the anaphor.",
        "We can characterize F1 in the following way:",
        "(9) F1 = (GF+",
        "where GF denotes the set of grammatical function labels.",
        "For F1 to be a valid binding domain for anaphors subject to this constraint, it must not contain any smaller f-structure that properly contains the anaphor and a subject.",
        "That is, F1 must be the smallest complete nucleus.",
        "We will define DPF (`domain path f-structure') as any of the f-structures that contain the anaphor and are properly contained in F1:",
        "The constraint that an anaphor must be bound within the minimal complete nucleus can, then, be stated as follows:",

        "< > GF) =< cr >IA b.",
        "--1(DPF1 SUBJ)",
        "These two equations ensure identity between the semantic content of the anaphor and its antecedent, where the antecedent is the value of some GF of an f-structure F1 that contains the anaphor.",

A more interesting case arises when a binding relation is subject to both a negative and a positive constraint.",

        "This is because Martin appears outside the binding domain of honom sjalv and is thus not considered when either positive or negative binding constraints are applied.",

        "If the domain and the antecedent binding requirements for an anaphor are both positive or both negative, the requirements must be satisfied by the same element.",
