        "Both in formal semantics and in NLP, the issue of (pro)nominal reference has aroused much interest.",
        "Formal discourse semantics was mainly inspired by the Discourse Representation Theory developed by Kamp (1981) and, the closely related, File Change Semantics (Heim, 1982).",
        "In standard DRT, hardly any restrictions were imposed on the relation between antecedent and anaphor.",
        "This contrasts strongly with work clone in the NLP area.",
        "Knowledge of the world and intricate inferences play key roles in restricting the number of antecedents for anaphora.",
        "Insights from artificial intelligence, linguistics and psychology are all integrated into complex procedures.",
        "The model I will describe in this paper considers the linguistic context as a means to restrict the large number of interpretations that an expression in principle has to a limited number of alternatives.",
        "Knowledge of the world and/or preference of one alternative to the others may only restrict the domain further, never stretch it.",
        "This view will be defended in the paper.",
        "The former limitation is discussed under the name of 'possible' analyses, the latter is christened 'preferred' analyses.",
        "I will first introduce the model in the next section.",
        "Sections 4 and 5 will motivate the approach and compare it to other proposals.",
        "Section 6 will describe and discuss the so-called associative anaphora and show that the model adopted can be extended to non-standard anaphoric reference as well."

        "The model makes a distinction between possible and preferred antecedents for a particular anaphor.",
        "The wellformedness definition below expresses the relation between an anaphor and its possible antecedents.",
        "Key notions in the definition are compatibility and recency.",
        "The units referred to in the definition relate to units in the discourse.",
        "The data structure re",
        "fleets the structure .of the text, be it that only current units show internal structure.",
        "Figure 1 pictures the state of affairs at the time the 4th sentence in chapter 3, paragraph 3 of a book is being processed.",
        "The current chapter, paragraph and sentence show substructure, the others have no internal structure at all.' Recency and compatibility are the central notions in the definition.",
        "The notion of recency needs no further explanation.",
        "Its importance for anaphora resolution has been demonstrated convincingly by Hobbs (1978).",
        "Compatibility demands agreement of linguistic features relevant to anaphora resolution.. Pronoun resolution signals the need for features such as category, person, number, gender and humanness.",
        "Definite NP resolution requires a more sophisticated mechanism.",
        "It should also be able to recognize relations such as synonymy, hyperonymy etc.",
        "Besides the wellformedness definition, one might want to adopt preference rules to select a (small set of) preferred antecedent(s) from the set of possible ones.",
        "I will not particularly be concerned with the preference rules in this paper, though I do foresee two areas that will determine the nature of these rules.",
        "The first is world knowledge.",
        "In some cases, only extremely complex inferences can decide between two linguistically equally preferred antecedents.",
        "The second is anaphoric preference.",
        "An anaphor sometimes prefers an object to a subject or a pronoun to a full NP, everything else being equal.",
        "The truth is 1 The model unintendedly suggests that the units are syntactic in nature and in linear order.",
        "A more realistic picture includes semantic units and substructures, as argued for by a.o.",
        "Grosz(1977), Scha et.al.",
        "(1988) that everything else seldom is equal.",
        "Preference is very subtle and influenced by factors like sub-language, style etc.",
        "The discussion to follow will mainly be concerned with possible antecedents."

      "heading": "4 Motivation",
      "text": [
        "The approach claims that anaphoric resolution is a two-stage procedure.",
        "The first stage determines the possible antecedents by means of the linguistically defined notions of compatibility and recency.",
        "The second stage consists of the calculation of preferred antecedents.",
        "I will first argue why the distinction between possible and preferred is important.",
        "And second, I will motivate why the definition of possible antecedents is expressed in terms of the notions compatibility and recency.",
        "The distinction possible vs. preferred is considered essential for the following reasons.",
        "First, it is a means to determine whether a discourse is coherent or not, from the anaphoric point of view.",
        "Consider what happens when an antecedent is selected but needs to be rejected because of information later in the discourse.",
        "As the meanings of terms like possible/impossible suggest, there is no way that we can backtrack on an initially possible antecedent in favour of an antecedent that is not part of the set of possible ones.",
        "Compare the following two discourses: (1) John was late for his appointment with Joe Fortunately, Joe was even later His work had kept him from leaving in time He, on the other hand, had missed the bus 2",
        "(2) John was late for his appointment with Mary Fortunately, Mary was even later His work had kept him from leaving in time She, on the other hand, had missed the bus Discourse (1) is clearly incoherent whereas (2) is acceptable.",
        "The reasons are purely linguistic.",
        "The definition of possible antecedents above stated that some antecedents are not accessible to a pronoun because of other intermediate compatible antecedents.",
        "Only the latter are possible candidates.",
        "When the continuation of the discourse makes clear that they were not the right antecedents after all, the discourse should be considered incoherent.",
        "A preferred antecedent, however, may be rejected later on in the discourse in favour of one that was not preferred, merely possible.",
        "An algorithm that merges possible and preferred is not able to make this distinction.",
        "The second motivation for maintaining the possible/preferred distinction is provided by (linguistic) ambiguity in the language.",
        "Consider (3) and the examples cited in Winograd(1972), (4) vs. (5).",
        "(3) The women met their husbands at a party They were very young at the time (4) The city councillors refused the demonstrators a permit because they feared violence (5) The city councillors refused the demonstrators a permit because they advocated violence",
        "Discourse (3) is three-way ambiguous and it is vague which of the meanings is intended.",
        "Blurring the distinction between preferred and possible antecedents right away contradicts the intuition that all three antecedents in the first sentence might serve as antecedents for the pronoun but not any NP that was mentioned before this utterance.",
        "The examples (4) and (5) serve to show that linguistically possible is essentially different from possible as regards 'the world'.",
        "Assuming that no NLP-system, nor any human discourse participant by the way, has rich enough information to infer all essentials at the right time (yet), this approach at least yields a reliable, and finite, set of possible candidates.",
        "Having shown that the distinction between well-formed and preferred antecedent-anaphor relations is necessary, it remains to be shown why possible antecedents are defined by means of the simple notions of compatibility and recency.",
        "The explanation is quite simple: they seem to yield the right results.",
        "It is well-known that full definite NPs are in general further apart from their antecedents than pronouns are.",
        "Now consider that definite NPs, in general again, have more descriptive content than pronouns do.",
        "It follows that pronouns may be compatible with antecedents that definite NPs do not match with.",
        "Together with the notion of recency, compatibility then explains why the antecedents of definite NPs may be at quite a distance.",
        "This only holds for definite NPs that have ample descriptive content though.",
        "An underspecified definite NP like 'the man' behaves similarly to the pronoun 'he'.",
        "Both will accept the most recently mentioned male individual(s) as their possible antecedent(s).",
        "So, the number of units that the anaphor may search to find its antecedent is dynamic rather than static.",
        "Consider discourse (1) versus (2) again.",
        "A static number of sentences would not explain the difference.",
        "The pronouns in (1) behave similar to those in (2) and yet, one of the two is incoherent.",
        "The reason is that `John' in (1) is not accessible because of the intervening NP `Joe'.",
        "The NP 'Mary' in (2) does not block reference to 'John' because 'Mary' is not compatible with the same anaphor."

        "the topic of anaphora resolution.",

        "Note, however, that the members on this list are substantially different from the possible antecedents described in this paper.",
        "Potential antecedents in the Focusing Approach are not determined by the descriptive content of the anaphor but rather by what the discourse makes available for further reference.",
        "Suppose a sentence yields 'the pump' and 'the men' as available antecedents.",
        "They will he on the list from which a subsequent pronoun, say 'they', selects its antecedent.",
        "The difference is that 'the pump' may be potential in the Focusing Approach but in no way 'possible' in the sense I used the term.",
        "Moreover, all potential antecedents in the Focusing Approach may be rejected in favour of an antecedent selected by a more global mechanism.",
        "This means that even the function of Sidner's list of potential antecedents in the discourse model differs from mine.",
        "I claim that failure in finding a co-referent on the list of possible antecedents corresponds to incoherence of the discourse.",
        "The list employed in the Focusing Approach has no such function.",

        "The pronoun is anaphoric.",
        "Given the notion of compatibility and the fact that empty pronouns have no descriptive content at all, they are predicted to be compatible with any NP.",
        "Combining it with the notion of recency, it means that the set of possible antecedents consists of all and only the NPs in the most recent unit.",
        "To see whether this is correct, compare the following examples: (7) I drove by our house in my car The windows were dirty (8) I drove by our house in my car I saw my father's car The windows were dirty (9) I drove by our house in my car I saw my father's bicycle The windows were dirty (10) I drove by our house in my car The windows were dirty The front door was open In (7), both 'our house' and 'my car' are possible antecedents for the associative anaphor in the second sentence of the discourse.",
