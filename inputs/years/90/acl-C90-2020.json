        "The KALIPSOS prototype we have.",
        "developed at the IBM Paris Scientific Center is able to analyze texts written in French and to produce a semantic representation of these texts expressed as a set of interrelated Conceptual Graphs [6, 1].",
        "It uses a semantic lexicon which contains, for each word to be defined, one or more Conceptual Graphs corresponding to one or more meanings of the word.",
        "The KALIPSOS question/answering system analyzes a Natural language query, translates it into Conceptual Graphs, performs pattern matching and deduction on these text graphs to select the answer, and finally generates a Natural Language answer from the selected answer graphs.",
        "We do not detail this KALIPSOS system here because many papers have already been published on it (see the references).",
        "We have chosen to present recent work [5] which has been done on building a large concept hierarchy from an existing published dictionary.",
        "More precisely, we have synthesized a large semantic network by selecting hyperonym definitions from the \"Dictionnaire du 1,,outhulaire essentiel - Les 5000 mots fondamcn-taux\" (G. Matore, Larousse, Paris 1963) and coding them as a set of Prolog clauses available for the KALIPSOS system.",
        "Concept type hierarchy and hyperonymy First., we must remind you how the concept type hierarchy is the necessary basis for any use of the Conceptual Graph model.",
        "The reader may of course refer to [6].",
        "In the Conceptual Graph model, the concept types are not supposed to he words but abstract symbols (atoms) used to denote a concept.",
        "For example, we could have COMMUNICATION-PROCESS as the concept type that occurs in the definition of the verbs \"to say\", \"to communicate\", \"to discuss\", etc.",
        "In the same way, a polysemic word like \"bat\" should point on distinct graphs containing STICK and ANIMAL as primitive concept types.",
        "It appears that the concept type hierarchy must also contain chains like: Such a concept type hierarchy is necessary to define the pattern matching algorithms on Conceptual Graphs which are used to build a graph from a Natural Language sentence by joining the Conceptual Graphs of its parts.",
        "It is also necessary lo encode and to verify the preference semantics constraints in the semantic lexicon.",
        "The concept hierarchy is the basis for the join a.nd projection algorithms [3, 6] which provide a way to disambiguate the Natural Language complex sentences and to perform query/answering on.",
        "Conceptual Graphs.",
        "In the present work, we consider that concept types may generally he identified to word senses.",
        "Thus, the word \"bat\" points on concept types BATA and BAT.2 and BAT.1 < STICK, 13AT.2 < ANIMAL, is stored in the hierarchy (STICK and ANIMAL being the concept types associated to the main meanings of the words \"stick\" and \"animal\").",
        "This implies that the synthesis of a large concept type hierarchy is related to the selection of correct hyperonyms.",
        "We give here the logical interpretation of the hyperonymy relation between the words with meanings w 1 and w2, derived from the one given in [4]:",
        "where: S(w) stands for a sentence containing an occurrence of w, S(w2/w 1) stands for the sentence S(w2) in which the occurrence of w2 is replaced by wl.",
        "p is the usual logical implication.",
        "For example, ANIMAL is hyperonym of DOG because all assertions about a particular dog remain true when we substitute \"the animal\" for \"the clog\".",
        "Of course, this criterion is not always verified in a such formal way.",
        "It is only a guideline.",
        "In a Natural Language dictionary, the Natural language definitions may be classified into a typology, as in [4].",
        "For example, all the definitions of the form NP VI' may he hyperonym definitions, as in:",
        "'elephant': a very large animal with two tusks and a trunk with which...",
        "But NP VP definitions may also be meta definitions, as in: 'beget': old use to become the father of or, as an example in French: 'etre': mot qui denote la faculte d'exister.",
        "In this paper, we have tried to translate the definitions into English to make it easier to read, but our French dictionary (5,000 entries) uses simpler definitions than the I,ongman dictionary.",
        "This is the reason why the reader will not find a perfect match when referring to the Longman.",
        "Furthermore, this work depends on the particular dictionary (Matore I.,arousse) we adopted but the important fact is that the result we have built is coherent and correct."

      "heading": "The method",
      "text": [
        "The method was mainly empirical: it was not so clear that the information contained in the dictionary would be useful for synthesizing a large and coherent concept hierarchy.",
        "We will return to this important point later.",
        "But we must .",
        "add that the building of a large concept hierarchy from natural language definitions has limits.",
        "For example, it cannot be a simple hierarchy but a hierarchy in which the links are labeled by conceptual relations like part-of, set-of, etc.",
        "Another limit is that the theoretical transitivity of the hyperonymy relation can only he verified on a chain of word senses if the chain is not too long.",
        "It .should he noted that we were particularly interested in the top part of the hierarchy, i.e. in the list of the basic concepts from which all the others may be derived.",
        "The method, a bottom-up one, was carried out in the following stages: I.",
        "'The hyperonymy definitions were selected from the dictionary (by hand).",
        "2.",
        "The meanings of the words, in the entries and in the definitions, were distinguished by introducing a coherent subscript notation for the current word and the main noun of its definition (by hand).",
        "3.",
        "'The relation between the current meaning of the word and its hyperonym were encoded as a Prolog clause (by hand).",
        "4.",
        "Loops were suppressed by the application of Prolog consistency checking programs that introduced an additional synonymous relation between concepts.",
        "We mean here that when w 1 < w2 and w2 < w I are found, we declare as a Prolog clause that SYNONYM(wl,w2).",
        "5.",
        "Prolog programs were applied to the result in order to display it in a suitable way (see appendices A and B), and to have associative access to this data from Prolog.",
        "There is a difference between simple hyperonym definitions and compound hyperonym definitions.",
        "A simple hyperonym definition has the syntactic pattern VP..., or RELATIVE-CLAUSE...",
        "In this case we choose N as the hyperonym of the current word, if it is a correct hyperonym.",

        "This last case implies that the result is more than a simple hierarchy: from a formal point of view it is a semantic network because of the use of primitive relations ACT-OF, PART-OF, SET-OF etc.",

        "It appears that in a chain w 1 < w2 < < wn, it is possible to consider that each relation wi < wi + 1 is justified.",
        "Nevertheless, it is more difficult to justify w 1 < wn.",

        "In this chain, each contiguous relation is justified, but to justify the link between 'grave' and part-of(space) requires specifying the point of view that is taken.",
