        "Among current syntactic theories, Generalized Phrase Structure Grammars (GPSG) [4] provide an appealing solution for describing natural languages with their modular system of composite categories, rules, constraints and feature propagation principles.",
        "As other highly modular systems, GPSG is plagued by the difficulty of designing an efficient algorithm for combining its various components into an executable program.",
        "Recent attempts to solve this problem have followed different lines of research.",
        "One solution [9] rests on the almost equivalence between GPSG and Context-Free Grammars (CF).",
        "In this framework, GPSG rules, metarules and constraints on well-formed categories and local trees are transformed before any parsing took place into an equivalent set of CF productions for which various efficient parsing methods already exist.",
        "In theory, this method has the advantage of preserving the nice expressive properties of GPSG while leading to a par-sable grammar.",
        "Though, the method is clearly Unpractical in the case of real grammars due to the enormous number of categories and local trees which must be considered prior to the filtering by the other modules.",
        "A related yet more realistic method [9] follows the same strategy of compiling GPSG into another grammar description language for which there exist parsing algorithms.",
        "In this case, the target language [6] has a CF skeleton but is augmented through feature descriptions which provide a natural mapping from GPSG categories.",
        "Here the difficulty lies for the linguist in the expression of the grammar in the target language since there exist no algorithm to compile automatically the GPSG grammar.",
        "Another set of approaches [1,7,8] attempt to build from scratch a parsing strategy which is suited to GPSG or rather to a modified version of it.",
        "The modifications are (sometimes) motivated by linguistic arguments, e.g. enhancing the expressive power, but first to render GPSG computationaly tractable at the expense of some of its distinctive features.",
        "The last class of methods [2,12] try to take GPSG as it is and to design a parsing algorithm which is not only sound but also complete with respect to the theory.",
        "Then the difficulty lies in the efficiency of the parser.",
        "The method described in this paper belongs to this category.",
        "Several principles contribute to its efficiency.",
        "First, it is based on a bidirectional chart parser, which, together with the advantages of conventional chart parsing, is well suited to both the ID/LP decomposition and the particular role devoted to head constituants.",
        "Second, the various constraints used in GPSG (linear precedence, head feature convention, foot feature principle) are viewed as a set of constraints which are applied as soon as possible, when necessary, to shorten the development of unproductive hypotheses.",
        "Third, the constraints are precompiled into a connection graph which minimizes the computation of category subsumption done at run time.",
        "And, fourth, the rule invocation strategy is bottom-up and head-driven in that the only de",
        "mentary active edges created bottom-up in the chart are those corresponding to head constituants.",
        "This strategy allows the FFP and the HFC to be brought into use at the time active edges are created and, consequently, by instantiating very soon a maximum of the foot and head features of dominating categories, to detect violations of constraints long before constituents are completed."

        "Conventional chart parsing techniques [5] avoid redoing identical parses for grammars having a context free basis.",
        "In the case of GPSG, these techniques could be straightforwardly customized to accommodate ID rules.",
        "This would result in a strategy where an active edge would be created for each category in a rule extending a given inactive edge, be it a head daughter or not.",
        "When one considers the goal of having uninteresting parses fail as soon as possible, it becomes important to make head daughters come into play first.",
        "This is because they activate a maximum of constraints on their mother categories by the percolation of features through the RFC and FFP.",
        "In order to build local ID trees around their head daughters, the strategy should not force the first constituent attached to an edge to be its leftmost one.",
        "We use bidirectional chart parsing [11] because it relaxes this constraint.",
        "This technique has been first proposed in the context of speech recognition where island parsing is made advantageous because lexical interpretations are weighed by plausibility factors.",
        "Its proponents remarked that it could also be well suited to linguistic theories sharing the notion of head constituent, like GPSG.",
        "This intuition was confirmed by the comparison we made on several chart parsing strategies (see section 6 \"Implementation\").",
        "In order to fit the ID/LP decomposition, each edge of the bidirectional chart must have the following structure : Start : the leftmost position of the edge; End : the rightmost position; Rule a pointer to the associated ID rule; Match : a bit vector indicating those Category: members in the LHS of Rule with Daughters : an extension attached to the edge; the category of the edge; the list of daughter categories.",
        "Thus an edge is active just in case all bits of Match are set to 1.",
        "New edges are created in two manners.",
        "Some are formed when an inactive edge is an extension of a head category in an ID rule (rule 1).",

        "Since the whole process is initialized by extending lexical inactive edges, the only categories possible for non-lexical edges am extensions of rule LHSs.",
        "In addition, LP and FCR constraints only concern categories being an extension of respectively both categories in a LP statement or the left category in a FCR constraint.",
        "It is then possible to remark that the constraints that should be verified on a category A are inherited from the constraints to be verified on the category 13 category A stems from.",
        "This is because for A to be an extension of a category C it is necessary that B may be unified with C. In the same way, inactive edges of category A may only become daughters in local trees whose associated ID rile features a category B in their LI-IS such that A is an extension of B.",
        "Thus determining the ID rules by which elementary edges could be created under the application of rule 1 to an inactive edge may be seen as inheriting these ID rules from the categories of edges leading to it by the recursive application of rule 2 (extension).",
