        "Within the past decade; several developmental robustness approaches have been forwarded: Syntax-free semantic parsing [1] constraint relaxation after parse failure in a pattern matching [2] or ATN framework [3,4], parse tree fitting [5] and several non-formalized case frame approaches (e.g. the parser series in [6,7]).",
        "Three approaches [5,8,9] account for special defectivities by extending grammatical coverage.",
        "This paper reformulates the so-called weakness approach, first published in [10], which extends robustness to declarative parsing formalisms.",
        "There are serious shortcomings in robustness research, emerging from the common view of robustness as a parsing and not as a representation problem.",
        "Typically, two distinct representation levels for grammatical and non-grammatical language are assumed.",
        "The former is given by the basic framework, the latter by relaxed pattern slots [2] or ATN arc tests [3], by \"non-grammatical\" meta-rules [4], by some construction specific strategies [6,7] or by the schema mechanism [11].",
        "While formalism syntax is sometimes speciiied (e.g. [4,10]), a semantics of robust i.ra.tittnar formalisms, being necessary to define these two representation levels, has not been given yet.",
        "'Without a well-defined formalism semantics, it is impossible to predict the behaviour of a (robust) grammar fragment when applied to non-grammatical language.",
        "Therefore, no robustness methodology has been available until now."
