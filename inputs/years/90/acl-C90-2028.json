        "In any system for Natural Language Processing having a dictionary, the question arises which entries are included in it.",
        "In this paper, I will assume the environment of a multilingual MT system based on a linguistic analysis and transfer architecture, from which I will derive some argumentation.",
        "The question which entries are included in the dictionary should be answered in two parts.",
        "First there is a mapping from graphic words to lexical units (lu's), then a mapping from lu's to readings, each of which is represented in an entry.",
        "The former mapping represents a certain level of analysis of the graphic word.",
        "It abstracts away from inflection and spelling variation, and, depending on the system's analysis component, may do so as well for productive *I would like to thank my colleagues at the university and in Eurotra, especially Louis des Tombe and Henk Verkuyl, for their helpful comments.",
        "derivation and compounding, and multi-word units.",
        "In this paper I will concentrate on the latter mapping, reading distinction, in a way that does not appeal to a particular choice on the relation between lu and graphic word.",
        "A consistent approach to reading distinction is necessary, because inconsistencies in reading distinction in an MT system will complicate transfer components between a pair of languages, and jeopardize extensibility of the system.",
        "A correct solution will save time in development and improve performance.",
        "The central question in this area can be formulated as in (1).",
        "(1) Given an lu X and two of its senses S1 and S2, is X ambiguous or vague with respect to S1 and S2 ?",
        "In (1) a sense of an lu is the meaning the lu has in a certain set of contexts.",
        "If the lu is vague, both senses are covered by the same reading.",
        "If it is ambiguous, S1 and 52 are examples of different readings of the lu, each reading being represented in a single entry."

      "text": [
        "Since every reading distinction creates lexical ambiguity that has to be solved, it seems attractive to use the features expressing the relevant information as criterion for answering (1): An lu is ambiguous between S1 and 52 iff there is a feature describing the difference.",
        "If we only take morphological and syntactic features, many intuitively clear cases of ambiguity (e.g. bank as financial institution vs. as",
        "river verge) cannot be expressed.",
        "This will lead to problems in transfer or in generation.",
        "On the other hand, these features will cause unwanted distinctions as well, e.g. French fonetionnaire (civil servant) with gender masculine or feminine, and kneel with past tense kneeled or knelt.",
        "It makes no sense to try to disambiguate these.",
        "The use of semantic features to define ambiguity should be rejected for similar reasons.",
        "First, we have to determine a fixed set of features a. priori, since otherwise no answers to questions of reading distinction evolve.",
        "This imposes an artificial upper bound on reading distinction.",
        "Moreover, the availability of a certain feature does not mean that it has to be assigned in all cases.",
        "We will certainly have a feature expressing the male/female contrast, but it is not desirable to create two readings of parent accordingly, leading to a translation of parents into something meaning mother(s) and/or father(s).",
        "Alternatively, we could argue that, since translation is the goal, it should be the cri-terium for reading distinction as well, answering (1): An lu having two senses is ambiguous if there are different translations for the two senses.",
        "Leaving aside the non-trivial problem of determining whether there are different translations, we have to admit that there are cases of exceptional distinctions in one language, e.g. Ileum vs. rivieir in French, meaning river ending in a sea or in another river respectively.",
        "These distinctions will influence all other dictionaries in the system, in the sense that e.g. English river and Dutch rivier be.",
        "conic ambiguous, and there are two translation rules between them.",
        "If we restrict our attention to a limited group of languages, e.g. the languages in the system, the system becomes difficult to extend, since adding a. new language from outside this group will affect all existing dictionaries.",
        "Otherwise there is a conceptual problem, since it will never be possible to decide that an lu is vague, unless we know all languages of the world.",
        "Instead, cases of exceptional distinctions, bilingual ambiguities, are best handled in transfer between the two languages, because they really are translation problems.",
        "Summarizing, taking the means (features) or the goal (translation) as a criterium for reading distinction results in decisions that cause various practical problems and are intuitively incorrect.",
        "Furthermore these strategies detach the notion of reading from meaning, which is theoretically undesirable.",
        "Taking only intuitions as our guide will link reading to meaning, but if even trained intuitions of lexicographers do not prevent inconsistencies, as can be seen in many published dictionaries, there is not much hope of reaching consistency, unless we manage to find some support for the intuitions."

        "The tests I will propose here to decide on reading distinction are based on monolingual meaning, and yield a substantially greater degree of consistency than direct, unaided intuitions.",

        "In order to be able to check the results, we will first consider some tests where specific processes in P are used, as applied to some intuitively clear cases of ambiguity (e.g. bank as financial institution vs. river verge) and vagueness (e.g. elephant as Indian elephant vs. African elephant).",
