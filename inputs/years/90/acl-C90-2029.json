        "In the field of natural language analysis, Unification Grammars are a main research topic.",

        "Knowing the formalism of Tree Adjoining Grammars (in the following called TAGS in short), which is closely related to context-free grammars (in the following abbreviated CFG), the idea arises to replace the context-free grammar in a Unification Grammar by a TAG.",
        "The advantage of TAGs is that complete context-free derivation trees or parts of them build the rules of that grammar type (e.g., with the intention of representing a whole linguistic phenomenon).",
        "The recursion operation for TAGs allows the replacement of nodes by a tree (defined by a TAG-rule), so that larger structure trees are processed.",
        "In the literature, a first definition for combining these two formalisms was proposed, where the main idea is to separate the two recursion processes - adjoining and unification - to preserve all properties of both.",
        "Here a different approach is chosen, where both recursion processes are integrated.",
        "The main point to emphasize here is that the different approaches not only represent a switch between two modes of interpreting the same definition, but a change in the properties of the resulting formalism.",
        "This can he simply demonstrated by the property of monotonicity of the unification.",
        "Associated with each tree of a TAG all specification rules for the unification are interpreted at once (e.g., represented as links between the DAG representation of the specification rules at each node in the tree).",
        "If now the recursion process of TAGs, the adjoining operation, combines two trees, which both have DAGs, a strategy for reinterpretation of specification information must be defined, because an adjoining modifies inner nodes, where links still arc installed.",
        "In the following, the two formalisms are briefly revisited to have a common terminological basis with the reader, before the existing definition of Tree Adjoining Grammars with Unification is presented.",
        "In contrast to this approach, the new definition is motivated and its properties are discussed.",
        "Finally, our experience with an implementation of that definition in the application domain of syntax analysis (e.g., in a natural language dialogue system) is summarized."

      "text": [
        "In 1975, the formalism of Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAGs) was introduced by Aravind K. Joshi, Leon S. Levy and Masako Takahashi (see [Joshi et al.",
        "751).",
        "Since then, a wide variety of properties - formal properties as well as linguistically relevant ones - were studied (see, e.g., [Joshi 851 for a good overview).",
        "The following example describing the crossed dependencies in Dutch should illustrate the formalism (see Figure 1, where the node numbers written in slanted font should be ignored here, they make sense in combination with Figure 3).",
        "A TAG is a tree generation system.",
        "It consists of two different sets of trees, which are combinable.",
        "Intuitively, the set of initial trees can be seen as context-free derivation trees.",
        "This means, the start symbol is the root node, all inner nodes are nonterminals and all leaves are terminals (e.g., in Figure 1 tree a).",
        "The second set, the auxiliary trees, which can replace a node in an initial tree (which is possibly modified by further adjoinings) during the process of adjoining, must have a form that again a derivation tree results.",
        "The trees Q1 and [32 demonstrate that restriction.",
        "A special leaf (the foot node) must exist, labelled with the same nonterminal as the root node is labelled with.",
        "Further, it is obligatory that an auxiliary tree derives at least one terminal.",
        "The union of the initial and the auxiliary trees, so to speak the set of rules of a TAG, is called the set of elementary trees.",
        "The most obvious property of TAG rules (elementary trees), which arises from the close relation with context-free derivation trees - with which linguists are familiar - is the easy way to write and understand such rules.",
        "The advantage instead of a context-free grammar producing the derivation trees is that related facts can be described in one rule.",
        "E.g., in Figure 1, each tree contains exactly the dependent pieces without any further processing (for more examples see, e.g., [Kroch, Joshi 85]).",
        "With the close relation between TAGs and CFGs, one can think that both formalisms are equivalent.",
        "But TAGs are more powerful.",
        "In the linguistic community, it is discussed controversially, how powerful a linguistic formalism should be (see, e.g., Pullum 84] or [Shieber 85]).",
        "TAGs are mildly context-sensitive, which means that they can describe some context-sensitive languages, but not all (e.g., www with w e {a,b}*, but ww is acceptable for a TAG).",
        "There is the thesis that natural language can be described very well by a mildly context-sensitive formalism.",
        "But this can only be empirically confirmed by describing difficult linguistic phenomenons (here, the example in Figure 1 can only give an idea for the appropriateness of TAGs for natural language description).",
        "If an efficient implementation of a parser for TAGs is desired (e.g., in a natural language access system to an expert system), the existence of polynomial time acceptors for the word problem of TAGs becomes relevant (upper time bound 0(0' log n), see [Harbusch 89]).",
        "On the basis of this efficient algorithm the new definition has been implemented which is mentioned later in the summary.",
        "With this short impression of some advantages of the TAG formalism, the disadvantages should now be tackled.",
        "The main property, which has its roots in the close relation to context-free grammars, is the same problem with subcategorisation.",
        "Further information encoded in the category name leads to combinatory explosion of the grammar.",
        "In the framework of CFGs, this disadvantage is removed by defining a Unification Grammar extending a context-free grammar."

        "To allow this property to be interpreted without failure, which is desirable for Elie idea of defining a filter via adjoining, a computation of such parts of paths in the adjoined tree is done to find the maximal extension of the path, behind which the value can be added without producing a fail.",
