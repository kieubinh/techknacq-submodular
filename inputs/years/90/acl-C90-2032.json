        "Conventional NLP systems often use ad hoc or extremely large knowledgebases (pragmatic / semantic / commonsense) to eliminate ambiguities.",
        "Such systems are too slow and sometimes provide incomplete analyses.",
        "They have the further handicap that very large knowledgebases are needed.",
        "Asking the user for confirmation [Nishida 1982] is a practical solution to get correct parse-trees, but this confirmation is not useful for further computations.",
        "A practical NLP system should produce accurate results automatically while using a simple method and simple knowledge.",
        "Preference models [Petitpierre 1987, Lass 1983, Schubert 1984], such as preference semantics, scoring, and syntactic preference are good candidates for a practical NLP system, because these models utilize simple ready-made knowledge like semantic markers or case frame dictionaries.",
        "The most difficult problem with preference models is the selection of the most appropriate preference knowledge that will induce a correct interpretation.",
        "However, preference knowledge extracted from a large corpus or an on-line dictionary [Jensen 1987] induces preference knowledge conflicts which block complete disambiguation.",
        "To solve this problem, we introduce Document oriented Preference Sets(DoPS).",
        "The concept of DoPS is that to determine the most appropriate preference knowledge, preference knowledge be segregated into several domains, for example, language domain, field domain, and sentence domain, each of which has a different execution priority.",
        "By using the segregated preference knowledge in the fixed order, the most plausible interpretation can be obtained more rapidly and more accurately."

        "Syntactic rules are capable of producing many sentence parse-trees.",
        "These parse-trees are syntactically correct, but most are incorrect from the view points of semantic meaning, contextual meaning, common-sense, specific field knowledge.",
        "It is necessary to use appropriate knowledge (semantic / contextual / commonsense / specific field) to eliminate the incorrect interpretations.",
        "For example, consider passage 1 of Figure 1.",
        "There are two possible interpretations for the gerund-phrase attachment.",
        "temperature coefficients, not circuits.",
        "However if specific field knowledge is lacking, it is difficult to determine which is correct.",
        "The notion of the DoPS is to utilize preference knowledge which can be extracted from other sentences of the target document or other documents.",
        "Documents sometimes contain paraphrases and the same or similar expressions.",
        "These expressions can contain several kinds of knowledge (semantic / contextual / commonsense / specific field).",
        "Sentence disambiguation can be based on such knowledge.",
        "For example, from passage 2 (which was written in another part of the target sentence(1)), it is clear that the coefficient of voltage-temperature is a property of the battery, thus the beginning of sentence (1) can be disambiguated.",
        "This notion will be useful for any NLP stage, but it will be especially useful for dependency structure analysis.",
        "A DoPS is a collection of plausible combinations of phrases or words.",
        "To eliminate conflicts of preference knowledge, a hierarchical structure of preference knowledge is adopted in the DoPS.",
        "Figure 2 shows a hierarchical structure of a DoPS.",
        "The domains are, in order of increasing priority, language, application, field, author, document, paragraph, and sentence.",
        "several documents in the same field.",
        "We consider that the knowledge associations held in the document, paragraph, sentence domains are more reliable than those in other domains.",
        "DoPS entries of document, paragraph, sentence domains are acquired from the target document during the analysis, others can be prepared before analysis.",
        "For example, in Figure 3, if the author of document B. is the same as document A, same DoPS entries of author, field, application, language domains are used in the analysis.",
        "Other domains, that is, sentence, paragraph, document domain are acquired during the analysis.",
        "The language domain in a DoPS contains general language preference extracted from a large database, such as a word corpus or on-line dictionary.",
        "In the application domain (e.g. patent claim sentences, news papers, editorials, manuals), there exists application dependent phrases or word relations.",
        "In the field domain (e.g. electrical engineering, chemistry, agriculture), there exists field specific phrases or word relations.",
        "The author domain include author's characteristics as shown in his writing.",
        "A author often write on",
        "In Figure 1 , since passage 2 is disambiguous, the DoPS system extracts two entries (Entry 3 and Entry 4) listed below.",
        "The DoPS entries are similar to the dependency relationships in dependency grammar, but two expansions have been made: semantic expansion coordination expansion Semantic expansion ensures that for efficient use of DoPS, the dependency relationships will be expanded into semantic dependency relationships.",
        "In passage 3, the entry 3 is extracted as a dependency relation between instances.",
        "These will be semantically expanded by using an ordinary thesaurus dictionary(e.g. Roget's thesaurus).",
        "For example, the thesaurus category number of \"battery\" is 160 and the broader-word is \"POWER\".",
        "This means the word \"battery\" is a member of a word group named ''POWER\".",
        "This word group contains \"power pack\", \"charger\", \"condenser\", and so on.",
        "It is assumed that the same dependency relation will be valid for other members of the same word group.",
        "Passage 5 can be validate by entry 3 from passage 3. passage 5: This condenser iÂ§.",
        "charged automatically.",
        "(sem:160 POWER) (sem:54 STORAGE) ;\"condenser\" is the same word group as ;\"battery\" The other expansion is to exchange the intermediary expressions (usually prepositional words or verb).",
        "The transformation rules of intermediary expressions will be written in the DoPS system like",
        "Coordination expansion means that a DoPS like preference sets can be constructed using coordinated relationships between the coordinated sentence constituents.",
        "Using the coordinated constituents of preference sets, ambiguous constituents can be uniquely resolved, if the same type of coordinated sentence exists somewhere else in the target document or other documents.",
        "In passage 7, it is clear that \"records\" and \"files\" is coordinated constituents.",
        "Preference sets for coordinated constituents is extracted as Entry 7.",
        "Using entry 7, the coordination in passage 8 is disambiguated.",
        "Passage 7: Were records and files dumped?",
        "Old records and files were dumped.",
        "Coordination: *(Old records) [and] (files) were dumped.",
        "Old (records) [and] (files) were dumped.",
        "Even when semantically expanding the disambiguous dependency relations, ambiguities sometime persist.",
        "If ambiguous parts remain, the system adds ambiguous entries to the DoPS.",
        "In any domain, the execution priority of disambiguous entries is, of course, higher than that of ambiguous entries.",
        "Thus the target candidate is analyzed with disambiguous entries first.",
        "After that, if ambiguities still persists, the ambiguous entries are used.",

        "\"I\" indicates that this can be used in reversed relationships.",
