        "Natural language systems that extract information from volumes of text have matured during the last several years.",
        "While these systems still operate in fairly limited domains, they can produce useful structured information from text with reasonable accuracy.",
        "Volumes of text information, low cost computing power, and scarce labor resources increase the motivation for using computers to manage information.",
        "The question that stands in the way of the widespread installation of text processing systems is \"Are they good enough yet?\" Performance is a major issue in the evolution of text processing systems from \"toy\" research problems to real applications.",
        "In spite of the rapid advances in computing technology, most text processing systems are simply too slow, because applications and thorough testing both demand higher throughput.",
        "Excess grammatical complexity clearly accounts for much of the performance shortfall.",
        "Most computational methods of analysis overlook the human-like capability to \"skim\" texts, limiting computation to sections of importance.",
        "Unfortunately, the \"skimming\" approach has come to be identified with systems that abandon grammatical knowledge as well as syntactic processing, thus sacrificing accuracy and other performance features.",
        "The ideal skimming system would need no less linguistic knowledge than a full syntactic parser; in fact, knowing what not to parse may require as much linguistic information as parsing itself.",
        "Our approach to skimming is relation-driven: the program makes a low-cost first pass through the texts, determining what conceptual relations could be relevant.",
        "Then it segments the text to limit grammatical analysis to sections that affect those conceptual relations.",
        "In sections of text with high information content, the program still performs a complete analysis.",
        "In other cases, the skimming technique leads to three types of performance improvements.",
        "The following examples illustrate these features in the context of SCISOR, a system that reads news stories about corporate takeovers [Rau and Jacobs, 1988]:",
        "1.",
        "Skipping irrelevant text.",
        "Example: The company said it expects 1989 daily output to average 10,500 barrels of oil and liquids.",
        "Effect: Do not parse the sentence.",
        "2.",
        "Limited processing of intervening phrases.",
        "Example: Fidelity Federal Savings & Loan Association said its board held a meeting on Dec. 2 and declined a proposal to amend the acquisition agreement by BEI Holdings Ltd. Effect: Parse to determine the roles of \"declined\" and \"acquisition\" only.",
        "3.",
        "Limited attachment.",
        "Example: Revere said it had received an offer from an investor group to be acquired for $16 a share, or about $127 million.",
        "Effect: Break the sentence into three sections to limit complexity.",
        "In each of the above examples, relation-driven skimming limits processing by concentrating on information that is necessary to satisfy the information requirements of the program, such as identifying the target and suitor of a takeover.",
        "In the first case, the program can skip an entire sentence because it does not contribute at all.",
        "In the second example, the sentence contains relevant information, but one clause (about the meeting of the board) does not really contribute.",
        "In the third example, the sentence is packed with relevant material, but the program can still limit grammatical complexity by discarding alternatives that do not contribute to semantic processing.",
        "Relation-driven skimming is part of our text processing system, which has been applied to several prototype domains.",
        "The first accomplishment of the algorithm was to deliver a factor of six improvement in performance to SCISOR, which reads Dow Jones",
        "financial news stories at a rate of over 500 per hour.",
        "The same skimming program applied successfully to an evaluation set of naval operations reports used in the Message Understanding Conference (MUCK-11) held in San Diego in June, 1989 [Sundheim, 1990].",
