        "Our entire model of linguistic knowledge consists of a database of these constructions, uniformly representing lexical knowledge, syntactic knowledge, and semantic knowledge.",

        "Such a construction is a sign in the sense Of Saussure, or a rule-pairing in the sense of Montague.",
        "1 use a somewhat extended notion: a construction is a relation between one information structure and one or more others.",
        "These information structures can be semantic, syntactic or both.",
        "Thus, whereas the \"sign\" expressed a relation between a set of ordered phonemes and a meaning structure, the construction abstracts over this by replacing 'ordered sets of phonemes' with *I want to express my thanks to Peter Norvig, Nigel Ward, and :Robert Wilensky for many helpful comments and discussions on these ideas.",

        "The representation language and the grammar offer a number of distinguishing features.",
        "First is the ability to define constituents of constructions semantically as well as syntactically.",
        "For example, note that the first constituent of the WhNonSubjectQuestion, $t, was defined as any informational element which is an instance of a certain Identify concept.",
        "The Identify concept indicates some question about the identity of the individual filling the Identify-Specified relation.",
        "The information that is known about the individual fills the Identify-Presupposed relation.",
        "The Identify concept is the main characteristic of the lexical semantics of the wh-words.",
        "Thus this constituent is specified semantically, simply by requiring the presence of the Identify semantics.",
        "In more traditional grammars, the constituent would be defined syntactically, as some sort of WhPhrase.",
        "Capturing the syntax of the WhPhrase would entail duplicating huge parts of the grammar or introducing significant syntactic apparatus.",
        "Since the semantics of Identify must be in the grammar anyhow, using it to specify the construction simplifies the grammar at no cost 1.",
        "A construction's constituents can be constrained to be instances of other constructions.",
        "For example, the second constituent in figure 1 is constrained to be an instance of SubjectSecondClause.",
        "But these constraints are the only form of syntactic knowledge that this representational system allows.",
        "That is, constituency and ordering are the only syntactic relations in the system.",
        "All others are semantic.",
        "In keeping with these last two ideas, this representation dispenses with any enrichment of surface form.",
        "Thus phenomena which might traditionally be handled by gaps, traces, or syntactic coindexing are handled with semantic relations.",
        "Thus, as we saw above, the first constituent of the WhNonSubjectQuestion construction is specified semantically, and no gaps or traces are involved 2."
