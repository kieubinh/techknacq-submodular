        "Various kinds of grammatical formalisms without transformation were proposed from the late 1970s 1,11raugh the 19805 [Gamier et al. 85, Kaplan and Bresnan 82, Kay 05, Pollard and Sag 87).",
        "These formalisms were developed relatively independently but actually had common properties; that is, they used data structures called functional structures or feature structures and they were based on unification operation on these data structures.",
        "'These formalisms were applied in the field of natural language processing and, based on these formalisms, systems such as machine translation systems were developed I kogare el al 881.",
        "In such unification-based formalisms, feature structure (FS) unification is the most fundamental and significant operation.",
        "The efficiency of systems based on such formalisms, such as natural language analysis and generation systems very much depends on their FS unification efficiencies.",
        "This dependency is especially crucial for lexicon-driven approaches such as .HPSG[Pollard and Sag 861 and iPSG1Gunji 871 because rich lexical information and phrase structure information is described in terms of FSs.",
        "For example, a spoken",
        "Japanese analysis system based on IIPSGiliogure 891 uses 90% - 98% of the elapsed time in FS unification.",
        "Several FS unification methods were proposed in [Karttunen 86, Pereira 85, Wroblewski 871.",
        "These methods uses rooted directed graphs (DGs) to represent FSs.",
        "These methods take two DGs as their inputs and give a unification result DG.",
        "Previous research identified DO copying as a significant overhead.",
        "Wroblewski claims that copying is wrong when an algorithm copies too much (over copying) or copies too soon (early copying).",
        "Ile proposed an incremental copy graph unification method to avoid over copying and early copying.",
        "However, the problem with his method is that a unification result graph consists only of newly created structures.",
        "This is unnecessary because there are often input subgraphs that can be used as part of the result graph without any modification, or as sharable parts between one of the input graphs and the result graph.",
        "Copying sharable parts is called redundant copying.",
        "A better method would minimize the copying of sharable parts.",
        "The redundantly copied parts are relatively large when input graphs have few common feature paths.",
        "In natural language processing, such cases are ubiquitous.",
        "For example, in unifying an FS representing constraints on phrase structures and an FS representing a daughter phrase structure, such cases occur very frequently.",
        "In Kasper's disjunctive feature description unification [Kasper 861, such cases occur very frequently in unifying definite and disjunct's definite parts.",
        "Memory is wasted by such redundant copying and this causes frequent garbage collection and page swapping which decrease the total system efficiency.",
        "Developing a method which avoids memory wastage is very important.",
        "Pereira's structure sharing FS unification method can avoid this problem.",
        "The method achieves structure sharing by importing the Boyer and Moore approach for term structuresllloycr and Moore 721.",
        "The method uses a data structure consisting of a skeleton part to represent original information and an environment part to represent updated information.",
        "The skeleton part is shared by one of the input FSs and the result FS.",
        "Therefore, Pereira's method needs relatively few new structures when two input .FSs are difference in size and which input is larger are known before unification.",
        "However, Pereira's method can create skeleton– environment structures that are deeply embedded, for example, in recursively constructing large phrase structure from their parts.",
        "This causes O(log d) graph node access time overhead in assembling the whole DG",
        "from the skeleton and environments where d is the number of nodes in the DG.",
        "Avoiding this problem in his method requires a special operation of merging a skeleton-environment structure into a skeleton structure, but this prevents structure sharing.",
        "This paper proposes an FS unification method that allows structure sharing with constant order node access time.",
        "This method achieves structure sharing by introducing lazy copying to Wroblewski's incremental copy graph unification method.",
        "The method is called the lazy incremental copy graph unification method (the LING unification method for short).",
        "In a natural language processing system that uses declarative constraint rules in terms of FSs, FS unification provides constraint-checking and structure-building mechanisms.",
        "The advantages of such a system include:",
        "(1) rule writers are not required to describe control information such as constraint application order in a rule, and (2) rule descriptions can be used in different processing directions, i.e., analysis and generation.",
        "However, these advantages in describing rules are disadvantages in applying them because of the lack of control information.",
        "For example, when constructing a phrase structure from its parts (e.g., a sentence from a subject NP and VP), unnecessary computation can be reduced if the semantic representation is assembled after checking constraints such as grammatical agreements, which can fail.",
        "This is impossible in straightforward unification-based formalisms.",
        "In contrast, in a procedure-based system which uses IF-THEN style rules (i.e., consisting of explicit test and structure-building operations), it is possible to construct the semantic representation (THEN part) after checking the agreement (IF part).",
        "Such a system has the advantage of processing efficiency but the disadvantage of lacking multi-directionality.",
        "In this paper, some of the efficiency of the procedure-based system is introduced into an FS unification-based system.",
        "That is, an FS unification method is proposed that introduces a strategy called the early failure finding strategy (the EFF strategy) to make FS unification efficient.",
        "In this method, FS unification orders are not specified explicitly by rule writers, but are controlled by learned information on tendencies of FS constraint application failures.",
        "This method is called the strategic incremental copy graph unification method (the SING unification method).",
        "These two methods can be combined into a single method called the strategic lazy incremental copy graph unification method (the SLING unification method).",

        "After the process finishes, all COPY slot values are ignored and thus original structures are not destroyed.",
        "The unification procedure based on this method takes as its input two nodes which are roots of the DGs to be unified.",
        "The procedure incrementally copies nodes and arcs on the subgraphs of each input DO until a node with an empty ARCS value is found.",
        "The procedure first dereferences both root nodes of the input DGs (i.e., it follows up FORWARD and COPY slut values).",
        "If the dereference result nodes are identical, the procedure finishes and returns one of the dereference result nodes.",
        "Next, the procedure calculates the meet of their type symbol.",

        "Otherwise, the procedure obtains the output node with the meet as its TYPESYMBOL.",
        "The output node has been created only when neither input node is current; or otherwise the output node is an existing current node.",
        "Next, the procedure treats arcs.",
        "The procedure assumes the existence of two procedures, namely, SharedArcs and ComplementArcs.",
        "The SharedArcs procedure takes two lists of arcs as its arguments and gives two lists of arcs each of which contains arcs whose labels exists in both lists with the same arc label order.",

        "It substitutes arcs with newly copied nodes for existing arcs.",
        "That is, antecedent nodes in the COPY-DEPENDENCY values are also copied.",
        "In the above explanation, both COPY-DEPENDENCY and COPY slots are used for the sake of simplicity.",
        "however, this method can be achieved with only the COPY slot because a node does not have non-NIL COPY-DEPENDENCY and COPY values simultaneously.",
        "The data in the COPY-DEPENDENCY slot are temporary and they are discarded during an extensive process such as analyzing a sentence.",
        "However, this does not result in any incompleteness or in any partial analysis structure being lost.",
        "Moreover, data can be accessed in a constant order time relative to the number of DG nodes and need not be reconstructed because this method does nut use a data structure consisting of skeleton and environments as does Pereira's method.",
        "The efficiency of the LING unification method depends on the proportion of newly created structures in the unification result structures.",
        "Two worst cases can be considered: (.1) If there are no arcs whose labels are unique to an input node with respect to each other, the procedure in LING unification method behaves in the same way as the procedure in the Wroblewski's method.",
        "(2) In the worst cases, in which there are unique label arcs but all result structures are newly created, the method",
        "has the disadvantage of treating copy dependency information.",
