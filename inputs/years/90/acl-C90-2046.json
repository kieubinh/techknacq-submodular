        "The main goal of this paper (as in Keenan and Stavi 1986) is to characterize the possible determiner denotations in order to develop a computational approach that makes explicit use of this information.",
        "To cope with the constraints that languages impose when generating determiners, a computational model has to follow the laws that map definiteness to structures and strings and viceversa.",
        "In the following proposal I distantiate from K. 13iihlers Deixis Theory and Weinrichs (76) proposal where indefinites suggest subsequent information, while definite point out facts from the previous information.",
        "This very general position is insufficient if we want to formalize NP-definiteness.",
        "The semantics of NP definiteness must be captured adequately in computational frameworks for such tasks as answering quantified NI, questions, or in a MT system to convert NPs from one language into another.",
        "In the first part of this paper I draw a typology of definiteness; later I reflect on the definiteness of NPs in an IL-representation.",
        "The major result is given by the determiner generators.",
        "Definiteness should be evaluated in a Q-A system and in MT.",
        "The extensive functionality of definiteness is first elaborated in the parsing and results in an IL-representation; finally the determiner generators create correct morphological determiners and right determiner structures."

        "The NPs parsing strategy that copes with these three information types comes down to these main questions: the question of building adequate semantic interpretation for the functional features fixed during analysis The question of reference resolution for definite NPs To achieve that goal the Np grammar must work with a sufficient: determiner subcategorisation strategy about constraints depending upon the semantic features of the nouns, and on the context (PPs, Rel-S, compounding, etc.)",
