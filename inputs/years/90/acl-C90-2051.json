        "In some contemporary versions of paradigms whose basic rules were originally intended to subsume both \"ID\" and \"LP\" information, information is reorganized so the information expressed by the basic rules is quite limited, arid additions are needed to express the remainder.",
        "The fundamental cause of the modifications is the need to effectively accommodate the relatively free orderings in clause constituents of many languages.",
        "Thus, for example, in augmented phrase structure grammars (APSGs), which include definite clause grammars, it is inconvenient to specify each legal dependent ordering by a separate phrase structure rule.",
        "Instead, as discussed by Jensen (1987), it is more convenient to focus on binary rules, combining a node containing a head with one of its modifiers, e.g.,",
        "Using these binary forms, the phrase structure portion of the rules indicate not much more than the side of a head on which a modifier may occur.",
        "The \"augmentations\" have a number of responsibilities.",
        "They must.",
        "indicate ordering constraints among siblings in terms of features recording subtree \"states\" (i.e., to the extent that such states are not implied by the category names).",
        "Also, explicit facilities are needed for structure building to avoid separate nodes for each rule applied) Finally, if the rules arc used in combination with a lexical orientation, since modifiers are indicated in phrase structure rules by general category (e.g., NP), augmentations must locate and specify the relationship between the modifier category and the specific modifier expressed type (e.g., an expected complement).",
        "The result of this (necessary) movement of function away from the basic rules of the paradigm is a tendency toward somewhat laborious, redundant specification.",
        "To illustrate the kind of redundancy involved, we construct an APSE-style binary rule for allachment of indirect objects.",
        "The example assumes a lexicon identifying potential modifiers of a head by frames, which, by unification, map between syntactic and semantic representations of those modifiers.",
        "To allow for ordering provisions, modifier frames have associated labels, such as \"indobj\".",
        "We also assume that semantic representations of dependents include valency numbers for complements.",
        "To avoid the development of two examples, we also ensure that the rule is hi-directionally applicable.",

        "In parsing the next \"unify\" function ensures that a direct object has not yet been included in VP1.",

        "If these provisions were added, the \"feature testing\" aspects relating to ordering would become considerably more complicated, if expressible at all.",
        "This is because detecting and using textual considerations seems to involve taking into account the entire complex of modifiers for a head, which is extremely awkward in terms of binary phrase structure rules.",

        "If those conditions were expressed in the context of binary rules, it seems that a rule such as VP° -> VP1 x in the parse would have the responsibility of assigning x to \"focus\" if there has been a break to the left of x in the conventional ordering of dependent.",

        "(Topic/focus identification criteria for English are also considered by Hajicova, and are more complicated).",
        "So adding textual provisions to phrase structure rules would pose a considerable challenge.",
        "Simply put, attaching dependents to heads one at a time is a convenient approach in parsing, but detaching them one at a time is not a convenient approach for generation.",
        "On the other hand, if textual provisions are omitted from the grammar, then generation would produce all syntactically legitimate sentences.",
        "One would then use additional rule sets to select among all the generated utterances based on semantic and textually based preferences.2 (And rules are also need to detect textual features during analysis.)"
