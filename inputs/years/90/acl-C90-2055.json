        "The purpose of the SESAME project is to provide users with the possibility of extracting data from an information system in a language as close as possible to natural language.",
        "Users will be allowed to express queries with concepts closer to the external model of an application than to the logical schemes of data bases.",
        "It is thus necessary to use a model of the content of the information system at the conceptual level.",
        "The semantics of the application will be represented by a conceptual model.",
        "Mapping modules will be used to translate conceptual representations into relational schemes.",
        "The natural language query expressed by the user is translated into a logical form by a parser.",
        "This parser uses a grammar and a lexicon specific to a particular application.",
        "It has access to the conceptual schema to validate the semantics of queries.",
        "The logical form is then translated into a SQL query, using the information provided by the mapping between the conceptual schema and the relational schema.",
        "SESAME is an industrial product.",
        "It only uses fairly standard techniques.",
        "It is an interface generator, portable, intended for a large diffusion.",
        "Its most important feature is that it allows people who are not computational linguistics specialists to develop an application fairly easily.",
        "The whole design of SESAME is intended to respect this very strong constraint, even when it meant to use less sophisticated techniques than what is available.",
        "Great care has been also put in the design of the user environment for the querying steps as well as for the manipulation of the results provided by the",
        "data base SESAME is interfaced with (Bates & Weischedel 1987).",
        "The SESAME system is made of four environments: The information system environment used to build the conceptual schema of a given application and to generate mapping rules between the conceptual level and the relational level.",
        "The linguistic environment to generate the linguistic knowledge bases from the conceptual schema of the application and a corpus of the domain.",
        "The query environment provides the user with the tools to query the data base.",
        "The results management environment provides the user with the tools to manipulate the results of the query provided by the D.B.M.S.",
        "and to exploit them through standard office systems or specialized applications.",
        "The first two environments are used by the designers of a particular application to generate the knowledge bases necessary for this application.",

        "The information system environment is used to design the information system parts of a particular application, which consist essentially of the conceptual schema of the application and mapping rules between the conceptual level and the data base relational level.",
        "The conceptual schema is a set of specifications which describe the semantic structure of the data base.",
        "It is specified in an entity relationship (ER) model.",
        "This model contains the traditional concepts (entity, relationship, property) used in standard design methods (Merise, Yourdon, IDA...).",
        "We have chosen to use this type of model instead of a knowledge representation language or a semantic network, in order to ease the implementation of applications by people used to standard data base tools.",
        "To respect the purpose of SESAME, it was essential not to fall in the trap where only the designers of SESAME would be able to develop applications.",
        "See (Grosz et al.",
        "1987) for a review of existing systems, regarding the problem of portability.",
        "We have extended the ER model to include multivalued properties, structured value domains (e.g. the domain date will be built from the domains day, month and year), and the generalization/specialization of entity types through the definition of inheritance relations between entity types.",
        "It is possible to specify on a schema the dependencies between entities, which makes the generation of a normalized schema easier for the mapper.",
        "It is also on this schema, at the conceptual level, that access rights for confidential data can be specified.",
        "They have their counterpart at the linguistic level: only words expressing authorized concepts will be accessible for a particular user.",
