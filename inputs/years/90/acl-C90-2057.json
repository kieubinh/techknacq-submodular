        "(...) The above discussion implies that certain 'understanding proc-esses' are target language dependant, and cannot be fully specified in a monolingual manner.\" Specifically the problem of translating a word for an expression, is one of the reasons presented by Schenk[15] to use the concept of \"Complex Basic Expression\" in the description of one language.",

        "This implies that, in this framework, it is the set of all languages in presence that defines what is a basic meaning.",
        "Like this, it is possible to dispense altogether with structural transfer, \"Structural transfer is not necessary, since idioms are based onto basic meanings.\" In general, however, most MT systems do riot make the analysis phase dependant on the target language(s), and therefore it is usual to see statements like the following[4]: \"the lexical rule must mark words with the corresponding parts of speech,\", in the \"cases where a source language entry must be rephrased in the target language as an ad-hoc combination of words which does not form a lexical entity\".",
        "It is unclear, however, how much complexity of the result can be handled, or how much syntactical transformation the new expression can suffer.",
        "Some hybrid approaches can also be found in [9], this time apparently putting the burden on the generation phase: \"The second substep of German morphological generation is the application of German word list transformations.",

        "This approach gives origin to very heavy dictionaries, with a lot of redundancy, moreover, since there may be similar transformations repeated to many entries.",
        "On the other hand, not only the dictionary becomes very difficult to understand and modify, (requiring someone who knows the \"programming\" language used), but also it makes it tightly coupled to the structural representation and; or particular linguistic formalism and options used in the machine translation system, in both analysis and generation.",
        "We chose thus a different method that",
        "• allows for maximal readability • is independent of the linguistic (and programming) decisions of the whole NIT system (being only concerned with lexical transfer) • provides as much power as any unrestricted (tree or graph) transformation language",
        "The method proposed consists then of using the target string as the result value in the bilingual dictionary, therefore keeping it independent of whatever structure it should be assigned, and invoking a target language parser that builds the structure required, on the fly.",
        "Another advantage of the process above is that the new structure is dynamically built only when it is necessary (that is, when it corresponds to the chosen translation).",
        "On the other hand, no separate (and redundant) lexical rules need he written in the dictionary, as the very same grammar is used for all multiword target expressions.",

        "With this simple example, it can be seen that some structural manipulation took place (converting the English direct object pronoun into a Portuguese possessive adjective - triggered by the CI ITPOSS marker in Figure 4), and that the words taking part in the rnultiword expression were conveniently inflected (in this case, only the verb).",
        "More complex processing can clearly take place, as is exemplified in Figure 6.",
