        "By looking at some basic properties of gapping from the point of view of interpretation and cognitive processing, it is possible to arrive at a global principle that can provide an integrated approach for these Various influences on gapping.",
        "The principle proposed has the added advantage of being not just an arbitrary formal rule but being motivated by 'Cognitive considerations.",

        "Gapping constructions involve two or more coordinated clauses where the verb is missing in all but one clause, such as (1) Bill is reading a book, John 0 a newspaper, and Kathy 0 her favorite cartoon.",
        "Here I use '0 ' to indicate the position of the gap, i.e. the position the missing constituent would presumably have taken in the clause if it had been spelled out in.full.",
        "This notation is merely a convenience and should not be taken to imply that some sort of empty constituent is present.",
        "Also, for historical reasons, I will refer to the constituents 'left-over' in the gapping clause as remnants, without implying that some sort of deletion has actually taken place.",
        "The more interesting cases of gapping are those where the verb is missing along with other constituents.",
        "In these cases the 0 notation is essential to disambiguate the intended reading.",
        "(2) (a) Bill gave John the book and 0 0 Kathy the newspaper (b) •Bill gave John the book and Kathy 0 0 the newspaper (c) *Bill gave John the book and Kathy 0 the newspaper 0",
        "This example also shows that, in general, `grammaticality' or 'acceptability' is defined only relative to an intended interpretation.'",
        "Thus, whereas sentence/interpretation (2a) is fine, most speakers don't get (2c) and accept (2b) only when given a particular intonation, i.e. topic-focus structure.",
        "The examples above all illustrate forward gap ping, i.e. the gapping clause follows the non-gapping clause.",
        "The converse, backward gapping, also occurs, but the question of what determines the direction of gapping will not be addressed here.",
        "In fact; all the examples discussed in,this paper are forward gapping constructions from English and German where backward gapping is not nearly as varied and flexible as the forward variety.",
        "The main reason for focusing on forward gapping at this point is that we want to consider gapping phenomena from the point of view of the cognitive processing demands they pose for the speaker/hearer.",
        "As will be discussed in section 2.2, it seems safe to make some very basic assumptions about processing in the case of forward gapping, so that its implications can be studied without the burden of wildly speculative premisses from a still largely unknown domain.",
        "Most theories to date have tried to account for gapping on the basis of purely formal aspects of syntax alone (see van Oirsouw (1987) for an overview), with the notable exception of Kuno (1976), who explicitly considers functional and perceptual aspects.",
        "Such approaches, mostly in a transformational framework, try to explain gapping as the result of some form of 'deletion under identity.'",
        "Hence these accounts are unable to consider questions such as why (2b) becomes possible only when given the appropriate focus structure (stressing Bill, the book, and Kathy, the newspaper).",
        "In these frameworks focus is considered a matter of pragmatics and simply doesn't figure in a syntax-based account.",
        "Section 3.3 will show that the effects of focus on gapping are a natural consequence of the approach taken here.",
        "Similarly, semantic constraints and contextual factors may have an influence on the interpretation of gapping clauses.",
        "Compare the sentences in (2) above to those in (3).",
        "(3) Mary got a lot of nice clothes on her sixteenth birthday.. (a) Her parents gave her an expensive evening gown and her godmother 0 0 a fine pair of shoes.",
        "(b) ?Her parents gave her an expensive evening gown and 0 0 her godmother a fine pair of shoes.",
        "(2a) and (3a), and (2b) and (3b), respectively, have identical phrase structure, yet the preferred interpretations of the gapping clauses are reversed.",
        "Some of the ways in which semantics can influence gapping are discussed in section 3.4."

        "It is natural that researchers try to confine linguistic phenomena to subtheories (such as syntax), feeling that not doing so would inevitably",
        "face them with an overwhelming range of data for which no adequate principles and rules are available.",
        "Cognitive Linguistics proposes that all levels of linguistic processing are embedded in the general human cognitive apparatus and that, therefore, linguistic generalizations can only be derived by studying language as the product of cognition rather than of some autonomous formal system (Langacker, 1985; Lakoff, 1986).",
        "If this view is correct then the study of processing constraints and applicable cognitive principles (e.g., of categorization) should provide us with a handle on some of the linguistics phenomena that apparently span a variety levels.",
        "Of course nothing is won if we have to resort to uncertain or unjustified claims about the cognitive domain itself, or have no certainty of its relation to the linguistic problems in question.",
        "Fortunately, in the special case of gapping as discussed here, the assumptions we have to make about underlying semantics and processing structures are minimal.",
        "I will adopt an informal version of frame semantics, along the lines of Fillmore (1982).",
        "In this view, the main verb of a clause determines a set of roles to be filled by the (meaning of) remaining constituents.",
        "Thus, interpreting the first clause of (2a) results in a structure of the form give",
        "It is a matter of debate how 'deep' the roles or cases making up the frame representation should be.",
        "For our purposes it is not crucial whether one prefers several levels of representation, such as grammatical roles vs. semantic roles, or general roles (like agent) vs. frame-specific roles (like giver).",
        "The only assumption here is that interpretation requires a process equivalent to the assignment of constituent meanings to slots in the frame, and that this assignment has to be derived based on whatever linguistic and contextual clues are provided.",
        "In the case of gapping, then, several such frames are obtained by partly retaining slot fillers from previous instances of the same type of frame (i.e. generated by the same verb).",
        "Thus a sequence of multiple frames with shared fillers can be linguistically realized in a single, compact construction where multiple fillers are expressed",
        "only once.",
        "In the case of example (2a) above, the second, gapping clause refills the 'patient' and 'recipient' slots of the give frame, while retaining the 'agent' slot.",
        "In non-gapping sentences a combination of word order, case marking, prepositional markers, selection restrictions, etc.",
        "is usually more than sufficient to assign fillers unambiguously to frame slots.",
        "In gapping constructions the role assignment problem becomes potentially more difficult since some of this information is lost, although in many cases the loss is marginal.",
        "Thus, in example (1) interpretation of the second clause is unproblematic since two constituents have to fill two slots, and the usual rules of constituent order in English unambiguously determine the assignment.",
        "In (2), on the other hand, there are three potential role assignments consistent with the constituent order given.",
        "The problem, then, is to identify the syntactic, semantic and pragmatic factors that render certain gapping structures (and their corresponding interpretations) acceptable, while others are ruled out (or at least made less felicitous)."

        "If we assume that roles are sequentially processed and have to be retrieved when refilled, it seems natural that the retrieval tends to become more difficult as the temporal distance from the previous processing event increases.",
        "At a more abstract level, syntagmatic proximity can be viewed as symbolizing conceptual relatedness (Langacker 1985).",
        "Hence the frame unit at the conceptual level corresponds (prototypically) to a clause unit at the syntactic level.",
        "Gapping constructions relate not just the fillers of the roles in a single frame but also the various fillers of the same role in different frames.",
        "Therefore we would expect those fillers to be syntagmatically close to the extent that the two relational aspects can be accommodated simultaneously.",
