        "Conventional morphosyntactic grammars do not allow to describe non-concatenative parts of morphology declaratively.",
        "Two-level morphology on the other hand can deal with some of these phenomena like vowel or consonant change, but there is no sound way to transmit information to the morphosyntactic grammar.",
        "This leads to quite unnatural solutions like the use of diacritics for the representation of morphosyntactic phenomena.",
        "While German morphology is mainly based on concatenation, some non-concatenative phenomena do exist.",
        "The most prominent example is so-called \"Umlautung\".",
        "Umlautung means that in the surface form the original stem vowel is replaced by another vowel in a systematic manner.",
        "Possible transformations are a=>a, au=>au, o=>O, u=>ii, and - in some cases - e=>i. Umlautung in German realizes quite different morphological features.",
        "With nouns it can mark the plural either by itself (e.g.",
        "Mutter => Mutter) or in combination with an explicit plural-ending (e.g. Mann => Manner), depending on the inflection class.",
        "With adjectives it is used to mark comparative forms (groB graer => am groBten), again in combination with an ending, for verbs following strong conjugation it marks the subjunctive II and 2nd and 3rd person singular of the indicative present tense.",
        "Umlautung also occurs in derivation in combination with a number of derivational particles, e.g. -lich (klagen => klaglich).",
        "In contrast to its use in inflection, Umlautung provides for no extra morphosyntactic information in derivational forms.",
        "At last, it appears in compounding in combination with some \"Fugenelement\" (joining element) (e.g. Meinnerchor - male chorus).",
        "There are two common ways to cope with umlautung in conventional morphological components for German.",
        "One is to treat all forms created by umlautung as suppletions, i.e. these forms are explicitly entered into the lexicon.",
        "This is linguistically inadequate, because it obscures the phonological similarity of the two forms.",
        "From a more practical point of view it has the drawback that in a few cases, e.g. forming of the diminutive with the derivational -then, umlautung is still productive, and cannot therefore be lexicalized.",
        "The other solution is a special function replacing (and interpreting) or generating the umlaut in all stems which are marked for umlautung required by the morphosyntactic context (c.f.",
        "Trost & Dorffner 1987).",
        "This makes umlautung a special case neglecting its status as a regular means of morphosyntactic marking.",
        "Solutions within the two-level approach have also been proposed.",
        "They rely on the idea to represent stem vowels which exhibit umlautung with special characters (diacritics) (e.g. A) at the lexical level.",
        "These characters are then realized as either the regular vowel (e.g. a) or the corresponding umlaut (e.g. a) at the surface level.",
        "The idea behind is that these stem vowels are lexically somewhat underspecified.",
        "To trigger the appropriate substitution, GOrz & Paulus (1988) use a separate data structure to control for each word form which of the two possible rules is applied to create the surface structure.",
        "Schiller & Steffens (1989) use still another diacritic symbol for this task.",
        "Flexional endings triggering umlautung start with the diacritic $ (realized as 0 at the surface level).",
        "The context to the right of the substitution of all umlaut rules requires the occurence of that $.",
        "Therefore the umlaut rule would fail if no such affix follows the stem.",
        "As a consequence, the null morph must be explicitly represented by $ in lexical strings where morphosyntactic information is expressed by umlautung only (e.g.",
        "Mutter => Mutter).",
        "Although both solutions certainly do work, at least for flexional morphology, they provide no clean and general solution for the integration of umlautung in the framework of two-level morphology.",
        "The use of a separate data structure is contrary to the intuition that umlautung is a regular phenomenon of German morphology, the treatment of which should require no extra mechanism.",
        "And the use of the diacritic $ places a burden on morphonology which clearly belongs to morphosyntax.",
        "The handling of non-concatenative morphological phenomena within the two-level approach imposes two new requirements: â€¢ Information about the application of a rule needs to be transferred to the morphosyntactic grammar.",
        "It must be possible to restrict the application of two-level rules to certain classes of morphs.",
        "Accordingly, we propose an approach where umlautung requires no extra mechanism at all and where no diacritics are (mis)used to describe morphosyntactic features.",
        "The basic idea is to provide two-level rules with a filter in form of a feature structure which controls its applicability.",
        "This feature structure has to be unified with the feature structure of the morph found in the lexicon to which the rule applies.",
        "In case of failure the two-level rule may not be applied.",
        "If unification succeeds information is transferred that way from the two-level part to the associated morphosyntactic grammar.",
        "This is crucial for the treatment of umlautung because, as mentioned above, its application conveys morphosyntactic meaning.",
        "In the following we will describe the parts of our system in some detail and explain how umlautung can be handled using that framework.",
        "(Basic knowledge of the two-level approach and feature-unification is presupposed.)",
        "We will also argue that extending the two-level rules with filters facilitates the description of certain morphonological phenomena as well."

        "Our implementation of the two-level part is similar to the one proposed by Bear (1988a, b), i.e. rules are interpreted directly and not compiled into automata.",
        "Rules consist of a left context, a right context and a substitution.",
        "Left and right contexts are regular expressions over pairs of lexical and surface symbols.",
        "A substitution consists of exactly one such pair.",
        "Rules may be optional or obligatory (i.e. in contrast to Bear there are no disallowed rules).",
        "By definition, all default pairs are regarded as optional rules with empty contexts.",
        "The pair of strings (lexical and surface) is processed from left to right.",
        "If more than one",
        "optional rule is applicable at a time this shows an ambiguity, i.e. there are as many continuations as there are different substitutions.",
        "Obligatory rules supercede all optional ones (thereby pruning the tree of continuations).",
        "If more than one obligatory rule is applicable at the same time (enforcing different substitutions) the whole mapping must be discarded.",
        "The same is true if no rule applies at all.",
        "The major difference from other two-level approaches is the possibility to provide the rules with a filter.",
        "A filter is an arbitrary feature structure.",
        "A rule may only be applied if the filter unifies with the feature-structure of the actual morph, i.e. the morph to which the substitution applies.",
        "Filters are used to restrict the application of a rule to certain classes of morphs.",
        "This is in contrast to the original view of Koskenniemi that morphonological rules are to be applied over the whole lexicon regardless of morphosyntactic considerations.",
        "This is certainly true of post-lexical rules.",
        "But there is evidence that it is not even true for all morphonological rules.",
        "Take e.g. the verb senden (to send), which can form two different past tenses send-e-te and sand-te, the former being regular weak conjugation, the latter a strong stem with weak inflection ending.",
        "The epenthesis of schwa (or e in orthography) depends on the morphological class of the stem (weak or strong).",
        "Or take the adjective dunkel, where the nominalization im Dunk-e-ln (in the dark) is different from the attributive use den dunkl-e-n Mantel (the dark coat) (c.f.",
        "Gigerich 1987).",
        "Here nominalization requires schwa epenthesis in the stem, not at the morph boundary like the adjective.",
        "If we want to use two-level rules for the description of non-concatenative morphology, such filters are necessary anyway.",
        "Because, as mentioned above, we do need some means to convey information from the two-level part to the morphosyntactic grammar.",
        "In the case of umlautung we suppose that it is triggered by the concatenation of a stem which is lexically marked for umlaut (by the occurrence of a diacritical character A, 0, U or E) with an affix allowing for umlautung (i.e. carrying the feature [umlautung: +D.",
        "Therefore the filter for all rules concerning umlautung basically contains the feature-value pair which marks affixes [umlautung: +/-1.",
        "Umlautung must only be performed if the stem allows for umlautung and that feature has the value +.",
        "Accordingly, all two-level rules substituting a vowel by its umlaut have the filter [umlautung -H. Corresponding rules are needed which keep the original vowel in the surface form.",
        "They have the filter [umlautung: -I.",
        "All the above-mentioned rules are obligatory, and exactly one of them applies to every occurence of a stern marked for umlaut (see figure 1).",
        "To select exactly one rule (in order to prevent a deadlock between two obligatory rules) the feature umlautung must always have a value.",
        "But, as stated above, stems are not lexically marked for this feature.",
        "The marking is effected by the morphosyntactic grammar, which unifies the agreement features of affix and stem, thereby transferring the feature umlautung to the feature structure of the stem (see figure 5).",
        "What is important to note here, is that the two-level rules themselves contain no information about the tnorphosyntactic interpretation of umlautung.",
        "This is only specified in the grammar rules.",
        "Therefore the same two-level rules can be used for all the different places, where umlautung occurs.",
