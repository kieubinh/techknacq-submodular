        "BACKGROUND.",
        "Our approach to point of view is based on Ann Banfield's (1982) theory of narrative sentences.",
        "Banfield characterizes the sentences of narration as objective or subjective.",
        "Objective sentences are those that objectively narrate events.",
        "Subjective sentences are those that present the consciousness of an experiencing char",
        "acter within the story.",
        "They express characters' evaluations, emotions, judgments, uncertainties, beliefs, and other attitudes and affects.",
        "Kinds of subjective sentences include those that portray a character's thought or perception (represented thought or represented perception; Banfield 1982), and those that report a character's private state such as seeing, wanting, or feeling ill – that is, some perceptual, psychological, or experiential state that is not open to objective observation or verification.1 We call the character whose consciousness is presented by such a sentence the subjective character of that sentence.",
        "The following passage illustrates different kinds of subjective sentences.",
        "Sentence (1.2) is a private-state report: It reports Zoe's private state of being furious with Joe.",
        "Sentence (1.6) is a represented thought: It presents Zoe's thought and it expresses her evaluation of Joe (that he is awful).",
        "Represented perceptions appear in the following passage: 2) 2.1Certainly, Dennys thought, anything would be better than this horrible-smelling place full of horrible little people.",
        "\"'There was a brief whiff of fresh air.",
        "23A glimpse of a night sky crusted with stars.",
        "[L'Engle, Many Waters, p. 25] Sentence (2.1) is Dennys's represented thought and (2.2) and (2.3) are Dennys's represented perceptions.",
        "Third-person narrative text is characterized by shifts in point of view: a single text can have objective sentences as well as subjective sentences attributed to different characters.?",
        "To determine the current point of view, readers cannot consider sentences in isolation.",
        "In many cases, it is only in I See Wiebe 1990 and the references therein for alternative categorizations of subjective sentences.",
        "2 There are different kinds of point of view in narrative.",
        "The kind addressed here is psychological as opposed to, for example, spatial or temporal (Uspensky 1973).",
        "In addition, we do not consider texts that take the point of view of an overt narrator (Chatman 1978).",
        "context that a sentence is subjective or has a particular subjective character.",
        "Sentence (1.6) is such a sentence.",
        "We have developed an algorithm for recognizing subjective sentences and identifying their subjective characters in third-person fictional narrative text.",
        "The algorithm is based on regularities, found during our examination of passages from over forty novels and short stories, in the ways that texts initiate, continue, and resume a character's point of view.",
        "The rules of the algorithm were checked, by hand, on over four hundred pages from seven novels.",
        "We were able to categorize most exceptions according to particular problems that remain to be addressed, such as the effect of certain spatial and temporal discontinuities on the psychological point of view.",
        "These classes of exceptions, together with complete descriptions of the current algorithm and its implementation, can be found in Wiebe 1990.",
        "A preliminary version of the algorithm was presented by Wiebe & Rapaport 1988."

        "Black, Turner, & Bower (1979) claim the following result of their empirical investigation of point of view in narrative: \"Merely making a character the subject of the narrative statement sufficed to establish his as the dominant point of view\" (p. 187).",
        "However, their stimulus materials were short, artificially constructed narratives.",
        "For extended texts (i.e., novels and short stories), this simple rule is inadequate.",
        "The subjective character of a subjective sentence is sometimes identifiable from the sentence itself.",
        "This is the case if the sentence has a narrative parenthetical (such as `Dennys thought' in (2.1)); it might also be the case if the sentence denotes a private state, but not always.",
        "If the subjective character is not identifiable from the sentence, it is often one of two previously mentioned characters: the subjective character of the previous subjective sentence or the actor of an action denoted by a previous objective sentence.",
        "The availability of these characters is conditional; obviously, for example, the former is available only if a subjective sentence has previously appeared.",
        "The subjective character also may not be identifiable when the sentence appears.",
        "Thus, identifying the subjective character involves determining whether it can be identified from the sentence itself, or, if not, determining whether it can be identified from the previous context.",

        "In this case, the current sentence continues a character's point of view (if the previous sentence was also subjective) or resumes one (if objective sentences have appeared since the last subjective sentence).",
        "Sentences (2.2) and (2.3) illustrate the former, and sentence (1.6) illustrates the latter; it has the same subjective character as (1.2), the last subjective sentence, and is separated from (1.2) by objective sentences (1.3) – (1.5).",
        "Less commonly, the subjective character is the actor of an action denoted by a previous objective sentence.",
        "Since this character need not be the subjective character of the last subjective sentence, this is a way to initiate a new point of view.",

        "E.g., the conjuncts of compound sentences are separate input units.",
        "Even so, an input unit can still have multiple clauses, each of which denotes an event.",
        "The algorithm uses heuristics to choose the most important of these for tracking point of view (most often, it chooses the event denoted by the main clause).",
        "Thus, when we refer to a sentence that denotes an action, for example, we actually mean an input unit of which the event chosen for consideration is an action.",

        "But the last subjective character is fake, so Augustus's point of view is initiated, not merely resumed or continued.",
        "In order to identify the subjective character in these situations, the algorithm keeps track of expected subjective characters, characters who ate likely to become the subjective character.",
        "Often, the last subjective character is one of these.",
        "However, drastic spatial and temporal discontinuities can block the continuation or resumption of a character's psychological point of view.",
        "We consider one kind of discontinuity, a scene break, which is a break from one parallel storyline to another (Almeida 1987).",
        "Thus, the last subjective character is an expected subjective character only if a subjective sentence has appeared in the current scene (see Wiebe 1990 for examples).4 The usual situation for a shift in point of view to an actor is one in which the action of a previous subjective character is focused by the text – specifically, when the objective sentence denoting the action appeared earlier in the current paragraph, :and the entire paragraph so far has been objective.\"'",
        "In these situations, the actor of the last such sentence, the last active character, is an expected subjective character.",
        "If the subjective character is not identifiable from the sentence, then the algorithm chooses an expected subjective character, if there is one.",
        "If there isn't one, then the algorithm cannot identify the subjective character at this point in the text (see Wiebe & Rapaport 1988 and Wiebe 1990 for cxatnples in which the reader must read further in the text in order to identify the subjective character).",
        "In the case of competition between expected subjective characters, the last active character is the preferred choice, since he or she is more highly focused by the text than the last subjective character is.",
        "The last subjective character is chosen only if the sentence is about the last active character.",
        "The choice of the last subjective character is incorrect if the sentence is the last active character's self-refiection or self-perception; this 4 The algorithm cannot detect scene breaks; rather, it must be informed when one occurs.",

        "In situations like those, the subjective character is determined from the previous context.",
        "A subjective sentence is also able to initiate a new point of view if the subjective character is identifiable from the sentence itself.",
        "A simple example is a sentence with a narrative parenthetical, such as (2.1) – the subjective character is always the subject of the parenthetical.",

        "Passage (4) shows, however, that the subjective character of a private-state sentence need not be the experiencer.",

        "So, when a private-state sentence immediately follows a subjective sentence without a paragraph break (this is called the continuing-subjective text situation), the algorithm identifies the subjective character to be the last subjective character, not the experiencer of the private state.9 3.32.",
        "Subjective Elements.",
        "Another factor that suggests that a private-state sentence should be attributed to an expected subjective character rather than to the experiencer is the appearance of a subjective element.",
        "There are many linguistic elements (syntactic, lexical, and morphological) that can indicate that a sentence is subjective.",
        "Examples are evaluative terms such as 'the old bag' (Banfield 1982), and evidentials such as 'evidently' and `apparently' (Doleiel 1973).",
        "Although some of these elements always indicate that a sentence is subjective, others only potentially do so.",
        "A subjective element is a linguistic element that actually indicates that a sentence is subjective in the context of use.1° Before we address the effect of subjective elements on identifying the subjective character of a private-state sentence, we need to consider interpretations of private-state sentences.",

        "9 Actually, the algorithm allows for a broadening or narrowing of point of view upon a private-state sentence.",
        "This can occur because, as shown by Banfield 1982, a subjective sentence can be attributed to a set of characters.",
        "I° We borrow this term from Banfield 1982, but redefine it; Banfield uses it to refer to linguistic elements that always indicate that a sentence is subjective.",

        "A private-state sentence that is interpreted to be a private-state report, on the other hand, is a report of a character's private state; it is not someone's thought about it.",
        "Examples are (4.3) and (4.7).12 The subjective character of a private-state report is always the experiencer.",
        "Thus, the subjective character is identifiable from the sentence itself.",
        "On the other hand, the subjective character of a represented thought cannot be identified from the sentence itself, but depends on the context (unless, of course, a narrative parenthetical appears).",
        "This is so regardless of whether the subjective character is referred to in the sentence.",
        "For example, the subjective character of the following represented thought is the referent of 'she' (as the sentence appears in the short story): Why couldn't she?",

        "We are extending this work along two avenues.",
        "First, we are developing psychological experiments to test whether the regularities on which the algorithm is based influence the reader's recognition of subjective sentences and identification of subjective characters.",
        "Second, we are extending the algorithm to make connections with work on focus of attention and discourse structure (such as Grosz & Sidner 1986); in particular, we are investigating how resolving anaphora and tracking the current point of view are related (Stark 1987, Hewitt 1988).",
        "An important direction for future research is reasoning about the plausibility of a suggested interpretation, that is, whether it is plausible that the content of a subjective sentence is a particular character's thought or perception.",
        "We have presented part of an algorithm for identifying subjective characters that is based on regularities in the ways that texts initiate, resume, and continue a character's point of view.",
        "When faced with a subjective sentence, the reader has to decide whether the subjective character can be identified from the sentence itself.",
        "It can be if the sentence is a private-state report, but not if it is a represented thought; we give rules for distinguishing between these two interpretations of private-state sentences that involve the textual situation and the appearance of subjective elements in the sentence.",
        "A subjective character who is not (see Wiebe 1990).",
        "identifiable from the sentence itself is often one of two previously-mentioned characters; we identify those characters and specify when one of them should be chosen to be the subjective character.",
        "Our findings are based on extensive examinations of natural narrative.",
