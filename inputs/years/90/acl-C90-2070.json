        "There have been numerous attempts to build systems that automatically acquire word irvanings.",
        "Mostly, these have becar either dictionary readers or attempts to hypothesize meanings of completely unfamiliar words from context (e.g., Selfridge (1982), Granger (1977)).",
        "In contrast, we have focussed on the problem of acquiring word senses that arc related to ones already known.",
        "2J.. A Note on Word Senses For the purposes at hand, we are only concerned with word senses that are synchronically related.",
        "These may be polysemous senses of individuals words, as well as related senses of different words.",
        "In addition, we distinguish meanings or conception structures of a word from senses.",
        "(We will use the term \"meaning\" and \"conceptual structure\" interchangely in this context.)",
        "A sin",
        "gle meaning may be involved in any number of senses, each of which has grammatical or other differences.",
        "Typically, a word has at least one core meaning from which the meanings involved in other senses are in some sense synchronically based.",
        "For example, the word \"open\" has adjectival and verbal senses; the verbal senses include some whose meaning is, roughly, making physical access available to an enclosed region by moving some object (e.g., \"open a jar\", \"open a draw\", \"open the door\").",
        "This is probably a core meaning of the word.",
        "There are several senses involving this meaning, just among the verbal senses.",
        "These senses are differentiated from one another by how the components of the meaning relate to the verb's valence.",
        "For example, one sense has the object moved as the patient, and hence as the direct object of the transitive verb (as in \"open the door\"); another uses the container itself as the direct object (e.g., \"open the jar\"); perhaps another involves some sort of aperture that widens (e.g., \"open your throat\" or \"open the pupil of your eye\").",
        "Additionally, each of these components of the meaning can be realized as patients by appearing as the subject of the intransitive version of the verb.",
        "We consider each differentiable valence structure for both the transitive and intransitive verb forms as constituting different senses, although we presume that the same conceptual structure is in all of these examples.",
        "Yet other senses of \"open\" have the meaning of causing an infonnation-containing item to come into existence (e.g., \"open a bank account\" or \"open a file on someone\").",
        "This second meaning is probably based on the first one.",
        "Also, the various adjective uses (e.g., \"the open door\") are separate senses in this view having some as yet unspecified relation to the senses described above.",
        "Finally, other words, e.g., \"close\", have senses that we presume to be related to the various senses of \"open\" just discussed."

        "Previously, we have succeeded in doing some automatic lexical acquisition by exploiting conventional metaphors as motivations for linguistic forms.",
        "In particular, Martin (1988) implemented the MIDAS system which both uses metaphoric word senses to help with language under",
        "standing, and to extend the lexicon when a new metaphoric use of a word is encountered.",
        "For example, the sentence \"John have Mary a cold.\" is presumed to make recourse to a \"a cold is a possession\" metaphor.",
        "We call such a conventionalized metaphor a core metaphor, since it seems to serve as the basis for related metaphoric uses.",
        "Thus, the sentence \"John gave Mary a cold\" is presumed to involve the \"infecting with a cold is giving the cold\" metaphor, which entails the previous \"cold is possession\" metaphor.",
        "Suppose the system encounters an utterance like \"John got the flu from Mary\", but is not familiar with this use of the verb \"get\", nor with the notion of a flu being treated as a possession.",
        "Then both the available non-metaphoric sense of \"get\", along with the metaphors involving diseases and possession, are brought to bear to hypothesize the word sense that might be in play.",
        "Hypotheses are generated by two kinds of lexical extension processes: core extension and similarity extension.",
        "Understanding \"get a cold\" given an understanding of \"give a cold\" involves core extension, as the core metaphor \"cold is possession\" is extended to the \"getting\" concept; understanding \"get the Hu\" given an understanding of \"get a cold\" involves similarity extension, as the generalization about a role in Me metaphoric structure must be extended from colds to diseases general.",
        "Understanding \"get the flu\" given an understanding of \"give a cold\" involves both kinds of extension.",
        "The MIDAS system has been used in conjunction with UC to extend metaphoric word senses in the computer domain.",

        "A simple similarity extension is attempted, resulting in a proposed \"Terminate-Computer-Process\" metaphor for interpretation of the input.",
        "The interpretation thus provided is passed along to UC, which can answer this question.",
        "Meanwhile, the metaphor is incorporated into UC's knowledge base, which allows UC's language generator to use the same terminology in encoding the answer.",

        "We believe that MIDAS works because it is exploiting metaphoric subregularity by a form of analogical reasoning.",
        "That is, it finds a metaphorical usage that is closest to the given case according to some conceptual metric; it then exploits the structure of the prior metaphor usage to construct an analogous one for the case at hand, and proposes this new structure as a hypothetical word sense.",
        "Note that according to this explanation, metaphor does not play a crucial role in the extension process.",
        "Rather, it is the fact that the metaphor is a subregularity rather than the fact that it is a metaphor that makes it amenable to analogical exploitation.",
        "Analogy, of course, has played a prominent role in traditional linguistics.",
        "Indeed, rather influential linguists (for example, Paul (1891) and Bloomfield (1933) seemed to attribute all novel language use to analogy.",
        "However, today, analogy seems almost entirely relegated to diachronic processses.",
        "A notable exception to this trend 408 2 is the work of Skousen (in press), who appears to advocate a view quite similar to our own, although the primary focus of his work is morphological.",
        "Analogy has also been widely studied in artificial intelligence and cognitive psychology.",
        "The work of Carbonell (1982) and Burstein (1983) is most relevant to our enterprise, as it explores the role of analogy in knowledge acquisition.",
        "Similarly, Alterman's (1985, 1988) approach to planning shares some of the same concerns.",
        "However, many of the details of Carbonell's and Alterman's proposals are specific to problem solving, and Burstein's work is focused on formulating constraints on the relations to be considered for analogical mapping.",
        "Thus, their work does not appear to have an obvious application to our problem.",
        "Many of the differences between analogical reasoning for problem solving and language knowledge acquisition are discussed at length in Martin (1988).",

        "(1989).",
        "However, there are numerous reasons we believe an explicitly analogical framework to be superior.",
        "The Rumelhart-McClelland model maintains no memory of specific cases, but only a statistical summary of them.",
        "Also, the analogy-based model can use its knowledge more flexibly, for example, to infer that a word encountered is the past tense of a known word, a task that an associationist networks could not easily be made to perform.",
        "In latch-fion, we interpret as evidence supportive of a position like ours psycholinguistic results such as those of Cutler (1983) and Butterworth (1983), which suggest that words are represented in their full \"imdecomposed\" -Corm, along with some sorts of relations between related words."

        "In particular, Norvig and Lakoff (1987) offer six types of links between word senses in what they call lexical network theory.",

        "This rule states that, for some noun whose core meaning is a functional object, there is another sense, also a noun, that occurs without determination, and means the primary activity associated with the first sense.",
        "For example, the word \"bed\" has as a core meaning a functional object used for sleeping.",
        "However, the word can also be used in utterances like \"go to bed\" and \"before bed\" (but not, say, \"*during bed\").",
        "In these cases, the noun is determinerless, and means something akin to sleeping.",
        "Other examples include \"jail\", \"conference\", \"school\" and virtually all the meal terms, e.g., \"lunch\", \"tea\", \"dinner\".",
        "British English allows \"in hospital\", while American English does not.",
        "The dialect difference underscores the point that this is truly a subregularity: concepts that might be expressed this way are not necessarily expressed this way.",
        "Also, we chose this example not because it in itself is a particularly important generalization about English, but precisely because it is not.",
        "That is, there appear to be many such facts of limited scope, and each of them may be useful for learning analogous cases.",
        "Consider also rule 4, which relates function nouns to verbs.",
        "Examples of this are \"tree\" as in \"The dog treed the cat\" and \"knife\" as in \"The murderer knifed his victim\".",
        "The applicable rule states that the verb means some specific activity involving the core meaning of the noun.",
        "I.e., the verbs are treated as a sort of conventionalized denominalization.",
        "Note that the activity is presumed to be specific, and that the way in which it must be \"concreted\" is assumed to be pragmatically determined.",
        "Thus, the rule can only tell us that \"treeing\" involves a tree, but only our world knowledge might suggest to us that it involves cornering; similarly, the rule can tell us that \"knifing\" involves the use of a knife, but cannot tell us that it means stabbing a person, and not say, just cutting.",
        "As a final illustration, consider rule 5, so-called \"role splitting\" (this is the same as Norvig and Lakoff s semantic role differentiation link).",
        "This rule suggests that, given a verb in which two thematic roles are realized by a single complement may have another sense in which these two complements are realized separately.",
        "For example, in \"John took a book from Mary\", John is both the recipient and the agent.",
        "However, in \"John took a book to Mary\", John is only the agent, and Mary is the recipient.",
        "Thus, the sense of \"take\" involved in the first sentence, which we suggest corresponds to a core meaning, is the basis for the sense used in the second, in which the roles coinciding in the first are realized separately.",
        "A similar prediction might be made from an intransitive verb like \"shave\", in which agent and patient coincide, to the existence of a transitive verb \"shave\" in which the patient is realized separately as the direct object.",
