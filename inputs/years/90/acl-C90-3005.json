        "The parser has two important novel features: (.i) It has a local word grouping phase in which word groups are formed using 'local' information only.",
        "They are formed based on finite state machine specifications thus resulting in a fast grouper.",

        "It first transforms the constraints to an integer programming problem and then solves it."

        "There are also commonalities in vocahulory, in senses spanned by a word in one language to those of its counterpart in another Indian language, etc.",
        "Lie base our grammar on the karaka (pronounced kaarak) structure.",
        "It is necessary to mention that although karakas are thought of as similar to o,9r,os, +boy aro filndamentlly different : \"The pivotal categories of the abstract syntactic representation are the karakas, the grammatical functions assigned to nominals in relation to the verbal root.",
        "They are neither semantic nor morphological categories in themselves but correspond to semantics according to rules specified in the grammar and to morphology according to other rules specified in the grammar\" [Kiparsky, 82].",

        "Function of the morphological analyzer is to take each ward in the input sentence and extract its root and other associated grammatical information.",

        "This implies that whenever there is a possibility of more than one grouping for some word, they will not be grouped together by the LUG.",
        "This block has been introduced to reduce the load on the core parser resulting in increased efficiency and simplicity of the overall system.",

        "These are semantico-syntactic relations between the verb(s) and the nominals in a sentence.",
        "The computational grammar specifies.",
        "a mapping from the nominals and the verb(s) in a sentence to karaka relations between them.",
        "Similarly, other rules of grammar provide a mapping from karaka relations to (deep) semantic relations between the verb(s) and the nominals.",
        "Thus, the karaka relations by themselves do not give the semantics.",
        "They specify relations which mediate between vibhakti of nominals and verb form on one hand and semantic relations on the other [Bharati, Chaitanya, Sangal, 90].",
        "For each verb, for one of its forms called as basic, there is 'a default karaka chart.",
        "The default karak chart specifies a mapping from vibhaktis to karakas when that verb-form is used in a sentence.",

        "When a verb-form other than the basic occurs in a sentence, the applicable karaka chart is obtained by taking the default karaka chart and transforming it using the verb type and its form.",
        "The new karaka chart defines the mapping from vibhakti to karaka relations for the sentence.",
        "Thus, for example, 'jotata hai' (ploughs) in A.1 has the default karaka chart which says that karta takes no parsarg (Ram).",

        "For the task of karaka assignment, the core parser uses the fundamental principle of 'akanksha' (demand unit) and 'yogyata' (qualification of the source unit).",
        "The linguistic units which play the role of demand and source word groups can vary depending on the parse cycle.",
        "In the case of simple sentences, only one cycle is needed in which verb groups and some special noun groups (e.g. 'paas'(near), 'door'(far) etc.)",
        "play the role of demand word groups, and noun groups and predicative adjectives play the role of source word groups.",
        "During the parsing process, each of the source word groups may be tested against each of the karaka restrictions in each of the karaka charts of the demand word groups.",
        "An appropriate data structure may be created storing the source word groups and the kayak restrictions (in karaka charts of demand groups) they satisfy.",
        "We call each such entry as a candidate variable.",
        "Typically, a number of source word groups will qualify for a particular demand.",
        "The job of the core parser is to make an appropriate assignment of the candidates, subject to certain constraints such as the following:",
        "1) one candidate source word group cannot: satisfy more than one demand of the same demand word.",
        "2) every obligatory demand must be satisfied in some karaka chart of every demand word group.",
        "3) every source word must have an assignment.",
        "4) if more than one interpretation of a source word is available, then exactly one has to be selected.",
        "The above problem is transformed to an integer programming problem.",
        "Assigning 1 to a candidate variable means that the particular karaka relation between the source word group and the demand word group holds; 0 stands for otherwise.",
        "All the various types of constraints mentioned above can be specified in a very natural manner using algebraic inequalities in integer programming.",
        "Having a set of candidate variables assigned to 1 riot only identifies the karaka relations which can be used to get the deep cases, but also identifies the karaka chart which serves to identify the sense of the verb group, etc.",
        "Moreover Integer programming also permits a linguist to express preferences among various candidates for a particular demand.",
        "A typical example of such a preference can be given.",
        "For example, for most of the verbs an animate thing is more likely to be the karta than inanimate things, and among animates human beings are more likely candidates to karta than non-human candidates.",
        "These preferences would simply order the multiple parses if any in the absence of other information.",
        "The parsing strategy actually adopted in the system makes use of the merged karaka chart and corresponds to Anvit-Abhidhanvad, a theory of mimamsa school of the Indian grammatical tradition.",
        "In this approach, we first determine the karaka relationships among the demand and source word groups.",
        "(These are determined",
        "The above principle allows us to deal with active passives.",
        "The verb forms for active and passive are just two special cases of the forms a verb can take.",
        "For example, the verb 'jota' in Hindi has four different meanings listed in the dictionary:",
        "1) harness (e.g., Ram ne bail ko kolhu me jota, or Ram harnessed the bullock for (turning) the crusher.)",
        "2) hitching the cart (e.g., Ram ne gaadii ko jota, or Ram hitched the cart.)",

        "kaam me jota diva, or Ram exploited his servant by putting him to (hard) work. )",
        "• For each of the four senses, a karaka chart can be created.",
        "A karaka chart specifies the mandatory karakas (i.e., which must be filled for the sentence to be grammatical), optional karakas, and desirable karakas.",
        "For each of the karakas, it specifies the vibhakti (i.e., inflection or post position marker), and the semantic specification (typically in the form of semantic type) to be satisfied by the source word (group).",
        "Such a specification for a karaka in a karaka chart is called a karaka restriction.",
        "Thus, the karaka chart for the 'hitching' sense of 'jota' has two mandatory karaka restrictions: one for karta karaka (pronounced kartaa kaarak) and the other for karma karaka (pronounced karm kaarak).",
        "The former karaka relation maps to agent and the latter to patient semantic relation.",
        "As shown in Fig. 1, the restriction for karta karaka says that a source word group satisfying it must be present in the sentence, its vibhakti must be 0, and its semantic type should be human."
