        "Halliday's system networks [3] lay out in diagrammatic form the interlinked sets of linguistic choices which a speaker must make in order to generate an utterance.",
        "As such they have formed the basis of several computer models of natural language generation [4,11].However, as Mel-lish [12] has pointed out, a network can also be read as encoding a set of background constraints which restrict the co occurrence of descriptive features, and hence as a specification of the way in which partial descriptions of linguistic objects can be combined.",
        "Although it is easy to combine feature sets, it is not always clear whether the resulting combined description can actually describe any well-formed linguistic object.",
        "Thus the main task we face is that of checking feature sets for consistency.",
        "Consider for example the framework given by Winograd for the description of English pronouns, which is reproduced in figure 1.",
        "Suppose that a natural language system has somehow recovered the information that a pronoun in a particular position can be treated as both third (person) and subjective.",
        "At this stage",
        "we could be dealing with either \"they\", \"he\", \"she\" or \"it\".",
        "Were we to combine this underspecified pronoun with the further description feminine we should know for sure that the pronoun described is \"she\" and the number has to be singular, since the network dictates, in a way which will be explained in detail below, that the choice between feminine, masculine, and neuter is only applicable to third person singular pronouns.",
        "The network thus provides the raw material for particular sorts of limited inference about the behaviour of pronouns.",
        "We wanted to investigate the mathematical properties of systemic networks in order to better understand the nature of the constraints on feature structure which they are capable of expressing.",
        "Both Mellish and Kasper [7] provide translations of systemic networks into non-graphical formalisms: Mellish expresses constraints as axioms within a simple subset of predicate logic, while Kasper uses an extended version \"of Functional Unification Grammar [10].",
        "Unfortunately the methods which they then use to check for consistency are powerful general methods which may incur considerable computational cost.",
        "We initially hoped to show that systemic networks constitute a low-power constraint language which combines the twin goals of linguistic credibility and computational tractability.",
        "While the main result we present in this paper is a negative one indicating the unexpected power of systemic networks, we do go on to present suggestions about how networks can be exploited in natural language applications.",
        "Our first task is to provide a precise characterisation of the information expressed by a systemic network.",
        "We begin by defining a way of labelling systemic networks, then provide a translation which maps labelled networks into collections of axioms expressed in the form of propositional logic.",
        "This work is a slight refinement of a very similar approach used by Mellish.",
        "Figure 1 contains examples of each of the four types of system which we need to consider, linked together in such a way as to produce a description of the possible forms of English pronouns.",
        "The leftmost system is a choice system expressing the opposition between question, personal and demonstrative pronouns.",
        "Within these broad classification further distinctions operate.",
        "['or example question pronouns may be animate or inanimate, and must also make a. choice between various cases.",
        "The system which expresses the necessity of making two simultaneous choices is indicated with a left curly bracket, and is the and system.",
        "Note that there are two routes to the choice of case, one from question and the other from personal.",
        "The system which",
        "ties these two routes together is called the disjunctive system.",
        "Finally, the rightmost system is a choice between various grammatical genders.",
        "This system can only be reached if a pronoun is both third and singular.",
        "The system involving the right-hand curly bracket which expresses this is called the conjunctive system."

        "Each choice system translates into two axioms: an accessibility axiom, expressing the constraint that none of the labels to the right of the system can be selected unless the entry point of the system has been reached; and an exclusivity axiom expressing the fact that these labels are mutually exclusive.",
        "5 Systemic classification is NP-hard In tins section we show that the problem of systemic classification is at least as hard as problems known to be NP-hard.",
        "This is done by constructing a polynomial time mapping II from instances of the NP-hard problem called 3SAT to networks which can be tricked into solving this problem for us.",

        "It is known that 3SAT is just-, as hard as the problem Of satisfiability for general boolean formulae (Barton et al. provide a demonstration of this fact on pp 52-55 of P.D.",

        "Each choice system carries two labels, one corresponding to a variable name in V and the other formed by negating the label on the other branch of the system.",
        "The choice of prefix should be such that all labels on the resulting network are unique.",

        "These systems are labelled with generated labels distinct from those already used in the network.",

        "The network given in figure 3 is the one which would be produced from E. In order to use the constructed network to solve the satistiabil-ity problem for E, we check an expression corresponding to the conjunction of all the three member clauses in E. This is built by choosing an arbitrary label from each of the rightmost.",

        "Although accurate checking of systemic descriptions is an NP-hard problem, it is still possible to devise algorithms which carry out part of the process of checking without incurring the cost of complete correctness.",
        "Our algorithm depends on a preprocessing step in which the original network is split into two components, each of which embodies some but not all of the information that was present at the outset.",
        "The first component is a simplified version of the original network, in which no disjunctive systems are present.",
        "This is achieved by removing all disjunctive systems, then reattaching any dangling systems to a suitable point to the left of the position of the disjunction.",
        "For convenience in bookkeeping we introduce special generated features which take the place of the disjunctive expressions that appear in the labelling of the original network.",
        "Figure 5 shows the result of peeling awaythe disjunction in figure 4.",
        "The second component of the network consists of a collection of statements indicating ways in which the generated features may be discharged.",
        "For the example network we would have had to note that gen f eat c1 V c2 Taken together the simplified version of the network and the statements about generated features contain all the information needed.",
        "The simplified network is now amenable to deterministic and efficient checking procedures, including reductions to term unification as proposed by Mellish.",
        "The efficiency of these techniques hinges on the removal of disjunctive systems.",
        "The second stage of checking involves the search for a consistent way of discharging all the",
        "generated features introduced by the first stage.",
        "This is the potentially costly part of the checking process, since separate disjunctions may conspire to produce exponentially many different alternatives which have to be checked.",
        "It was to be expected that the process of systemic checking would involve an exponential cost somewhere, so this is no surprise.",
        "Even the second stage of checking is cheap unless two separate conditions hold I..",
        "The description produced by the first stage of checking must involve many generated features.",
        "2.",
        "The generated features must be interdependent, in that the way in which one feature is discharged constrains the way in which other features can be discharged.",
        "'We can't be sure whether the first condition is going to hold until we see the output of the first stage, but we can estimate the extent to which features interact by inspecting the checking rules which arise when the network is partitioned.",
        "Thus, while we can't promise that the use of systemic networks will ensure tractability for arbitrary grammars, we can help linguists to catch potential problems in the formulation of their feature systems during grammar development, and avoid the risk of unexpected combinatorial explosions during the exploitation of the grammars in question."
