        "This paper describes the approach taken to the unification of disjunctive feature structures in an experimental bottom-up shift-reduce Japanese analyser called Propane, for Prolog Parser using the Nadine Grammar.",
        "Nadine (Kogure, 1989; Kogure and Na-gata, 1990), which is implemented in Lisp, is the analysis and translation component of SL-TRANS, the spoken language translation system under development at ATR interpreting Telephony Research Laboratories, and its large (12,000 line) grammar and lexicon make extensive use of disjunction.",
        "The general problem of unifying two disjunctive feature structures is non-polynomial in the number of disjunctions (Kasper, 1987).",
        "That is, barring revolutionary developments in the theory of algorithms, the problem is NP-complete, and the time taken to perform such a unification can, in general, at best he an exponentially increasing function of the number of disjunctions.",
        "However, in writing large grammars of natural languages, it is often convenient to be able to specify constraints in terms of disjunctions.",
        "This seems especially to be the case for Japanese, because of its relatively free word order and widespread ellipsis.",
        "It is therefore important to develop unification algorithms that can in practice unify disjunctive feature structures in a reasonable time, despite the inherent NP-completeness of the task.",
        "Propane's unification method embodies two novel techniques.",
        "Firstly, when a new mother constituent is created by the application of a grammar rule to daughter constituents during bottom-up parsing, disjunctions not relevant to the mother can safely he removed.",
        "However, deciding on relevance in less than exponential time is a non-trivial problem.",
        "Propane's technique is rapid, and results in the removal of enough irrelevant disjunctions that constituents higher in a parse tree are not burdened with inordinately many of them.",
        "Secondly, Propane adopts a modification to Kasper's (1987) disjunctive unification algorithm that \"almost all the time\" (in a sense of that phrase to be discussed), runs in binomial time.",
        "Practical results, which will be presented throughout this paper, suggest that these techniques have the desired effect of allowing Propane to parse even quite long sentences in a reasonable time.",
        "These results need, however, to be evaluated in the context of ATR's Japanese language processing research programme in general and of Propane's approach to parsing in particular, which will therefore be presented in the next section as a preliminary to the main body of the paper."

        "That is, there are two alternatives: reduce now and then be forced to shift twice, or shift now and, unless unification failure prevents.",
        "it, reduce twice.",
        "In such situations, Propane chooses the second option.",
        "This often allows sentences to be parsed which would not otherwise be, and does not prevent the parsing of any sentences in the subcorpus.",
        "Because only category names, arid not features, are examined, the lookahead procedure is very quick.",
        "With this small amount of lookahead included.",
        "Propane was able to parse 75 of the 100 sentences in the subcorpus.",
        "No attempt was made to check thoroughly the validity of these because of the present author's limited familiarity with Japanese and the Nadine grammar; however, they were inspected informally, and none seemed to be obviously wrong.",
        "Of the 25 sentences for which no parse was found, ten involved an incorrect reduction.",
        "Eight of these might have been prevented had information corresponding to Guriji's (1988) treatment of \"sentence levels\" for modification been present in the grammar.",
        "Twelve sentences failed through incorrectly favouring longer edges over shorter; all of these failures involved a lexical entry for the same particle • sequence; and could have been prevented either by altering the treatment of that sequence or by im-• plementing: the same kind of limited lookahead for ' the long-over-short preference as was clone for the'reduce-over-shift preference.",

        "At each stage k, tiny disjunct that does not take part in any consistent k-tuple is eliminated.' If' all the disjuncts in a disjunction are eliminated, the conjunction of which hat disjunction is a conjunct is eliminated too; and if the outermost (;onjuriction of the whole feature structure is eliminated, unification fails.",

        "Nevertheless, since n can sometimes be quite large, this exhaustive process be time-consuming, and indeed in the limit will take exponential time, Propane's attempted solution to this problem is based on the hypothesis that the vast majority of large unrealizable disjunctive feature structures that",
        "will be created in the use of a practical natural language gran-in-tar will be not only unrealizable, hut also \"pairwise unrealizable\", in the sense that they will fail at or before the second stage of Kasper's consistency check, for k 2.",
        "The reason we can expect most unrealizable structures also to be pairwise unrealizable is that most comn unrealizability will result from the contents of two nodes in the tree being incompatible., through assigning non-unifiable values to the same position in a feature structure.",

        "Thus it can be tentatively concluded that, with the current, version of the Nadine grammar and with bottom-up parsing, the risk is worth taking: that is, a full realization is virtually always possible, in reasonable time, for a pairwise consistent structure.",
        "Maxwell and Kaplan's (1989) belief that ''... [simple inconsistencies] become less predominant as grammars are extended to cover more and more linguistic phenomena'' does not therefore of dear to be true of the Nadine grammar, in spite of its coverage of a wide range of phenomena at many linguistic levels; or if it is true, it does not affect the success of Propane's strategy.",
        "That is, even if simple inconsistencies are less predominant, they are still common enough that a large structure that is unrealizable because of complex inconsistencies will also",
        "be unrealizable because of simple ones.",
        "Of course, this does not alter the fact that in general, i.e. for an arbitrary input and for an arbitrary grammar written in the Nadine formalism, Propane's unification algorithm, like Kasper's, is exponential in behaviour.",
        "In the limit, an exponential term in the formula for the time behaviour of an algorithm will dominate, however small its associated constant factor.",
        "Unlike Nadine's unifier, Propane's strategy has the property that when a structure survives consistency checking, not every member of every disjunct in it can necessarily participate in a full realization; that is, ideally, it should have been pruned.",
        "However, this property is only undesirable to the extent that, at the end of the parse, it makes any exhaustive search for full realizations inefficient through excessive backtracking.",
        "Again, in practice, this seems not to be a problem; exhaustive full realization is extremely quick compared to parsing.",
        "An analysis of Propane's processing of its corpus reveals quite wide variation in the relationship-between the total number of disjunctions in a rule application (in both daughters and the rule) and the time taken to perform the unification.",

        "Had Nadine not been aborted in these cases, two more data points would be available that would increase the significance further.",
        "The progressive speed advantage of Propane may be due partly to the fact that, as discussed above, it follows only the single sequence of shifts and reductions specified by the algorithm described in section 2, and does not explore alternative bracketings.",
        "However.",
        "Nadine is also, through numerical scoring, sensitive to the left branching preference, which guides it to explore, and presumably to find, preferred parses first; and the Nadine times used in the comparison were those taken to find the first parse, not all parses.",

        "that if storage time were ignored for both parsers, Propane's speed advantage would be even more apparent.",
        "Such vague remarks are admittedly unsatisfying and should, given time, be firmed up by the acquisition and analysis of more data, and by separate evaluations of the parsing and unification time behaviours.",
        "The latter would involve comparing the two parsers running with the same unifier and then the two unifiers running under the same parsing algorithm.",

        "One could easily write a grammar in which every disjunction from daughter nodes was needed by mothers, so that nothing would be pruned at all.",
        "And thirdly, it is n.ot claimed that the left-branching preference in Japanese is anything more than a preference, albeit quite a strong one.",
        "However, because the grammar, lexicon and sentence set dealt with here are in no sense toy ones written to test unification techniques but are the tools of a major effort to process natural language as it as actually used, it is of interest to analyse Propane's overall time behaviour under the assumption that the relationships inferred above through observation and statistical methods are valid.' There seems to be no a priori reason to doubt that the same behaviour could be achieved by other systems or.",
        "for other languages (except, of course, that the left-branching characteristic is language-dependent).",
        "Thus in Propane, the number of unifications attempted during the successful parsing of a sentence of length N is 0(N) (this happy situation is, of course, bought at the price of failure when the preference heuristics fail).",
        "Let us assume a strongly left-branching structure, which, being maximally unbalanced, is the worst case.",
        "Then the number k of nodes dominated by each new mother node the parser (attempts to) create will be uniformly distributed between 0 and N. From observation, it seems that the number of disjunctions el involved in a unification that dominates k nodes will be proportional to k (This is the pessimistic option; as argued earlier, there are grounds for hoping that, with sufficient pruning, d will not increase with k at all, so that disjunctive unification time will made no contribution to parsing time as a function of N).",
        "Unification time for d disjunctions, under the pairwise consistency hypothesis, appears to be proportional to d2.",
        "Compositional semantic interpretation will probably mean in the limit that the size of the non-disjunctive part of a constituent will also be proportional to the number of constituents dominated.",
        "Unification time here is order n log n in the sizes n of the input structures (Kasper, 1987).",
        "Thus a node dominating k others will take order kalog k time to create.",
        "Summing over k from 0 to N gives an order N4logN result.",
        "More generally, a parsing algorithm that on atomic categories has order f(N) should, with disjunction, have order f (N)N2 log N if the distribution of k over nodes created is also uniform.",
        "In conclusion, the assessments of the various aspects of Propane's time behaviour are all consistent with, and in some cases provide good evidence for,",
        "the claim that the two novel techniques described here can significantly enhance the speed with which sentences can be parsed using a large grammar containing disjunctions.",
        "As long as the essential hypothesis about pairwise consistency holds for the particular grammar and the sentences it will in practice encounter, polynomial tune behaviour can be expected, as compared to an exponential time for other approaches involving disjunctive unification."
