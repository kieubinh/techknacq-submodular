        "In the KPSG, we assume the syllable structure rule as the general rule as follow : whose value is determined with respect to a category possibly generated by a number of syllable boundaries.",
        "This feature plays a crucial role in describing the phonological process: vowel harmony and so on.",
        "These principles are the constraints to select the adequate local syllabic tree among the inadequate local syllabic trees generated by the above phonological rules: M ---> C PI and M' ---> M H. The information of the basic feature values is prepared as the concrete phoneme entry, and is propagated a local tree to another local tree during the phonological processing.",
        "The operation which determines the structure of feature and the sets of feature is called unification.",
