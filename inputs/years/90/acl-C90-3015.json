        "1987; Hertz 1981, 1982, forthcoming; Hertz et a!.",
        "1985) are, at heart, unconstrained string-based transformational grammars.",
        "Generally, text-to-speech programs are implemented as the composition of three non-invertible mappings:",
        "1. grapheme to phoneme mapping (inverse spelling rules + exceptions dictionary) 2. phoneme to allophone mapping (pronunciation rules) 3. allophone to parameter mapping (interpolation rules)",
        "h denotes strong release of breath (aspiration) ' denotes slight/weak aspiration - denotes no aspiration These mappings are usually defined using rules of the form A 4 B D e.g. (1), usually called \"context-sensitive\", but which in fact define unrestricted rewriting systems, since B may be the empty string (Gazdar 1987).",
        "It should be recalled that \"if all we can say about a grammar of a natural language is that it is an unrestricted rewriting system, we have said nothing of any interest\" (Chomsky 1963:360).",
        "Often, of course, grammars made with rules of this type may be (contingently) quite restricted.",
        "For instance, if the rules apply in a fixed order without cyclicity, they may be compiled into a finite-state transducer (Johnson 1972).",
        "But in general there is no guarantee that a program which implements such a grammar will halt.",
        "This would be pretty disastrous in speech recognition, and is undesirable even in generation-based applications, such as text-to-speech.",
        "However, this has not prevented the appearance of a number of \"linguistic rule compilers\" such as Van Leeuwen's (1987, 1989) and Hertz's systems.",
        "The basic operations of a transformational grammar – deletion, insertion, permutation, and copying – are apparently empirically instantiated by such well-established phonological pheneinona as elision, epenthesis, metathesis, assimilation and coarticula-tion."

        "In partial recognition of some of these problems, phonologists have been attempting to reconstruct the transformational component as the epiphenomenal result of several interacting general \"constraints\".",
        "Numerous such \"constraints\" and \"principles\" have been proposed, such as the Well-Formedness Condition (Goldsmith 1976 and several subsequent formulations), the Obligatory Contour Principle (Leben 1973), Cyclicity (Kaisse and Shaw 1985, Kiparsky 1985), Structure-Preservation (Kiparsky 1985), the Elsewhere Condition (Kiparsky 1973) etc.",
        "While this line of research is in some respects conceptually cleaner than primitive transformational grammars, there has been no demonstration that a \"principle\"based phonology is indeed more restrictive than primitive transformational phonology in any computationally relevant dimension.",
        "A declarative model of speech For the last few years, I have been developing a \"synthesis-by-rule\" program which does not employ such string-to-string transformations (Coleman and Local 1987 forthcoming; Local 1989 forthcoming; Coleman 1989).",
        "The basic hypothesis of this (and related) research is that there is a trade-off between the richness of the rule component and the richness of the representations (Anderson 1985).",
        "According to this hypothesis, the reason why transformational phonology needs to use transformations is because its data structure, strings, is too simple.",
        "Consequently, it ought to be possible to considerably simplify or even completely eliminate the transformational rule component by using more elaborate data structures than just well-ordered sequences of letters or feature-vectors.",

        "Assimilation can also be modelled non-destructively by unification (fig.",

        "Coartieulation is simple to model if parametric phonetic representations may be glued together in parallel, rather than simply concatenated.",
        "Consonants may then overlaid over vowels, rather than simply concatenated to them (Oilman 1966, Perkell 1969, Gay 1977, Mattingly 1981, Fowler 1983).",
        "If required, this analysis can also be implemented in the phonological component, using graphs of the 'overlap' relation (Griffen 1985, Bird and Klein 1990), e.g.: It is now common to analyse epenthesis, not as the insertion of a segment into a string, but as due to minor variations in the temporal coordination of independent parameters (Jespersen 1933:54, Anderson 1976, Mohanan 1986, Browman and Goldstein 1986) (fig.",
        "3).",
        "It has been demonstrated (Fourakis 1980, Kelly and Local 1989) that epenthetic elements are not phonetically identical to similar non-epenthetic elements.",
        "The transformational analysis, however, holds that the phonetic implementation of a segment is depen-dendent on its features, not its derivatonal history (\"a [t] is a [t] is a [t]\" ), and thus incorrectly predicts that an epenthetic [t] should be phonetically identical to any other [t].",
        "Elision is the inverse of epenthesis, and is thus in some sense \"the same\" phenomenon, taking the \"unelided\" form as more primitive than the \"elided\" form, a decision which is entirely meaningless in the declarative account (fig.",
        "4) Metathesis is another instance of \"the same\" phenomenon i.e. different temporal synchronisation of an invariant set of elements.",
        "Epenthesis, Elision and Metathesis may all be regarded as instances of the more general phenomenon of non-significant variability in the timing of parallel events.",
        "As well as these relatively low-level phonological phenomena, work in Metrical Phonology (Church 1985) and Dependency Phonology (Anderson and Jones 1974) has shown how stress assignment, a paradigm example for transformational phonology, can be given a declarative analysis.",

        "The sequence of feature-structures is parsed.",

        "The phonological structure is traversed and an",
        "interpretation function applied at each node to derive a phonetic parameter matrix.",
        "Parsing is done using a Phrase Structure Grammar of phoneme strings.",
        "A very simplified version of such a grammar is fig. 5.",
        "I have implemented several such grammars so far, including a DCG implementation and a PATR-II-like implementation.",
        "With one or two simple extensions to the grammar formalism, it is also possible to parse re-entrant (e.g. ambisyllabic) structures and other overlapping structures, such as those arising from bracketting \"paradoxes\".",
        "The resulting graphs are thus not trees, but directed acyclic graphs.",
        "In computational syntactic theory, one of the main uses for the parse-tree of a string is to direct the construction of a compositional (Fregean) semantic interpretation, according to the rule-to-rule hypothesis (Bach 1976).",
        "In the YorkTalk system, the same approach is employed to assign a phonetic interpretation to the phonological representation.",
        "A second, theory-internal motivation for constructing rich parse-graphs of the phonemic string is that it enables the phoneme string to be discarded completely, thus liberating the phonetic interpretation function from the sequentiality and other undesirable properties of segmental strings.",
        "After the phonological graph has been constructed by the parser, a head-first graph-traversal algorithm maps the (partial) phonological category of each node into equations describing the time-dependent motion of the synthesis parameters for specified intervals of time.",
        "These parametric time-functions are finally instantiated with actual numbers representing times, in order to derive a complete matrix of (parameter, value) pairs.",
        "As well as being computationally \"clean\", this method of synthesis has the additional merit of being genuinely non-segmental in (at least) two respects: there are no segments in the phonological representations, and there is no cross-parametric segmentation in the phonetic representations.",
        "The resulting speech does not manifest the discontinuities and rapid cross-parametric changes which often cause clicks, pops, and the other disfluencies which typify sonic synthetic speech.",
        "On the contrary, the speech is fluent, articulate and very human-like.",
        "When the model is wrong in some respect, it sounds like a speaker of a different language or dialect, or someone with dysfluent speech.",
        "For all these reasons, the York-Talk model is attracting considerable interest in the speech technlogy industry and research community, a circumstance which I hope will promote a widespread change of approach to computational phonology in future."
