        "The choice of target language realizations in machine translation or in multilingual generation is conditioned by constraints involving different levels of linguistic description for the individual languages.",
        "From a descriptive point of view, it is desirable to be able to keep these different levels separate -- conceptually as well as in the actual implementation of knowledge sources and representations of linguistic objects; such levels may include, for example, a description of morphological properties, of constituent structure, of predicate-argument structures or functional structures, as well as a description of textual and pragmatic properties.",
        "In generation from semantic representations, constraints on the choice of linguistic realizations depend on properties of the basic elements of lexical and syntactic variants with respect to all these levels; such constraints usually interact in various ways.",
        "Knowledge sources which provide the information necessary for modelling such phenomena should therefore allow for modularization as well as for *Research reported in this paper is partly supported by the German Ministry of Research and Technology (BMFT, Bundesminister fur Forschung and Technologic), under grant No.",

        "In research on MT and NI, generation, different approaches to both problems, modularization and interaction between the modules, have been proposed.",
        "Although most of these approaches allow for a description of linguistic phenomena at each individual level, it is hard for them to explicitly express interactions between levels without using directionality.",
        "Usually, adjacent levels are connected by explicit mappings.",
        "Conditions acting on nonadjacent levels often cannot be expressed directly: thus, information has to be carried explicitly across levels where it would normally not be stated.",
        "Moreover, as the input structure is transformed stepwise, the set of mappings has to be ordered carefully.",
        "Other generation researchers, like [DANLOS 1987]:96-99 and [NIRENBURG 1989]:242f have a similar view of the architecture of the linguistic description; most of their solutions to the above problem are based on a heuristic ordering of the mapping and on some loss of strictness in the separation of levels.",
        "In order to alleviate such problems, the use of \"codescriptions\" has been proposed' which allows for statements about the coexistence of partial descriptions belonging to separate descriptive levels.",
        "This device makes all relevant information available in one place thus allowing for constraints from different levels to be considered at the same time.",
        "Although the use of codescriptions perfectly supports the formulation of interactions between different types of partial information, the current propos'See.",
        "e.g. [FENSTAD ET AL.",
        "1987] who annotate context-free rules of Lexical Functional Grammar with functional as well as semantic descriptions, which allows for the simultaneous construction of f-structures and situation schemata; an application to transfer has been proposed by [KAPLAN ET AL.",
