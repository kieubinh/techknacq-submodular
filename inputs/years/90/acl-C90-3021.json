        "The limited capacity of working memory is intrinsic to human sentence processing, and therefore must be addressed by any theory of human sentence processing.",
        "I assume that the amount of short term memory that is necessary at any stage in the parsing process is determined by the syntactic, semantic and pragmatic properties of the structure(s) that have been built up to that point in the parse.",
        "A sentence becomes unacceptable for processing reasons if the combination of these properties produces too great a load for the working memory capacity (cf. Frazier (1985), Gibson (1987)):",
        "where: K is the maximum allowable processing load (in processing load units or PLUs), xi is the number of PLUs associated with property n is the number of properties, Ai is the number of times property i appears in the structure in question.",
        "Furthermore, I hypothesize that the human parser prefers one structure over another when the processing load (in PLUs) associated with one structure is markedly lower than the load associated with another.",
        "That is, I hypothesize there exists some arithmetic preference quantity P, corresponding to a processing load difference, such that if the processing loads associated with two representations differ by P, then only the representation associated with the smaller of the two loads survives.",
        "Given the existence of a preference quantity P, it is easy to account for garden-path effects and preferred readings of ambiguous sentences.",
        "Both effects occur because of a local ambiguity which is resolved in favor of one reading.",
        "Given two representations for the same input string that differ in processing load by at least P, only the less expensive structure will be maintained.",
        "If that structure is not compatible with the rest of the sentence and the discarded structure is part of a successful parse of the sentence, a garden-path effect results.",
        "If the parse is successful, but the discarded structure is compatible with another reading for the sentence, then only a preferred reading for the sentence has been calculated (cf. Gibson (1987), Gibson & Clark (1987), Clark & Gibson (1988)).1 Thus if we know lAn alternative to the preference constraint presented here is the serial hypothesis, which allows at most one representation for the input string at any stage in the parse (see, for example, Frazier & Fodor (1978), Frazier (1979), Marcus (1980), Berwick & Weinberg (1984), and Pritchett (1988)).",
        "There is a longstanding debate in the psycholinguistic literature as to whether or not more than one representation for an input can be maintained in parallel.",
        "It turns out that the parallel view appears to handle some kinds of data more directly than the serial view, where one reading of a (temporarily) ambiguous sentence becomes the strongly preferred reading, we can write an inequality associated with this preference:",
        "where: P is the preference factor (in PLUs), x, is the number of PLUs associated with property n is the number of properties, Ai is the number of times property i appears in the unpreferred structure, Bi is the number of times property i appears in the preferred structure.",
        "In this paper I will concentrate on syntactic properties:2 in particular, I present two properties based on the 0 Criterion and Projection Principle from Government and Binding Theory (Chomsky (1980).3 Once these properties are associated with processing loads, they can predict a large array of garden-path effects.",
        "Furthermore, it is demonstrated that these properties also make desirable cross-linguistic predictions with respect to unacceptability due to memory capacity overload.",
        "The organization of this paper is given as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the structure of the underlying parser that is assumed.",
        "Section 3 includes the proposed syntactic properties.",
        "Section 4 examines a number of locally ambiguous sentences, including some garden-paths, with respect to these properties.",
        "Section 5 explores a number of acceptable and unacceptable sentences and demonstrates that the properties proposed in Section 3 make the right predictions with respect to processing overload.",
        "Furthermore, it is demonstrated in this section that these properties seem to make the right predictions cross-linguistically Some conclusions are given in the final section.4 keeping in mind that the data are often controversial.",
        "See, for example, Kurtzman (1985) or Gorrell (1987) for a history of the debate along with evidence in support of the parallel hypothesis.",
        "Note in particular that data normally taken to be support for the serial hypothesis include garden-path effects and the existence of preferred readings of ambiguous input.",
        "However, as noted above, limiting the number of allowable representations is only one way of constraining parallelism so that these effects are also easily accounted for in a parallel framework.",
        "2 Note that I assume that there also exist semantic and pragmatic properties which are associated with significantproccssing loads."

        "In particular, consider Dutch and German.",
        "It turns out that multiply center-embedded relative clauses become difficult in these languages at the same point as they do in English: on the second embedding.",
        "For example, the German sentence (34) is unacceptable, as expected: (34) # Der Mann den die Frau die der Hund bib sah schwam.",
        "\"The man that the woman that the dog bit saw swam.\" Unlike English, however, German and Dutch are verb final in subordinate clauses, so that verbs with lexical requirements for three thematic elements pose an interesting test to the theory.",
        "If the theory presented here is correct and it generalizes cross-linguistically, then constructions with three initial 0-role-requiring constituents should be acceptable.",
        "It turns out that this is in fact the case, as the German example (35) illustrates: (35) Ich glaube, dab John Mary das Geschenk gegeben hat.",
        "I believe that John Mary the present given has \"I believe that John has given Mary the present.\" After the word Geschenk, there are three noun phrases that require thematic roles, but currently lack them.",
        "All lexical requirements are satisfied at this point in the parse, so the total load associated with this parse state is Rho PLUs.",
        "Thus (35) is predicted to acceptable, as desired.",
        "Another good test for the theory presented here comes from cross-serial dependencies in Dutch.12 In examples of cross-serial dependency, noun phrase arguments appear at the beginning of a subordinate clause, followed by their thematic role assigning verbs.",
        "It turns out that",
        "constructions with three initial noun phrases are perfectly acceptable, as is exemplified in (36): (36) ... dat Jan Pict de kinderen zag helpen zwemmen.",
        "... that Jan Piet the children saw help swim \"... that Jan saw Net help the children swim.\" However, these constructions lose their acceptability with the addition of further NP arguments: (37) a.",

        "... that Jan Piet Marie the children saw help make teach swim \"... that Jan saw Net help Marie make Karel teach the children to swim.\" This result is predicted in the framework presented here.",
        "Four NP arguments locally lacking thematic roles force a load of 4xmi, too much for human short term memory capacity.",
        "Evidence from the processing of Japanese also supports the memory capacity results obtained here.",
        "Japanese is a verb final language, so that subjects and objects appear before the verb.",
        "Verbs that take clausal complements provide an interesting test case for the theory presented here, since it is grammatical to place all NP arguments before the thematic role assigning verbs.",

        "Since the structural properties that are used in the formation of the inequalities are independently motivated, and the system of inequalities is solvable, the theory of human sentence processing presented here makes strong, testable predictions with respect to the proccssability of a given sentence.",
        "Furthermore, the success of the method provides empirical support for the particular properties used in the formation of the inequalities.",
        "Thus a theory of PLUs, the preference factor P and the overload factor K provides a unified account of 1) acceptability and relative acceptability; 2) garden-path effects; and 3) preferred readings for ambiguous input and perception of ambiguity."
