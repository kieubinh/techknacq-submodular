        "Nakamura & Nagao (1988) automatically constructed a taxonomy, but did not distinguish the senses of nouns and hence cannot allow inheritance of properties along the links of the implied network created by the taxonomy.",
        "Because of the semantic category markings in LDOCE, we have been able to develop heuristic procedures (described in section • 4), that, to a great extent, automate the task of developing a hierarchy of word senses.",
        "Constructing taxonomies from the genus terms of definitions forces one to take a stand on how to treat a large class of noun definitions which are not as \"standard\" as the definition given above for knife.",
        "The characteristic property of these definitions is that the head of the first noun phrase (the usual place to find a genus term) seems vacuous, and another easily identifiable noun in the definition gives information about the headword.",

        "The question at issue is: what to do with these cases?",
        "In the original work of Amsler and White (1979) with the Merriam Webster Pocket Dictionary (MPD, 1964), the disturbed head cases were handled by asking paid human \"disambiguators\" to sense-tag the head of the first noun phrase in the definition and also to sense-tag any other noun in the definition which \"made a significant semantic contribution to an IS-A link\" (Amsler and White, 1979: p. 55) with the headword being defined (i.e. for the deuterium definition above, \"hydrogen\" was sense tagged as well as \"form\").",
        "The taxonomy actually contained both a link from deuterium to \"form\" and a link from deuterium to \"hydrogen\", although the hydrogen sense was marked in a special way to indicate it is not the syntactic head of the definition.",
        "In cases like the \"hydrogen\" example just given, the marked \"semantic contributors\" were never given ancestors, since the link often represented a more loosely defined relation than the strictly transitive \"is a subset of definition of IS-A, which ideally relates the headword and its genus sense.",
        "This degenerate form of IS-A precludes inheritance in the network.",
        "It is included in the taxonomy in order to form links to words which may not be related in a strict IS-A sense, but which convey useful information about the word being defined.",
        "There have been various proposals over the years suggesting different specialized link types to be added to the taxonomy (besides the degenerate IS-A).",
        "Markowitz et al., (1986) suggest HAS_MEMBER links be created in definitions which use the phrase \"member of (i.e. \"college\" HAS._MEMBER \"academic\" in the definition of academic above).",

        "However, in their work, only the spelling form of the genus is identified automatically; the sense selections are made by humans.",
        "The disambiguation here is not to attach a sense number, but rather to perform a function termed \"sprouting\" 2 139 which interactively selects among all words which have a given word-sense as a genus.",
        "Their taxonomy contains only IS-A links, but they partially attack the \"disturbed head\" problem by identifying a small class of what they call \"empty heads\".",

        "The book and tape versions of LDOCE both use a system of grammatical codes of about 110 syntactic categories which vary in generality from, for example, noun to nounlcount to noun/count/followed-byinfinitive-with-TO.",
        "The machine readable version of LDOCE also contains \"box\" and \"subject\" codes that are not found in the book.",
        "The box codes use a set of primitives such as abstract, concrete, and animate, organized into a type hierarchy.",
        "This hierarchy of primitive types conforms to the classical notion of the IS-A relation as describing proper subsets.",
        "These primitives arc used to • assign type restrictions on nouns and adjectives, and type restrictions on the arguments of verbs.",

        "The parser is left-corner, and bottom-up, with top-down filtering.",
        "The context-free grammar driving the chart parser is virtually unaugmented and, with certain minor exceptions, no procedure associates constituents with what they modify.",
        "Hence, there is little or no motivation for assigning elaborate or competing syntactic structures, since the choice of one over the other has no semantic consequence.",
        "Therefore, the trees are constructed to be as \"flat\" as possible.",
        "The parser also has a \"longest string\" (fewest constituents) syntactic preference.",

        "Ninety-Five percent result in a parse tree for the entire definition text.",
        "Five percent of the analyses fail at some point.",
        "In those cases where it fails the parser still returns a partial parse (of the leading constituents in the definition text), and this is the most important part of a definition anyway.",
        "The second phase of this procedure is to find the correct sense of the genus term that has been identified by the parser.",
        "To do this, we have constructed a program called the Genus Disambiguator, which takes as input the subject codes (pragmatic codes) and box codes (semantic category codes) of the headword, taken from the machine readable version of LDOCE, and the spelling form of the genus word which has been identified by the parser described above.",
        "The output is the correct sense of the genus word.",
        "The codes in LDOCE seem to support the thesis that the genus for a noun must be a noun, and that the semantic category of the genus word must be",

        "However, the tie is broken by appeal to the subject code, Music, which selects the second sense of instrument as the genus of flute, and the output is \"instrument-2\".",
        "There are occasional failures, many of which appear to be due to unusual markings in LDOCE.",

        "Therefore the first sense is selected and the output is \"fruit-1\".",
        "This happens to be correct, but it is an unsatisfying resolution.",
        "In a piece of related work, Stator (1988a) has implemented a scheme in the Lexicon Provider which imposes deeper structure onto the LDOCE subject hierarchy (e.g. terms like Food, Botany, and Plant-Names in the \"fruit\" definitions above) relating these categories in a natural way, in order to discover important relationships between concepts within text.",
        "This manual restructuring simply observes that words classified under Botany have pragmatic connections to words classified as Plant-Names, as well as connections with other words classified under Science (connections not made by the LDOCE hierarchy as given), and that these connections are useful to exploit.",
        "The Lexicon Provider system relates these codes through a specially restructured hierarchy created for that purpose, making Communication, Economics, Entertainment, Household, Politics, Science, and Transportation the fundamental categories.",
        "Every word sense defined with a subject code therefore has a position in the new hierarchy, attached below the node for its subject code.",
