        "Generally the development of grammars, formalisms and natural language processors is based on written language data or, sometimes, not real data at all, but invented 'example sentences'.",
        "This holds for both computational and general linguistics.",
        "Thus many parsing systems that work quite well for sentences like la.",
        "and lb.",
        "fail, if they get applied to the authentic data in 2a.",
        "and 2b.",
        ": Ia.",
        "die Grundform ist nicht eckig the basic form is not angular lb.",
        "das blaue habe Ich als Waage auf dem grOnen liegen I have got the blue one lying upon thew- greenvAT oneDAT like a balance 2a.",
        "die die Grund die Grundform sind is nich Is nich eckig the the basic the basic form are is not is not angular 2b.",
        "das blaue hab ich als Waage auf das grime liegen I have got the blue one lying upon theAcc greenACC oneAcc like a balance To native recipients the utterances in 2. appear to be more or less defective, but interpretable expressions.",
        "Moreover, the interpretation of 2a.",
        "or 2b.",
        "might require even less effort than, for instance, understanding an absolutely grammatical 'garden path sentence'.",
        "Since utterances like 2a.",
        "and 2b.",
        "occur quite frequently in spontaneous speech, an approach to parsing everyday language has to provide techniques that cover repairs, ungrammatical repetitions (2a.",
        "), case-assignment violation (2b.",
        "), agreement errors and other phenomena that have been summarized under the label 'ill-formed' in earlier research (Kwasny/Sondheimer",
        "1983, Lesmo/Torasso 1984, Kudo et al.",
        "1988).",
        "Though the present paper will adhere to this terminology, it should be emphasized that it is not presupposed that there are any general criteria precise enough to tell us exactly whether some utterance is 'ill-formed' relative to a natural language.",
        "Let us assume, instead, that some utterance U is 'ill-formed (defective, irregular, ...) with respect to a grammar G' iff U is not a sentence of the language specified by G. Since, for instance, repairs exhibit a high degree of structural regularity (cf. Schegloff et al.",
        "1977, Levelt 1983, Kindt/Laubenstein in preparation) one might prefer to describe them within the granunar and not within some other domain (e.g. within a production/perception model).",
        "Therefore the concept 'ill-formed' is used as a relational term that always has to be redefined with respect to the given context.",
        "There have been two main directions in the prior research on ill-formedness.",
        "The one direction has focussed on the problem of parsing ill-formed input in restricted domain applications, such as natural language interfaces to databases or robot assembly systems (Lesmo/Torasso 1984, Selfridge 1986, Carbonell/Hayes 1987).",
        "Though the techniques developed in that field seem to be quite adequate for the intended purposes, the results are not directly transferable to the interpretation of spontaneous speech, since the restrictions affect not only the topical domains but also the linguistic phenomena under consideration: e.g. the CASPAR parser (cf. Carbonell/ Hayes 1987) is restricted to a subset of imperatives, Lesmo/Torasso (1984) achieve interpretations for ill-formed word order only at the price of neglecting long distance dependencies etc.",
        "The other main direction has been the 'relaxation'-approach (Kwasny/Sondheimer 1981, Weischedel/Sondheimer 1983).",
        "The basic idea is to relax those grammatical constraints an input string does not meet, if a parse would fail otherwise.",
        "The main problem of this approach is that relaxing constraints (i.e. ignoring them) makes a grammar less precise.",
        "Thus, for instance, a noun phrase that lacks agreement in number is analysed as a noun phrase without number and it remains unexplicated how this analysis might support a further interpretation.",
        "Surprisingly, none of these papers concentrates on real life",
        "spontaneous speech (most of them are explicitly concerned with written man-machine communication).",
        "The present paper focusses the problem of normalization, i.e. how to define the relation between ill-formed utterances (e.g. 2a.",
        "and 2b.)",
        "and their well-formed 'counterparts' (la.",
        "and lb.).",
        "A sentence is an adequate normalization of an ill-formed utterance, if it corresponds to our intuitions about what the speaker might have intended to say.",
        "This is, of course, not observable, but a request for repetition (which typically does not give rise to a literally repetition in case of an utterance like 2a.)",
        "might serve as a suitable test.",
        "In the present approach normalization is based on solely syntactic heuristics, not because syntactic information is regarded to be sufficient, but as a starting i)oint for further work.",
        "Thus, the normalizations achieved on the basis of these heuristics serve as default interpretations that have to be evaluated using additional information about the linguistic and situational context.",
        "The empirical background is a corpus of authentic German dialogues about block worlds that has been recorded for the study of coherence phenomena (cf. Forschergruppe Koharenz [ed.]",
        "1987).",
        "I will discuss three heuristics that are used in an experimental normalization system, called NOBUGS (NOrmalisierungskomponente im Bielefelder Unifika-tionsbasierten Analysesystem fur Gesprochene Sprache normalization component of a Bielefeld unification-based speech analysis system).",
        "The core of NOBUGS is a left-corner parser that interprets a GPSG-like formalism encoded in DCG notation.",
        "The grammars used with NOBUGS are very restrictive and exclude everything that is beyond the bounds of written standard German.",
        "But in combination with the heuristics I will discuss now the system is capable of handling a wider range of phenomena including morpho-syntactic deviations, explicit repair and ungrammatical repetitions."

        "Morpho-syntactic deviations make up a considerable proportion of errors both in spoken and written German (German has a much more complex inflectional morphology than English).",
        "The basic principle of this approach to normalization is as follows: Try to find out which properties of a given input string make a parse fail and use the given grammatical knowledge to alter the input string minimally so that it is as similar as possible to its initial state but without the properties that caused the failure.",
        "What is meant by that can easily be seen if we consider an example where the property that makes a parse fail is evident, e.g. the string 'John sleep', which lacks the NP-VP-agreement concerning person and number that is required by the following rule: cat S cat NP cat = VP person case e nom person = XI num e X2 person xi num = X2 num = X2 This rule is not applicable to 'John sleep', since there are no lexical entries for 'John' and 'sleep', respectively, that have unifiable specifications for person and number, and this makes the whole parse fail.",
        "The strategy to account for strings like 'John sleep' consists of three steps: Step 1: Collect all lexical entries that match with the words of the input string and generalize them by substituting variables for their morpho-syntactic specifications (case, number, gender etc.).",
        "Step2: Parse the string using the generalized lexical entries instead of the completely specified entries.",
        "Step3: If the parse with generalized specifications is successful, the problem with the input string is mor-pho-syntactic (agreement error or case-assignment violation).",
        "Collect all preterminal categories (most of them still contain variable morpho-syntactic specifications) and try to unify them with full-specified lexical entries.",
        "At least one matching entry will belong to some item different from the corresponding word in the input string.",
        "In that case replace the original word by the matching item.",
        "If there are many different sets of matching entries choose the one that requires the least number of substitutions and output it as the default normalization (if there are many sets of matching entries that require the same least number of substitutions the normalization is ambigous.",
        "In that case output all of them).",
        "Returning to our example string 'John sleep', let us assume that the grammar consists just of the rule stated above and the following lexical entries: John: person 3, num sg, cat m np, case nom sloop: person 3, num pl, cat vp sleeps: person 3, num .",
        "sg, cat vp Generalizing the lexical entries for the input string 'John sleep' will produce two new entries: John: person - VAR1, num VAR2, cat np, case VAR3 sleep: person VAR4, num VAR5, cat - vp A parse using these entries will be successful.",
        "The application of the rule unifies the variable specifications for number and person and instantiates case nominative in the NP.",
        "The preterminal categories resulting from the parse are:",
        "Though the crucial specifications (person and nuns) are still variable the difference is now that there are the same variables in both categories.",
        "The (only) set of lexical entries that match with these preterminal categories requires the replacement of 'sleep' by 'sleeps' and thus 'John sleeps' is the normalization of 'John sleep'.",
        "Note that this strategy is not, in principle, limited to morpho-syntactic features.",
        "It might be useful for phonological and semantic normalization, as well.",
        "gives a grammatical sentence can only be decided by the grammar.",

        "If applied to the utterance 'You put the left one eh nonsense the red one to the left' the first deletion gives 'You put the left the red one to the left' which is not accepted by the parser.",
        "The second alternative tried ('You put the the red one to the left') fails, too.",
