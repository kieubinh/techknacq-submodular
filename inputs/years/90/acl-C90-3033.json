      "text": [
        "The ability to face and resolve problems associated with ill-formedness is fundamental in order to make natural language interfaces usable (see [Carbonell and Hayes, 1983] for a review of the problems of ill-formedness and of techniques used to resolve them).",
        "We shall focus on two phenomena: intersentential ellipsis and coordination (possibly with gaps).",
        "Ellipsis is a very common phenomenon and is frequently encountered in dialogues between persons.",
        "Up to the present, studies on natural language interaction with computers generally highlight the frequency of this phenomenon, (see, for example, [Eastman and McLean, 1981]).",
        "For this reason, ellipsis has received much attention and different solutions have been proposed based on the mechanism used to analyze the sentence: semantic grammars (the LIFER/LADDER system [Hendrix, 1977]), ATN [Kwasny and Sondheimer, 1981, Weischedel and Sondheimer, 1982], or case-frame instantiation (the XCALIBUR system [Carbonell et al., 1983]).",
        "As far as coordination is concerned, it is also frequently considered a phenomenon of ill-formedness for the following reasons: - since every pair of constituents of the same syntactic category may be coordinated, if the grammar specifically included all these possibilities it would greatly increase the size of the grammar itself; - a constituent inside a coordination may have gaps (that is, missing elements) that, in general, are not allowed in constituents of the same type.",
        "Even in the most purely linguistic area, coordination has not received in-depth treatment, if not recently (for example, see [Sag et al., 1984] and [Kaplan and Maxwell, 1988]).",
        "Until the beginning of the 80's almost no system (the most relevant exception being the SYSCONJ module, present in the LUNAR system [Woods, 1973]) has confronted coordination in a generalized manner.",
        "The 80's have seen renewed computational interest in coordination that has brought new efforts (see [Kwasny and Sondheimer, 1981], [Dahl and McCord, 1983], [Fong and Berwick, 1985], [Lesmo and Torasso, 1985], [Kosy, 1986] and [Proudian and Goddeau, 1987]).",
        "In this paper we present a solution to both the problems outlined above (that is, ellipsis and coordination).",
        "The solution is original with respect to those presented in the literature in that it is based on chart parsing [Kaplan, 1973, Kay, 1980], an approach little used to treat ill-formedness until now.t For both problems the solution is based on a strategy that uses the information contained in the structures produced by the parser (as is the case in almost all the work mentioned in this introduction; for a pragmatics-based approach to ellipsis, see [Carberry, 1989]).",
        "Both the solutions proposed have been inserted into WEDNESDAY 2 [Stock, 1989], a chart-based parser used in a dialogue system for Italian; attention has been paid to distinctive aspects of this language (for example, the relative liberty of order inside a single constituent).",
        "The process of building the analysis is based on a sort of unification.",
        "The parser is built so that it may be connected to a semantic (and possibly pragmatic) discrimination component; in this way, the discrimination is carried out incrementally as the syntactic analysis proceeds.",
        "All examples in this paper are in Italian."

        "The algorithm for treatment of ellipsis consists of alternate scanning of the model chart and fragments chart.",
        "When a vertex is found in the model chart from which a cycling edge exits that is of the same category as the inactive edge I' exiting the vertex of the fragments chart upon which it is positioned, then the inactive edge I (generated from the given cycling edge) of the model chart is substituted by the inactive edge I' of the fragments chart.",
        "Thereafter the parser is restarted by the usual mechanism (the substitution concerns not only edge I, but all the inactive edges that that edge subsumes and all the active edges that subsume edge I or some of the edges subsumed by I.",
        "This aspect of the algorithm is consistent with some of the techniques used in [Wiren, 1989]).",
        "In essence the algorithm is expectation-driven, given that the fragment is inserted where there is a cycling edge that wants it.",
        "In this way, the expectations created by the preceding sentence are taken into account to guide the search for a solution to the ellipsis.",
        "Because an agenda is used to manage the chart, the algorithm is sufficiently simple and causes only limited changes in normal functioning of the parser.",
        "There are two different phases: i) activation of the mechanism (that is, the search for the vertex where to insert the first fragment that restarts the usual mechanism); ii) the next phase brings only effects of the modification of the function that selects the tasks contained in the Agenda.",
        "The algorithm uses pointers to the vertices of the two charts: Remaining-ModelChart for the model chart and Remaining-FragmentsChart for the fragments chart, which are initialized at the initial vertex of the respective chart.",
        "First of all, consider the activation phase:",
        "1. for all cycling edges C exiting from the vertex of Remaining-ModelChart, a check is done to determine whether among the inactive edges leaving the vertex of Remaining-FragmentsChart there is one, I', of the same syntactic category as C; if yes, go to point 2, otherwise move Remaining-ModelChart to the next vertex in the model chart and return to the beginning of point I; 2. save the preceding context (what this means will be made clearer at the end of the algorithm formulation); 3. remove the edge I, generated from the cycling edge C, from the model chart (together with those specified above) and put a task into the Agenda that inserts the edge I' into the model chart; 4. move the pointers Remaining-ModelChart and",

        "point 1 after having reestablished the preceding context and having moved Remaining-ModelChart to the next vertex of the model chart.",
        "Now, we analyze the way in which the function that selects the tasks contained in the Agenda is modified:",
        "1. when a task that extends an active edge A with an inactive edge I is to be executed, check whether among the inactive edges leaving the vertex of Remaining-FragmentsChart there is one, I', of the same syntactic category as I; if yes, go to point 3, otherwise go to point 2; 2. move Remaining-ModelChart to the arrival vertex of edge I and exit from the function normally 2 185 executing the task selected; 3. save the preceding context (what this means will be made clearer at the end of the algorithm formulation); 4. the task selected is removed from the Agenda; 5. remove edge I from the model chart (together with those specified above) and put a task into the Agenda that inserts the edge I' into the model chart; 6. move the pointers Remaining-ModelChart and",

        "Some aspects of the backtracking mechanism are now specified (and with them the reason for saving and reestablishing the contexts): backtracking is here intended exclusively as a nondeterministic strategy relative to the insertion of elliptical fragments.",
        "This does not impinge in any way upon the chart mechanism, which continues to provide flexible and efficient nondeterministic management.",
        "Furthermore, intuitively, the ellipsis resolution algorithm will only have to work on a very limited number of fragments, as they occur in man-machine interaction.",
        "This considered, the complexity of the algorithm remains, in practice, within acceptable limits (as well-known for the chart).",

        "Figure 1 shows the model sentence with the relevant cycling edges; Figure 2 shows the inactive edges for Gioacchino and in un affresco di Padova.",
        "The activation phase immediately brings into operation the substitution of the inactive edge that goes from vertex 1 to vertex 2 (Giotto) with the inactive edge of the fragments chart that represents Gioacchino; after this substitution and opportune changes to Remaining-ModelChart and to Remaining-FragmentsChart, the parser is restarted, but it fails because of a violation of semantic restrictions.",
        "This failure causes backtracking to begin and therefore to seek another vertex in which to make the substitution.",
        "This vertex is number 3, from which an inactive edge terminating in 4 that has recognized S. Francesco exits.",
        "This edge is then substituted with the inactive edge of the fragments chart that represents Gioacchino.",
        "The parser works normally until Remaining-ModelChart points to vertex 4 and the task selection function must extend the active S edge with an inactive PP edge (which extends from vertex 4 to vertex 9).",
        "In this case it can substitute the inactive PP edge [in un' operadi Assisi] with in un affresco di Padova and therefore restart the chart, which reaches the conclusion of the analysis.",

        "Expansion is much simpler - it is convenient to allow adjunctive adverbs to be inserted only at a fixed position in the sentence (e.g., extreme left), with obvious advantages of efficiency for the parser.",
        "We conclude this section with a couple of remarks.",
        "The first one concerns preferences for the insertion of fragments: for many kinds of dialogues it seems reasonable to use a heuristics that favors the insertion of the elements of the fragments chart all at the same level inside one constituent.",
