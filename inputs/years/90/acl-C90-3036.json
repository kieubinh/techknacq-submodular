        "Parsing a sentence means reading the input text into an internal representation, which makes the relations of the constituents explicit.",
        "In symbolic parsing, the result is usually a semantic network structure, e.g. a conceptual dependency representation [17; 3], or a syntactic parse tree augmented with semantic restrictions [13; 9].",
        "The advantage of this approach is that sentences with arbitrary complexity can be parsed and represented.",
        "However, processing knowledge must be hand-coded with specific examples in mind.",
        "Rules for expectations, defaults and generalizations must be explicitly programmed.",
        "The localist connectionist models [2; 20; 5; 1; 19; 7] provide more general mechanisms for inferencing and give a more plausible account of the parsing process in terms of human performance.",
        "However, these networks need to be carefully crafted for each example.",
        "The main advantage of the distributed connectionist approach [8; 18; 12] is that processing is learned frorn examples.",
        "Expectations about unspecified constituents arise automatically from the processing mechanism, and generalizations into new inputs result automatically from the representations.",
        "Any statistical regularity in the training examples is automatically utilized in making inferences.",
        "The result in distributed parsing at the sentence level is",
        "e.g. an assembly-based case-role representation of the sentence [8; 10].",
        "The output layer of the network is divided into partitions, each representing a case role, and distributed activity patterns in the assemblies indicate the words filling these roles.",
        "Representing complex structures is problematic in the distributed approach [6; 15].",
        "The proposed sentence processing architectures can only deal with simple, straightforward sentences.",
        "Case-role analysis is feasible only when the sentences consist of single acts, so that unique case role can be assigned for each constituent.",
        "The approach can be extended and roles reserved for attributes of the constituents also.",
        "However, sentences with relative clauses remain intractable.",
        "A hierachical PDP architecture for parsing, representing and paraphrasing sentences with multiple hierarchical relative clauses is described in this paper.",
        "Each relative clause is itself an act, and has its own case-role representation.",
        "The whole sentence is represented as a collection of these acts.",
        "The relations of the acts are implicit in their content, rather than explicit in the structure of the representation.",
        "The original complex hierarchical sentence, as well as a simplified paraphrase of it, can be produced from the list of the act representations."

        "interpretation of it is immediately formed in terms of case roles.",
        "Each act fragment is parsed independently from others.",
        "A higher-level process (the sentence parser) keeps track of the recursive relations of the act fragments and combines them into complete representations.",
        "It also ties the different acts together by determining the referents of the relative pronouns.",
        "The acts are stored in the memory as separate facts, without explicit high-level structure.",
        "The structure is represented in the facts thernself, e.g. two acts have the same agent, the agent of one act is the patient of another etc.",
        "Sentences with relative clauses can be produced from this unstructured internal representation.",
        "In other words, the recursive structure is a property of the language, not the information itself.",
        "Internally, the information can be represented in a parallel, canonical form, which makes all information directly accessible.",
        "In communication through narrow channels, i.e. in language, it is necessary to transform the knowledge into a sequential form [12].",
        "Parallel dependencies in the knowledge are then coded with recursion.",
        "Generating output is seen as a task separate from parsing.",
        "Sentence generation is performed by a different module and learned separately.",
        "The same module can learn to paraphrase the same internal representation in different ways, e.g. as a single sentence consisting of relative clauses, or as a sequence of several simple sentences.",
        "What actually gets generated depends on the connection weights of this module.",
        "It would be possible to add a higher-level decision-making network to the system, which controls the connection weight values in the sentence generator network through multiplicative connections [14].",
        "A decision about the style, detail etc.",
        "of the paraphrase would be made by this module, and its output would assign the appropriate function to the sentence generator.",
        "The model exhibits certain features of human performance.",
        "As recursion gets deeper, the sentence networks have to keep more information in their sequence memories, and the performance degrades.",
        "Moreover, tail recursion (e.g.",
        "The woman blamed the man, who hit the girl, who blamed the boy) is easier than relative clauses in the middle of the sentence (e.g.",
        "The woman, who the boy, who the girl blamed, hit, blamed the man), because the latter case involves more steps in the sequence, taxing the memory capacity more.",
        "Note that in symbolic modeling, the depth or the type of the recursion makes absolutely no difference.",
        "The scale-up prospects of the architecture seem fairly good.",
        "The simple data used in the experiments did not come close to exhausting the processing power of the system.",
        "Larger vocabulary, more case roles and sentences consisting with more acts could well be processed.",
        "It seems possible to represent a wide range of acts by their case-role assignments.",
        "Corn-plex attributes, such as PPs, can be represented as additional relative clauses (e.g.",
        "The man with the hat... 4 The man, who has the hat...).",
        "Currently, the system depends on commas to separate the clause fragments.",
        "This is not a very serious limitation, as segmenting could he based other markers such as the relative pronouns.",
        "A more fundamental limitation, characteristic to PDP systems in general, is that the system needs to be trained with a good statistical sample of the input/output space.",
        "It does not have an abstract representation of the clause structure, and it cannot generalize into sentence structures it has not seen before.",
        "As sentences become more complex, a mechanism for maintaining unique identities for the words is needed.",
        "For example, in representing The man, who helped the boy, blamed the man, who hit the girl it is crucial to indicate that the man-who-helped is the same as the man-who-blamed, but different from the man-who-hit.",
        "A possible technique for doing this has been proposed in [12].",
        "The representation of the word could consist of two parts: the content part, which is developed by FGREP and codes the processing properties of the word, and an ID part, which is unique for each separate instance of the word.",
        "The ID approximates sensory grounding of the word, and allows us to tag the different instances and keep them separate."
