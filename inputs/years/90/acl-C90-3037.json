        "For some time there has been interest in the idea of parsing as deduction.",
        "Here we present a grammatical formalism, 'Axiomatic Grammar', which is based upon a small number of linguistically motivated axioms and deduction rules.",
        "Each axiom or rule combines a 'category' with a string of words to form a further category.",
        "This contrasts with the usual 'treestructure' approach to syntactic analysis where constituents are combined with each other to form a further constituent.",
        "We describe a grammar for English which has a good coverage of 'non-constituent' coordination.",
        "The grammar has been integrated with a toy semantics, and has been implemented in a left-to-right parser with incremental semantic interpretation.",
        "The parser does not suffer from spurious ambiguity."

        "Coordination is a particularly troublesome phenomenon to account for in theories of syntax based upon phrase structure rules.",
        "Acceptable examples of `non-constituent' coordination such as:",
        "(1) John gave Mary a book and Peter a paper (2) Ben likes and Fred admires Mary",
        "have led some to abandon a single level of grammatical description, and others to abandon phrase structure rules.",
        "An example of the former approach is Modifier Structure Grammar (Dahl and McCord, 1983), which was justified as follows: ... it appears that a proper and general treatment must recognise coordination as a 'inetagrammaticar construction, in the sense that metarules, general system operations, or 'second-pass' operations such as transformations, are needed for its formulation.",
        "parallels with the SYSCONJ system (Woods, 1973)).",
        "In order to parse sentence (2), the state of the parser at the point immediately before 'Fred' is matched to the state immediately before 'Ben'.",
        "'Fred admires' is then parsed, and the resulting state is merged with the state after parsing 'Ben likes'.",
        "The alternative approach to dealing with coordination uses a single level of grammatical description, but uses a weaker notion of constituency than phrase structure grammar.",
        "It is presently exemplified by proposals to extend Categorial Grammar with Forward Composition, the Product operator, Subject Type-Raising etc.",
        "Categorial Grammar, just like phrase structure grammar, is based upon the combination of one or more constituents to form a further constituent.",
        "In order to deal with coordination, the category (X \\ X)/X1 is assigned to the conjunction, or, more usually, a phrase structure rule is invoked of the form:",
        "In either case, each conjunct has to be assigned a category.",
        "Extensions to Categorial Grammar provide a greater coverage of coordination phenomena by allowing a greater number of strings to form categories.",
        "For example, to accept both (2) and (3),",
        "(3) Ben likes Mary and admires Jane",
        "an extended grammar must allow 'Ben likes' to form a category which can combine with 'Mary' to form a sentence, and 'likes Mary' to form a category which can combine with 'Ben' to form a sentence.",
        "The consequence of this is that the simple sentence 'Ben likes Mary' can be assigned at least two different syntactic structures: (Ben (likes Mary)) or ((Ben likes) Mary), winch both correspond to the same reading (the sentence is spuriously ambiguous according to the grammar).",
        "Axiomatic Grammar avoids the problem of spurious ambiguity by avoiding the need to assign categories to conjuncts.",
        "Although the formalism was developed during research into extended Categorial Grammar, the separation of grammatical information into axioms and rules makes its treatment of coordination look similar to that in a metalevel approach such as Modifier Structure Grammar.",
        "This",
        "similarity is easiest to show if we introduce the central notion of 'category transition' through the idea of state transition.",
        "Consider a left-to-right parse of the sentence 'a man sits' based upon a phrase structure grammar including the rules: s np vp np det n Initially we start in a state expecting a sentence (which we can encode as a list (s)).",
        "After absorbing the determiner, 'a', we can move to a new state which expects a noun followed by a verb-phrase (encoded as a list (n,vp)).",
        "Following the absorption of `man', we can move to a state expecting just a verb-phrase, and following the absorption of 'sits' we have a successful parse since there is no more input and nothing more expected.",
        "The transitions between the encodings of the states are as follows:",
        "(`a:det' means that the word 'a' is a determiner) Instead of deriving these transitions from the phrase structure rules, consider directly supplying axioms of the form:",
        "If constituent names are replaced by category specifications, generalisations become possible.",
        "The three axioms:",
        "(`np/n' is an np requiring a noun on its right, and `s\\rip' is a sentence requiring an np on its left) are instantiations of the axioms:",
        "('X' is the head and 'R.', the tail of the list encoding the state.",
        "`o' denotes concatenation, so '(n,s\\np)' is equivalent to '(n) â€¢ (s\\np)') The 'encoded states' will roughly correspond to `principal' categories in Axiomatic Grammar, and the axioms above to the axioms of Prediction and Composition.",
        "The rule for coordination in Axiomatic Grammar is stated in terms of principal category transition.",
        "For example, the acceptability of sentence (2) is dependent upon a proof that the two strings \"Ben likes\" and \"Fred admires\" both take us from the initial category (corresponding to a parsing state expecting a sentence) to a second category (corresponding to a state expecting a noun-phrase).",
        "The rule will be stated formally after a general description of the formalism."

        "Axiomatic Grammar is mainly lexically based, with lexical entries containing both subcategorisation and order information.",
        "An association of a word with a 'lexical' category is given by an expression of the form: word: LEX-CAT Each lexical category is a feature valued structure.",
        "The features of interest are 'cat', which gives the base type of the category (`s',`rip', or 'n'), and 'left' and 'right' which contain lists of 'arguments'.",
        "Each argument is itself a lexical category.",
        "Categories are complete if the argument lists are empty.",
        "As an example, consider the lexical entries for the determiner `the' and the transitive verb 'likes':",
        "We can read the category for 'likes' as follows: given a complete noun-phrase on the left and a complete noun-phrase on the right, we can form a complete sentence.",
        "It is worth comparing this category with the category generally assigned to 'likes' by a Categorial Grammar:",
        "The categories differ in two respects.",
        "Firstly, the Categorial Grammar category not only provides information as to what is on the left, and what is on the right, but also determines the order in which each argument is to be absorbed (in the above, the argument on the right must be absorbed first, followed by the argument on the left).",
        "Secondly, whereas the Categorial Grammar category would be regarded as having the syntactic type `np---*(np--->s)', the Ax- iomatic Grammar category is regarded as having the base type 's'.",
        "This difference has a bearing on the treatment of modifiers (discussed later).",
        "When a string of words is absorbed it causes a transition between principal categories.",
        "A principal category is again a feature structure, the feature of interest being the 'right' feature i.e. the list of arguments2 required on the right.",
        "A parse of a sentence consists of a proof that, starting with a principal category which requires a sentence, we can end",
        "up with a complete principal category.",
        "For example, to prove that 'Ben sits' is a sentence we prove the statement3",
        "Henceforth, the convention is adopted that left or right argument lists which are not specified are empty.",
        "This allows us to rewrite the statement above rather more compactly as:",
        "A proof of a parse is performed using rules and axioms.",

        "7 At this stage no restrictions have been imposed upon the ordering of the rules, and more than one proof tree is possible.",
        "However, it is relatively trivial to prove the existence of a normal proof strategy which supplies a single proof tree for a given sentence and a possible semantics (Milward, 1990).",
        "8Parentheses are used as a shorthand.",
