        "The data flow in natural language generation (NLG) starts with a 'world' state, represented by structures of an application program (e.g., an expert system) that has text generation needs and an impetus to produce a natural language text.",
        "The output of generation is a natural language text.",
        "The generation process involves the tasks of a) delimiting the content of the eventual text, b) planning its structure, c) selecting lexical, syntactic and word order means of realizing this structure and d) actually realizing the textusing the latter.",
        "In advanced generation systems these processes are treated not in a monolithic way, but rather as components of a large, modular generator.",
        "NLG researchers experiment with various ways of delimiting the modules of the generation process and control architectures to drive these modules (see, for instance, McKeown, 1985, Hovy, 1987 or Meteor, 1989).",
        "But regardless of the decisions about general (intermodular) or local (intramodular) control flow, knowledge structures have to be defined to support processing and facilitate communication among the modules.",
        "The natural language generator DiocENEs(e.g., Niren-burg et al., 1989) has been originally designed for use in machine translation.",
        "This means that the content delimitation stage is unnecessary, as the set of meanings to be realized by the generator is obtained in machine translationas a result of source text analysis.",
        "The first processing component in DIOGENES is, therefore, its text planner which, takes as input a text meaning representation (TMR) and a set of static pragmatic factors (similar to Hovy's (1987) rhetorical goals) and produces a text plan (TP), a structure containing information about the order and boundaries of target language sentences; the decisions about reference realization and lexical selection.1 At the next stage, a set of semantics-to-syntax mapping rules are used to produce a set of target-language syntactic structures (we are using the f-structures of LFG see, e.g., Nirenburg and Levin, 1989).",
        "Finally, a syntactic realizer produces a target language text from the set of f-structures.",
        "To produce texts of adequate quality, natural language generation needs a sufficiently expressive input language.",
        "In this paper we discuss several important aspects of the knowledge and the processing at the text planning stage of a generation system.",
        "First, we describe a comprehensive language processing paradigm which underlies work on both generation and analysis of natural language in our environment.",
        "Next, we illustrate the features of our meaning representation languages, the text meaning representation language TAMERLAN and the text plan representation language TPL.",
        "Finally, we describe the mechanism of text planning in DIOGENES and illustrate the formalism and the strategy for acquiring text planning rules."

        "Understanding a text involves determining its propositional content as well as detecting pragmatic meaning elements, those pertaining to the speech situation and to the nature of the discourse producer's goals.2 A high-quality natural language generator must be capable of expressing the entire set of meaning types in a natural language.",
        "The input to a generator must, therefore, express all of the kinds of meanings to be rendered in the output text.",
        "This requires a convenient knowledge representation scheme for the input, as well as actual knowledge (in the form of heuristic selection rules) about interactions between the input and elements of the output.",
        "The acquisition of this knowledge must be informed by systematic field work on such linguistic phenomena as focus, topic and comment, speech acts, speaker attitudes, or reference-related phenomena (anaphora, deixis, ellipsis, definite description, etc.).",

        "Being able to achieve goals through communication can be seen as broadening the range of tools an agent has for attaining its goals.",

        "When the decision is made to try to achieve a goal by rhetorical means, one of the available rhetorical plans corresponding to this goal is selected for processing.",
        "Based on knowledge recorded in this plan structure, the agent produces a new, language-dependent, structure, a text plan, as an intermediate step in producing a text.",
        "The process of natural language understanding in our approach will be modeled as a plan recognition process in a similar conceptual architecture.",
        "In understanding, it is necessary to determine not only the propositional content but also the illocutionary force of each utterance.",

        "producer's goals, in order to decide if an utterance constitutes a direct or an indirect speech act, calculating any added non-propositional, implicit elements of meaning.",
        "In generation, as we have seen, the task is to decide, on the basis of the communication situation and knowledge of the producer's intentions, whether to achieve a given goal via rhetorical means.",
        "If so, it is also necessary to decide whether it will be realized in the target text directly or indirectly.",
        "If a direct speech act is chosen, one must further determine whether to lexicalize the speech act through the use of a performative verb (e.g., promise, order, etc.).",
        "The treatment of speech acts is thus always accomplished using links between the set of producer's current goals and the propositional content.",
        "The order of operations, however, differs depending on whether this treatment is a part of analysis or generation.",
        "To illustrate, suppose an agent is cold and has a goal to be warm.",
        "To achieve this goal, we construct a plan tree, with the goal he-warm as the root, and various plans of action as sub-trees (see Figure 1).",
        "In analysis, the tree is traversed bottom-up: the consumer has direct access to the input utterance and uses it as a clue to reconstruct the producer's goals.",
        "If complete extraction of meaning is to be achieved, it is crucial to know whether an utterance realizes a direct or an indirect speech act, In generation, the tree will be traversed top-down.",
        "If the producer's choice is to achieve his goal through rhetorical means, he can generate any of the following three utterances:",

        "(2) Close the window, please.",
        "(3) It's cold in here.",
        "Now, even though (3) differs in propositional meaning from (1) and (2), the distinction between direct speech act (1) or (2) and indirect speech act (3) does not matter from the point of view of the producer's goals.",
        "In TAMERLAN the representation of both Close the window and It is cold in here will contain a pointer (in TAMERLAN the filler of the producer-intention slot of every clause frame) to the same plan node, in this case, 'request-action.' The fact that in the above utterances, the request-action is realized as a command or a statement pertains to text, not domain planning."

        "â€¢ modifying the consumer's model of the producer by stating facts (including opinions) about the latter which are not in principle observable by the consumer â€¢ modifying the consumer's opinions by stating producer's opinions about facts of the world (the latter can in principle be observed by the consumer)",
        "The above distinctions only become visible if one decides to represent attitudes overtly.",
        "Once this decision is made, it becomes clear that it brings about better description possibilities for additional linguistic phenomena, such as the argumentative structure of discourse.",
        "It has been observed (e.g., Anscombre and Ducrot, 1983) that texts have a well-defined argumentative structure which a) reflects the producer's current goals and b) influences such processes as the ordering of text components and lexical selection in generation.",

        "Sets of such lexical items may have to be considered equivalent from a purely semantic point of view, but different in a facet of their pragmatic effect known as argumentative orientation.",
