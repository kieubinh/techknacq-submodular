        "While commensurability is a desirable property, and there is a clear need for a way to compare alternate explanations, it appears that a single scalar measure is not enough to account for all types of processing.",

        "Conjuncts corresponding to \"new\" information have a low cost of assumability, while those corresponding to \"given\" information have a higher cost, since to assume them is to fail to find the proper connection to mutual knowledge.",

        "Below are two interpretations of L. The first just assumes the entire logical form for $23, while the second applies the rules and shares the enclosure(y) predicate common to one of the definitions of pen(y) and the definition of in (x , y) to arrive at a $20.80 solution.",

        "'Translating \"lube-oil alarm\" as (3o)lubeoil(o) is suspect; in the case of an alarm still in the box, there is not yet any particular oil for which it is the alarm.",
        "that does not disambiguate \"pen\" is not just making an assumption – rather it is failing altogether.",
        "One could accommodate this problem by writing disambiguation rules where the sum of the left-hand-side components is less than 1.",
        "Thus, the system will always prefer to find some interpretation for \"pen\", rather than leaving it ambiguous.",
        "• In the case of vagueness rather than ambiguity, one would probably want the left-hand-side to total greater than 1.",
        "For example, in \"He saw her duck\", the word \"duck\" is ambiguous between a water fowl and a downward movement, and any candidate solution should be forced to decide between the two meanings.",
        "In contrast, \"lie\" is vague between a boy and a man, but it is not necessary for a valid interpretation to make this choice.",

        "All three would get a cost of $20.8.",
        "To choose among these three, we would have to add knowledge about the likelihood of these three things being in boxes, or add knowledge about the relative frequencies of the three senses of \"pen\".",
        "For example, we could change the numbers as follows:",
        "This has the effect of making the writing implement sense slightly more likely than the fenced enclosure sense, and much more likely than the female swan sense.",
        "These rules maintain the desirable property of commensurability, but the numbers are now even more overloaded.",
        "Hobbs et al.",
        "already are giving the numbers responsibility for both \"probabilities\" and \"semantic relatedness\", and now we have shown they must account for word frequency information, and both the cost of assumptions and the quality of the explanation, the two measures needed to control search.",
        "As our previous criticisms have shown, a single number cannot represent even the cost and quality of an explanation, much less these additional factors.",
        "Also note that to constrain search, it is important to consider bottom-up clues, as in (Charniak 1986) and (Norvig 1987).",
        "It would be a mistake to use the rules given here in a strictly top-down manner, just because they are reminiscent of Prolog rules.",
        "(3) There is no notion of a \"good\" or \"bad\" interpretation, except as an epiphenomenon of the interpretation rules.",
        "In the \"pen\" example, the difference between failing completely to understand \"pen\" and properly disambiguating it to fenced-enclosure is less than 10% of the total cost.",
        "The numbers in the rules could be changed",
        "to increase this difference, but it would still be a quatiti-tative rather than qualitative difference.",
        "The problem is that there are at least three reasons why we might want to maintain ambiguity: because we are unsure of the cause of an event, because it is so mundane as to not need an explanation, and because it is so unbelievable that there is no explanation.",
        "This theory does not distinguish these cases.",
        "The theory has no provision for saying \"I don't understand--the only interpretation I can find is a faulty one,\" and then looking harder for a better interpretation.",
        "(4) There is no way to enforce a penalty worse than the cost of an assumption.",
        "Consider the sentence \"Mary said she had killed herself.\" The logical form is something like: sal/(Mhey, x)\" A x kill(M ary, Mary)\".",
        "Thus, for $6 we can just assume the logical form, without noticing the inherent contradiction.",
        "Now let's consider some rules.",
        "We've collapsed most of the interesting parts of these rules into etc predicates, leaving just the parts relevant to the contradiction:",
        "We've ignored time here, but the intent is that the alive predicate is concerned with the time interval or situation after the killing, including the time of the saying.",
        "Now, an alternative interpretation of L is:",
        "Presumably there should be some penalty (finite or infinite) for deriving a contradiction, so this interpretation will total more than $6.",
        "The problem is there is no way to propagate this contradiction back up to the first interpretation, where we just assumed both clauses.",
        "We would like to penalize that interpretation, too, so that it costs more than $6, but there is no way to do so.",
        "A solution to this problem is to legislate that rather than finding a solution to the logical form of a sentence, L, the hearer must find a solution to the larger set of propositions, I', where L' is derived from L by some process of direct, \"obvious\" inference.",
        "We do riot want the full deductive closure from L, of course, but we want to allow for some amount of automatic forward chaining from the input.",
        "(5) We would like to be able to go on and find alternative explanations, perhaps one where Mary is speaking from the afterworld, or she is lying, or the speaker is lying.",
        "One could imagine rules for truthful and untruthful saying, and such rules could be applied to Mary's speech act.",
        "However, since the goal of the interpretation process is \"providing the best explanation of why the sentences would be true,\" it does not seem that we could use the rules to consider the possibility of the speaker being untruthful.",

        "In Charniak and Goldman (1989a), the coherence of stories is explained by a (probabilistic) assumption of spatio-temporal locality between events mentioned in adjacent sentences in the text, Thus the story would be treated roughly as if it were: jack got a rope.",

Charniak and Goldman (1989b) go on to propose a theory of \"mention\" rather than a theory of coincidence, but they do not develop this alternative.",
        "(3) It seems that for many inferences, frequency in the world does not play an important role at all.",

        "Charniak and Goldman's system is like an assumption-based truth-maintenance system (ATMS) that keeps track of all possible worlds in one grand model, but needs a separate interpretation process to extract consistent solutions.",
        "Thus, the system does not really do interpretation to the level that could lead to decisions.",
        "Rather, it provides evidence upon which decisions can be based.",
        "Both approaches are problematic.",

        "In chess, if I play optimally and my opponent plays sub-optimally, I win.",

        "Put another way, there is a clear \"evolutionary\" advantage for optimal chess strategies, but once language has evolved to the point where communication is possible, there is no point for a hearer to try to change his interpretation strategy to derive what an optimal speaker would have uttered to an optimal hearer–because there are no such optimal speakers.",
        "Indeed, there is an advantage for communication strategies that can be computed quickly, allowing the participants to spend time on other tasks.",
