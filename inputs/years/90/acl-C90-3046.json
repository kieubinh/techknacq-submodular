        "Furthermore, even when utterances are not grammatical, it is impractical for a parser to reject them because of their ungrammaticality.",
        "Therefore, the following two desiderata can be considered for such sentence analyses: to select plausible candidates from among many possible candidates and to integrate, in a uniform manner, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic processing.",
