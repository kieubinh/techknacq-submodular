        "One useful way to look at computational morphology and phonology is in terms of transductions, that is, nary word relations definable by the element-wise concatenation of n-tuple labels along paths in a finite directed labeled graph.",
        "For instance, we can take one member of such a relation to be the spelling of an inflected form, another member to be the corresponding lemma, another to be a string representing its morphosyntactic features, another to represent its pronunciation, and so forth.",
        "Inspired by the (unpublished) work of Kaplan and Kay (ongoing since the late 1970's), and that of Koskennierni in [12], many researchers have used binary word relations to represent \"underlying\" and \"surface\" forms in the morphophonology of words.",
        "Much of the interest of this work has been focused on methods to combine multiple two-tape automata, which may be composed or run in parallel in order to compute the desired binary relation.",
        "In this paper, we take a somewhat different approach to defining and computing word relations, and discuss its application in a morphological processor for Spanish orthographic words that covers more than forty millions forms generable from the approximately 55,000 basic words in the Collins Spanish Dictionary ([3]) 1.",
        "The main advantage of this approach is the extreme simplicity both of its data structures and of their interpretation.",
        "As a result, an interpreter is easy to implement; time and/or space op.",
        "timization issues in the implementation are straight.",
        "forward to define; at the same time, it is extremely easy to compile traditional morphological information into the required form, at least for languages like Spanish that can be fairly well modeled in terms of the concatenation of stems and affixes.",
        "As is usually the case in automata-based approaches, the system treats analysis and generation symmetrically, and the same description can be run with equal facility in either direction.",
        "Define2 an nary nondeterministic finite automaton as a 5-tuple A=(Q,g1,F,E,H) where Q is a finite non-empty set of states, qi is a designated start state, F is a set of designated final states, E is a finite non-empty alphabet, and H is a finite subset of {Q x (E*)\" x Q}, where (E*)\" is the set of n-tuples of (possibly empty) words over E. A can be thought of as a labeled directed graph, whose nodes are elements of Q, and whose edges are elements of H, each such edge being labeled with the appropriate n-tuple of words.",
        "The component-wise concatenation of labels along every path that begins in qi and ends in an element of F defines a set of n-tuples, R C (E5)\", which is the relation accepted by A.",
        "As a practical matter, we generally want to run a program that (explicitly or implicitly) searches this graph in order to find all the n-tuples in R with some interesting property, say those corresponding",
        "to forms whose surface spelling is the string w, or those corresponding to the first person plural imperfect subjunctive of such-and-such a verb.",
        "Depending on the structure of H and the property selected, the search will be harder or easier.",
        "For the stem-and-affix kind of morphology exemplified by Spanish, the natural structure for H is quite easy to search.",
        "We do not have space to discuss search methods here, but will simply observe that a non-optimal method devised for convenience in another experiment ([6]) processes several hundred Spanish words per second on a Sun4.",
        "For the application discussed in this paper, we want to relate inflected forms, lemmas, and morphosyntactic features, so that the elements of R should be 3-tuples like:",
        "Since most Spanish words consist of a stem, which mainly specifies the lemma, and a set of affixes that mainly specify the morphosyntactic features, it is appropriate to use 2-tuples made by concatenating the second and third elements.",
        "The basis of our runtime system is the arc list H. For a large lexicon, it is inconvenient to write this list by hand, and so we compile it from a lexical table that reflects more directly the way that morphological information is represented in a standard dictionary, such as the Collins dictionary we began with.",
        "The program interprets recursively all the possible arcs of the lists.",
        "Therefore, more than one analyzed or generated form is given.",
        "For instance, the analysis for the input word \"retirada\" is of the form: retirar past participle feminine singular retirado adjective feminine singular retirada noun feminine singular"

        "For instance, each verb headword in the Collins dictionary is given an index that specifies one of 62 conjugation classes.",
        "Based on this information, the arc-list compiler calculates the set of stem al-lomorphs necessary for that verb's inflection, along with the set of endings that each stem allomorph selects.",
        "Spanish verbs have from one to five orthographic stem allomorphs.",
        "When the verb is regular there is only one stem, like \"cambi-\" in \"cambiar\" (to change).",
        "An irregular verb may have up to five stems, like \"ten-\", \"teng-\", \"tien-\", \"tend\", \"tuv-\" for the verb \"tener\" (to have).",
        "This is common in Romance languages (see Tzoukermann 1986 for French).",
        "These different stems are the result of morphophonological changes occuring during the verbal flexion, usually related to the stress implications of the verbal ending or to the features of its initial vowel.",
        "Depending on the conjugation class, the character string corresponding to the verb lemma is subjected to one or more rewriting rules.",

        "Some verbs are subject to one type of rewriting rule such as in (a) (c) above, and consequently produce one additional stem allomorph.",

        "Some other verbs, less frequent in number' but more frequent in actual use, are subject to two rewriting rules and need a more complex treatment.",
        "In \"forzar\" (to force), the morphophonological rule combines with the othographic one and produces a distribution of four stems, such as \"forz-\", \"fore\" \"fuerc-\" , \"fuerz-\" .",
        "The same phenomenon occurs for \"rogar\" (to beg) with the sterns \"rog-\", \"rogu-\", \"rueg-\", \"ruegu-\".",
        "For some verbs of the second group in \"-er\", the stem production is less predictable; for instance \"tener\" presents five sterns \"ten-\", \"teng-\" , \"tien-\", \"tend-\" , \"tuv-\" .",
        "Notice that some of them such as \"teng-\" do not follow the type of morphophonological rules mentioned above.",
