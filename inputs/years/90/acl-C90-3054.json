        "This results in a set of possible interpretations which correspond to acceptable sequences of morphemes recognized in the word (3).",
        "Words (or parts of complex words) which are not in the dictionary will be assigned the category UNK (for UNKnown).",

      "text": [
        "The DEFAULTER system consists of three modules:",
        "(1) a BASIC module containing language-independent functions (like table manipulation, dictionary checking, creating defaulted entries in METAL format, general string manipulation, etc.).",
        "Furthermore, the basic module contains the necessary information about what features (of the set defined for METAL) should not be copied from entries that are already in the dictionary, but should get new values for the particular word in question.",
        "(2) for each language, a language-dependent module containing functions whose algorithms depend on the language involved.",
        "(3) for each language, a set of tables containing language-dependent information in a declarative way.",
        "The smartness of the system",
        "depends largely on their completeness and degree of refinedness.",
        "There are three major types of tables: (3.1) STANDARD-ENTRIES-TABLES, containing for each category the minimal feature-value information that has to be in the lexicon.",
        "(3.2) CONTROL-TABLES, containing for each category the functions to be applied for trying to find a related root form in the lexicon.",
        "(3.3) ENDINGS-TABLES, containing for each category defaulted the endings that allow one to fill in the values for specific features (see Lemmens 1988).",
        "An entry in the table has the following general structure:",
        "(3.4) beside these three major tables, the system needs to know about the linguistically motivated ways to find the root form of a",
        "morphologically complex word.",
        "For verbs, nouns, adjectives and adverbs (subject to productive morphological processes), the system has exhaustive lists of derivational prefixes it will try to match with the word to be defaulted.",
        "If these prefixes require that certain defaulted values be changed, this will be stored in additional conversion tables for overriding default information (4).",
        "Off-line defaulting plays a major role in the INTERCODER subsystem, a window and menu-based interactive coding tool that hides the internal representation of information in the lexicons from the user 4nd presents it in a more friendly way.",
        "Secondly, developers of the METAL system can simply default files with words and create a new file with defaulted entries.",
        "These files can then be edited with any type of editor to correct and complete the entries before adding them to the lexicons."

      "text": [
        "Most problems with off-line defaulting occur at level 1, when the word takes over certain features from its morphologically related basic form, while this is incorrect.",
        "Unfortunately, these errors are hard to predict.",
        "At level 2 (when defaulting can only resort to the endings-tables), errors are mostly a mere consequence of incompleteness in these tables.",
        "These errors are usually easier to detect because they are more striking (e.g. when they lead to the creation of several impossible allomorphs for a word)."

        "Even if the attempt at on-line defaulting (using endings information and suffix-stripping) is incapable of disambiguating categorially, at least partial disambiguation may be possible, leaving the system with a minimum of acceptable guesses of a category plus the associated feature-value information for the word involved (noun and verb, for instance)."

      "text": [
        "The earlier on-line defaulting approach consisted of calling a category-guessing function in the test part of three UNK-rewriting morphosyntactic rules, viz. NO -> UNK, ADJ -> UNK, and VB -> UNK.",
        "The category-guessing function took the form of the unknown word as input, and returned either NO, ADJ, VB, or NIL, depending on whether it could predict the unknown to be a noun, adjective or verb respectively (using lists of",
        "derivational and inflectional suffixes in the process).",
        "If the guess-cat function returned NIL, the word was assumed to be a noun (the catchall default).",
        "The function applied a simplified right-to-left morphological analysis algorithm, trying to find an acceptable pair of a derivational and an inflectional suffix for a particular category.",
        "This approach has a few shortcomings: (1) It is a single-category defaulting scheme: the guess-cat function only returns one guess, and leaves it at that.",
        "Furthermore, the guessing process will not be useful for languages with a high degree of categorial ambiguity.",
        "(2) Guess-cat only returns the categorial information and no specific feature-value information, whereas the form of the unknown word may reveal much more specific feature-value information.",
        "(3) The parser will always try the three UNK-rewriting rules (and call the guess-cat function at least three times with the same string), though only one of the three rules can succeed.",

        "As far as further research into off-line defaulting is concerned, we will be looking at the potential of the approach for defaulting transfer lexicon entries (and not only monolingual ones).",

        "If we knew about a correspondence between Dutch on and a French adjective-deriving prefix with the same meaning (say, mat-), we could first default monolingual Dutch ongelukkig on the basis of gelukkig, then look at the transfer for gelukkig (heureux), and default the monolingual French malheureux, as well as the transfer entry ongelukkig -> malheureux.",
        "Of course, such an approach relies heavily on unique mappings of phenomena across languages, which will rarely be the case.",
        "For on-, for instance, onjuist (incorrect) does not correspond to *malcorrect, but incorrect.",
        "Even in these cases, a translation could be suggested, possibly accompanied by alternative prefixes of the target language with the same meaning.",
        "As to on-line defaulting, the current approach is more or less stable for Dutch and French, but we are still refining the strip-abd-match algorithm for optimal results.",
        "For the other languages in the set of METAL language•pairs (German, English, Spanish), we will look into the usefulness and the feasibility of some-categories on-line defaulting, and see if interesting tables can be constructed for these languages as well.",
