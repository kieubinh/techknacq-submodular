        "Since December 1986, MIK, the Japan Broadcasting Corporation, has been conducting two-channel, direct satellite broadcasting using Japan's BS-2b broadcasting satellite.",
        "The two satellite channels now have 24-hour nationwide TV broadcasting services.",
        "The core of the services on Channel 1 is \"World News,\" in which news from across the globe is broadcast.",
        "The languages spoken in NHK's World News are English, French, German, Italian, Russian, Korean, and Chinese.",
        "Urgent and important news has simultaneous interpretation services.",
        "In usual cases, however, services only superimpose Japanese subtitles on the TV screen.",
        "Actually, more than 50 bilingual translators prepare a manuscript by transcribing and translating the original news.",
        "All the work must be done in a limited time, even at midnight due to the time difference between Japan and other countries.",
        "A machine translation system was introduced to make easier this daily work.",
        "As a first step, the English World News has been experimentarily broadcast, about 5 minutes a day, using the Japanese translation provided by the MT system.",
        "We think this is cultivating a new possibility of machine translation in Japan Pl.",
        "2 Satellite Broadcasting and Machine Translation Usually the generation of the subtitles proceeds as follows: 1) a bilingual translator prepares a manuscript by transcribing and translating the original news; 2) a supervisor examines the manuscript; and 3) an operator inputs the final manuscript into the processing equipment.",
        "Our MT system was introduced in step I, First of all, the original news is greatly summarized in English since the length of a subtitle script is at most 30 Japanese characters per a display screen.",
        "Preediting is also carried out in this step to provide a better input for the MT system.",
        "After postediting, the final result is given to step 2.",
        "The system is based on the STAR machine translation system [2], and works basically by a transfer method.",
        "The translation process can be divided into 4 main steps: morphological analysis, syntactic analysis, transfer, and generation.",
        "The morphological analysis identifies words as well as locally fixed sequences of words.",
        "In the syntactic analysis, all the possible surface structures for an input sentence are derived, and then the best candidates are chosen by using the \"weight mechanism\" described below.",
        "At present, the size of the dictionary is about 100,000 entries, and the grammar has about 3,000 CFG-type rules.",
        "The system can translate a sentence having 11 words on average within 2 seconds using a 3 MIPS UNIX computer.",
        "Further characteristics of the system are discussed below."

        "By these rules, \"President\" can be translated differently into Japanese depending on the previous word.",

        "The main processing functions are: 1) klentili: As explained in 3.2, the LOCT can estimate the grammatical values for undefined words by identifying local patterns.",

        "If \"karera\" has a marker [H1WILL] (objects with high will) and \"sorera\" has nothing, translation control of \"they\" is realized by specifying the subject of a verb as [HIWILL] or nothing.",
        "2) Basic verb's translation word selection Verbs frequently used in news sentences are basic and thus have various meanings.",
        "To select a proper Japanese translation of a basic verb, we have set some special markers for news sentences.",
        "One of them is [CRIMINAL] which is utilized to obtain a special translation of \"catch.\" Consider the sentence: \"The police caught the assailant, who has a history of mental illness.\" The word \"catch\" was successfully translated as \"taiho-suru (arrest),\" since \"assailant\" has the marker [CRIMINAL] and the translation description of \"catch\" defined its Japanese as \"taiho-suru\" when it took an object noun that belongs to [CRIMINAL].",
