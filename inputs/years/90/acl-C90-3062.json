        "In human conversation there are continual implicit acknowledgements that communication is proceeding smoothly.",
        "The speaker is monitoring the hearer in different ways to see if they understand (for example, using checking moves such as 'Do you know what I mean?",
        "'), and the 'hearer' is often giving verbal acknowledgement to the speaker (e.g., 'yes', ‘uhuh').",
        "If the hearer takes over the conversation, she may acknowledge the last utterance implicitly by, for example, continuing the topic [2].",
        "However, if the utterance is not understood, a repair may be initiated.",
        "We can examine this repair from several perspectives: Sequencing: A typical repair sequence may consist of a repair initiator by the hearer, a repair by the original speaker, and an acknowledgement by the hearer.",
        "However, repair sequences in general may be much more complex.",
        "For example, the speaker may do a third turn",
        "repair on realising, from the hearer's response that her original utterance was not understood.",
        "These different types of repair have been discussed in [7].",
        "Repair Initiators: Repair initiators may take many forms in human interaction, including: facial expression; verbal signals (`huh?')",
        "and clarification questions.",
        "In human dialogue, the speaker may frequently self-correct without hearer intervention.",
        "Source of Trouble: Communication may break down for many reasons, such as from lack of hearing, reference failure or from general misunderstanding of complex material.",
        "Although the form of the repair initiator may indicate the source of the trouble, this is not always the case.",
        "It may therefore be necessary to guess at the likely source of trouble, possibly using discourse context or assumptions about the hearer's knowledge to reason about likely problems [3].",
        "Repair work both relies on, and shapes the context of the interaction.",

        "In order to illustrate some of these different aspects of repair, this section will give a number of examples of types of repair work in an interactive explanation system (the EDGE system, described further in [1]).",
        "These include repairs when the user fails to understand the explanation, as well as repairs when the system fails to understand the user.",
        "These latter are adapted from [4].",
        "The EDGE system plans explanations of the behaviour of simple circuits, depending on assumptions about the user's knowledge.",
        "These are interactive, with many opportunities for repair work when the user fails to understand the explanation.",
        "The user input to the system consists of one or two word commands or questions, rather than arbitrary natural language utterances.",

        "The system will normally reply to this question, then try and get back to what it was in the middle of explaining.",
        "This is achieved using discourse 'plans' to structure the clarification sub-dialogue, and a simple notion of focus to attempt to resume the previous discussion in such a way that it follows on from the topic introduced by the user.",

        "In this example the system was planning to describe the detailed behaviour of the light detector circuit's components.",
        "Because of the interruption/clarification, the system chooses to first describe the behaviour of the light dependent resistor.",
        "Signalling Misunderstanding: The user may also signal that they are not following without mentioning the exact problem – maybe they don't know why they don't understand.",
        "The system must then 'guess' at the likely source of trouble.",
        "This is done by maintaining a model of the discourse so far which includes any assumptions made about the user's knowledge.",
        "In attempting a repair the system identifies an assumption which may have been mistaken, then tries to fill in missing knowledge or explain something another way.",

        "System initiated remediation: Sometimes the system can deduce that the user has a misunderstanding from the user's utterances (e.g., replies to questions).",
        "Then a remediation sequence is initiated by the system using strategies based on work on tutorial dialogues (e.g., [8]).",
