        "This paper presents a report processing method with object-centered semantics.",
        "The syntactic analysis is performed along classical generative principles, though with a deliberately simple output as a list of index-value doublets, which the semantic module processes using methods in an object-oriented framework.",
        "The final representation is made of two types of object-centered structures : first, case-like, event level dated structures corresponding to the input clauses; second, detailed representation of the current state of an agent of the reference world, plus records for the follow-up of a task over time.",
        "Uncertainty, imprecision and prevision are handled using specialized fields.",
        "This framework is applied to the processing of daily naval reports in English."

        "A report typically gives information on the activity of one ship during the past 24 hours; for example: \"La Belle Poule is performing oceanographical measurement in the northern Mediterranean, while moving south at a speed of 5 knots.",
        "La Belle Poule was approximately 40 nautical miles south of Marseille at 10:00, April 14.\" This example exhibits discursive information on the current activity and movement of the ship and a spatio-temporal plotting relative to a reference location."

        "The task of the analyzer is not domain-neutral and not purely grammatical : - the \"p\" element of the doublets is in fact filtered and sometimes transformed : prepositions which translate identically end up the same (but inversely, ambiguities caused by plurivocal prepositions are left for the semantic processor to solve, mainly by the use of domain filtering); - a lot of lexicon entries are complex nouns and verbal phrases A clause is represented in the output under the form :",
        "There have been deeply contrasted positions on the role of syntax.",
        "It can be thought of as a full-fledged first stage, as an auxiliary which is sufficiently informative even when a complete syntactic structure per se (e.g. an x-barred tree) is not built (conceptual analysis : [Schank & Riesbeck 81)), as a co-process in close cooperation with semantics (since SHRDLU), as the first in an ordered sequence of increasingly costly means (as suggested by [Rau & Jacobs 87), who then list slot-filling involving filtering, heuristics when choices are to be made, and general domain knowledge).",
        "Grossly, syntax in itself carries information on : - constituent ordering and constituent relationship - flexion and syntactic function (if the grammar is relational).",
        "But more actively, syntactic analysis backed by lexical semantics, even if less sophisticated than in LFG or Mel'cuk's model for example, can play an active part in sorting items out and ascribing them an adequate translation, as for prepositions with an identical meaning.",
