        "Natural language i's• essentially a discrete information system.",
        "It often allows multiple syntactic interpretations.",
        "To minimize the possibility of multiple interpretation, we introduce a minimum amount of semantic inform,tion and adopt the case frame.",
        "This provides flexible facility in eyntace-tic analysis and helps to distinguish structural ambiguity.",
        "In this approach, the translation accuracy is up to 9C or more, which can be raised if corresponding information and/or rules are modified and supplemented."
