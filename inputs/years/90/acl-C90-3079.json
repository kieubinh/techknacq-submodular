        "Then the WF could be translated from one language to another, transformed from verbal to pictorial form or vice versa, etc.",
        "Such kind of manipulations are often performed by forecasters, translators, editors in order to obtain better representation of the WF from the point of view of its perception and understanding.",

        "Each of these manipulations can be decomposed into analysis of the source WF and synthesis of the target WF.",
        "These two processes are mediated by a uniform internal representation which is language independent.",
