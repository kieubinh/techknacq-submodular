        "Current attempts to diagnose grammatical faults in natural language utterances are except for agreement errors and certain cases of overgeneralization and interference strongly based on the principles of error anticipation (cf. Yazdani 1988, Schwind 1988, Catt 1988): Rather tiny context free grammars are enhanced by some additional rules which describe selected faulty structures and invoke error messages if they are needed for a successful parse.",
        "The efforts required to compile an at least approximatively comprehensive rule set even for simple domains of grammar are considerable.",
        "Besides this, it is the student's risk to fall into the remaining gap of neglected possibilities which seems to be difficult to avoid.",
        "Hopefully, an improvement of this situation can be achieved by an application of model-based reasoning procedures, where an internal model (of language correctness) is used to simulate and evaluate error hypotheses by investigating their consequences for other parts of the model.",
        "To a certain degree the diagnostic results are logically determined by the correct remainder of the utterance and useful results require a balanced ratio between correct and incorrect language use within the solution of the student.",
        "Provided a correct and covering model can be supplied for a limited domain, diagnosis is guaranteed to be precise and robust enough and error anticipation eventually may be renounced completely.",
        "In order to yield an efficient implementation of the idea into a practical solution a preponderantly data driven procedure instead of a strictly hypotheses driven one seems to be desirable.",
        "A procedure of this kind has been successfully pursued in an earlier paper on the diagnosis of agreement errors in fixed syntactic environments (Menzel 1988).",
        "Quite naturally this success raises the question on how much of the experience gathered can be transferred to other types of grammatical regularities as linear ordering principles or dominance regularities, for instance.",
        "Up to now the only notable exception to the one-sided orientation on error anticipation has been a fail-soft technique implemented in the error sensitive parsing system Linger (Barchan et al.",
        "1986), an approach which later has been named \"word soup heuris-tics\" by their authors: Whenever the normal parsing process based on a principally anticipation-oriented context-free grammar fails, the system attempts to achieve a successful parse by trying single word form substitutions, insertions, deletions or displacements.",
        "Although often being very useful in detecting simple flaws of the student, this heuristics not so infrequently produces rather surprising and sometimes even funny interpretations of the input data.",
        "Its main drawback is the basic limitation to only single word form errors.",
        "Any extension to the handling of complete constituents, desirable as it may be, seems to be condemned to failure because of efficiency reasons: the whole approach is basically expectation driven and it opens up too vast a search space of possible error hypotheses, where the verification of only a single one is not just a trivial task."

        "The intrinsic problem with the diagnosis of structural errors is its not fitting easily into the standard paradigm of model-based reasoning which essentially relies on two basic assumptions (Reiter 1987):",
        "(1) A model always has an a priori given number of elementary model components.",
        "(2) The intercornponent connections of the",
        "model are invariant and, likewise, given a priori.",

        "Parsing a natural language sentence first of all is solving the task of structural identification.",
        "Therefore, diagnosing arbitrary syntactic errors in arbitrary utterances, from this point of view, may perhaps be compared with electronic troubleshooting in a circuitry of obscure function with at least partially unknown components and partially invisible wiring under the additional assumption that there is no possibility to vary the conditions of measurement!",
        "It should go without saying that such a task can only be solved in very limited domains relying on an as strong as possible (semantic) support from the situational and sentential context.",
        "The final goal, of course, should be an as far-reaching as possible integration of structural identification and diagnosis.",
        "Model-based diagnosis, especially for teaching purposes where comprehensible error explanations are desired, poses two additional constraints on the kind of model information to be used.",
        "Both conditions, if compared against usual parsing grammars, certainly are not a matter of course:",
        "(3) The model has to provide an extremely reliable correct/incorrect distinction, whereas traditional grammars, in the hope that ungrammatical sentences will not appear as input, massively rely on over-generation.",
        "(4) An explicit representation based on comprehensible generalizations has to be",
        "attempted for a maximum of regularities in the domain.",
        "in order to allow this information to be used immediately for explanation purposes.",
        "The latter condition in most cases definitely rules out simple lists of alternative solutions as a proper means of representing model information.",
        "To code, for instance, word order regularities as a list of possible permutations gives no sensible error explanation besides, say, \"Your constituent order is not contained in the list of admissible constituent sequences\".",
        "What is desired instead of this would be an explanation, based on explicit generalizations as in \"The verbal group of German subordinate clauses has always to be placed in final position\".",
        "A first attempt to make word order regularities explicit has been made by using ID/LP format for GPSG (Gazdar et al.",
        "1985).",
        "For diagnostic purposes such explicitness is not only necessary with respect to linear order principles but with respect to omissi-bility and combinability of categories as well.",
