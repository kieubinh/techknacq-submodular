        "In general, our implementation of the planner is along the same lines as described in Trovy 88 except that we incorporate not only RST relations but also domainspecific relations like ACCESS (how does one get to an object) and OPEN (when are the opening hours of an object).",
        "Moore and Swartout 89 and Moore and Paris 89 use the same planning algorithm and they have added plans like e.g.",
        "PERSUADE to the RST plans.",
        "This enables them to answer follow-up questions in advisory dialogues or in the explanation facility of an expert system.",
        "Most of the questions they can answer are Why questions except two What questions: What is a concept?",
        "and What is the difference between two concepts?",
        "The general idea of their approach too is to gather the information that should be communicated but using their plans we could not answer the kind of general question we have in mind.",
        "Like RST plans our plans consist of a nucleus and a satellite each associated with requirements and growth points.",
        "The nuclei contain the information that has to be verbalized obligatorily which is either done by recursively invoking other subplans or by an explicit verbalization command say(r).",
        "All plans are recursively expanded until they lead to a verbalization command.",
        "In contrast to nuclei satellites, using the same notation, contain the same kind of information that can be optionally verbalized.",
        "The growth points allow for the inclusion of further information into the list of entities that is finally passed on to the generator.",
        "They again contain plans.",
        "Finally, the requirements for nucleus and satellite contain inquiries to the inference engine about e.g. the validity of certain subsort relations and about beliefs of the hearer.",
        "An example of a plan, interesting _feature , is given below (the planner is implemented in PRO-LOG so the atoms with capital letters are variables):",
        "[interesting feature(Feature)] â€¢ satellite growth point: C]) Among the 12 plans used by PIT are domain dependent ones as.",
        "well as domain independent ones.",
        "The latter are formalizations of RST relations that lead to small text structures.",
        "The domain dependent plans lead to larger structures, e.g. whole paragraphs.",
        "Each plan, even if it can be seen as domain independent, contains a domain specific part, namely the requirements for nucleus and satellite which are inquiries to the inference engine that have to heed the names of entities, roles, and features of the knowledge representation.",
        "The planning algorithm uses four data structures: the plans, a tree, a stack, and a used list.",
        "The text structure tree is binary.",
        "The root contains the communicative goal that initiates the planning process.",
        "The nodes represent the executed plans.",
        "Each node has successive nucleus and satellite edges.",
        "whose corresponding nodes may be either empty or contain an explicit verbalization command or further plans.",
        "The stack is used as an agenda.",
        "Its elements are tuples consisting of the plan to be executed next and a pointer to that leaf of the tree where the subtree stemming from the execution of the plan should be added.",
        "The used_ list is a bookkeeping device representing which plan has been-used for which entity.",
        "The planning algorithm consists of three phases: first, the text structure tree is built by a top-down hierarchical planner (Sacerdoti 75) using recursive descent.",
        "Second, the verbalization commands are collected by traversing the tree depth-first, left-to-right.",
        "Third, the entities to be verbalized are expanded by their attributes contained in the knowledge base and",

        "At the start of the planning process, i.e. when the communicative goal comes in, the tree, the stack, and the used-list are empty.",
        "If the plan library offers an appropriate plan to achieve the goal it is tested whether this plan has already been executed for the entity in question.",
        "If so, the execution is aborted, otherwise the plan is put on the used list.",
        "Next the requirements of the plan are checked, first, the ones common to both nucleus and satellite and then the nucleus requirements.",

        "If they cannot be met the corresponding plans of the satellite and the satellite growth points are skipped.",
        "Are all requirements met, the new plans together with their pointers to that leaf of the tree where the subtrees should be added are pushed onto the stack in the following order: satellite growth points, nucleus growth points, satellite and nucleus.",
        "The second plan that is to be executed is popped from the stack and dealt with as described above with the addition that the agenda has to be updated when the tree has been expanded.",
        "The pointers of all plans to that leaf of the tree where a subtree has Teen added have to be changed in order to point to the nucleus of the new subtree.",
