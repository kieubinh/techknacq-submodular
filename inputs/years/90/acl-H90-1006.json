        "\"Prosody,\" the suprasegmental information in speech, i.e., information that cannot be localized to a specific sound segment, can mark lexical stress, identify phrasing breaks and provide information useful for semantic interpretation.",
        "Although all of these aspects may be useful in spoken language systems, particularly important are prosodic phrase breaks which can provide cues to syntactic structure to help select among competing hypotheses, and thus help to disambiguate otherwise ambiguous sentences.",
        "In speech understanding applications, information such as prosody that aids disambiguation, is particularly important, since speech input, as opposed to text, introduces a vast increase in the amount of ambiguity a parser must face.",
        "For example, Harrington and Johnstone [7] found that even when all phonemes are correctly identified, the indeterminancy of phoneme sequences when word boundaries are unknown yields in excess of 1000 word string parses for many of their 4 to 10 word sentences.",
        "Moreover, these estimates rise dramatically as indeterminancy is introduced in the phoneme sequences: only 2% of the same sentences had fewer than 1,000 parses when phonetically similar phonemes were clustered together (e.g., voiced stops).",
        "This indeterminancy vastly increases the work for a parser.",
        "The work reported here focuses on the use of relative duration of phonetic segments in the assignment of syntactic structure, assuming a known word sequence.",
        "Specifically, relative duration of phonemes is estimated by a speech recognizer constrained to recognize the correct string of words.",
        "These duration values are then used to compute phrase break indices, which are in turn used to rule out alternative parses in otherwise syntactically ambiguous sentences.",
        "In this paper, we begin by providing some theoretical background on prosodic phrase breaks, and by describing a numerical representation of phrase breaks for use in speech understanding.",
        "Next we describe algorithms for automatic recognition of these break indices from speech for known text, and the modification of a grammar to use these indices in parsing.",
        "Finally, we present experimental results based on ambiguous sentences from three speakers, showing that the use of prosodic information can significantly reduce the number of candidate syntactic parses by pruning mismatches between prosody and syntax."

        "In recent years, there have been significant advances in the phonology of prosodic phrases.",
        "While this work is not yet explicit enough to provide rules for automatically determining the prosodic phrase boundaries in speech, it is useful as a foundation for our computational models.",
        "Several researchers in linguistics have proposed hierarchies of prosodic phrases [9, 12, 10].",
        "Although not all levels of these hierarchies are universally accepted, our data appear to provide evidence for prosodic words as individual words or clitic groups, groupings of prosodic words, intermediate phrases, intonational phrases, groupings of intermediate phrases as in parenthetical phrases, and sentences.",
        "Since it is not clear how many of these levels will be useful in speech understanding, we have represented all seven possible types of boundaries, but focus initially on the information in the highest levels, sentences and intonational phrases.",
        "In order to utilize this information in a parser, we developed a numerical representation of this hierarchy",
        "using a sequence of break indices between each word.",
        "A break index encodes the degree of prosodic decoupling between neighboring words.",
        "For example, an index of 0 corresponds to cliticization, and an index of 6 represents a sentence boundary.1 We found that these break indices could be labeled with very high consistency within and across labelers.",
        "We anticipate that the strongest boundaries (highest level of the hierarchy) will be both easiest to detect and most useful in parsing, and will refer to these boundaries (4-6) as major phrase boundaries.",
        "The acoustic cues to prosodic breaks vary according to the different levels of the hierarchy.",
        "For example, there are phonological rules that apply across some boundaries of the hierarchy but not others (e.g., [12, 18]).",
        "Intonation cues mark intermediate and intonational phrase boundaries [15, 3].",
        "Pauses and/or breaths may also mark major phrase boundaries.",
        "Our initial data indicate that duration lengthening is a fairly reliable cue to phrase boundaries.",
        "Prepausal lengthening is observed in English and many, but not all, other languages (see [16] for a summary).",
        "Lengthening without a pause has been observed in English in clause-final position (e.g., [5]) and in phrase-final position, though lengthening of phones at the ends of words is disputed in the literature (see [8]).",
        "The typical representation of syntactic structure is not identical to prosodic phrase structure.",
        "There is some work suggesting methods for predicting rhythmic structure from syntactic structure, but not vice versa [13, 6].",
        "These results are complicated by the complex relationship between intonation and rhythm and the influence of semantics on intonation.",
        "Although people disagree on the precise relationship between prosody and syntax, it is generally agreed that there is some relationship.",
        "We have shown, for example, that prosody is used by listeners to choose the appropriate meaning of otherwise ambiguous sentences with an average accuracy of 86% [11].",
        "Although listener performance varied as a function of the type of syntactic ambiguities, reliability was high for left vs. right attachment and particle/preposition ambiguities, both difficult problems in parsing.",
        "An example illustrates how the break indices resolve syntactic and word sequence ambiguities for two phonetically identical sentences:",
        "• Marge 0 would 1 never 2 deal 0 in 2 any 0 guys 6 • Marge 1 would 0 never 0 deal 3 in 0 any 0 guise 6",
        "Note that the break index between \"deal\" and \"in\" provides an indication of how tightly coupled the two words are.",
        "For \"in\" as a particle, we expect tighter connection to the preceding verb whose meaning is modified than to the following phrase which is the object of that verb.",

        "In earlier work [11], each phone duration was normalized according to speaker and phone-dependent means and variances.",
        "Raw break features were generated by averaging the normalized duration over the final syllable coda of each word and adding a pause factor.",
        "Lexically stressed and non-stressed vowels were separated in the computation of means and variances.",

        "These indices had a high correlation with hand-labeled data (0.85) and were successfully used in a parser to reduce the number of syntactic parses by 25% [2].",
        "However, the normalization algorithm required knowledge of the raw break features for the entire sentence, which has the disadvantages that the algorithm is non-causal and may not reflect sentence-internal changes in speaking rate.",
        "In addition, the algorithm used the full scale of break indices, so every sentence was constrained to have at least one 0 break index.",
        "A new algorithm, using a hidden Markov model (HMM), was investigated for computing the break indices from the raw break features described above.",
        "The algorithm is not strictly causal (in the same sense that the HMM recognizer is not causal - decisions are not made until sometime after a word has been observed), but does not require any ad hoc scaling.",
        "We anticipate the time delay associated with HMM prosody decoding to be similar to delays associated with a speech recognizer.",
        "In a slight variation from previous work, the raw break indices were computed from the rhyme (vowel nucleus + coda) of the final syllable instead of the coda alone.",
        "This change did not have an effect on the correlation with hand labels.",
        "A second, more important difference is that the phone duration means are adapted according to a local speaking rate.",
        "Local speaking rate is given by the average normalized durations over the last M phones, excluding pauses, where M = 50 was determined experimentally.",
        "The mean duration for each phone is adjusted with each new observed phone according to = ± er/N where r is the speaking rate, N is a feedback coefficient that is equal to 5000 at steady state, but varies at start-up for faster initial adaptation, cr is the standard deviation of the phone's duration, unadapted, and pa represents the mean duration for phone a.",
        "A fully connected seven-state HMM is used to recognize break indices, given the raw break feature.",
        "Each HMM state corresponds to a break index (state number = break index) and the output distribution in each state describes the raw indices observed while in that state.",
        "In this work, we investigated the use of Gaussian output distributions of the scalar break feature, but joint use of several features in multivariate output distributions will best utilize the power of the HMM approach.",
        "Viterbi decoding was used to obtain the state sequence for an utterance, corresponding to the break index sequence.",
        "The parameters of the break HMM were estimated in two different ways, involving either supervised or unsupervised training.",
        "By supervised training, we mean that the hand-labeled break indices are given, so the state sequence is fully observable and simple maximum likelihood estimation (as opposed to the Estimate-Maximize, or forward-backward, algorithm) is used.",
        "In unsupervised training, no hand-labeled data is used.",
        "Mean output distributions of the states are initialized to values on a scale that increases with the corresponding break index, and the transition probabilities were initialized to be essentially uniform.",
