        "Despite numerous investigations into English tense-aspect semantics, the problem of formally interpreting tense and aspect remains in large part unsolved.",
        "A formal solution requires (a) a well-defined mapping from a subset of English covering the most common tense-aspect constructions (including embedded tensed clauses) to a formal meaning representation, and (b) a well-defined denotational semantics for the meaning representation, which accords with speakers' intuitions about the original text.",
        "We propose a simple structure called a tense tree (or a set of connected tense trees) as a basis for interpreting tense-aspect constructions and some time adverbials in a context-dependent way.",
        "The de-indexicalization process simultaneously transforms tense trees and logical forms, the former in accord with simple recursion equations and the latter in accord with formal equivalences between context-indexed and context-independent logical forms.",
        "The rules have been implemented, and yield meaning representations in a formal episodic logic for narrative understanding."

        "Narratives describe and relate episodes (events, situations, eventualities).",
        "The episodes successively introduced appear to \"line up\" in systematic ways as a function of the text structure, with tense and aspect playing a crucial role.",
        "(1-2) illustrate this familiar phenomenon:",
        "(1) John grinned at Mary.",
        "She frowned.",
        "(2) John knocked, but soon realized Mary had left.",
        "Each of the verbs in (1) appears to introduce an episode; the past inflection places them before the utterance event (or speech time), and the surface ordering suggests temporal sequencing, and probably a causal connection.",
        "In (2) we appear to have at least three episodes, a \"knocking,\" a \"realizing\" and a \"leaving.\" The past perfect auxiliary relates the \"leaving\" to a past episode serving as reference point.",
        "(This reference point seems closely correlated with the \"realizing\" episode, but on our theory is not identical with it.)",
        "As well, the adverb soon implicitly references and relates the \"knocking\" and \"realizing\" episodes.",
        "The problem of automatically extracting these relationships is complicated by a number of subtle issues:",
        "• How many episodes (events, situations, etc.)",
        "does a sentence implicitly introduce?",
        "We remarked that the introduction of episodes appears correlated with verbs; but in (3) John did not elude the tackle and score a touchdown, disappointing the fans.",
        "the causally relevant episode is characterized by the non-occurrence of successive \"eluding\" and \"scoring\" events; and in (4) When each guest congratulated Mary and gave her a present, she felt quite overwhelmed.",
        "the focus is on a \"quantified\" event consisting of any number of \"congratulating\" and \"giving\" events.",
        "• What are the relative (semantic) scopes of tense and aspect, relative to NPs, VPs, adverbials, negation, etc.?",
        "Syntax suggests that tense scope is confined to the tensed verb or VP, yet in a sentence like (5) For a whole week this summer, no rain fell.",
        "this simple view is troublesome: if the past tense is confined to the VP (so that fell means \"falls-beforenow\"), then the sentence is true if we can find a week any time this summer in which there are no past rainfalls – a property that holds of all remaining (i.e., future) weeks of the summer!",
        "• Do simple past or present-tense sentences make definite or indefinite reference to episodes (or times)?",
        "D avi dson [3] , H arman [5] , Rei chenb ach [13] and a majority of writers after them took event reference in simple past and present to be indefinite (existential), and this seems in accord with intuition in such sentences as (6) John got married last year.",
        "where there is no definite commitment as to the time of the event (apart from its being confined to last year).",
        "On the other hand, Partee[12] pointed out the seemingly anaphoric character of tense reference in sentences like (7) I left the stove on.",
        "Also, Leech[8], McCawley[9], Webber[19] and many others have noted that the simple past normally involves a \"point of orientation\" such as an immedi",
        "ately preceding event, and that Reichenbach's \"reference time\" appears to be definite at least in the case of perfect.",
        "Our goal is a comprehensive account of how episodes and their relationships are determined by syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.",
        "The account is to be an intrinsic part of a general theory of the understanding process, and is to be formulated in a mathematically precise and computationally implementable way.",
        "At the most general level, the task can be viewed in terms of the following sort of schema: English 0 WORLD for MR Context Suitable inference I.e., English in conjunction with suitable context structures needs to be mapped to a formal meaning representation (0), and this MR needs to be formally interpretable (0), with truth conditions that are in intuitive accord with intuitions about the original English text.",
        "Thus we will have some assurance that inferences based on the MR will be those intuitively warranted.",
        "With respect to this schema, most previous studies of tense and aspect have been more formally explicit about C than about Q.",
        "The MR is often some dialect of first-order logic, or a modal or intensional logic, with formal semantics in the traditional vein (e.g., possible-worlds models with multiple time indices).",
        "The description of 0, however, is often very informal or limited to a very restricted set of constructions.",
        "Furthermore, the formalized accounts (e.g., [4], [6], [14]) tend to take context for granted – the focus is on truth conditions, and so the model is simply assumed to supply the needed reference times.",
        "AI-motivated work on tense and aspect has emphasized their pragmatic significance, e.g., for discourse segment structure (see [1], ch.",
        "13 & 14), and their role in the practical extraction of temporal relationships from discourse in applied NL systems (e.g., see several of the articles in Computational Linguistics 14(2), 1988).",
        "Much of this work has treated 0 heuristically, restricting attention to simple types of sentences and viewing tense and aspect as phenomena to be handled by a separate module, rather than as an integral part of a compositional mapping from text to meaning representations.",
        "Non-compositional approaches based on simple sentence types run the risk of being ungeneralizable.",
        "For instance, they may tie event introduction to verb phrases in a way that doesn't generalize to logical compounds (as in sentences (3) and (4)).",
        "Also, they may get the semantics of embedded sentences wrong.",
        "For instance, simple sentence types suggest that past tense places an event before the speech time.",
        "But in",
        "(8) Mary will realize a year from now that her wedding to John, which takes place tomorrow, was a big mistake.",
        "the past tense is used for a future event.",
        "Thus we need to characterize the semantics of particular syntactic constructs – including tense-aspect constructs – in a way that holds for all syntactic environments in which the constructs may occur.",
        "On the issue of compositionality, we should also remark that we find much of the work on tense and aspect \"unduly Reichenbachian\".",
        "Though the importance of Reichenbach's seminal work in this area is undisputed, it is based on the dubious view that tensed perfects are complex variants of \"simple\" past, present and future tense.",
        "Since these \"complex\" tenses appear to involve a reference time (besides the event and speech times), Reichenbach attributed such a reference time to \"simple\" tenses as well.",
        "But from a compositional perspective, it is much more natural to view tense (past and present) and perfect as making separate contributions to the VP or sentence meaning.",
        "After all, each can occur in a VP without the other (\"John probably forgot\", \"John is likely to have forgotten\").",
        "Thus semantic dependence on Reichenbach's reference time may well be particular to the perfect – just as dependence on speech time (or a more general sentence reference time) seems particular to tense.",
        "In the remaining sections of the paper we report our progress so far on the tense-aspect problem within the above schema.",
        "Section 2 briefly elaborates our conception of the understanding process.",
        "Section 3 explains the intuitive idea behind our method of transforming indexical logical forms (LFs) to nonindexical LFs in a principled way, using context structures called tense trees.",
        "These provide the \"points of orientation\" (reference episodes) needed to interpret tense and aspect, and are transformed in the course of \"de-indexicalizing\" LFs in a way that can be concisely stated by recursion equations.",
        "Section 4 provides a formal statement with examples of the basic de-indexicalization rules for tense and aspect.",
        "Section 5 summarizes our progress and work left to be done.",
        "In the course of the paper, we make commitments about key aspects of the issues enumerated above.",
        "Briefly, our view is that at the level of LF, tensed English sentences contain separate past, pres, perf and futr operators; (will and would have separate tense and futr components); that not only past, pres, perf, and futr introduce episodes, but that various logical operators do so as well, including negation, conjunction, and quantification; that past and pres are sentence-level operators generally taking wide scope (despite syntactic appearances); and that the episodes introduced by past and pres, and indeed by any operators, are indefinite (existentially quantified).",
        "This last claim applies even to the past in the past perfect, consistently with our compositional view of tense and aspect.",
        "The way the past perfect auxiliary connects up with a preexisting \"point of orientation\" is not by direct anaphoric reference, but by a mechanism that applies to all statives."

        "This episode lasts until \"if in the complete formula, which is nothing else but the reference episode for the perfect (corresponding to Reichenbach's reference time).",
        "For (13), this I/ is a \"present\" episode (by the Pres-rule), so (13) means, in effect, that John has been sleeping until now.",
        "We take this to be the desired inference.",
        "For (14), we will get a subformula [[John wake-up] @ ei], and since this is nonstative, (3e: [e recent-subep ei] [[John wake-up] * e]).",
        "Since further [[John wake-up] ** el] entails [[John awake] * (fin ei)] for all el (via suitable meaning postulates), this suggests [[John awake] * (fin ei)], where as in (13), ei lasts until n, the (present) reference episode.",
        "In other words, John is still awake.",
        "Note that this is only an implication, since we can perfectly well say, without contradiction, \"John has woken up and fallen asleep again.\" The second variant of perfect is simpler, amounting to a \"relative past\": Perf (2) : [(perf2 0)./.",

        "** eT]) ** (F j)] Note that in the Perf (1)-rule, episode eT was taken to last until the reference episode, and to be only indirectly characterized by I (via \"@\"); here eT is before the reference episode, and is directly characterized by I (after de-indexicalization).",
        "The two main consequences are, first, that there is no longer an implication that a stative episode persists to the reference time; and second, the episode stored in the tense tree is now the actual 0-event, not an episode which by inference contains a 0-event.",
        "The differences between perfl and perf2 help to account for the following contrasts:",
        "(15) a.",
        "*John has left yesterday.",
        "b. John had left the day before.",
        "c. John will have left the day before.",

        "b. John had woken up and had immediately dressed.",
        "c. John will have woken up and will immediately have dressed.",
        "On our account, only pertf1 is available in the a-sentences; so in (15) a, we do not get \"John's leaving\" stored in the tense tree, but only an episode containing John's leaving and lasting till now – but that cannot possibly be contained in yesterday.",
        "Similarly in (16) a, John's waking up is not directly stored in the tense tree, and so is not directly available in the interpretation of immediately.",
        "(We think that there may be a recovery mechanism in the interpretation of adverbials, which looks for suitable points of orientation in the history list (where we assume that all indefinites and definites are recorded, whether explicitly mentioned or inferred) after failing to find them in the tense tree.)",
        "In the b and c sentences in (15) and (16), no difficulties are encountered because of the availability of the perf2 reading.",
        "Perhaps the most important point about our treatment of the perfect, alluded to earlier, is that the reference episode is introduced simply by the normal effect of operators (usually past, pres or futr) \"exterior\" to it.",
        "Briefly reconsidering (9) b, for example, we see that the (wide-scope) past will generate an episode in the past relative to the time of speech, and oriented by the \"entering\" episode in (9) a.",
        "It is this past episode which becomes the reference episode for the perfect.",
        "Now the key to the seemingly anaphoric character of this reference episode is this: if [el orients e2], and e2 is stative, then there is a strong suggestion that e2 is either concurrent with e1 (namely, when el is stative as well) or contiguous with its end point (when e1 is nonstative).",
        "This is apparent, for instance, in the following variant of",
        "(9): (17) a. John entered the room.",
        "b.",
        "His paintings were gone.",
        "c. In their place were Schwarzenegger posters.",
        "In b, the episode of the paintings being gone covers (at least) a short timespan immediately following John's entering.",
        "In c, the episode of the posters being in place is concurrent with the paintings being gone, since both episodes are stative.",
        "Now, recognizing that perfect reference episodes are stative (because the state of being after some given type of event can persist indefinitely, and holds of the subintervals of any intervals of which it holds), the same analysis places the past episode in (9) b (serving as reference episode for the perfect) right after John's entering, contiguous with it.",
        "This is tantamount to making the end of John's entering the \"reference time\" for the perfect.",
        "So we get the desired \"anaphoric\" effect, without treating past as anaphoric, and without singling out the past in past perfect for special treatment.",
        "Next we mention the de-indexicalization rules for That and that-nominalizations:",
        "The rules cause focus shifts to the root of an embedded tree, indicated by the 1 – ).",
        "and operations.",
        "The",
        "first of these always adds a new embedding link whose destination is a new root node, whereas the second only does so if no embedding link exists at the current focus; otherwise, it causes re-traversal of the last embedding link added at the current focus.",
        "The leftward arrows in the two rules indicate focus restoration much like the upward arrows in the preceding rules.",
        "Intuitively, the distinction between a sentence nominalization derived explicitly from the text and one introduced through an implicit performative is motivated by the following sort of contrast:",
        "(18) a. John knows that Mary got home before midnight.",
        "b.",
        "He also knows that she watched a movie.",
        "(19) a. Mary got home before midnight.",
        "b.",
        "She watched a movie.",
        "In (18) the sentences about Mary in a and b are objects of attitudes, and it is much less clear than in (19) whether they refer to successive episodes.",
        "Now, the LFs for (19) a, b will contain performative predicates and that-nominalization operators; since the rule for that causes re-traversal of embedding links, the a and b episodes will end up at the same node.",
        "But in (18) only the \"knowing\" episodes map to the same node, while the episodes involving Mary map to different embedded nodes.",
        "Thus it will be harder to establish a connection between them (i.e., tense structure alone will not establish a connection though inference based on other information still might).",
        "Before proceeding to further rules we illustrate some of the ones so far with a \"trace\" of an LF de-indexicalization, namely, that of sentence (21), uttered right after (20): (20) Mary looked pale.",
        "(21) John realized that Mary was tired.",
        "The tree structure after processing of (20) will be eo T= el where e0 corresponds to the added performative – i.e., the speaker's utterance of (20), and el corresponds to Mary's looking pale at a point in the past.",
        "The logical form of (21) is initially (without performative) [John <past realize> (That [Mary <past tired>])].",
        "and after scoping and addition of the implicit performative, (pres [Speaker assert (that (past [John realize (That (past [Mary tired]))]))]).",
        "By the Pres-rule, the first step of the de-indexicalization relative to T yields (3e2: [[e2 at-about Nowt] A [e0 orients e2]] [[Speaker assert (that (past [John realize (That (past [Mary tired]))]))]T, ** e2]) e0e2 where Ti = ® l el Next, a simple rule we have not mentioned moves the T' inward to the that-clause.",
        "The That (2)-rule causes retraversal of the embedding link, and the Past-rule then gives the following altered form of the outer that-clause:",
        "Again T\" is moved inward to the embedded That-clause, and the That (1)-rule generates a new embedding link and tree root at the focal node.",
        "It then remains to process the innermost tensed clause (past [Mary tired])T",
        "One more application of the Past-rule, but keeping in mind that we are now at a past-dominated node, converts the tensed clause to (3e4: [e4 at-or-before e3] [[Mary tired] ** e4]) assuming the orienting predication is omitted when there is no orienting episode.",

        "The central concept is that of a tense tree structure as part of a more general context structure.",
        "This provides a straightforward and easily visualized way of converting originally indexical LFs to representations of the meaning of an utterance which are context-independent at least as far as the episodic relations implicit in the tense-aspect structure are concerned.",
        "This includes the most common \"orienting\" relations between episodes, and some of the more subtle relations conveyed by perfective aspect.",
        "Our Common Lisp implementation of the de-indexicalization process allows rules to be straightforwardly represented and easily edited; example sentences of the type in this paper (modulo simplification of some of the adverbials) run in roughly a tenth of a second on a Sun SPARCstation 1.",
        "Future work will focus on extension of the rules so as to cover more types of adverbials (especially clausal ones), tenseless VPs and clauses (some of which we already handle, such as action nominalizations like \"To have loved and lost is not unusual\"), and relative clause.",
        "A preliminary look at some of these phenomena, especially clausal adverbials and relative clauses, suggests that an operation on pairs of trees may be required, something one might call a \"two-point overlay\" T1:T2, where the root node of T1 and another node of T1 are aligned with two nodes of T2, creating orienting relationships between certain episodes stored at the aligned nodes.",
