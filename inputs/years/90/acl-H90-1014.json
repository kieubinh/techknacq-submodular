        "The purpose of Project MURASAKI is to develop a foreign language text understanding system that will demonstrate the extensibility of message understanding technology.' In its current design, Project MURASAKI will process Spanish and Japanese text and extract information in order to generate records in both natural language databases, respectively.",
        "The fields within these database records will contain a natural language phrase or expression in that respective language.",
        "The domain of Project MURASAKI is the disease AIDS.",
        "The associated software system will include a general domain model of AIDS in the knowledge base.",
        "Within this model, there will be five subdomains: incidence reports records the occurrence of AIDS and HIV infection in countries and regions, among various populations, testing policies covers measures to test groups for AIDS, campaigns describes measures adopted to combat AIDS, new technologies lists new equipment and material used in detecting and preventing AIDS, and 1 Thus, it is not to be confused as a message understanding project, but rather a multi-paragraph (i.e., text) understanding project [51.",
        "AIDS research details the various vaccines and treatments that are being developed to prevent AIDS.",
        "The subdomains of incidence reports, testing policies and campaigns are found in the Spanish text while the topics of incidence reports, new technologies and AIDS research are covered in the Japanese text.",
        "Project MURASAKI will demonstrate a sufficient level of full text understanding to be able to identify the existence of factual information within either a given Spanish or Japanese text that belongs within a particular Spanish or Japanese language database.",
        "Then, it will determine what information in that text constitutes a single record in the selected database.",
        "The balance of this paper will focus on the evaluation technique: why it was chosen, some basic assumptions underlying it, as well as the design and application of this technique.",
        "To illustrate various technical points of this technique, examples will be given using text excerpted from the Spanish AIDS corpus and its associated (generated) Spanish database records.",
        "Appendix A contains a sample Spanish AIDS text (Text #124) and its English translation.' Appendix B contains a record from the Incidence Reporting database that was generated from Text #124.",
        "Similarly, Appendix C contains a record from the Testing Policies database that was also generated from Text #124.",
        "The Need for a Black Box Given the overall design of this foreign language text understanding program, there arose the need for developing a general purpose evaluation technique[1].",
        "This technique would compare the actual, computer generated output of one such system to the expected, human generated output of another.",
        "That is to say, given some sample piece of (foreign language) text as input, some predefined system output (namely, for project MURASAKI, the generation of a finite number of database records) could be manually generated so that a determination as to the correct performance of the computer system was made.",
        "Given this type of \"correct\" output, it could",
        "therefore be possible to measure the performance of an automated system based on this type of well-defined input/output pairs.",
        "It was precisely this type of rationale that led to the development of a black box evaluation – evaluation primarily focused on what a system produces externally rather than what a system does internally.",
        "In direct contrast to this type of evaluation is glass box evaluation – \"looking inside the system and finding ways of measuring how well it does something, rather than whether or not it does it\" [5].",
        "With the development of the MURASAKI evaluation technique, comes the notion of two types of measures: a quantitative measure and a qualitative measure.",
        "The quantitative measure determines the number of correct (and/or incorrect) records that have been generated in any one database while the qualitative measure evaluates the \"correctness\" of any database record field."

        "Given the overall design of Project MURASAKI, there are a few assumptions, or rather, some groundwork that needs to be laid, in order to proceed in the development of this evaluation technique.",
        "These assumptions are explained as follows:",
        "• Given the nature of the AIDS text corpus, any one text could possibly generate one or more records in one or more databases.",
        "This fact is loosely referred to as domain complexity.",
        "(Furthermore, for any record, all fields may not be filled.)",
        "• Given the structure of the AIDS domain model, it is just as easy (or hard) to distinguish one subdomain from another.",
        "That is, each database is as likely to have a record generated in it as another.",
        "This hypothesis is known as subdomain differentiation.",
        "• Upon the determination of what the expected output of Project MURASAKI should resemble, a correct record (in any database) is uniquely identified by the contents of its key fields plus the contents of one or more non-key fields.",
        "This statement constitutes the definition of a correct record.3 Generated Output: What Could Go Wrong?",
        "After a thorough analysis of the system flow for Project MURASAKI and given a typical AIDS text as system input, the following list represents all possible undesirable situations that could arise: 3 All appropriate information should be extracted from the text and placed in the correct database.",
        "A change in any of the key fields will result in the generation of a new record.",
        "For example, if data from a different time period is presented in the text, a key field change is required, and a new record is generated.",
        "If data from a new region is presented, a new record is generated.",
        "Examples of key and non-key fields are found in Appendices B and C. Key fields, which are found in the thick, darkened boxes, are the same throughout each database.",
        "Generate one or more records in the wrong database.",
        "Not generate one or more records in the correct database.",
        "Generate too many records in the correct database, i.e., over-generate.",
        "Generate too few records in the correct database, i.e., under-generate.",
        "Generate too many fields in the correct record.",
        "6.",
        "Generate too few fields in the correct record.",
        "7.",
        "Generate the wrong answer in the fields.",
        "Situations 1 and 2 illustrate what could go wrong at the database level while scenarios 3 and 4 depict possible problems arising at the database record level.",
        "The remaining criteria (namely 5, 6 and 7) shows what could happen at the database record field level.",
        "However, the more crucial way of viewing these problems is not so much in where (i.e., at what level) these events occur, but rather in how these problems can be detected and thus measured for evaluation purposes.",
        "It is with this motivation that the following categorization was derived: a quantitative measure could be designed to account for the problems that could arise at both the database and database record levels while a qualitative measure could comparably be designed for evaluation at the database record field level.",
        "In the next section, two examples are given depicting how the quantitative measure accounts for problems arising at the first two levels.",
