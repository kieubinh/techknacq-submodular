        "When a category model (e.g. a context-free (CF) model such as a monophone) is used to a model a set of subcategories (e.g. context-dependent (CD) models such as triphones), the category model becomes the subcategory prior-probability weighted average of the subcategory models: EPsubcatMsubcat EPsubcat where M denotes a model.",

        "*This work was sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.",
        "In speech recognition, a phone category would contain some set of subcategories and a subcategory would defined by some specific set of context factors.",
        "There are many factors which may be used to define the subcategories [3]; a commonly used set is triphone [18] subcategories and monophone categories.",
        "Alternatively, stressed and unstressed phones might be combined.",
        "(Note that this averaging is recursive: subcategories are the combination of some set of subsubcategories and so on...) We assume that speech is generated from some \"true source\" language model.",
        "(This language model would change as a function of many factors such as topic, history, and participants, but we will assume it to be constant for each task.)",
        "This true language model is known for some artificial tasks such as the DARPA Resource Management (RM) database [16], but can be estimated for naturally elicited speech and text if sufficient data is available.",
        "(However, current techniques for estimating language models are fairly rudimentary.)",
        "Since the acoustic realization of the phones will be a function of this true language model, any acoustic models averaged over any group of subcategories will learn this true language model to some degree.",
        "(Learning the language model \"to some degree\" may be viewed as favoring the more likely subcategories.)",
        "Pragmatically, we have insufficient data to model all relevant subcategories separately and, even if we had sufficient data, we currently have insufficient computational resources to process all of it in any practical manner.",
        "Thus, since we must combine subcategories into larger models, a recognition system would favor the subcategories that were more commonly observed during training."

        "Thus, one would expect better recognition",
        "performance than would be predicted by the perplexity of the explicit recognition language model.",

        "But since the training data is perplexity 9, the acoustic training data includes a limited set of contexts.",
        "The explicit testing language model may allow a greater set of contexts, but the acoustic models in the recognizer are biased toward the contexts that are actually observed in the training data.",
        "WPG recognition performance would be expected to be worse if trained on data actually generated by the WPG.",
        "One would expect a similar effect if NG training data were used for NG tests.",
        "The net effect is that our performance testing is misleading: the performance obtained with the WPG does not tell us what the performance would be on a true perplexity 60 task.",
        "Similarly the NG tests do not tell us what the performance would be on a true perplexity 991 task.",

        "Errors or near misses are used to perturb the acoustic models to lessen the possibility of error.",

        "Since we have techniques which implement the language model independently of the acoustic model, it would help if the acoustic models were as free as possible from biases due to the training environment.",
        "The first technique is to use a source of training data with a rich and realistic true language model.",
        "(The richness can be further increased by using data from a number of different sources.)",
        "This will provide a rich set of contexts to allow our systems to see the full range of contexts in which a real system will have to operate.",
        "CMU has already shown that a richer data source improves one's ability to produce task independent acoustic models [5].",
        "A second technique is to minimize averaging across contexts in order to limit the ability of the acoustic models to model the language.",
        "A number of sites have already moved in this direction by changing from context-independent phone (monophone) models to left and right context dependent phone (triphone) models [18].",
        "A further step along this line has been the inclusion of crossword triphone models [7, 10, 13] which has minimized the ability of the acoustic models to learn the bigram language model.'",
        "These changes have improved recognition performance when trained and tested on the same database, but their effects on vocabulary independence have not been tested.",
        "A third technique is to use larger training datasets.",
        "(\"There is no data like more data.\").",
        "This allows us to train more contexts and minimize the smoothing (averaging) required to train models.",
        "Comparisons of performance with increased amounts of training data using the RM1 database for speaker-independent training (109 vs. 72 speakers) and the RM2 database for speaker-dependent training (2400 vs. 600 sentences per speaker) have shown improved results [15] within task.",
        "The CMU vocabulary-independence experiments showed improved cross-task performance [5], but since the amount of data llf sufficient training data is available to train the cross-word-context phone models without averaging, cross-word-context-dependent phone modeling will clearly minimize the effects of the bigram language model.",
        "However, the training data for the referenced systems was sufficiently limited that it was necessary to smooth (weighted average) some phone models for robustness and it was necessary to use cross-word-context-independent (i.e. averaged over observed word-boundary phones) phone models for the unobserved crossword phone models needed by the recognizer.",
        "The net effect for limited training data is unknown – the crossword phone models may increase the bigram language model learning for limited amounts of training data.",
        "Definitive experiments isolating this effect have not been reported.",

        "A fourth technique is to limit discriminative training to cases where the language model and vocabulary are known at training time.",
        "Discriminative training explicitly alters the acoustic models to reflect the true source and training language models.",
        "This may improve within task performance, but will not help and may impair cross-task performance.",
        "(The phone models have, in effect, been made fragile with respect to vocabulary and task.)",
        "However, it is not clear that this within-task advantage will be maintained with a good language model and better acoustic modeling techniques using non-discriminative training on adequate amounts and kinds of data.",
        "A final technique is to test with a good language model.",
        "Testing with intentionally weakened language models asks the acoustic modeling to perform a task that it has not been trained to do.",
        "While the simplicity of no-grammar testing may be attractive, it is also the most misleading test condition and does not always predict the performance of a system with a good language model.",
        "If a realistic language model is used with properly trained acoustic models, the language model will perform the word sequence modeling and the acoustic models will perform the acoustic modeling without each trying to do the other's job.",
