        "A long-standing and widely accepted linguistic theory of speech recognition holds that natural spoken messages are understood on the basis of an intermediate representation of the acoustic signal in terms of a small number of phonetic symbols.",
        "The traditional linguistic theory is very attractive for several reasons.",
        "First, it provides a natural way to partition the process of communication by spoken language into distinct acoustic, phonetic, lexical and syntactic sub-processes.",
        "Second, it provides for a reduction in bandwidth at each successive stage of the process.",
        "And, finally, it seems to be reflected in the development of written language.",
        "It is thus not surprising that this seminal idea formed the basis for several early speech recognition machines [1, 2, 3, 4].",
        "In this report we offer what we believe to be the simplest and most direct expression of the linguistic theory in a working speech recognition system.",
        "The present system is the culmination of a succession of experiments conducted over the past three years.",
        "The method of acoustic phonetic mapping is described in [5], and results of its application to speaker-dependent recognition of fluently spoken digit strings are given in [6].",
        "Next, a new method of lexical access was devised and applied to the problem of speaker-dependent recognition of isolated words from a large vocabulary [7] and sentences composed of them [8].",
        "Attention was then turned to speaker-independent phonetic transcription [9,10] which was then used in an early account of speaker independent recognition of fluent speech from the 991 word DARPA [11] resource management task [12].",
        "In its present form, our speech recognition system uses a particular kind of hidden Markov model in conjunction with an appropriate dynamic programming algorithm to accomplish the acoustic-to-phonetic mapping.",
        "This part is not constrained by lexical or syntactic considerations and is thus vocabulary and task independent.",
        "Word recognition is then easily treated as a classical string-to-string editing problem which is solved by a two-level dynamic programming algorithm, the lower level of which performs lexical access while the upper level performs the parsing function.",
        "Our account of the present speech recognition system is given in the following order.",
        "We first give an overview of the system at the block diagram level.",
        "This is followed by a detailed description of each of the component blocks, the acoustic phonetic model, the phonetic decoder and, finally, the lexical access and parsing techniques which, because they are so closely coupled, are treated as a unit.",
        "This is followed by an account of our experimental results and an interpretation of them.",
        "To summarize our results, on the DARPA resource management task with the perplexity 9 grammar, we attained 88% correct word recognition with 3% insertions yielding a word accuracy of 85%.",
        "Phonetic transcription accuracy was assessed by resynthesizing directly from the phonetic transcription.",
        "In a few informal listening tests, we judged the word intelligibility rate to be approximately 75%.",
        "The word accuracy of our system is not as good as that obtained on exactly the same data by several other conventional systems [13,14,15,16].",
        "However, we believe that a few correctable shortcomings of the existing system are responsible for the disparity.",
        "We hope to make the necessary changes in the near future."

        "There are two very important points to be made regarding this stage of processing.",
        "First, no lexical or syntactic information of any kind is available to the phonetic decoder.",
        "Second, once the decoding is accomplished, the acoustic signal is discarded.",
        "All that remains is its phonetic transcription and the duration, in centiseconds, of each phonetic unit in that transcription.",
        "The lexical access and parsing functions are conceptually separate but are combined here in a two-level dynamic programming algorithm.",
        "The lower level is the lexical part while the upper level accomplishes the grammatical analysis.",
        "The two are intricately coupled.",
        "The DP algorithm simply performs a string-to-string editing in which the error-ridden phonetic transcription is mapped into sentences of conventional orthography.",
        "The lexicon used simply gives the phonetic transcription of each vocabulary word pronounced in citation form.",
        "The grammar is a strict right linear grammar with no null productions.",
        "The entire system is implemented in FORTRAN-77 and runs on an Alliant FX-80.",
        "Because the phonetic decoding and lexical access stages have a high degree of intrinsic parallelism, we can exploit the architecture of the FX-80 to full advantage resulting in an execution time of 15 times real time for a typical sentence.",
        "We have applied this system to the DARPA Naval Resource Management Task [11] which allows one to inquire about and display in various ways, the status of a 180 ship fleet.",
        "The vocabulary is 992 words including silence and the grammar imposes a highly stylized word order syntax resulting in a entropy of about 4.4 bits/word.",

        "Since the hidden Markov model comprises an unobservable Markov chain and a set of random processes that can be directly measured, it seems most natural to represent speech as a hidden Markov chain in which the hidden states correspond to the putative unobservable phonetic symbols and the state-dependent random processes account for the variability of the observable acoustic manifestation of the corresponding phonetic symbol.",

        "The states of the model, {qi } 7=1, represent the hidden phonetic units.",
        "The phonotactic structure of the language is modelled, to a first order approximation, by the state transition matrix, a which defines the probability of occurrence of state (phoneme) qi at time t conditioned on state (phoneme) qi at time t, where ti is the duration of phoneme i.",

        "This would allow us to associate the spectral distributions with three states rather than two.",
        "This should afford a better model of coarticulatory effects.",
        "Also, the spectral distributions can be made more faithful by using Gaussian mixtures rather than unimodal multivariate densities.",
        "Fidelity can be further improved by accounting for temporal correlations among observations.",
        "Finally, we need to make a global improvement in the model by optimizing it.",
        "We have repeatedly tried reestimation techniques but, thus far, they have actually degraded performance.",
        "We speculate that applying constraints to the reestimation",
        "formulae by forcing the state sequence to be fixed will ameliorate the results of optimization.",
        "Second, we can improve the lexical access technique by rationalizing the insertion, deletion, substitution metric.",
        "One possible alternative is to replace the rhobar distance with error probabilities determined either analytically or empirically.",
