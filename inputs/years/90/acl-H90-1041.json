        "The recognition problem is to identify the most likely path (word sequence) from the root (beginning) to a leaf (end) taking into account the junction probabilities (the stochastic language model) and the optimum acoustic match (including time alignment) given that path.",

        "This search will result in a prohibitive amount of computation and a very large stack for any large-vocabulary high-perplexity speech recognition task because the score decreases rapidly with path length and thus short paths will be \"carried along\".",
        "A better scoring criterion is the A* criterion [7].",
        "The A* criterion is the difference between the actual log-likelihood of reaching a point in time on a path and an upper bound on the log-likelihood of any path reaching that point in time:",

        "In general, the closer ubL(t) is to lubL(t), the less computation.",

        "If ubL(t) becomes less than lubL(t), longer paths will be favored excessively and the first output sentence may not have the highest log-likelihood, i.e., a search error may occur.",
        "(Note that ubL(t) is constant for any t and therefore does not affect the relative scores of the paths at any fixed time – it only affects the comparison of paths of differing lengths and the resultant order of path expansion.)",
        "The basic problem is obtaining a good estimate of ubL(t) in a time-asynchronous decoder.",
        "(Note that lubL,tate(t) over the states is easily computed in a time-synchronous decoder and that Astate(t) is the value compared to the pruning threshold in a beam search [6].)",

        "Reorganizing the stack immediately preceding each pop if the least upper bound has been updated, adding a miniscule length dependent penalty, and using the maximum of the normalized log-likelihood as the stack score for each theory results in a computationally-optimal admissible implementation of the stack decoder.",
