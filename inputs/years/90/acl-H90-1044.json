        "The direction finding capability is provided by an expert system which is also part of the MIT VOYAGER system [18]).",
        "1 One major goal in this research has been to understand issues of training vs. coverage in porting a language understanding system to a new domain.",
        "Specifically, we wished to determine how much data it takes to train a spoken language system to a given level of performance for a new domain.",
        "We can use the answer to this question in the process of designing data collection tasks to decide how much data to collect.",
        "We address a related question, that is, how to quantify the growth of a system as a function of training, in [12].",
        "To explore the relationship of training to coverage, we have developed a methodology to measure coverage of unseen material as a function of training material.",
        "Using successive batches of new material, we assessed coverage on a batch of unseen material, then trained on this material until we reached a certain level of coverage, then repeated the experiment on a new batch of material.",
        "The system coverage seemed to level off at about 70% coverage of unseen data after 1000 sentences of training data.",
        "A second goal was to develop a methodology for automatically tuning a broad-coverage grammar to a new application domain.",
        "This approach avoids repeating domain independent grammar development work over again for each new domain.",
        "To do this we developed a method for deriving a minimal grammar and a minimal This work was supported by DARPA contract N000014-8900171, administered by the Office of Naval Research.",
        "We are grateful to Victor Zue of MIT for making the SUMMIT and VOYAGER systems available to us, and for providing us with the direction-finding data.",
        "We also wish to thank Mitch Marcus of the University of Pennsylvania for making the services of outside evaluators available to us, and Beatrice Santorini for coordinating the evaluation.",

        "The application of this technique to the DIRECTION-FINDING corpus will be described in this paper.",
        "We then compared the coverage and performance of the minimal grammar and lexicon on a test set, and found that a twofold decrease in parse time was achieved with only a small loss of coverage.",
        "Our second major focus was on evaluation of specific algorithms, using the natural language system as a testbed.",
        "In particular, we compared the performance of two algorithms for reference resolution processing.",
        "Finally, our third major focus has been to evaluate the overall coverage and accuracy of the entire spoken language system.",
        "We did this using two test corpora collected at MIT ([17]), containing a total of 1015 utterances.",
        "The system was evaluated on the basis of the first utterance of the N-best output of SUMMIT accepted by PUNDIT, or the first candidate of the N-best if no utterance was accepted by PUNDIT.",

        "The architecture of the system which we report on here has also been largely described elsewhere ([1]), with the exception of the N-best processing, and so will only be summarized here.",
        "There are five major components of the system, the speech recognition system (SUMMIT), the dialog manager (vFE), the PUNDIT natural language processing system, the module which formats PUNDIT'S",

        "VFE takes summiT's N-best output (computed using a word-pair grammar of perplexity 60), and sends it to PUNDIT for syntactic and semantic analysis.",
        "The first candidate which PUNDIT accepts is sent to QTIP, where it is formatted and sent to the direction finder.",
        "When the direction finder's English response is returned to VFE, it is sent to PUNDIT as well, so that the information from the direction finder's response can be processed and incorporated into the discourse context.",
        "This feature allows the user to refer to things that the direction finder has mentioned, and in general allows the user and the expert system to engage in a dialog.",

        "This approach has the disadvantage of constructing a basic grammar of English over again for each domain.",
        "The other approach is to prune a general grammar of English to cover only those constructions seen in the training data.",
        "This approach has the advantage of making available a 'library' of constructions (that is, the full grammar) which can easily be added to the system when additional data indicates a need for them.",
        "In both cases, the coverage of the grammar will directly reflect the amount of training data seen.",
        "We have developed a technique for pruning our general English grammar, based on supervised training.",
        "We make use of the fact that PUNDIT provides a detailed parse tree, reflecting the set of BNF definitions used in parsing the sentence.",
        "The parse tree also contains each word labeled by part of speech.",
        "Given a corpus of training sentences with their correct parses, a program can identify those constructions used to obtain that parse and can extract the associated rules from the general grammar.",
        "Similarly, it can identify how each word is actually used in the training data and extract a minimal lexical definition reflecting the word's usage in context.",
        "Using these techniques, we performed a small set of experiments on the effects of pruning both the grammar and the lexicon.",
        "There are several ways to analyze how pruning affects overall system behavior.",
        "We can look for reduction in perplexity; however, given the heavily context-dependent nature of our grammar, the effects of pruning seemed quite small (10-15% reduction).",
        "We also looked at the effect of pruning on overall system performance.",
        "Given a grammar based on some 500 training sentences, we observed a twofold speed-up when the same sentences were run using the pruned grammar and lexicon (reducing the average time to correct parse from 4.2 sec to 2.1 seconds, on a Sun 3-60).",
        "We also looked at the relation between coverage and amount of training data.",
        "Our tests indicated that we did not lose much coverage by pruning the grammar (-3 % after training on 226 sentences and 2 % after training on 526 sentences).",
        "We lost more coverage from pruning the lexicon (-33 % after training on 226 sentences, and 7 % after training on 526 sentences), but this was largely to the \"unknown\" word problem, more than to pruning away needed meanings.",
        "Batch",
        "These experiments, though limited, indicate that grammar and lexicon pruning may offer significant reductions in processing time with only small losses in coverage.",

        "Since we had only one judge for Test Set 2, we do not have reliability measurements for that data.",
        "This reliability score can be interpreted as saying that if a new set of judges did these tasks we would expect the correlation between the new judgements and the old judgments to have this value.",
        "The high reliability of the correctness judgement is not surprising, since this is a fairly objective judgement.",
        "The other, more subjective, judgements which we asked the evaluators to make were less reliable than correctness.",
        "For example, the reliability of the fluency judgements on the test data was only .34.",
        "We believe that this could be improved through more explicit instructions and some additional training for the evaluators, although it may be that the fluency judgement is of only marginal interest anyway.",
        "Disagreements among the judges were mediated by an expert judge who was familiar with the evaluation task, but was not a system developer.",
        "Tables 1 and 2 show that, while PUNDIT as a filter did not provide a large improvement in word accuracy, it did provide a fairly large improvement in sentence accuracy, and it roughly doubled application accuracy.",
        "Application accuracy went from 22.0 to 45.7 percent for Test Set 1 and from 28.0 to 51.6 percent for Test Set 2.",
        "This improvement results from PUNDIT'S ability to reject uninterpretable candidates in the set of N-best candidates, so that only meaningful candidates are considered for interpretation.",
        "It is also interesting to note that word accuracy and application accuracy do not covary completely.",
        "There are two reasons for this.",
        "First, it is possible for a candidate that is semantically equivalent to the reference answer to be accepted by the natural language system and for the answer to be judged correct.",
        "For example, this would be the case if the reference utterance was How do I get to the nearest bank?",
        "but the natural language system accepted How would I get to the nearest bank?.",
        "The upshot of this situation is a correct score for application accuracy but a lower score for word accuracy.",
        "On the other hand, it is possible for the reference candidate to be accepted by the natural language system, but to then be misunderstood and consequently give an incorrect response.",
        "This means that word accuracy is good even though application accuracy is bad.",
        "ers, 496 query/response pairs), depending on whether or not reference query occurred in N-best (N=100).",
        "Over and above these summary scores, we wished to investigate the performance of PUNDIT depending on the state of affairs in the N-best.",
        "For example, we looked at what PUNDIT did when the reference query occurrs in the N-best and when it does not.",
        "If the reference query",
        "occurs in the N-best then the right thing for the natural language system to do is to find it, or find a semantically equivalent candidate, and give a correct answer.",
        "On the other hand, if the reference query is not in the N-best, then the right thing to do is either to find a semantically equivalent candidate and give a correct answer, or to reject all candidates.",
        "Table 3 shows how often PUNDIT did the right thing, by these criteria, for Test Set 1 with N=40, and Table 4 shows similar results for Test Set 2 with N=100.",
        "We were also interested in looking at the performance of the system as a function of the location of the reference answer in the N-best.",
        "This bears on the question of what the optimal setting is for N. Intuitively, looking at more candidates increases the probability that the reference utterance or a semantic equivalent will be found, but at the same time it increases the probability of a false alarm, with the natural language system finding an acceptable candidate that differs semantically from the reference utterance in crucial ways.",
        "If we could quantify the relationships among N, the rate of correct responses, and the false alarm rate, it would give us a technique for setting N for optimal accuracy of the spoken language system, given a particular speech recognizer and a particular language understanding component.2 In Figure 2, we show the cumulative correct answers and the cumulative false alarms as a function of the location of the reference utterance in the direction finding data from Test Set 1 and Test Set 2.",
        "In order to determine the optimal setting of N for the SUMMIT/PUNDIT system, we looked at the difference between the cumulative correct responses and false alarms as a function of the location of the reference utterance in the N-best.",
        "Figure 3 shows this difference, assuming that correct responses and false alarms have an equal weighting.",
        "Obviously they do not have an equal weighting in general.",
        "In fact, in most applications false alarms should probably be heavily penalized.",
        "If we weight the cost of a false alarm at three times the benefit of a correct response, then the optimal performance of this system is obtained with N = 10 for Test Set 1 and N = 11 for Test Set 2.",
        "That is, if the answer is not found in the top 10-11 candidates, the cost of false alarms exceeds the benefit of increased correct responses.",
        "2 This leaves out another important component of optimal N, of course, which is time, since a larger N would normally be expected to result in increased processing time."
