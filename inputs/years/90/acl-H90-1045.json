        "Meaningful evaluation of spoken language interfaces must be based on detailed comparisons with an alternate, well-understood input modality, such as the keyboard.",
        "This paper presents an empirical study in which users were asked to enter digit strings into the computer by voice and by keyboard.",
        "Two different ways of verifying and correcting the spoken input were also examined using either voice or keyboard.",
        "Timing analyses were performed to determine which aspects of the interface were critical to speedy completion of the task.",
        "The results show that speech is preferable for strings that require more than a few keystrokes.",
        "The results emphasize the need for fast and accurate speech recognition, but also demonstrate how error correction and input validation are crucial components of a speech interface.",
        "Although the performance of continuous speech recognizers has improved significantly in recent years [6], few application programs using such technology have been built.",
        "This discrepancy is based on the fallacy of equating speech recognition performance with the usability of a spoken language application.",
        "Clearly, the accuracy of the speech recognition component is a key factor in the usability of a spoken language system.",
        "However other factors come into play when we consider a recognition system in the context of live use.",
        "For example, system response time has direct consequences for system usability.",
        "Various studies have shown that the amount of delay introduced by a system significantly affects the characteristics of a task (such as throughput) as well as human performance (such as choice of task strategy) [3, 15].",
        "Less intuitive interface issues concern the control of the interaction.",
        "When does the system listen to the speaker and when should it ignore speech as extraneous?",
        "How can the system best signal to the speaker that it is ready to listen?",
        "How can a user verify that the system understood the utterance correctly?",
        "How does the user correct any recognition errors quickly and efficiently?",
        "These and other questions are currently unanswered.",
        "While some researchers have found speech to be the best communication mode in human-human problem solving [1], results from evaluations of computer speech recognizers point in the opposite direction [10, 11, 16, 9], with the exception of a few, contrived, exceptions [14].",
        "The community has become aware that speech applications need more than good recognition to function adequately [13, 4, 8], but no systematic solutions have been offered.",
        "Our objectives in this paper are to clarify some of the tradeoffs involved when users are given the option of using either speech or typing as an input to an application program.",
        "We deliberately chose the simplest possible task to avoid confusing task-related cognitive factors with the inherent advantages and disadvantages of the interface modes."

        "The study consisted of two essentially identical experiments and differed only in the method of stimulus presentation.",
        "Both experiments required the subjects to enter three lists of 66 digit strings into the computer, using three different data entry modes.",
        "In the first experiment, the digit strings were presented on the screen, two lines above the area where either the speech recognition result or the typed input was displayed.",
        "In the second experiment, the subjects had to read the digit strings from a sheet of paper placed next to the keyboard and monitor.",
        "We will refer to the first experiment as the screen experiment and to the second experiment as the paper experiment throughout this report.",
        "There were 3 lists of 66 digit strings to be entered.",
        "Each data set contained exactly 11 randomly generated digit strings of length 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11.",
        "The first six digit strings included one string of each length and were identical for all data sets.",
        "These first six digit strings were included for the purpose of familiarizing the subject with a particular condition and were consequently removed from the transcripts before data analysis.",
        "Three lists of randomized digit string were generated once at the start of the experiment and used throughout.",
        "Three data entry modes were included in the experiment.",
        "• In the first mode voice only, subjects could only use speech to enter a digit string.",
        "They read the digit string out loud into a head-mounted, close-talking microphone.",
        "The speech recognizer would then analyze the speech signal and display the recognition as a digit string.",
        "The subject was asked to verify the result of the recognition.",
        "If the result was not correct, the subject was instructed to repeat the digit string into the microphone.",
        "This procedure was repeated until the number displayed as the recognition was correct.",
        "If the displayed recognition result was correct, the subject would then say the word \"OK\" or \"ENTER\".",
        "The system running the experiment would then store the number that was entered and the subject could proceed to the next number on his/her list.",
        "• In the voice with keyboard correction mode, the subject would again read the digit string into the system.",
        "If the recognition was not correct, the subject was instructed to use the keyboard to enter the correct digit string terminated by a carriage return.",
        "If the recognition string was correct, or after the keyboard correction was performed, the subject hit the enter key to store the number in the system.",
        "• In the keyboard only mode, subjects typed in the digit string, which was then also displayed for confirmation and correction.",
        "If they had miskeyed the string they could correct it again using the keyboard.",
        "Once the correct digit string was displayed on the screen, subjects would hit the enter key to store the number in the system and proceed to the next number.",
