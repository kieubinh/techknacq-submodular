        "Explanation-based learning (EBL) is a machine-learning technique, closely connected to other techniques like macro-operator learning, chunking, and partial evaluation; a phrase we have found useful for describing the method to logic programmers is example-guided partial evaluation.",
        "The basic ideas of the method are well-described in an overview article which recently appeared in Artificial Intelligence [1], to which we refer the reader who wants to understand the theoretical principles; here, we will only summarize briefly what EBL means in the context of natural-language processing.",
        "A detailed presentation can be found in [3] and [4].",
        "What EBL tries to do in the context of NLP is exploit the well-known observation that users of an NL interface tend to ask the same types of question most of the time; lacking exact figures, it seems reasonable to guess that at least 80% of all questions posed to a given specific NL application will be accounted for by the 100 most common question-types.",
        "If one had some simple way of automatically identifying these \"common\" question-types, it would be possible to win a great deal of efficiency by bypassing the normal parsing mechanism in all but the hard cases.",
        "Unfortunately, it is not feasible simply to add 100 extra rules to the grammar, since the common question-types vary depending on the application: a construction which occurs constantly in one domain may hardly exist in another.",
        "Something more sophisticated is required, which is capable of taking examples of common types of query and synthesizing the corresponding special rules.",
        "This is exactly what the EBL method offers.",
        "The normal route through the parser is extended with an EBL bypass, which contains special rules for efficient processing of common queries; these rules are not coded by the programmer, but rather are produced automatically by inspecting the solutions to previously posed queries of the same type.",
        "EBL can thus best be thought of as a way of automatically tuning an NL system to produce increased performance in a particular domain.",
        "The EBL module can consequently be divided into its compile-time and runtime parts.",
        "The compile-time part extracts the learned rules from sample queries: the central component is the generalizer, which in our version is essentially a type of Prolog interpreter.",
        "The runtime part then applies the rules to input queries, the compile-time system having previously indexed them so as to make them readily accessible to some kind of table lookup facility.",
        "In [4], we demonstrated, using examples taken from an application of the EBL method to CHAT-80 [2], that table lookup methods of this kind can be implemented quite simply in Prolog with a minimal overhead.",
        "In the current paper, we describe the results of experiments carried out at IBM Nordic Laboratories, where the EBL method was used on a large-scale NL query interface prototype.",
        "The EBL module learns a \"two-level\" set of special grammar rules; the top-level rules for S's treat NP's as primitive, and these are supplemented by a second set of rules for common NP's.",
        "Both types of rules are learned automatically in the way described above.",
        "In the remainder of the paper, we first give a brief overview of the IBM system, concentrating on the features that presented problems for the implementation of the EBL process; we then describe the architecture of the EBL module's compile-time and runtime components.",
        "In section 4, we present our experimental results, which indicate fairly unambiguously that the EBL method gives a real, and quite substantial, speed-up of the system as a whole; the final section contains our conclusions together with suggested directions for further research."

        "The system used for our experiments was a large-scale NL query prototype, implemented in Prolog, which is intended to provide good coverage of a fairly large portion of English.",
        "The main components perform the tasks of parsing, semantic interpretation, paraphrasing and database query generation; since the first of these is both the \"cleanest\" and by far the most time-consuming, we decided only to attempt to apply EBL to this phase of the process.",
        "We will thus concentrate exclusively in the following description on the grammar formalism, grammar and parser.",
        "As explained in [4], the main difficulties derive from the fact that our implementation of the EBL method requires the grammar to be reduced to a set of Horn-clauses: in our earlier experiments with CHAT-80, this was fairly simple, and only involved some minor editing of the code.",
        "Here, however, the gap between the grammar and an equivalent \"clean\" version was non-trivial.",
        "This was much more important than the mere increase in its size (-1000 rules, as opposed to 150 for CHAT-80), which in fact caused no problems at all.",
        "The two major hurdles with regard to the grammar formalism were its non-standard treatment of features and movement.",
        "The basic feature operation is not unification, but priority merge: movement is handled not by gap features, but rather by \"non-restrictive\" rules, in which more than one non-terminal can occur on the left-hand side of the rule as well as the right.",
        "Partly due to this, an unusual parsing mechanism is used, in which extra-logical predicates (especially \"assert\") play an integral part.",
        "To give the flavour of the formalism, the following is a slightly modified version of a typical non-restrictive rule, in this case intended to cover free relatives like the one in \"John mentioned a book yesterday which you should read\":",
        "The rule reverses the sequence of temporal adverbial and relative clause, in effect transforming the sentence into \"John mentioned a book which you should read yesterday\".",
        "The \"2\" in the first argument position in the left-hand \"s\" indicates that its features are to be inherited from those in the second constituent on the right-hand side; \"prm=1\" means that the \"p rm\" feature in the inherited set will if necessary be overridden and set to 1.",
        "As we shall see in section 3.3, the parsing mechanism turns out to be irrelevant for our purposes; all that is significant is the grammar, viewed as a declarative description.",
        "We shall accordingly conclude our description of the target system at this point."

        "For convenience, we will subdivide the compile-time system into three smaller components.",
        "These are the grammar pre-processor, which converts the grammar into a suitable pure Horn-clause representation; the generalizer, which performs the actual extraction of learned rules; and the simplifier, which attempts to reduce them in size by removing unnecessary calls.",

        "This component performs the job of converting the original grammar into a pure DCG form, in which the first argument of each non-terminal contains a term encoding its derivation history; the motivation for this additional condition will be apparent in the next section.",
        "The only non-trivial part of the process, from our viewpoint, was dealing with unrestricted rules, since the other problems had already been taken care of by the normal grammar compiler.",
        "However, it turned out that this problem could also be solved simply, by first representing the unrestricted rules in Pereira's Extraposition Grammar (XG) format; using the XG compiler from [2], it is then straightforward to turn the grammar into pure Horn-clauses.",
        "Conceptually, the XG compiler turns the unrestricted grammar into a DCG, where each non-terminal is given an extra pair of arguments (the \"extraposition list\"), to pass around the additional left-hand constituents.",
        "To give an example, the rule quoted at the end of section 2 is represented (again in a slightly edited form) as follows:",
        "fget_feature (Feat s_4,_ rel , 1 ) , put_feature (Feat s2, prm, 1, Feat s_l ) , put_ feature (Feats_4, trm, 1, Feats2) } .",
        "The DCG produced can potentially contain left-recursive rules.",

        "Since a detailed description of the generalizer can be found in [4], we will restrict ourselves here to an example and a brief overview.",
        "The basic idea is first to define the class of operational goals; by this, we mean the goals which will be allowed to appear on the right-hand-side of learned rules.",
        "Having done this, a successfully processed example is generalized by (notionally) constructing a derivation tree for it, and then chopping off all the branches rooted in operational goals; the leaves in the new, \"generalized\" derivation will be the conditions in the learned rule (and thus by construction operational), and the root will be a more general version of the goal corresponding to that in the example.",
        "In the simplest (one-level) version of the scheme, operational goals will coincide with lexical ones: thus generalization will be at the word level.",
        "An illustrative example is shown in diagram 1.",
        "A slight refinement is to allow non-lexical operational goals, in particular ones corresponding to NP's.",
        "The basic method can now be applied recursively, first to the proof tree corresponding to the entire example, and then to each tree rooted in an operational NP goal; in the latter case, the operationality criterion is once again lexical.",
        "This results in the acquisition of two sets of rules, corresponding to the two different operationality criteria: the top-level rules construct S's from NP's and lexical items, and the second-level ones construct NP's from lexical items alone.",
        "The generalizer is basically a Prolog meta-interpreter, which means that generalization is from a computational perspective essentially the parsing of a query with a DCG; this means that care has to be taken to ensure that parsing efficiency is acceptably high, and even more importantly that infinite recursions are not caused by left-recursive grammar rules.",
        "Luckily, there is a simple and uniform way to solve this problem, by exploiting the fact that the first argument in each rule has been set up to hold the derivation history.",
        "The query is first run through the normal, \"dirty\" grammar, to find the intended instantiation of the derivation argument; this is then used to guide DCG parser used by the generalizer, effectively making the \"parsing\" deterministic.",

        "Dividing feature-manipulation into \"gets\" and \"puts\", we can optimize in at least the following ways: - Removing \"gets\" which can already be seen at compile-time to succeed.",

        "- Reordering the rule body so that all structure-building takes place at the end: this ensures that structure will only be built if the rule succeeds.",
        "If features were only used for syntax, it would also be possible to perform a further kind of optimization for S-level rules; having traced each \"get\" back through the chain of \"puts\" ending in the feature set it accesses, we could then remove the \"puts\" altogether.",
