        "The recent trend in natural language processing research has been to develop systems that deal with text concerning small, well defined domains.",
        "One practical application for such systems is to process messages pertaining to some very specific task or activity [5].",
        "The advantage of dealing with such domains is twofold - firstly, due to the narrowness of the domain, it is possible to encode most of the knowledge related to the domain and to make this knowledge accessible to the natural language processing system, which in turn can use this knowledge to disambiguate the meanings of the messages.",
        "Secondly, in such a domain, there is not a great diversity of language constructs and therefore it becomes easier to construct a grammar which will capture all the constructs which exist in this sub-language.",
        "However, some practical aspects of such domains tend to make the problem somewhat difficult.",
        "Often, the messages tend not to be absolutely grammatically correct.",
        "As a result, the grammar designed for such a system needs to be far more forgiving than one designed for the task of parsing edited English.",
        "This can result in a proliferation of parses, which in turn makes the disambiguation task more difficult.",
        "This problem is further compounded by the telegraphic nature of the discourse, since telegraphic discourse is more prone to be syntactically ambiguous."

        "The major objective of the research described in this paper is to use statistical data to evaluate the likelihood of a parse in order to help the parser prune out unlikely parses.",

        "The success rate of about 50% achieved by the probabilistic parser at UCREL is certainly impressive [4], considering the fact that their corpus included a range of domains and text types.",
        "However, our objectives differ from that of UCREL in that our aim is to build a system for a specific application task (viz. information extraction).",
        "For this reason, we sacrifice breadth of coverage for higher reliability.",
        "We use a model of probabilistic sentence generation based on a context-free grammar with independent probabilities for the expansion of any non-terminal by its alternate productions.",
        "These probabilities are adjusted to generate sentences in which the frequency of particular constructs corresponds to that observed in a sample corpus.",
        "The resulting grammar gives us not only the probabilities of sentences, but also the probabilities of alternate parses for a single sentence.",
        "It is the latter probabilities which are of primary interest to us in analyzing new sentences.",
        "Initially, probabilities of all individual productions were determined using a corpus of text.",
        "This body of text was parsed using the NYU PROTEUS grammar which is a subset of Sager's grammar[10] based on Linguistic String Theory [7].",
        "The parsing was performed using a chart parser [8].",
        "The probabilities of the productions were computed by an iterative procedure described below.",
        "The parser was then modified to use these probabilities.",
        "The probability of a parse tree is computed as the product of probabilities of all the productions used in that particular parse tree.",
        "The parsing algorithm generates parses in the best-first order [9] (i.e. most probable parse first).",
        "The prioritizing of productions not only helps in the disambiguation of parses but also forces the parser to try more likely productions first.",
        "As a result, there is a twofold improvement attributable to this modified parsing algorithm.",
        "Firstly, the accuracy of the parsing improves since the parser provides a mechanism to identify the most likely parse.",
        "Secondly, the tendency of the parser to try more likely productions first results in a quicker conclusion of the search process and a faster parser .",
        "To further enhance the performance of the system, probabilities of individual productions were computed separately for each of the contexts in which they could 'Speed of the parser can be approximately assessed from the number of edges generated.",
        "An edge is an intermediate hypothesis made by the parser [8]",
        "be invoked and these probabilities were used to compute probabilities of parse trees.",
        "This modification improved the speed and accuracy of the system still further.",

        "This computation was performed in a recursive manner, since edges themselves are incomplete parses.",
