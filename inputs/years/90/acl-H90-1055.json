        "To combat a limited set of specific circumstances in which the hypothesis fails, we use a small (4 rule, 8 symbol) distituent grammar, which indicates when two parts of speech cannot remain in the same constituent.",

        "In this section, we characterize a constituent boundary parsing algorithm, using an information-theoretic measure called generalized mutual information, which serves as an alternative to traditional grammar-based parsing methods.",

        "Our hypothesis is that constituent boundaries, or \"distituents,\" can be extracted from a sequence of n categories, or an n-gram, by analyzing the mutual information values of the part-of-speech sequences within that n-gram.",
        "In particular, we demonstrate that the generalized mutual information statistic, an extension of the bigram (pairwise) mutual information of two events into n-space, acts as a viable measure of continuity in a sentence.",
        "This hypothesis assumes that, given any constituent n-gram, aia2 ...an, the probability of that constituent occurring is usually significantly higher than the probability of aia2 ...anan+i occurring.",
        "This is true, in general, because most constituents appear in a variety of contexts.",
        "Once a constituent is detected, it is usually very difficult to predict what part-of-speech will come next.",
        "As it turns out, however, there are cases in which this assumption is not valid, but only a handful of these cases are responsible for a majority of the errors made by the parser.",
        "To deal with these cases, our algorithm includes what we will call a distituent grammar – a list of tag pairs which cannot be adjacent within a constituent.",
        "One such pair is noun prep, since English does not allow a constituent consisting of a noun followed by a preposition.",
        "Notice that the nominal head of a noun phrase may be followed by a prepositional phrase; in the context of distituent parsing, once a sequence of tags, such as (prep noun), is grouped as a constituent, it is considered as",
        "a unit.",
        "Our current distituent grammar consists of four rules of two tokens each.",
        "Our current implementation of this parsing algorithm determines a recursive unlabeled bracketing of unrestricted English text.",

        "Many of the errors on longer sentences result from conjunctions, which are traditionally troublesome for grammar-based algorithms as well.",
        "Further, this parsing technique is reasonably efficient, parsing a 35,000 word corpus in under 10 minutes on a Sun 4/280.",
        "While many stochastic approaches to natural language processing that utilize frequencies to estimate probabilities suffer from sparse data, sparse data is not a concern in the domain of our algorithm.",
        "Sparse data usually results from the infrequency of word sequences in a corpus.",
        "The statistics extracted from our training corpus are based on tag n-grams for a set of 64 tags, not word n-grams.",
        "The corpus size is sufficiently large that enough tag n-grams occur with sufficient frequency to permit accurate estimates of their probabilities.",
        "Therefore, the kinds of estimation methods of (n 1)-gram probabilities using n-gram probabilities discussed in Katz (1987) and Church & Gale (1989) are not needed.",

        "We will then adjudicate between the output of this new tagger, run on the same corpus, and the previously tagged material.",
        "We believe that this will yield well below 1% error, at an additional cost of between 5 and 10 minutes per 1000 words of material.",
        "To provide exceptionally accurate bigram frequency evidence for retraining the automatic tagger we are using, two subcorpora (Library of America, DOE abstracts) were tagged twice by different annotators, and the Library of America texts were adjudicated by a third annotator, yielding \"460,000 words tagged with an accuracy estimated to exceed 99.5%.",
        "Table 2 provides an estimate of error rate for part-of-speech annotation based on the tagging of the sample described above.",
        "Error rate is measured in terms of the",
        "number of disagreements with a benchmark version of the sample prepared by Beatrice Santorini.",
        "We have also estimated the rate of inter-annotator inconsistency based on the tagging of the sample described above (cf. Table 3).",
        "Inconsistency is measured in terms of the proportion of disagreements of each of the annotators with each other over the total number of words in the test corpus (5,425 words).",
        "Table 4 provides an estimate of speed of part-of-speech annotation for a set of ten randomly selected texts from the Dow Jones Corpus (containing a total of 5,425 words), corrected by each of our annotators.",
        "The annotators were throughly familiar with the genre, having spent over three months immediately prior to the experiment correcting texts from the same Corpus.",
        "Given that the average productivity overall of our project has been between 3,000-3,500 words per hour of time billed by our annotators, it appears that our strategy of hiring annotators for no more than 3 hours a day has proven to be quite successful.",
        "Finally, the summary statistics in Table 5 provide an estimate of improvement of annotation speed as a function of familiarity with genre.",
        "We compared the annotators' speed on two samples of the Brown Corpus (10 texts) and the Dow Jones Corpus (100 texts).",
        "We examined the first and last samples of each genre that the",
        "annotators tagged; in each case, more than two months of experience lay between the samples."
