        "Text-based systems can be broadly classified into classification systems and comprehension systems.",
        "Text classification systems include traditional information retrieval (IR) systems, which retrieve texts in response to a user query, as well as categorization systems, which assign texts to one or more of a fixed set of categories.",
        "Text comprehension systems go beyond classification to transform text in some way, such as producing summaries, answering questions, or extracting data.",
        "Text classification systems can be viewed as computing a function from documents to one or more class values.",
        "Most commercial text retrieval systems require users to enter such a function directly in the form of a boolean query.",
        "For example, the query (language OR speech) AND AU= Smith specifies a 1-ary 2-valued (boolean) function that takes on the value TRUE for documents that are authored by Smith and contain the word language or the word speech.",
        "In statistical IR systems, which have long been investigated by researchers and are beginning to reach the marketplace, the user typically enters a natural language query, such as Show me uses of speech recognition.",
        "The assumption is made that the attributes (content words, in this case) used in the query will be strongly associated with documents that should be retrieved.",
        "A statistical IR system uses these attributes to construct a classification function, such as:",
        "This function assumes that there is an attribute corresponding to each word, and that attribute takes on some value for each document, such as the number of occurrences of the word in the document.",
        "The coefficients ci indicate the weight given to each attribute.",
        "The function produces a numeric score for each document, and these scores can be used to determine which documents to retrieve or, more usefully, to display documents to the user in ranked order: Speech Recognition Applications 0.88 Jones Gives Speech at Trade Show 0.65 Speech and Speech Based Systems 0.57 Most methods for deriving classification functions from natural language queries use statistics of word occurrences to set the coefficients of a linear discriminant function [5,20].",
        "The best results are obtained when supervised machine learning, in the guise of relevance feedback, is used [21,6].",
        "Text categorization systems can also be viewed as computing a function defined over documents, in this case a k-ary function, where k is the number of categories into which documents can be sorted.",
        "Rather than deriving this function from a natural language query, it is typically constructed directly by experts [28], perhaps using a complex pattern matching language [12].",
        "Alternately, the function may be induced by machine learning techniques from large numbers of previously categorized documents [17,11,2]."

        "Any text classification function assumes a particular representation of documents.",
        "With the exception of a few experimental knowledge-based IR systems [15], these text representations map documents into vectors of attribute values, usually boolean or numeric.",
        "For example, the document title \"Speech and Speech Based Systems\" might be represented as",
        "(F, F, F, T, F, F, T, F, T, F, F, F ...) in a system which uses boolean attribute values and omits common function words (such as and) from the text representation.",
        "The T's correspond to the words speech, based, and systems.",
        "The same title might be represented as (0, 0, 0, 1.0, 0, 0, 0.5, 0, 0.5, 0, 0, 0 ...) in a statistical retrieval systems where each attribute is given a weight equal to the number of occurrences of the word in the document, divided by the number of occurrences of the most frequent word in the document.",
        "Information retrieval researchers have experimented with a wide range of text representations, including variations on words from the original text, manually assigned keywords, citation and publication information, and structures produced by NLP analysis [15].",
        "Besides this empirical work, there have also been a few attempts to theoretically characterize the properties of different representations and relate them to retrieval system performance.",
        "The most notable of these attempts is Salton's term discrimination model [19] which says that a good text attribute is one that increases the average distance between all pairs of document vectors.",
        "However, none of the proposed models of text representation quality addresses the following anomaly: since most text representations have very high dimensionality (large number of attributes), there is usually a legal classification function that will produce any desired partition of the document collection.",
        "This means that essentially all proposed text representations have the same upper bound performance.",
        "Therefore, in order to understand why one text representation is better than another, we need to take into consideration the limited ability of both humans and machine learning algorithms to produce classification functions.",
        "The concept learning model of text classification [14] assumes that both machine production of classification functions (as in translation of natural language queries and relevance feedback) and human production of classification functions (as in user querying or expert construction of categorization systems) can usefully be viewed as machine learning.",
        "Whether this is a useful model of human production of classification functions is a question for experiment.",
        "If so, useful view (which remains to be determined), a wide range of theoretical results and practical techniques from machine learning, pattern recognition, and statistics will take on new significance for text classification systems.",
        "We survey a variety of representations from the standpoint of the concept learning model in [15].",
        "We are currently conducting several experiments to test the predictions of the model [14].",

        "The relevance judgments tell which documents are relevant (i.e. should be retrieved) for each query.",
        "The retrieval system can be applied to each query in turn, producing either a set of retrieved documents, or ranking all documents in the order in which they would be retrieved.",
        "Two performance figures can be computed for a set of retrieved documents.",
        "Recall is the percentage of all relevant documents which show up in the retrieved set, while precision is the percentage of documents in the retrieved set which are actually relevant.",
        "Recall and precision figures can be averaged over the group of queries, or the recall precision pair for each query plotted on a scatterplot.",
        "For systems which produce a ranking rather than a single retrieved set, there is a recall and precision figure corresponding to each point in the ranking.",
        "The average performance for a set of queries can be displayed in terms of average precision levels at various recall levels (as in Table 1) or the averages at various points can be graphed as a recall precision curve.",
        "Both methods display for a particular technique how much precision must be sacrificed to reach a particular recall level.",
        "A single performance figure which is often used to compare systems is the average precision at 10 standard recall levels (again as in Table 1), which is an approximation to the area under the recall precision curve.",
        "A difference of 5% in these figures is traditionally called noticeable and 10% is considered material [22].",
        "Other single figures of merit have also been proposed [27].",
        "A large number of test collections have been used in IR research, with some being widely distributed and used by many researchers.",
        "The superiority of a new technique is not widely accepted until it has been demonstrated on several test collections.",
        "Test collections range in size from a few hundreds to a few tens of thousands of documents, with anywhere from 20 to a few hundred queries.",
        "Results on the smaller collections have often turned out to be unreliable, so the larger collections are preferred.",
        "Evaluation is still a research issue in IR.",
        "The exhaustive relevance judgments assumed for traditional test collections are not possible with larger collections, nor when evaluating highly interactive retrieval systems [6].",

        "The simplest explanation for the low quality of clusters is that not enough text was used in forming them.",
        "Table 2 gives considerable evidence that this is the case.",
        "The majority of occurrences of phrases were of phrases that occurred only once, and only 17.6% of distinct phrases occurred two or more times.",
        "We restricted cluster formation to phrases that occurred at least twice, and most of these phrases occurred exactly twice.",
        "This means that we were trying to group phrases based on the similarity of distributions estimated from very little data.",
        "Church [3] and others have stressed the need for large amounts of data in studying statistical properties of words, and this is even more necessary when studying phrases, with their lower frequency of occurrence.",
        "Another statistical issue arises in the calculation of similarities between phrases.",
        "We associated with each phrase a vector of values of the form n1,/ E nc, where ge, np, is the number of occurrences of phrase p in documents assigned to Computing Reviews category c, and the denominator is the total number of occurrences of all phrases in category c. This is the maximum likelihood estimator of the probability that a randomly selected phrase from documents in the category will be the given phrase.",
        "Similarity between phrases was computed by applying the cosine correlation [1] to these vectors.",
        "Problems with the maximum likelihood estimator for small samples are well known [10,4], so it is possible that clustering will be improved by the use of better estimators.",
        "Another question is whether the clustering method used might be inappropriate.",
        "Previous research in IR has not found large differences between different methods for clustering words, and all clustering methods are likely to be affected by the other problems described in this section, so experimenting with different clustering methods probably deserves lower priority than addressing the other problems discussed.",
        "A final issue is raised by the fact that using clusters and phrases together (see Table 3) produced performance superior to using either clusters or phrases alone.",
        "One way of interpreting this is that the seed phrase of a cluster is a better piece of evidence for the presence of the cluster than are the other cluster members.",
        "This raises the possibility that explicit clusters should not be formed at all, but rather that every phrase be considered good evidence for its own presence, and somewhat less good evidence for the presence of phrases with similar distributions.3 Again, investigating this is not likely to",
        "be profitable until other problems are addressed."

        "Another set of factors potentially affecting the performance of phrase clustering is the phrases themselves.",
        "Our syntactic parsing is by no means perfect, and incorrectly produced phrases could both cause bad matches between queries and documents, and interfere with the distributional estimates that clustering is based on.",
        "It is difficult to gauge directly the latter effect, but we can measure whether syntactically malformed phrases seem to be significantly worse content identifiers than syntactically correct ones.",
        "To determine this we found all matches between queries and relevant documents on syntactic phrases.",
        "We examined the original query text to see whether the phrase was correctly formed or whether it was the result of a parsing error, and did the same for the phrase occurrence in the document.",
        "We then gathered the same data for about 20% of the matches (randomly selected) between queries and nonrelevant documents.",
        "The results are shown in Table 4.",
        "We see that for both relevant and nonrelevant documents, the majority of matches are on syntactically correct phrases.",
        "The proportion of invalid matches is somewhat higher for nonrelevant documents, but the relatively small difference suggests that syntactically malformed phrases are not a primary problem.",
        "In proposing the clustering of syntactic phrases, we argued that the semantic properties of individual phrases were good, and only their statistical properties needed improving.",
        "This clearly was not completely true, since phrases such as paper gives (from sentences such as This paper gives results on...) are clearly very bad indicators of a document's content.",

        "to cluster together, and none of the phrases in these clusters would match query phrases.",
        "Unfortunately, almost the opposite happened.",
        "While we did not gather statistics, it appeared that these bad phrases, with their relatively flat distribution, proved to be similar to many other phrases and so were included in many otherwise coherent clusters.",

        "Since IR research on clustering of individual words has shown omitting high frequency words from clusters to be useful, we experimented with omitting high frequency phrases from clustering.",

        "Since many of our low quality phrases resulted from main verb / argument combinations, we will reconsider this choice.",
        "Fagan also maintained a number of lists of semantically general content words that were to be omitted from phrases, and which triggered special purpose phrase formation rules.",
        "We chose not to replicate this technique, due to the modifications required to our phrase generator, and our misgivings about a technique that might require a separate list of exemption words for each corpus.",
        "We did, however, conduct a simpler experiment which suggests that distinguishing between phrases of varying qualities will be important.",
        "We had a student from our lab who was not working on the phrase clustering experiments identify for each CACM query a set of pairs of words he felt to be good content identifiers.",
        "We then treated these pairs of words just as if they had been the set of syntactic phrases produced from the query.",
        "This gave the results shown in Table 5.",
        "As can be seen, retrieval performance was considerably improved, even though the phrases assigned to documents and to clusters did not change.",
