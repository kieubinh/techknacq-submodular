        "The June 1990 DARPA Resource Management Benchmark Test makes use of the first of several test sets provided with the Extended Resource Management Speaker-Dependent Corpus (RM2) [1].",
        "The corpus was designed as a speaker-dependent extension to the Resource Management (RM1) Corpus [2], consisting of (only) four speakers, but with a large number (2400) of sentence utterances for each of these speakers for system training purposes.",
        "The corpus was produced on CD-ROM by NIST in April 1990, and distributed to DARPA contractors.",
        "Results have been reported to NIST for both speaker-dependent and speaker-independent systems, and the results of NIST scoring and preliminary analysis of these data are included in this paper.",
        "In addition to the June 1990 (RM2) test set results, some sites also reported the results of tests of new algorithms on test sets that have been used in previous results (\"testretest\" results), or for new (first-time) use of previous test sets, cr for new systems in development.",

        "For speaker-independent systems, results were reported from AT&T [5], BBN [6], CMU [7], MIT/LL [4], SRI [8] and SSI [9].",
        "Most sites made use of the 109-speaker system training condition used for previous tests and reported results on the RM2 test set.",

        "SRI also reported results for the case of having used the 12 speaker (7200 sentence",

        "NIST has implemented some of the significance tests [3] contained on the RM series of CD-ROMs for some of the data sent for these tests.",
        "In general these tests serve to indicate that the differences in measured performance between many of these systems are small -- certainly for systems that are similarly trained and/or share similar algorithmic approaches to speech recognition.",
        "As a case in point, consider the sentence-level McNemar test results shown in Table 3, comparing the BBN and MIT/LL speaker dependent systems, when using the word-pair grammar.",
        "For the two systems that were trained on 2400 sentence utterances, the BBN system had 426 (out of 480) sentences correct, and the MIT/LL system had 427 correct.",
        "In comparing these systems with the McNemar test, there are subsets of 399 responses that were identically correct, and 26 identically incorrect.",
        "The two systems differed in the number of unique errors by only one sentence (i.e., 27 vs. 28).",
        "The significance test obviously results in a \"same\" judgement.",
        "A similar comparison shows that the two systems trained on 600 sentence utterances yield a \"same\" judgement.",
        "However, comparisons involving differently-trained systems do result in significant performance differences -- both within site, and across sites.",
        "Table 4 shows the results of implementation of the sentence-level McNemar test for speaker-independent systems trained on the 109 speaker/3990 sentence utterance training set, using the word-pair grammar, for the RM2 test set.",
        "For the no-grammar case for the speaker-independent systems, the sentence-level McNemar test indicates that the performance differences between these systems are not significant.",
        "However, when implementing the word-level matched-pair sentence-segment word error (MAPSSWE) test, the CMU system has significantly better performance than other systems in this category.",
        "Note that the data for the SRI system trained on 11,190 sentence utterances are not included in these comparisons, since the comparisons are limited to systems trained on 3990 sentence utterances."

        "Since release of the \"standard scoring software\" used for the results reported at this meeting, NIST has developed additional scoring software tools.",
        "One of these tools performs an analysis of the results reported for each lexical item.",
        "By focussing on individual lexical items (\"words\") we can investigate lexical coverage as well as performance for individual words for each individual test (such as the June 1990 test).",
        "In this RM2 test set there were occurrences of 226 monosyllabic words and 503 polysyllabic words -- larger coverage of the lexicon than in previous test sets.",
        "The most frequently appearing word was \"THE\", with 297 occurrences.",
        "In the case of the system we refer to as \"BBN (2400 train)\" with the word pair grammar, in the case of the word \"THE\" -- 97.6% of the occurrences of this word were correctly recognized, with 0.0% substitution errors, 2.4% deletions, and 0.7% \"resultant",
        "insertions\", for a total of 3.0% word error for this lexical item.",
        "What we term \"resultant insertione correspond to cases for which an insertion error of this lexical item occurred, but for which the cause is not known.",
        "The conventional scoring software provides data on a \"weighted\" frequency-of-occurrence basis.",
        "All errors are counted equally, and the more frequently occurring words -- such as the \"function\" words -- typically contribute more to the overall system performance measures.",
        "However, when comparing results from one test set to another it is sometimes desirable to look at measures that are not weighted by frequency of occurrence.",
        "Our recently developed scoring software permits us to do this, and, by looking at results for the subset of words that have appeared on all tests to date, some measures of progress over the past several years are provided, without the complications introduced by variable coverage and different frequencies-of-occurrence of lexical items in different tests.",
        "Further discussion of this is to appear in an SLS Note in preparation at NIST.",
        "By further partitioning the results of such an analysis into those for mono and polysyllabic word subsets, some insights can be gained into the state-of-the art as evidenced by the present tests.",
        "For the speaker-dependent systems trained on 2400 sentence utterances using the word-pair grammar, the unweighted total word error for monosyllabic word subset is between 1.6% and 2.2% (with the MIT/LL system having a slightly (but not significantly) larger number of \"resultant insertions\".",
        "For the corresponding case of polysyllabic words, the unweighted total word error is 0.2% for each system.",
        "For the CMU speaker independent system, using the word-pair grammar, the unweighted total word error for monosyllabic words is 5.6%, and for polysyllabic words, 1.7%.",
        "By comparing the CMU speaker-independent system results to the best-trained speaker-dependent systems, one can observe that the error rates for monosyllabic words are typically 3 to 4 times greater than for the speaker-dependent systems, and for polysyllabic words, approximately 8 times larger.",
        "When making similar comparisons, using results for other speaker-independent systems and the best-trained speaker-dependent systems, the monosyllabic word error rates are typically 4 to 6 times greater, and for polysyllabic words, 12 times larger.",
        "It is clear from such comparisons that the well-trained speaker-dependent systems have achieved substantially greater success in modelling the polysyllabic words than the speaker-independent systems."
