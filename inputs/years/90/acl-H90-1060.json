        "This paper reports on two contributions to large vocabulary continuous speech recognition.",
        "First, we present a new paradigm for speaker-independent (SI) training of hidden Markov models (HMM), which uses a large amount of speech from a few speakers instead of the traditional practice of using a little speech from many speakers.",
        "In addition, combination of the training speakers is done by averaging the statistics of independently trained models rather than the usual pooling of all the speech data from many speakers prior to training.",
        "With only 12 training speakers for SI recognition, we achieved a 7.5% word error rate on a standard grammar and test set from the DARPA Resource Management corpus.",
        "This performance is comparable to our best condition for this test suite, using 109 training speakers.",
        "Second, we show a significant improvement for speaker adaptation (SA) using the new SI corpus and a small amount of speech from the new (target) speaker.",
        "A probabilistic spectral mapping is estimated independently for each training (reference) speaker and the target speaker.",
        "Each reference model is transformed to the space of the target speaker and combined by averaging.",
        "Using only 40 utterances from the target speaker for adaptation, the error rate dropped to 4.1% – a 45% reduction in error compared to the SI result."

        "One important scenario for the use of spoken language systems (SLS) by new speakers is to start with a SI corpus or model and have the system adapt as the new users interact with the system.",
        "Once the interaction has begun, the system has the opportunity to collect speaker-dependent data of known orthographic transcription from the target speaker.",
        "After a small sample of speech has been collected, the system should be able to adapt so as to significantly increase performance compared to the original SI model.",
        "The success of this scenario depends on the adaptation being powerful enough to generalize from a small sample of speaker-specific speech in which most of the phonetic contexts of the language are not observed.",
        "Furthermore, it depends on having a SI speech corpus which is amenable to speaker adaptation.",
        "It is a widely held belief that speech used for training SI models must be collected from many speakers.",
        "It is also commonly accepted that collecting only a small sample of speech from each training speaker is a reasonable compromise to make in the effort to collect as many speakers as possible.",
        "While this compromise may be reasonable for SI recognition, several efforts to use such a corpus as a basis for speaker adaptation have failed to make significant improvements.",
        "Recently, we have discovered that adequate SI performance can be achieved with far less speaker coverage than conventionally thought necessary, but with much better sampling of each training speaker's speech.",
        "Specifically, we show that it is possible to achieve near state-of-the-art SI performance on a 1000-word continuous speech recognition task using only 12 training speakers.",
        "Furthermore, we will show that it is possible and advantageous to create the SI model from a set of independently trained speaker-dependent (SD) models, without retraining on the entire pooled dataset at one time Most importantly, we show that such a SI corpus is an effective basis for speaker adaptation.",
        "By combining the adapted models of 11 reference speakers, we were able to reduce the error rate by 45% compared to the SI performance.",
        "This method succeeds because we are able to apply a robust probabilistic speaker–transformation to well-trained and highly discriminating SD training models.",
        "In section 2, we describe the new SI training paradigm and present comparative results for SI recognition using only 12 training speakers.",
        "In section 3, we describe three previous attempts to adapt from a corpus of many training speakers.",
        "Then we describe our approach for adapting to new speakers from the 12 speaker SI corpus and discuss experimental results."

        "For several years, the DARPA Resource Management continuous speech corpus has provided a testbed for SI recognition.",
        "109 speakers are designated as training speakers and are each represented by a sample of 40 utterances.",
        "Typically, the data from all the speakers is pooled at the outset, as if it all came from one speaker.",
        "Although the training data originates from many diverse sources, the forward-backward (Baum–Welch) training procedure is robust enough to do a reasonable job of modeling the pooled data.",
        "When used with",
        "a standard word-pair grammar of perplexity 60, state-of-the-art SI recognition performance for this corpus is 6-7% word error rate.",
        "This performance is 3 times worse than our current SD performance using 600 training utterances.",
        "Also, the sentence error rate at this level of performance is greater than 30% – a level of error that we assume is far too high for the acoustic component of a spoken language system.",
        "Furthermore, this performance has been achieved with an artificial and non-robust grammar of modest perplexity which will not work within an SLS context.",
        "Combining the need for higher absolute performance with the need to use less powerful grammars indicates that the current SI error rate may need to be reduced by a factor of at least 4 to be acceptable for SLS applications."

        "Since we planned to perform adaptation from 12 reference speakers, we needed to run a SI control condition by using the data in the usual pooled fashion.",
        "We ran a comparative test using data from only the 12 speakers from the SD segment of the DARPA database.",
        "The training for each speaker consisted of 600 training utterances.",
        "Seven of the speakers are male.",
        "We did have some indication that pooling the data of even a few speakers could make large improvements from an experiment conducted at IBM and described in [5].",
        "However, 12 speakers could hardly be expected to contain an example of all speaker types in the general population (including both genders), so we could anticipate the need for some kind of smoothing before we began.",
        "Our usual technique for smoothing across the bins of the discrete densities, tri-phone cooccurrence smoothing [7], has proven to be an effective method for dealing with the widely varying amounts of training data for the detailed context models in the system.",
        "When used in a SD training scenario, it has allowed us to observe a performance gain for explicitly modeling several thousand triphones which were observed only once or twice in the training.",
        "However, the cooccurrence smoothing is not appropriate for models derived from the pooled data of many speakers.",
        "Spectra from different speakers will cooccur much more randomly than spectra from a single speaker.",
        "This will yield poorer estimates of the smoothing matrices.",
        "As such, in-phone cooccurrence smoothing is a speaker-specific modeling technique.",
        "If the data is pooled prior to training, we cannot effectively apply our best smoothing to the model.",
        "This realization has led us to examine the practice of pooling the data in the first place.",
        "A straightforward alternative to pooling the data is to keep the speakers separated until the speaker-specific operations of training and smoothing have been completed and then combine the multiple SD models.",
        "To allow the model combination to be done by averaging the model statistics, we constructed a SI codebook which was used in common for all speakers."

        "The 6.5% error rate is comparable to the best performance on record (6.1%) for this test set which was achieved by Lee as noted in [4].",
        "Furthermore, the sentence error rates are identical.",
        "Lee's system used a corrective training and reinforcement procedure to increase the discrimination ability of the model for confusable words.",
        "No corrective training was used for the BYBLOS results given in table 1.",
        "The system configuration for the 109 condition was identical to that which we use for SD recognition except for one difference.",
        "One new system parameter was added to decrease the lambda factors used for combining the context-dependent models into interpolated triphones [6] by a factor of eight to account for the larger corpus.",
        "Next we repeated the same conditions for the 12 speaker SI model.",
        "Simply pooling the 12 speakers without smoothing does not perform as well as the 109 speaker model.",
        "And once again, smoothing the jointly trained model has a rather weak effect on performance.",
        "However, we were surprised that the 12 speaker model should have only 25% more error than the 109 speaker model.",
        "The final two results show the effect of independently smoothing the 12 speaker model after either joint or independent training.",
        "To independently smooth the jointly trained model, we first trained on the pooled data as usual.",
        "Then a",
        "SD model was made, for each training speaker, by running the forward-backward algorithm on the combined SI model but on data from only one speaker in turn.",
        "This allowed us to generate a set of SD models for smoothing, which shared a common alignment.",
        "The smoothed models were then recombined by averaging the model statistics.",
        "The approach used on the final result is the most straightforward – we train multiple independent SD models allowing each to align optimally for the specific speaker, smooth each model to model spectral variation within each speaker, and then combine the models by averaging corresponding probabilities in the‘models.",
        "As is evident from the table, both of the final methods improve due to the increased effectiveness of the smoothing when it is applied to a speaker-specific model.",
        "In a final surprise, we find that constraining all the speakers to a common alignment does not help.",
        "Further, the word error rate of this simple model is only 15% worse than our best performance with the 109 speaker model and the sentence error rates are statistically indistinguishable.",
        "Some caution is required in comparing results of the 12 and 109 speaker models due to two, possibly important differences.",
        "The total amount of training speech used is different as is the number of different sentence texts contained in the training script.",

        "The 12 speaker model is trained on 7200 utterances drawn from only 600 sentence texts.",
        "While the additional speech may benefit the 12 speaker condition, the greater richness of the sentence texts may help the 109 speaker model.",
        "The effect of the additional sentence texts can be seen in the different numbers of triphone contexts observed in the two training scripts: 5000 triphones for 600 sentences vs. 7000 for the 2800–sentence script."
