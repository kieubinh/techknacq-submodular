        "Computing the full sum of equation 1 is expensive during training and prohibitively expensive during recognition since it must be computed for each active state at each time step.",
        "(Because the word sequence is unknown, recognition has many more active states than does training.)",
        "Ideally, one would only compute the terms which dominate the sum.",
        "However, it requires more computation to find these terms than it does to simply sum them.",
        "Two faster approximate methods for reducing the computation exist: mixture and observation pruning.",
        "Mixture pruning simply drops terms that fall below a threshold during training.",
        "The weights may then be stored as a sparse array which also saves space.",
        "The computational savings are limited during the early iterations of training since only a few terms have been dropped.",
        "The final SD distributions are quite sharp (i.e. have only a few terms), but the final SI distributions are quite broad (i.e. have many terms).",
        "Thus the savings are limited for SI systems.",
        "When the distributions are smoothed with less specific models, they become quite broad again.",
        "These difficulties are just computational – there is an even greater difficulty.",
        "During training, the parameters of the Gaussians are also optimized which causes them to \"move\" in the observation space.",
        "With mixture pruning, a \"lost\" Gaussian cannot be recovered.",
        "(This was the fundamental difficulty with the earlier version of the system reported in Reference [12].)",
        "Instead of reducing the mixture order, observation pruning reduces the computation by computing the sums for all Gaussians whose output probability is above a threshold times the probability of the most probable Gaussian.",
        "(Some other sites have used the \"top-N\" Gaussians [3, 7].",
        "In our system, it gives inferior recognition performance compared to the threshold method.)",
        "All of the Gaussians must now be computed, but this is a significant proportion of the computation only in training.",
        "(Some pruning is possible.",
        "Our exploration of tree-structured search methods showed them to be ineffective because the number of Gaussians is too small",
        "and the observation order is too large.)",
        "The amount of computation is now dependent upon the separations of the Gaussian means relative to their covariances and the statistics of the observations.",
        "The computational savings were very significant except for the SI second-differential observation stream (discussed later).",
        "Observation pruning does not save space for several reasons.",
        "The observation pruned TM systems suffer from the same \"missing observation\" problem as do the discrete observation systems and therefore no mixture weight can be allowed to become zero.",
        "Similarly, recruitment of \"new\" Gaussians (due to their movement) during training also requires that no mixture weight be allowed to become zero.",
        "Both can be accomplished by using full size weight arrays and lower bounding all entries by a small value.",
        "Smoothing now causes no organizational difficulty or increase in computation since all mixture weight arrays are full order."

        "The semiphone model will require further development and verification but it may be one way of simplifying our systems.",
        "Since the number of semiphones required to cover a 20,000 word dictionary is significantly less than the number of triphones required to cover the same dictionary, they may be a more practical route to vocabulary independent phone modeling than one based upon triphones."
