        "This estimation criterion is approximated by minimizing the Euclidean distance between spectral log-energy vectors, which is equivalent to minimizing the nonweighted, nontruncated cepstral distance.",
        "Correlations between frequency channels are incorporated in the estimation by modeling the spectral distribution of speech as a mixture of components, each representing a different speech class, and assuming that spectral energies at different frequency channels are uncorrelated within each class.",
        "The algorithm was tested with SRI's continuous-speech, speaker-independent, hidden Markov model recognition system using the large-vocabulary NIST \"Resource Management Task.\" When trained on a clean-speech database and tested with additive white Gaussian noise, the new algorithm has an error rate half of that with MMSE estimation of log spectral energies at individual frequency channels, and it achieves a level similar to that with the ideal condition of training and testing at constant SNR.",
        "The algorithm is also very efficient with additive environmental noise, recorded with a desktop microphone."

        "Speech-recognition systems are very sensitive to differences between the testing and training conditions.",
        "In particular, systems that are trained on high-quality speech degrade drastically in noisy environments.",
        "Several methods for handling this problem are in common use, among them supplementing the acoustic front end of the recognizer with a statistical estimator.",
        "This paper introduces a novel estimation algorithm for a filter-bank-based front end and describes recognition experiments with noisy speech.",
        "The problem of designing a statistical estimator for speech recognition is that of defining an optimality criterion that will match the recognizer, and deriving an algorithm to compute the estimator based on this criterion.",
        "Defining the optimal criterion is easier for speech recognition than it is for speech enhancement for human listeners, since the signal processing is known in the former, but not in the latter.",
        "For a recognition system that is based on a distance metric, whether for template matching or vector quantization, a reasonable criterion would be to minimize the average distortion as measured by the distance metric.",
        "In practice, achieving this criterion may turn out not to be feasible, and the question is then to what extent the computationally feasible methods approximate the desired optimality criterion.",
        "A basic difference between the cepstral distance criterion and the MMSE of single frequency channels (whether DFT coefficients or filter energies) is that the former implies a joint estimate of a feature vector, whereas the latter implies an independent estimation of scalar variables.",
        "Because the speech spectral energies at different frequencies are correlated, an independent estimate of individual channels results in a suboptimal estimation.",
        "To incorporate part of the correlations in the estimator, we modified our single-channel MMSE to be conditioned on the total energy in addition to the filter energy.",
        "This modification indeed improved performance significantly.",
        "We here derive a more rigorous method of approximating the cepstral distance criterion.",
        "The optimality criterion is the minimization of the distortion as measured by the Euclidean distance between vectors of filter log energies.",
        "We name the algorithm minimum-mean-log-spectral-distance (MMLSD).",
        "The MMLSD is equivalent to minimizing the nonweighted, nontruncated cepstral distance rather than the weighted, truncated one used by the recognizer.",
        "The necessity for this compromise arises from the difficulty in modeling the statistics of additive noise in the transform domain, whereas a model can be constructed in the spectral domain [for details see Eq.",
        "(2): the approximation there will not work for the transformed vector].",
        "The MMLSD estimator is first computed using a stationary model for the speech spectral probability distribution (PD).",

        "Measuring correlations between frequency channels with overlapping filters, we found that this assumption is incorrect.",
        "For example, with the vector quantization method (M1VILSDVQ) and a code book of size 32, the correlation between any pair of adjacent channels is of the order of 0.8, dropping to 0.4 for channels that are 3 filters apart and to 0.1 for channels that are 8 filters apart.",

        "Examining the MMLSD estimator in Eq.",

        "Because the degree to which the a posteriori class probability P(n I E) peaks around the true class depends on the SNR in the total energy, it not surprising that MMLSD-TE was efficient for white but not for environmental noise.",
        "A similar argument explains the advantage of MMLSD-TEP (where the total energy is defined on the",
