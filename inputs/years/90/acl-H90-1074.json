        "The SUMMIT system is a speaker-independent, continuous-speech recognition system that we have developed at MIT [12].",
        "To date, the system has been ported to a variety of tasks with vocabulary sizes up to 1000 words and perplexities up to 73.",
        "The architecture of this system is a product of two guiding principles.",
        "First, we desired a framework that could be flexible and modular so that we could explore alternative strategies for embedding speech knowledge into the system.",
        "Second, we required that the system be stochastic and trainable from a large body of speech data to account for our current incomplete knowledge of the acoustic realization of speech.",
        "The current implementation of the system is a reflection of both of these ideas.",
        "SUMMIT differs from the majority of prevailing HMM approaches in many respects ranging from its use of auditory models and selected acoustic measurements, to its segmental framework and use of pronunciation networks.",
        "In time, the specific implementation of these ideas will undoubtedly be modified as we discover superior techniques and approaches.",
        "Until phonetic and word recognition accuracies are competitive with those of human listeners however, we believe it will be appropriate to incorporate both notions of flexibility and trainability into the system.",
        "In the past year we have focused our attention on a larger spoken-language effort which integrates SUMMIT with a natural language system.",
        "We have also investigated issues which relate to phonetic recognition; namely alternative segmental representations and classification techniques.",
        "In addition, we have changed our normalization procedure to make it more amenable for recording spontaneous speech.",
        "In this paper we first describe the normalization procedure.",
        "We then review our segmental framework, and describe two alternatives we investigated.",
        "Finally, we present some phonetic classification and recognition experiments which assess the different segmental representations and classification techniques.",
        "These experiments indicated an improvement in classification rate of 4%, and in recognition rate of 8%."

      "heading": "Normalization",
      "text": [
        "Most speech recognition systems that measure some type of absolute value, such as the short-term energy, require that an utterance is first normalized before processed.",
        "In the sum-MIT system for instance, a weak signal that is not normalized will produce auditory outputs which are smaller than the spontaneous firing rate and will therefore be indistinguishable from silence.",
        "Currently we use a normalization procedure that scales a speech waveform with respect to its maximum magnitude value.",
        "This simple procedure has proven quite effective for the majority of speech processing and recognition applications since 1) the utterance has typically been completely recorded before it is being normalized, 2) any extraneous loud noises or clicks have been edited from the utterance so that the largest value in the waveform corresponds to speech (usually a vowel) and, 3) the speech intensity has been relatively uniform throughout the utterance.",
        "In situations where a human is interacting with a machine, some of these assumptions become less reasonable.",
        "From a computational perspective, it would be desirable to be able to process the signal in near or less than real-time.",
        "Another difficulty .a spontaneous speech is that there are frequently spurious noises and clicks which occasionally have the largest magnitude in the signal.",
        "In this case, an utterance is not normalized with respect to speech, so the speech waveform values are subsequently weaker than normal.",
        "Finally, if the speech intensity does change somewhat over the course of the utterance, a static scaling value will result in a weaker speech signal in some portions of the utterance."

        "The normalization procedure we are investigating uses a standard feedback system to compute a gain, g[n].",
        "In order to provide the gain some time to adapt to changing signal conditions, there is a delay of N frames between the point where the gain is computed and where the speech signal is scaled.",
        "Currently, a frame is computed every 25 ms, and the delay is 8 frames, or 200 ms.",
        "The gain control mechanism is illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "The system input, x[n], is a function of the recent short-term energy (computed with 25 ms rectangular window) of the speech signal, s[n].",
        "In order to reduce the amount of change in the gain output, the input x[n] is the maximum energy value within the previous N frames,",
        "The error signal, e[n], is generated by comparing the scaled value y[n] with a target level, i[n].",
        "The scaled value is gm-erated from the input and the previous gain value, g(n – 1].",
        "All values are in dB.",
        "The influence of e[n] on the final gain is controlled by a scaling parameter, a, which controls the influence of the error signal on the gain.",
        "Since the normalization structure assumes nothing about the signal to noise ratio, the entire signal is normalized equally whether or not the signal corresponds to speech or noise.",
        "If we could produce a value p,[n], corresponding to the probability of speech at time n, then we could modify the above algorithm.",
        "One possible modification would make the target level depend on ps[n].",
        "When p,[n] = 1, then t[n] = T, the target level for speech.",
        "When p,[n] = 0, then t[n] = y[n] (i.e., e[n]= 0).",
        "In effect, when the signal is considered to be noise, the gain does not change.",
        "The net result of this argument is to make",
        "Thus, we make the error proportional to the probability that we have speech.",
        "Note that another alternative procedure would be to reduce the gain.",
        "In addition to an estimate of the presence of speech in the signal, we can improve the performance of the normalization procedure if we can set a limit on the minimum allowable signal to noise ratio.",
        "This minimum can be used to set an upper limit on the gain value, and can be used for initialization purposes."
