        "This paper describes some of the most recent work on continuous speech recognition using phoneme-level hidden Markov models (HMMs) which has been conducted at the UK Speech Research Unit as part of the ARM (Airborne Reconnaissance Mission) project [11].",
        "The goal of the project is automatic recognition of spoken airborne reconnaissance reports.",
        "The project draws on many years of research undertaken in the UK by the Joint Speech Research Unit and the current RSRE Speech Research Unit, and also on the work on continuous speech recognition using sub-word HMMs which has been conducted under the current DARPA programme, particularly at MIT Lincoln Laboratory [5] and Carnegie Mellon University [3], and by the speech groups at IBM and BBN.",
        "The project began with the definition, implementation and evaluation of a simple speaker-dependent \"baseline\" system.",
        "This was then systematically improved and assessed in order to measure the performance gain resulting from each enhancement.",
        "The most recent version of the speaker-dependent ARM system scores an average 86.8% word accuracy with no syntax on the 497 word vocabulary ARM task.",
        "An overview of the development of the speaker dependent ARM system is presented in [11] and more detailed information about particular stages in the evolution of the system can be found in a set of separate reports [7, 6, 10, 8, 9].",
        "For completeness, the ARM task and the most recent version of the speaker dependent ARM system are both described in the present paper.",
        "The paper goes on to report work in progress in two areas: initial work towards the development of a speaker-independent version of the ARM system, and a study of the performance of versions of the speaker-dependent ARM system from the viewpoint of the number of system parameters.",
        "The development of a speaker-independent version of the ARM system is a current goal of the project.",
        "This has necessitated the collection of a new 340 speaker speech corpus which includes recordings of ARM reports for each subject.",
        "Orthographic annotation of this corpus is proceeding in parallel with the development of a baseline speaker-independent version of the recognition system through a process of \"annotation by forced recognition\".",
        "At the time of writing over 2000 sentences from 120 speakers have been labelled in this way and systems trained on 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 male speakers have been evaluated.",
        "This work is described in more detail below.",
        "For a fixed size of training set, the number of system parameters is clearly an important consideration in the design of any statistically based speech recognition system.",
        "The final section presents a study of some of the systems which have been evaluated as part of the ARM project from the perspective of number of parameters.",
        "The results show a range of sizes of parameter set which are large enough to fully exploit the training data in terms of accurate modelling of speech patterns and at the same time small enough to be supported by the training set.",

        "The mean channel amplitude of each filterbank frame is subtracted from all components of that frame, and a cosine transform is then applied.",
        "The 17 dimensional representation consisting of cosine coefficients 1 to 16 and mean filterbank channel amplitude forms the acoustic front-end parameterisation for the ARM system (see [8]).",
        "The frame-rate is reduced by approximately 50% using the variable frame rate technique described in [7, 6].",
        "Acoustic-phonetic processing in the current speaker-dependent version of the system uses a set of approximately 1500 HMMs (the precise number depends on the speaker) consisting of:",
        "• Four single state \"non-speech\" HMMs to model non-speech sounds in regions of the test data between spoken sentences.",
        "• Six word-level HMMs for the commonly occur-ing short words \"air\", \"at\", \"in\", \"of\", \"oh\" and \"or\".",
        "The number of states in these word-level HMMs is equal to three times the number of phonemes in the baseform transcription of the corresponding word.",
        "• Approximately 1490 three-state HMMs, one for",
        "each word-internal triphone [12] which occurs in the ARM vocabulary.",
        "Since the baseform pronunciations of ARM vocabulary words vary between speakers in the speaker dependent system, the precise number of triphone HMMs is different for each speaker.",
        "All HMM states are identified with single multivariate Gaussian state output probability density functions with diagonal (co)variance matrices.",
        "A single \"grand\" covariance matrix is shared by all states [4, 9].",
        "Words in the ARM vocabulary are related to phonemes through a dictionary of \"baseform\" phonemic transcriptions (one transcription per word).",
        "In the current, speaker-dependent, system this dictionary is modified for each speaker.",
        "The modifications are concerned with broad differences, for example between \"northern British English\" and \"southern British English\", rather than with fine details of the speakers pronunciation.",
        "Parameter estimation is based on standard sub-word HMM training procedures in which sentence level HMMs are constructed from phoneme-level HMMs (using the dictionary of baseform pronoun-ciations).",
        "These are then mapped onto the sentence level acoustic data using the forward backward algorithm to obtain contributions to the new model parameter estimates.",
        "Training is done in 3 stages: estimation of the parameters of context-insensitive monophone-HMMs, estimation of the parameters of context-sensitive triphone-HMMs (using the monophone HMM parameters as initial statistics), and estimation of the grand (co)variance matrix."

        "Recognition is performed using a one-pass dynamic programming algorithm with beam search and partial-traceback [1].",

        "This section reports on the first of these two stages.",
        "As in the speaker-dependent work, this phase of the project has started with the implementation of a simple \"baseline\" speaker-independent system.",

        "The \"Speaker Independent\" SIA Speech Corpus The SIA corpus contains recordings of 340 speakers, each speaking the following material:",
        "• 3 ARM reports • 6 extracts from ARM reports.",
        "These extracts consist of the centre sections of the reports which describe what the \"observer\" can see from the aircraft.",
        "These sections of the reports are less constrained than the initial and final parts, and consequently contain a richer variety of phonemic contexts.",
        "• 10 sentences generated from an air-traffic control application • 10 \"TIMIT like\" English sentences.",
        "Only the first two sets of recordings are used in the current phase of the project, the remainder are intended for future work.",
        "As with the earlier speaker-dependent database, all recordings were made digitally on video cassette (44kHz sample rate) in a sound proof room using a Shure SM10 head-mounted microphone.",
        "Annotation of the SIA corpus Although it is possible to estimate triphone HMM parameters using speech labelled at the report level, in practice it desirable that the training material should be labelled at a finer level.",
        "In the present experiments annotation is nominally at the sentence level, however segments of speech which are separated by long portions of non-speech are labelled as distinct items.",
        "Thus if a subject speaks reports as a sequence of fluent sentences, the data will be labelled at the sentence level, but if a long pause occurs in the middle of a sentence, that sentence will be labelled as two separate segments.",
        "Labelling of the speech corpus is proceeding in parallel with the development of the baseline speaker independent ARM system through a process of \"forced recog-nition\".",
        "New reports are labelled by the ARM recognition software using the current best speaker-independent models in conjunction with a report-specific syntax which allows non-speech models to occur between words but ensures recognition of the correct word sequence.",
        "The results of this automatic labelling process are checked manually and corrected if necessary.",
        "Thus, reports spoken by the first ten training speakers were labelled using speaker-dependent triphone HMMs, and reports spoken by subsequent groups of training speakers were labelled using triphone HMMs trained on all previous speakers.",
        "At the time of writing 360 reports from 120 speakers have been labelled in this way and recognition systems trained on 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 male speakers have been evaluated.",

        "Although the effect on performance which results from a particular change is normally attributed to its appropriateness in terms of speech pattern modelling, there will also be effects due to the ability of the training set to support different numbers of parameters.",
        "For example, early results showed that for monophone HMMs there was sufficient training material to support state-specific covariance matrices and that the introduction of a shared \"grand\" covariance matrix resulted in poorer performance [8].",
        "By contrast the introduction of triphone HMMs with state-specific covariance matrices resulted in either a small increase or a significant decrease in performance, because of the large number of system parameters, and large improvements in recognition accuracy were not observed until a shared covariance matrix was used [9].",
        "In terms of number of parameters these two cases represent extremes in the development of the system, but the results suggest that it would be fruitful to look at the performance of a range of versions of the system from the perspective of number of parameters.",
