        "This paper describes a wide-range restructuring of intermediate representations in machine translation, which is necessary for bridging stylistic gaps between source and target languages and for generating natural target sentences.",
        "We propose a practical way of designing machine translation systems, based on the transfer method, that deal with wide-range restructuring.",
        "The transfer component should be divided into two separate subcomponents: the wide-range restructuring subcomponent and the basic transfer subcomponent.",
        "The first subcomponent deals specifically with global reorganization of intermediate representations in order to bridge the stylistic gaps between source and target languages, and the second performs local and straightforward processing, including lexical transfer and basic structural transfer.",
        "This approach provides us with an effective basis for improving translation quality by systematically enhancing the transfer rules without sacrificing the clarity and maintainability of the transfer component.",
        "It also guarantees that most of the translation process can be based on the augmented Context Free Grammar (CFG) formalism and the so-called compositionality principle, by which we can both systematically expand and maintain linguistic data and design the simplified process control necessary for an efficient machine translation system."

        "Much effort has been devoted to research into, and development of, machine translation since the 1950s (Slocum 1985).",
        "However, the quality of the output sentences produced by most machine translation systems is not high enough to have any marked effect on translation productivity.",
        "A machine translation system produces a variety of expressions in the target language, including good, fair, and poor expressions.",
        "In this paper, we define these distinctions as follows.",
        "\"Good\" sentences can be easily understood and have high readability because of their naturalness, \"fair\" sentences can be understood but their readability is low, and \"poor\" sentences cannot be understood without referring to the source sentences.",
        "To improve the quality of translation, the following major functions should be implemented:",
        "1. selection of equivalents for words; 2. reordering of words; and 3. improvement of sentence styles.",
        "A machine translation system that does not have Function 3 often produces \"good\" output in the case of translation between languages in the same linguistic group if Functions 1 and 2 are appropriately achieved.",
        "However, most output will be \"fair\" or \"poor\" in the case of translation between languages in different linguistic groups, because of the stylistic gaps between them.",
        "We need to enhance Function 3 as well as Functions 1 and 2 in order to change \"fair\" or \"poor\" sentences to \"good\" or \"fair\" ones.",
        "Note that in this paper, style means a preferable grammatical form that successfully conveys a correct meaning.",
        "First, let us consider how to select target language equivalents for words in the source language.",
        "An appropriate part of speech for a word is first determined by the grammatical constraints provided by the analysis grammar.",
        "Nouns and the verb in a simple sentence can then be appropriately translated according to the combinative constraints between the case frame of the verb and the semantic markers of the nouns.",
        "This is a well-known mechanism for practical semantic processing in machine translation.",
        "However, this way of selecting equivalents has the limitation that we cannot classify verbs and nouns in sufficient detail, because of ambiguities in the definitions and usage of words.",
        "Many researchers in machine translation claim that a much more powerful semantic processing mecha",
        "nism with a knowledge base is required for this purpose.",
        "This is a long-range research project in he field.",
        "Second, there seem to be few critical problems in reordering words if structural transfer is appropriately carried out.",
        "In a simple sentence, for example, we can usually reorder words correctly on the basis of the case frame of the verb.",
        "Thus, the improvement of sentence styles is one of the crucial functions required for further enhancement of the present translation quality.",
        "Even when the output is \"fair\" in quality, it has to be read carefully, because the readability is often low.",
        "We expect an improvement in sentence styles to result in an improvement in translation quality from \"poor\" or \"fair\" to \"good.\" Improving sentence styles seems to be easier than selecting better equivalents for words, because there are syntactic clues to help us make the styles more natural.",
        "This paper focuses on an approach to the improvement of sentence styles by wide-range restructuring of intermediate representations.",
        "Wide-range restructuring in this paper means the global restructuring of intermediate representations, usually including the replacement of some class words (i.e., noun, adjective, verb, and adverb).",
        "Some papers have mentioned limited restructuring of intermediate representations (Bennett and Slocum 1985; Vauquois and Boitet 1985; Isabelle and Bourbeau 1985; Nagao et al.",
        "1985; McCord 1985; Nomura et al.",
        "1986).",
        "For example, LMT (McCord 1985) has a restructuring function after the transfer phase, to form a bridge between the basic styles of English and German.",
        "The Mu system (Nagao et al.",
        "1985) has two specific restructuring functions, before and after the transfer phase, mainly to handle exceptional cases.",
        "However, few machine translation systems have so far had a comprehensive component for wide-range restructuring (Slocum 1985), mainly because many systems are presently designed to produce output that is at best \"fair,\" and little effort has been devoted to obtaining \"good\" output or natural sentences.",
        "As a matter of fact, wide-range restructuring functions are usually scattered over the analysis, transfer, and generation phases in an ad hoc way.",
        "Because of complicated implementations, the systems come to have low maintainability and efficiency.",
        "Few papers so far have systematically discussed the crucial stylistic gaps between languages, the importance of wide-range restructuring of intermediate representations to bridge these gaps, and effective mechanisms for restructuring.",
        "A restructuring mechanism is necessary even when a machine translation system is based on the semantic-level transfer or pivot method (Carbonell et al.",
        "1981).",
        "In this paper, we first discuss stylistic gaps between languages, and the importance of dealing with them effectively in order to generate natural target sentences.",
        "We then propose a restructuring mechanism that successfully bridges the stylistic gaps and preserves a high maintainability for the transfer phase of a machine translation system.",
        "Last, we discuss the implementation of the wide-range restructuring function."

        "The basic concept underlying current machine translation technology is the compositionality principle (Nagao 1986).",
        "The original idea of the principle is that the meaning of a sentence can be assembled from the meaning of each of its constituents and, moreover, that the assembling process can be implemented by assembling the forms or syntax that convey the meanings.",
        "Montague grammar is one of the theoretical bases of the principle, and some work applying Montague grammar to machine translation has been reported (Lands-bergen 1982; Nishida and Doshita 1983).",

        "Because wide-range restructuring, which does not suit the compositionality principle, can be performed entirely in the restructuring sub-component, and because the basic transfer can be simplified and specialized in local and bottom-up treatments of structures based on the augmented CFG formalism, as mentioned above, all the processes of machine translation except wide-range restructuring can be based on the augmented CFG formalism or the compositionality principle.",

        "When the process goes to a new tree, the system checks the category name of its root node and thus avoids useless checking of the tree.",

        "This example shows that the basic transfer is more straightforward and localized than the wide-range restructuring."

      "text": [
        "Let us discuss example (5-a) in Section 2.",
        "The wide-range restructuring rule is as follows.",
        "If the main verb is have and the head noun (rate) of the object is a two-place predicate and there is an adjective (low) that modifies the head noun, then restructure it as shown in (5-b).",
        "If the head noun of the object is classified as \"ATTRIBUTE,\" the restructuring is obligatory.",
        "Otherwise, translation without this restructuring is not very good, but acceptable.",
        "The restructuring rule for case (1-a) in Section 2 is slightly complicated because we need richer information, such as (room contains table), so as to restructure (1-a) into the form `NP1 be in NP2.'",
        "If the input is The table has four legs, it will be restructured differently into the form Four legs exist for the table because of the above constraint.",
        "This is not standard English, but it is very similar in form to Japanese.",
        "We have not yet implemented a way of using semantic information, such as (room contains table), as constraint, because the desired restructuring can be done on the basis of syntactic restrictions in the field of IBM computer manuals.",
        "However, the approach proposed in this paper can be augmented to handle semantic information without any crucial problems, if we prepare a knowledge base."

      "heading": "5 CONCLUSIONS",
      "text": [
        "In this paper, we discuss the importance of treating stylistic gaps between languages and methods of doing so.",
        "A comprehensive wide-range restructuring that can cope with stylistic gaps is indispensable for improving the quality of translation, especially between languages from different linguistic groups, such as English and Japanese.",
        "We propose a practical way of designing machine translation systems.",
        "The transfer component should be divided into two separate sub-components: the wide-range restructuring subcomponent and the basic transfer subcomponent.",
        "Because the first of these deals with global reorganization of the intermediate representations, usually including the replacement of some class words, the second only has to do local, straightforward processing.",
        "This approach makes the transfer component much clearer and more maintainable than the conventional single-step transfer method.",
        "It also guarantees that, except for the wide-range restructuring sub-component, all of the translation process can be based on the augmented CFG formalism and the compositionality principle.",
        "The ease of controlling the process makes the system efficient, which is crucial for the development of a practical machine translation system.",
        "As a future direction, it will be necessary for us to pursue a thorough contrastive study of several languages, in terms of semantics as well as syntax.",
        "This will enable us to build more effective rules for restructuring that will further improve the quality of machine translation."
