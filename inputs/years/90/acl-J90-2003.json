        "Sweden We describe a comprehensive treatment of the syntax and semantics of comparative constructions based on theoretical work by Pinkham, which can be implemented in a relatively straightforward fashion within a feature-based phrase-structure grammar.",
        "Comparatives are divided up into \"clausal\" and \"phrasal\" constructions; in contrast to most previous theories, however, phrasals are not regarded as reduced forms of clausals.",
        "We begin by defining a Montagovian semantics for phrasal comparatives that directly links interpretation rules to the surface syntactic structure; we then show how this solution can be made computationally more efficient by \"factoring\" the interpretation through an intermediate level of representation, using a method similar to that used for dealing with scoping phenomena.",
        "Detailed examples are provided, showing how the method can correctly describe the semantics of a variety of superficially widely different comparative constructions.",
        "The ideas have all been implemented within a large-scale grammar for Swedish, a \"toy\" version of which is presented, along with examples of the output."

        "This paper is written with two different, though to some extent overlapping, audiences in mind.",
        "On the practical side, we address ourselves to the natural language interface constructor, who wants to expand the coverge of her system so as to incorporate comparative constructions; the state of the art has now progressed to the point where it is generally acknowledged that this is a problem that a serious system must attempt to deal with.",
        "In the following, we will thus attempt to describe our ideas in a sufficiently concrete fashion that they can be used as an implementation guide.",
        "Typical examples of comparatives according to the traditional classification are the following:",
        "1) Mary was happier in New York than John was in London.",
        "2) John has more books than Mary has newspapers.",
        "3) The table is longer than it is wide.",
        "Comparative ellipsis 4) John is taller than Mary.",
        "5) Few people run as fast as John.",
        "6) John bought more books than Mary.",
        "7) John was happier in New York than in London.",
        "8) Mary had more friends than John thought.",
        "9) John hit Mary harder than he meant to.",
        "10) More men than women bought the book.",
        "11) More people voted for the proposal than against.",
        "12) John likes Mary's house better than Mary John's. Unclear cases 13) More than 50 people signed the petition.",
        "14) Mary needs a larger car than this Fiat.",
        "15) John ran faster than the world record.",
        "16) John was born in the same city as Mary.",
        "17) John arrived before Mary.",
        "On the theoretical side, we want to re-examine some fundamental questions about the nature of the comparative construction, and in particular about the phenomenon generally referred to as \"comparative ellipsis\"; by this, we mean comparative constructions like those listed above in which the element after the comparative marker is not a clause, and which traditionally have been explained in terms of various kinds of deletion rules.",
        "Here, we will argue that, in most common cases, it is by no means necessary to postulate syntactic deletion operations.",
        "We will claim, rather, that it is possible (and indeed simpler) to assign a syntactic representation to such constructions that closely follows the apparent surface constituent structure.",
        "We will then show how to define semantic interpretation rules for such structures, which at no level reconstruct a representation of a syntactic clause, but rather operate on the principle of directly comparing constituents of similar type.",
        "To highlight the difference between our approach and the",
        "traditional one, we will refer to constructions handled by this method as examples, not of comparative ellipsis, but rather of contrastive comparison.",
        "Our opinion is that the issues we are raising are probably applicable to most grammatical frameworks subsumed under the feature-based phrase structure grammar paradigm; this includes established formalisms like LFG, GPSG, HPSG, PATR-II etc., and a vast number of more or less obscure formalisms in use around the world.",
        "At risk of offending everybody and pleasing nobody, we will make no particular attempt to align ourselves with any one of these theories; in Section 1.2, we will describe in general terms the properties we will expect a framework to possess, if it is to be capable of supporting the type of operations we will need.",
        "Basically, we will demand distinct levels of representation for constituent structure, function-argument structure, and logical form, related in the normal way; we will also require certain constructions to be treated as syntactic constituents.",
        "Most of this will be quite uncontroversial.",
        "To clear the decks before moving into action, we now spend a couple of paragraphs making clear which questions we are not attempting to answer.",
        "We regard the lexical semantics of comparatives as being outside the scope of the paper; we are only interested in determining how the phrasal semantics can be derived from them.",
        "We explain exactly what we mean by this statement in Section 1.2.",
        "We will ignore complex comparative operators (\"more than twice as much as\"; \"at least two inches longer than three times as long as\"); these are well dealt with in Ballard (1988), and in any case do not seem to pose fundamental difficulties.",
        "For similar reasons, we refrain from discussing determiners with phrasal comparatives, like \"more than two\" or \"at least half ': here, the most comprehensive reference is perhaps Keenan and Stavi (1986).",
        "We also ignore certain idiosyncratic constructions (\"as fast as ever\"; \"as much as usual\"), which do not seem to fit any pattern known to us.",
        "In our treatment of clausal comparatives, we will present two slightly different variants of a solution.",
        "The first is simple to implement, and appears capable of giving correct semantics to most normal examples; however, it fails to give both readings for the notorious Russell example, \"I thought your yacht was longer than it is.\"",
        "The second solution, on the other hand, is capable of dealing with this kind of sentence, but needs a number of additional scoping rules.",
        "We say more about this in Section 4.",
        "With regard to cross-linguistic coverage, we will restrict ourselves to English, Swedish, and a few other languages in which the comparative construction is syntactically similar in nature; this actually appears to include most European languages.",
        "Although we suspect that our results are probably applicable to at least some languages outside this group,3 we shall not make any further attempt to lend credibility to this claim.",
        "The organization of the rest of the paper is as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we review previous work: in particular, we point out what we regard as the main weaknesses of the deletion method, and summarize earlier attempts to describe phrasal comparatives by direct interpretation methods.",
        "The next two sections contain the main results of the paper.",
        "In Section 3, we examine contrastive phrasal comparatives.",
        "We begin by defining a Montagovian semantics for these, and then show how this can be improved by \"factoring\" it through an intermediate level of representation, in which the \"contrasting\" relationship between phrases is left undefined.",
        "We then go on to show how this methodology can be used to provide a readily implementable semantics for a wide variety of contrastive constructions, which also gives a simple explanation of the ambiguity of certain comparative sentences.",
        "Section 4 then goes on to describe our treatment of clausal comparatives, which is largely adapted from the work reported in Klein (1980) and Pinkham (1985).",
        "In Section 5 we briefly discuss noncoreference of compared objects; we also look at sentences containing the words \"before\" and \"after,\" pointing out some differences between these and comparative sentences.",
        "A corpus analysis, which gives some indication of the relative frequencies of the various constructions, is presented in Section 6.",
        "In Section 7 we summarize our results.",
        "The theoretical ideas advocated here were first developed and tested in practice within the framework of the SNACK85 project (Rayner and Banks 1986; 1989).",
        "In Appendix 2 we give the complete program code for a \"scaled-down\" version of the system, which handles all the constructions described in the main body of the paper, and in Appendix 3 we show examples of the system's output."

        "An ARG is represented at QLF level as a pair (arg-type, arg-value).",
        "We will need at least the following kinds of complements: NP, PP, S-COMP (a suitable S), VP-COMP (a suitable VP), APs.",
        "Semantically, a verb will be associated with a subset of EVENTS, which we can think of as a type of event, state, or situation.",

Similarly, a scalar adverb A translates to a two-place predicate A'(x, d) on EVENTS x DEGREES, with the interpretation: the event x is A' to degree d. We will assume that degree expressions like \"more,\" \"less,\" or \"at least twice as much as much as\" translate to two-place predicates on DEGREES x DEGREES.",

        "This section will summarize relevant previous work on comparatives; we begin by listing sources.",
        "So far, there has been a surprisingly small amount of work done in computational frameworks: the only major attempts known to us that integrate syntactic and semantic processing are those reported in Ballard (1988) and Friedmann (1989).",
        "Limited syntactic/semantic coverage has appeared in some other systems (e.g. DIALOGIC [Robinson 1982] and CLE [Alshawi et al.",
        "1989]), and the Linguistic String Project (Sager 1981) has an advanced syntactic coverage.",
        "On the theoretical front, we have been considerably influenced by Bresnan (1973), Hankamer (1973), Pinkham (1985), and Klein (1980), especially the last three; we were also surprised to discover at a late stage of our research that unpublished work by Heim (1985) and Krifka (1987) had pursued a course almost parallel to our own.",
        "We now go on to describe what we regard as relationships between these treatments and ours.",
        "We will start by looking at clausal comparatives, where the immediate problem is clearly to account for the apparent \"missing material\" in the comparative clause.",
        "An early and still very influential study of comparative constructions is that of Bresnan (1972; 1973; 1977), working within transformational grammar; the key concept is the introduction of the rule of Comparative Subdeletion, which will for example derive sentences like 1 a) and 2a) by deleting the bracketed material from the base forms 1 b) and 2b).",
        "1 a) John bought more books than Mary bought.",
        "1 b) John bought more books than Mary bought [x many books].",
        "2a) John bought more books than Mary bought records.",
        "2b) John bought more books than Mary bought [x many] records.",
        "Although Comparative Subdeletion explains many of the facts, it makes a number of erroneous predictions.",
        "A very long and thorough criticism was advanced in Pinkham (1985), where reasons are given to believe that it is preferable to adopt an analysis that represents the \"missing\" material as (in English) null proforms; these are bound to the head of the comparison by a mechanism that Pinkham calls Quantifier Binding.",
        "Pinkham's view of the clausal comparative has many points in common with that proposed in Klein (1980), in the context of a GPSG/Montague grammar framework, although Klein only really considers sentences of the type in example 2); our own treatment will in this respect be similar to Pinkham's and Klein's. Like Bresnan and Pinkham, but unlike Friedmann (1989), we will also regard the comparative clause as in general modifying the comparative head in the main clause, as opposed to treating the two clauses as parallel; we discuss further in Section 4 the reasons behind this decision.",
        "Moving on to phrasal comparatives, there would appear to be two basic approaches.",
        "The earlier and more common one is to treat these as reduced forms of clausal comparatives; for example, Hankamer (1971) introduces a rule of \"C-ellipsis,\" which deletes material from the comparative clause under identity with material in the main clause.",
        "Thus for example, 3a) and 4a) would be regarded as reduced forms of 3b) and 4b), where the bracketed material has been deleted:",
        "3a) John bought more books than Mary.",
        "3b) John bought more books than Mary [bought x many books].",
        "4a) John bought more books than Mary thought.",
        "4b) John bought more books than Mary thought [that he bought x many books].",
        "In a computational treatment, this means that the deletion rule has to be \"reversed,\" so as to reconstruct the deleted material from the phrasal remnant: this is the method used in Sager (1981) and Friedmann (1989).",
        "However, a number of researchers have showed that there are drawbacks to the \"C-ellipsis\" account.",
        "Although both Hankamer and Pinkham use C-ellipsis in their theories, they also provide strong evidence for the existence of at least some comparatives that are not elliptic in nature (Hankamer 1973; Pinkham 1985).",
        "Three examples are shown in 5)-7), where Pinkham in each case argues that there are severe difficulties involved in deriving a sentence of this type from a clausal comparative; the natural choice in a transformational framework is to regard the italicized portions as base-generated phrasal.",
        "5) I invited more men than women.",
        "6) John ran faster than the world record.",
        "7) Mary looks taller than John when she wears high heels.",
        "Of particular interest here is Pinkham's treatment of examples like 5), which are interpreted using a rule that she calls \"distributive copying.\"",
        "5) receives the logical form 5a), which after distributive copying becomes 5b).",
        "Although the details of the solution are not fully worked out (in particular, the notation is never given a formal semantics), the intuitive idea is clearly that of duplicating a \"shared\" or \"matrix\" predicate, substituting in the two compared elements in a suitable way.",
        "5a) I INVITED (MORE [ql (ql men), q2 (q2 women)]) 5b) MORE [ql (I INVITED ql men), q2 (I INVITED q2 women)]",
        "Similar suggestions have also been made in a rather different context by Keenan and Stavi (1986; 282-284); considering the semantics of comparative adjectival constructions like that in 8a), they argue convincingly that these are to be regarded as directly interpreted, rather than as reduced forms of sentences like 8b) or 8c):",

        "8b) More male students than female students passed the exam.",
        "8c) More male students passed the exam than female students passed the exam.",
        "We should also mention the work of McCord (1981; 1985; 1987) on \"focalizers\"; the key notion we borrow is the use of rewriting rules on semantic representations, to produce a logical form in which contrasted items appear at the same level.",
        "Although McCord does not attempt, as we do, to justify his operations formally, the intuitions behind them clearly overlap to a large extent with ours.",
        "In our own treatment of phrasal comparatives, we take all these ideas to their logical conclusion: we dispense with the C-ellipsis rule altogether, and regard all nonclausal comparatives as essentially phrasal, interpreting them by a method analogous to Pinkham's distributive copying.",
        "The abstract scheme is concretely implemented in the form of rewriting rules, which are applied to an intermediate quasi-logical form.",
        "A solution along these lines, which builds on previously reported work (Banks 1986; Banks and Rayner 1987; Rayner and Banks 1988), is described in Section 3.",
        "As we complete this article, we discover that a similar approach for German comparatives has independently been suggested by Krifka (1987); Krifka also proceeds by using direct interpretation rules involving contrasting of compared constituents, although the details of his analysis are in some respects fairly different.",
        "The following is a typical example: 9a) is given the semantics represented by 9b), where tid4(d) is to be read as \"the maximum d, for which 4)(d) holds,\" and KOMP(x, y, f) is defined by",

        "Our fundamental argument will be Occam's razor: especially from the implementation viewpoint, assuming that phrasals are derived from clausals has little real explanatory power.",
        "Since the authors quoted above give good theoretical arguments to show that at least some phrasal comparatives are not the result of C-ellipsis, we are at any rate going to have to provide direct interpretation rules for these eases.",
        "If it then turns out that these rules can be systematically extended so as to cover the other phrasal comparatives as well, we can dispense with C-ellipsis altogether and arrive at a simpler system.",
        "We claim that this is exactly what we have done.",
        "It is worth looking a little more closely at the case in which the comparative complement is of the form than NP; this is certainly the one that occurs most commonly in practice.",
        "The first point is well known, and was first described in detail in Hankamer (1971): in English (and in fact a good many other languages), it is possible to extract out of contrastive NP complements, but not from clausal comparative complements.",

        "10a) Who; does John run faster than ti?",
        "10b) *Who; does John run faster than t. runs?",
        "The relevance of this observation is obvious: if contrastive NP complements really are elliptic forms of clausal complements, we would appear to need some mechanism by which something originally an extraction island could cease to be one when a reduction is performed.",
        "This would be a very unusual phenomenon, which it would certainly be preferable to avoid introducing into a syntactic theory; rather than do this, it seems much simpler to treat the two constructions as fundamentally different, as we have done.",

        "We now proceed to show how the intuitive picture sketched out in Section 3.1 can be expressed formally in terms of Montague grammar; the technical idea is essentially inspired by the PTQ treatment of scoping phenomena5 (Montague 1972; Dowty et al.",
        "1982, pp.",
        "203-215).",
        "There are three slightly different variants of the method, one for constituents of type t (clauses), and two for constituents of type ( e, t) (VPs, APs).",
        "Since we are treating adverbials as properties of verb-objects, ADVPs will also fall into this second group.",
        "For each variant, we have a rule-schema, parameterized by the syntactic type of the comparative complement; we call this constituent COMPLEMENT, and we also assume the existence of a \"proform\" that can stand for constituents of type COMPLEMENT.",
        "An example of such a proform will be written as c-proformi for some suitable i.",
        "We will also need a set of proforms to stand for determiners; we will write these as q-proformi.",
        "Finally, we will assume a syntactic class COMP-OPERATOR, which will include expressions like more, less, at least twice as much, and so on.",
        "The denotation of an expression in COMP-OPERATOR will be a constant two-place relation between degrees.",
        "We then add syntactic rules, to say that a constituent of type COMPLEMENT can be realized as c-proformi, and that its denotation is a variable c1 of the appropriate type; similarly, a determiner can be realized as q-proformi, and its denotation will be a variable q1 of the type associated with degree expressions.",
        "Since the semantic rules are all defined relative to a variable-substitution g, it naturally follows that the truth conditions for a phrase containing any of these proforms depends on the values assigned by g to the associated variables.",
        "We are now in a position to define the syntactic rule-schema for composition of phrasal comparatives.",
        "We first take the simpler case, where the phrase is of clausal type; the input to the rule will be the following:",
        "1) A phrase (I) of type S, containing occurrences of c-proformi and q-proform for some i and j.",
        "2) Two phrases A1 and A2 of type COMPLEMENT.",
        "3) A phrase if of type COMP-OPERATOR.",
        "and produces as output the phrase Comp(, A1, A2, if) constructed by doing the following: a) Replace c-proformi in 4> by the phrase A1.",

        "To understand what it means in intuitive terms, we focus first on (I)\".",
        "This can be viewed in the usual way as a predicate with two argument slots: the first filled by an object denoting a phrase of type COMPLEMENT, and the second by an object denoting a degree.",
        "We now work \"from the inside out.\"",
        "We thus begin with the subformula V(N,N) }; remember that this is a generalized determiner (see Section 1.2).",

        "The final formula is now constructed by once again substituting suitable values into the argument slots for 0\", these now being A1' and IN I (13\"(A2',{N' I Ale(N,N)})}.",
        "To summarize: what we have described here is a rule-schema that allows us to construct what could be called a comparative S, which contrasts two constituents of type COMPLEMENT.",
        "A small extension now gives us corresponding schemas for comparative constituents of type (e, t) (this includes VPs, APs, and relative clauses); it seems that there are actually two slightly different versions.",
        "The most obvious case is the one in which contrasting takes place, as previously, between the comparative complement and some other constituent of similar type.",
        "Here, we can use the syntactic conditions for the rule above in unchanged form; since the type of cie is (e, t) rather than t, the semantic part of the rule has to be rewritten slightly, as the old definition would no longer make the condition on N a truth-value.",

        "One way to deal with these constructions would be to make them all equivalent with the case represented by 16): for relative clauses, it is reasonable to maintain that contrasting is between the complement, and a \"gap\" linked to the relative pronoun.",

        "Particularly in our analysis of contrastive phrasals, we have gone to some lengths to describe how the ideas can be implemented in a reasonably efficient way.",
        "Here, the key idea has been to use a level of representation intermediate between syntax and logical form, which we call quasi-logical form, or QLF.",
        "At QLF level, phrasal comparatives are linked to their heads, but not to the constituent they are contrasted against.",
        "Rewriting rules then reshape the QLF until it is in a form where the comparative complements are at the same level as their \"correlates.\"",
        "We also make use of features for defining long-range dependencies.",
        "These occur in several varieties: the bound null proforms in clausal comparatives, the missing sentential and VP complements in S and VP-operators, and finally the comparative complements, which in general are separated from their heads in surface syntax.",
        "Weighing up the strengths and weaknesses of our approach, it is most natural to compare it with Friedmann's. Since Friedmann gives the comparative degree wide scope by default, her system needs extra rewriting rules for dealing with quantified NPs, both in the main clause and the comparative complement; we have argued that a \"narrow scope\" default is in general preferable.",
        "We have also claimed that it is difficult in Friedmann's syntactically oriented approach to give a formulation of the comparative deletion rule that will extend to the harder cases.",
        "However, we have also seen, in Section 3.4.6, that our semantics runs into problems when attempting to derive the \"wide-scope\" reading for sentences like 27), where the comparative head occurs within the scope of a modal operator.",
        "Rather than postulate more ad hoc rewriting rules, we tentatively suggested that there may be alternate wide-scope versions of the key formulas from Section 3.2; this fits in well with Pinkham's remarks on wide and narrow-scope clausals, which we refer to at the end of Section 4.",
        "Further investigation of these issues seems like one of the most important items on our agenda for future research.",
        "Another topic that urgently needs study is the interaction between comparatives and coordination; in certain cases, illustrated in sentences 46)-49), our first impression is that problems will occur.",
        "Since these obviously depend on the",
        "15) John was born in the same city as Mary.",
        "16) John arrived before Mary.",
        "17) John likes Mary's house better than Mary John's. way in which we intend to handle coordination, we postpone discussion to a later paper.",
        "46) No one could have a safer and more promising future than John.",
        "47) Mary is more attractive than Jane and Sarah.",
        "48) John visits the U.S. more often than Mary, but less frequently than Carol.",
        "49) The results were better than John claimed, but worse than we had hoped.",
        "Several other open questions also deserve mention.",
        "We have not been very specific in giving rules about where comparative complements may occur, and our treatment of phrasal contrastives also appear to allow more readings than really exist.",
        "It would certainly be desirable to find rules to eliminate these, or at least heuristics to say which readings can be regarded as unlikely.",
        "Another interesting question is whether it is possible to make the theory more compact, by collapsing the three formulas (*), (**), and (***) into one; they are so similar that this seems intuitively quite feasible.",
        "We speculate that one may be able to do this in a framework like that described in Pereira and Pollack (1988), which allows conditional interpretation.",
        "Finally, we say a few more words about the \"discourse comparatives\" mentioned in Section 6.",
        "A cursory examination of the example sentences would suggest that most of the missing comparative complements are of one of the following: \"than previously,\" \"than the one just mentioned,\" or \"than is the case.\"",
        "For example, taking another look at sentences 43)-45), we can postulate that the complement is as given below in italics.",
        "43) The abandoned creature .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "committed a still graver sin (than the one just mentioned).",
        "44) At eight o'clock the wind was blowing more strongly (than previously).",
        "45) I should be colder (than is the case) if I were dead.",
        "To fill in these missing complements, it as usual seems clear that pragmatic information is needed; researchers working in discourse theory may find these problems worth investigating."
