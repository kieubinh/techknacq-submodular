        "In the example above, QLF resolution leads to the following LF in which the a_term is replaced by an intersentential referent mary, the noun phrase determiner is replaced by the quantifier exists, and the a_form is simply replaced by a formula involving the relational noun predicate friend_of taken from the lexicon: quant (exists, X, [and,[friend, X],[f riend_of , j ohn, [meet,mary,X]).",

        "This is in contrast to approaches (e.g., Hobbs 1976; Carter 1987) in which these details are encoded in the algorithm, leading to different success rates for different algorithms depending on the type of text (Walker 1989 compares the performance of two such algorithms).",
        "Our approach should make it possible to write different sets of resolution rules for different natural languages, or sublanguages, without changing the mechanism applying these rules.",
        "In the CLE, an ordered set of \"reference resolution rules\" determines the order in which proposed resolved LFs are derived from a QLF.",
        "Unresolved QLF expressions can be nested, so before the rules are applied to an unresolved expression, they are applied recursively to its restriction.",

        "A rule is taken to be applicable to the resolution of a QLF-expression if the expression unifies with the left hand side of the rule.",
        "In general, it is the category in unresolved QLF expressions that plays the major role in selecting resolution methods to be applied.",
        "The information represented in these categories is in principle open-ended in the same sense that holds for categories appearing in rules in unification grammar formalisms.",
        "As well as the main reference resolution rules just described, the resolution process makes use of lexical declarations specifying, for example, the predicate corresponding to relational nouns or the quantifier cardinality predicate corresponding to determiners: reflex( WordSense,Category,Predicate).",
        "Examples of these \"lexical reference declarations\" will be given in Section 4.",
        "The implementation of our QLF resolution model in the CLE uses a set of rules covering a range of reference phenomena that occur in English, including pronouns (Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.8), definite descriptions (Sections 4.4 and 4.9), quantifiers and collective readings (Sections 4.5 and 4.6), one-anaphora (Section 4.14), and implicit relations (Sections 4.11 and 4.12).",

        "We will not be discussing these heuristic factors much, but instead will focus primarily on illustrating how a wide range of semantic and pragmatic phenomena can be viewed as QLF resolution (Section 4), and secondarily on the application of constraints on resolution to resulting RQLF interpretations (Section 6).",
        "One way of viewing a QLF expression is as a conditional interpretation in the sense of Pollack and Pereira (1988).",
        "To take the simplest case, we can regard an a_term representing a pronoun in a QLF as an assumption that the variable for the a_term can be resolved by a matching reference rule.",
        "Our framework for QLF resolution can then be seen as a modular approach to representing and discharging such assumptions in a way that does not require their interactions, or the constraints on resolution, to be specified in the semantic interpretation rules of the system.",
