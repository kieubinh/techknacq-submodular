        "The Dictionnaire Explicatif et Combinatoire du Francais Contemporain (DECFC) is an attempt to provide a formally complete and adequate description of the French lexicon.",
        "It is based on the \"Meaning – Text\" theory (Mereuk 1973), which was the source of several projects in natural language processing and especially in automatic translation.",
        "One of the most important principles of the DECFC is that the greater part of the information needed to describe a natural language should be compiled within the dictionary.",
        "This is in contrast with the current practice of giving preference to grammars.",
        "Far from being a modest and secondary appendix to a good grammar, the dictionary becomes the main (in effect, only) basis of all grammars and, in general, of all linguistic descriptions (Merauk 1973).",
        "As the dictionary is used as the basis of linguistic description, it becomes a very complex database for different types of information with many links and constraints.",
        "A well-defined methodology is needed to build such a dictionary; adequate computerized tools are also needed, otherwise the task becomes almost impossible.",

      "text": [
        "To really understand the goal of the DECFC, it is important to put it in the perspective of the Meaning – Text Theory (MTT) for which it is the foundation.",
        "We now briefly sketch the MTT and show its implications for the dictionary.",
        "A comprehensive presentation can be found in Merduk (1973); a more computer science – oriented view is Boyer and Lapalme (1984), where it is used as the basis of a system for generating paraphrases.",
        "Mel6uk and Polguere (1987) describe the formal approach that underlies the construction of the DECFC.",
        "As stated by Mele'uk, the purpose of the MTT \"consists in establishing correspondences between any given meaning and (ideally) all synonymous texts having this meaning.\" The MTT is essentially descriptive and is not concerned with procedures for moving from meanings to texts and vice versa.",
        "In MTT, an utterance u is represented at seven levels:",
        "• the Sem(antic)R(epresentation), which is a linguistic object, an utterance in a pictorial language.",
        "Its role is to represent a class of synonymous sentences, weeding them out of all their syntactic information.",
        "A semantic graph is a connected directed graph with labeled nodes and arcs.",
        "The node labels are either predicates or names of objects.",
        "The arc labels are integers; the arc labeled by i leads to the ith argument of the predicate.",
        "• the D(eep-)Synt(actic)Representation is a tree whose nodes are labeled with \"meaningful lexemes\" of u.",
        "• the S(urface-)Synt(actic)R(epresentation) is also a tree, but its nodes are labeled with all actual lexemes of u.",
        "• MTT also introduces the Deep and Surface representations for morphology and phonology.",
        "which represents the sentence \"The sales have increased by 20 units.\" This network is incomplete because there is no indication about the time of the action and about the determination of the sales (do we know exactly what sales we are talking about?).",
        "To transform a SemR to a DSyntR, we have to cover all the nodes of the SemR with \"network schemata\" found in the DECFC and merge the corresponding trees also given by the DECFC.",
        "Suppose now that our dictionary contains only of three definitions composed of the \"network schema,\" the corresponding tree and the conditions under which the definition can apply to a network.",
        "The first rule indicates that if the y and z arguments are free variables and that w is a positive integer, then the change(x,y,z,w) predicate can be transformed to the tree corresponding to x' increase_by w. x' corresponds here to the x node obtained by using the dictionary definitions.",
        "In this case, the sale node gives the node (sale,name,(fem,n)).",
        "So applying rules 1), 2), and 3) we obtain the three following trees:",
        "Boyer and Lapalme (1984) describe a variant of the classical unification algorithm for merging these trees (where underlines indicate free variables); we get the following We could continue by applying similar rules to transform between the different levels of representation.",
        "The transformation rules have to be very precise, and thus the dictionary becomes a complex database involving many relations between words.",
        "A formal approach to the dictionary building is needed because the transformations are essentially automatic and data-driven (in our case dictionary-driven).",
        "Building the DECFC is an enormous task because it has to deal not only with the lexemes but also with their intricate relations.",
        "The appendix gives the full entry for the lexeme respect where it can be appreciated that a tool to help in writing and checking entries and relations would be very useful.",
        "However, the basic goal of the DECFC project is not to create a version of the dictionary that could be used by a computer program (for text analysis or generation, for instance) but rather to edit a printable version for human readers.",
        "This means that the way information is presented and edited is not always as formal as could be expected from the theory.",
        "For instance, definitions of lexemes, which are represented by semantic networks in the theory, are represented in the DECFC by French sentences derived from the network by following a set of principles (but no formal rules).",
        "Despite this, the DECFC is built applying a systematic methodology that could in principle be programmed, the main difference being that the information is not always as explicit as it could be.",
        "A lexicologist could, for instance, retrieve the exact semantic network from a DEC FC definition, but a computer could not.",
        "Furthermore, the DECFC includes some redundancies that would not be needed from a theoretical point of view.",
        "Even if there are a few differences between the DECFC and the formal lexicon of the MTT, there is a clear and direct correspondence between the two.",
        "Our discussion emphasizes the validations the system has to ensure and the way to implement them.",
        "We first give a description of the DECFC structure.",
        "We then concentrate on specific problems of coherence and verification through the dictionary.",
        "We finally discuss the way lexicographers can interact with the system through a specialized interface to the editor.",

        "• synonyms (SY1V): same meaning and same syntactic category • antonyms (ANTI): same meaning except that the definition of one of the two lexemes includes a negation • syntactic derivates: same meaning but different syntactic categories such as: Nominalization (So), Verbalization (Vo), Adverbialization (Advo), Adjectivization (Adjo) • Converses (CONV): same meaning and same syntactic category, but the order of syntactic actants with respect to semantic actants is different.",
        "Furthermore, the DECFC distinguishes four different degrees in which those relations can occur: • Exact (=): same meaning • Larger (>): the meaning of the first lexeme includes the second • Smaller (<): the meaning of the first lexeme is included in the second • Intersection (<>): the meanings of the two lexemes intersect",

        "This problem is simpler when dealing with semantic networks.",
        "For example, the semantic network for a larger synonym of a word A must be included in the semantic network of A (this is the definition of larger synonyms!).",
        "When the definition is expressed in terms of a sentence representing the network, the rules are a little trickier.",
        "For example, if a word A has exact or larger synonyms, one of the synonyms will have to appear in the definition of A.",
        "Exact synonyms will be preferred to larger ones; derivates will be preferred to converses, etc .. .",
        "• Synonymy and numbering: both numbering of lexemes and synonymous relations between lexemes are measures of semantic proximity and thus must comply with some identified rules.",
        "For example, if two lexemes differ only by the third level of numbering, they must be synonyms.",
        "These rules are derived from the methodology used to define numbering and the methodology used to identify synonyms (both methodologies being based on an analysis of the semantic network).",
        "Synonymy and government: there is a relation between sharing meaning and sharing government.",
        "Among other things, the number of syntactic octants of each lexeme must be the same (exact synonyms have the same number of semantic arguments).",
        "The reason that synonymic relations are so present in the problem of verifying coherence is they express a direct and explicit link between units of description inside the dictionary.",
        "Furthermore, these relations possess two important properties:",
        "each relation has an opposite; • with some limitations, relations can be composed to form new relations (i.e., If A is in relation with B and B is in",
        "relation with C, in most cases there is a relation between A and C).",
        "The most important consequence of those properties is that from a set of correct relations it is possible to validate any new relation given by the user or even to propose a list of new relations.",

        "But even then, it is important to consider them because when composed with another relation they can eventually simplify and return a single relation.",
        "For example, if we have the following relations: CONV213(buy) = sell, So(sell) = sale, CONV213(sale) = purchase, no compositions can be made according to Figure 2.",
        "However, combining the three relations would lead to CON V213(So(Conv213)buy))) = purchase.",
        "This larger expression can be reduced to So(buy) = purchase if some rules of simplification are used (commutativity, elimination, simplification of derivates, etc.).",

        "Identification of definition as well as of synonymic relations relies on intuition at some point in process.",
        "So, when a lexicologist enters a new synonymic relation, he or she expresses by a different mean, the same intuitions about equivalence and hierarchy of meaning as in definitions.",
        "The composition of synonymic relations done in our editor has to generate all possible consequences from such choices.",
        "For instance, if a lexeme uses a word in its definition, our editor could find out that this word has to be a near synonym and, by that, generates a list of relations that would have to be true.",
        "Lexicologists could then see clearly the scope and consequences of their intuition, which would result eventually in a better structuring and integration of those intuitions.",
        "As synonymic relations also have degrees, those must be combined as well.",
        "Figure 3 expresses the way relation degrees are combined.",
        "This is clearly different from relation composition, because in many cases more than one result is possible (the symbol * indicates the possibility of having no relation).",
        "It is important to note here that the inclusion of meanings does not follow the same rules as the inclusion of sets.",
        "For example, if A contains B and B contains C, then A contains C if A,B,C are sets, but it is not always true for synonymic relations.",
        "This is due to the fact that a synonymic relation exists only if the meaning shared is important enough (i.e., both definitions share a nontrivial4 part).",
        "Thus, it is possible that C is too different from A to lead to a synonymic relation.",
        "This shows that when near-synonymic relations are combined, we do not always get a single result but often a set of possibilities.",
        "This is sufficient for the purpose of ensuring the coherence of new information entered in the system.",
        "To be more precise would involve comparing the definitions of both lexemes, considering the numbering of the lexemes within their vocable and using statistical data.",
        "We have now defined some properties of synonymic relations that are helpful in checking if relations in a given state of the dictionary are coherent.",
        "We still have to know how this verification takes place.",
        "If we take all synonymic relations in the dictionary and represent them as two nodes linked by an arrow, we obtain a set of networks like the one in Figure 4.",
        "From there, we can check any new relations entered in the system by considering the network in which the new relation appears (this could imply the merging of two networks).",
        "We look at all the paths linking the two nodes in the new relations (even the paths going in the reverse direction of an arrow as we can define an inverse for all relations).",
        "We then combine the relation on each of these paths using the rules we defined.",
        "The relation is coherent if no contradiction occurs between the new relation and what is obtained on any of the paths.5 Using this method, our editor ensures that an overall coherence is maintained between those relations, which is close to impossible to do manually.",
        "Now we look at another kind of coherence verification: circular definition."

      "text": [
        "When the meaning of any word in a dictionary is expressed in terms of other words in the same language, circular definitions become unavoidable.",
        "This means that if we take a definition and replace each word by its definition and so on, either the first word (the one we started up with) is found somewhere in the process (we call this strong circularity) or we have to use a word that has a strong circular definition (we call this weak circularity).",
        "This is due to the fact that the process of replacing words by their definition is infinite but the lexicon is not.",
        "In fact these conditions imply that each definition in the dictionary is circular.",
        "To avoid that situation we accept that some words may not have a definition.",
        "They are the semantic primitives on which more complex meanings are built.",
        "One of the objectives of the DECFC is to find those primitives.",
        "The authors of the theory believe that the identification of semantic primitives can only be done by experimentation through the building of an actual dictionary.",
        "In respect to that goal, it becomes essential that each case of circularity be detected.",
        "Once again, this task is nearly impossible to realize without the help of an automatic tool.",
        "As we have seen, there are two kinds of circularity.",
        "But, as weak circularity presupposes the existence of strong circularity in the dictionary, only the latter must be looked for.",
        "There are two ways to analyze a definition for that purpose: top-down or bottom-up.",
        "The top-down approach consists of trying to find the word being defined in its own definition, and then in the definition of the words used to define it, and so on.",
        "The bottom-up method tries to find all the words that are not allowed and then to compare this list with the definition.",
        "For example, let's say we want to check if the definition of eye is circular.",
        "We first build a list of all the words in whose definitions eye appears.",
        "We then add to this list by doing the same thing for all the words in the list and so on.",
        "These two methods give the same result, but the latter has the advantage of generating a list of forbidden words that can be of some use to the lexicographers when writing definitions.",
        "Unfortunately, these simple mechanisms are not enough to get rid of circular definitions.",
        "This is because circular definitions are not created when the word being defined is repeated, but more precisely when its meaning is used to define it.",
        "This means that using an exact synonym in a definition also causes a definition to be circular.",
        "This is true for exact synonyms, but we need some precisions for imperfect ones.",
        "Let's look at the four possible cases given that B is SY N(A)=, using B to define A is forbidden; SY N(A),, using B to define A is perfectly acceptable because B has a more simple meaning than A (i.e. the meaning of A is B plus something else); SY INT(A)<, using B to define A is forbidden because B is more complex than A; SY N(A) „, using B to define A is forbidden because B has a part of meaning that A does not have.",
        "On the other hand, it would not create a circular definition but an incoherent one; Thus, to detect circular definitions, we have to take the synonymic relations into account.",
        "For example, in the top-down method we check not only for the word being defined but also for exact, larger, and intersection synonyms (and of course antonyms, converse and derivates).",
        "As a list of other relations can be deduced from a single set of synonymic relations, many \"deductions\" are only a list of possibilities.",
        "To ensure maximum validation, those relations have to be taken into account so that the system indicates potential circular definitions and explains what are the assumptions.",
        "But more important is that a circle can be introduced in a definition simply by adding a new synonymic relation, and this implies watching for circular definition each time a synonymic relation is added or modified.",
        "Circular definition and synonymous relations are amongst the major coherence problems of DECFC we have worked on.",
        "Many others have been studied, and still more needs to be defined and analyzed."

        "We now only present the data structure, the definition of algorithms for verification, and the user interface.",
        "We implemented our editor on a Xerox Lisp Machine because it provides a multi-windowing environment that enables different processes to be going on at the same time on different parts of the screen.",
        "For our editor, this is especially important since the validity of information is always related to other pieces of information elsewhere in the dictionary and it is essential for the user to be able to view, on a single screen, different parts of the dictionary.",
        "This becomes even more important when the system reports a coherence error: at this point, the user can see the two (or more) chunks of information that are in conflict and can browse elsewhere in the dictionary to really understand what the problem is.",
        "Furthermore, users often need to compare different entries or to use older entries as a model for new ones.",
        "For those reasons, we need much more than the usual single context view.",

        "When analyzing a section of information, the system applies an appropriate BNF grammar to the data.",
        "In some cases, context-free rules are not powerful enough and specific functions are used for verifying contextual rules of formation.",
        "The implementation of coherence rule verification poses two problems.",
        "First, the algorithms for our theoretically defined coherence rules, and second, the order of application of the verification rules.",
        "In particular, we had to define what actions to take when a piece of information is added, modified, or deleted.",
        "For example when a synonymic relation is modified, many things would have to be checked (Is the syntax ok?",
        "Did the change remove some incoherences present in the system?",
        "Is the relation incoherent?",
        "Could the relation be incoherent if some hypothesis were true?",
        "Does the relation introduce a vicious circle?).",

        "• Browsing is simple and flexible because it follows the structure of the DECFC.",
        "• Information is presented similarly as to what lexicographers are used to seeing (in the actual printed version of the DECFC, for instance).",
        "• The system shows different parts of the dictionary at the same time with few or no constraints.",
        "• The system communicates efficiently with the user by presenting and explaining incoherences and errors, by guiding the user for correction, and by showing general information about the actual state of the dictionary.",
        "• Editing is customized for each section of information (e.g. a definition is not edited like a lexical function).",
        "We defined a model of structured editing in which a structure editor is viewed as a set of specialized editors and a set of specialized selectors.",
        "Each node in the structure of the dictionary is then assigned either an editor (when it is an editable information) or a selector (when it is seen as a structure itself).",
