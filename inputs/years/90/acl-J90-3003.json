        "In previous work (Bachenko et al. 1986), we described an experimental text-to-speech system that determined prosodic phrasing for the Olive – Liberman synthesizer (Olive and Liberman 1985).",
        "The system generated phrase boundaries using information derived from the syntactic structure of a sentence.",
        "While we saw significant improvements in the resulting synthesized speech, we also observed problems with the system.",
        "Often these stemmed from our assumptions that both clausal structure and predicate-argument relations were important in determining prosodic phrasing.",
        "This paper reconsiders those assumptions and describes an analysis of phrasing that we believe corrects many of the problems of the earlier version.",
        "Like the earlier version, it has been implemented in a text-to-speech system that uses a natural language parser and prosody rules to generate information about the location and relative strength of prosodic phrase boundaries.",
        "Our current analysis rests on two ideas.",
        "First, it is possible to describe a level of prosodic phrasing that is independent of discourse semantics.",
        "Second, this discourse-neutral phrasing depends on a mix of syntactic and nonsyntactic factors; chiefly, syntactic constituency, left-to-right word order, and constituent length.",
        "There is no necessary fit between syntactic structure and phrasing, since prosodic phrasing may ignore major syntactic boundaries in order to satisfy the constraints on phrase length.",
        "Our approach thus follows that of Grosjean et al. (1979), namely, that phrasing reflects \"... two (sometimes conflicting) demands on the speaker: the need to respect the linguistic structure of the sentence and the need to balance the length of the constituents in the output\" (p. 75).",
        "Section 2 will outline our analysis, focusing on the relationship between syntactic and prosodic structure.",
        "The analysis is developed within the framework of generative grammar, but we believe it is consistent with other approaches to syntactic description.'",
        "Our main point will be that the syntax plays a necessary but not sufficient role in determining phrasing, its effects being filtered by separate conditions on prosodic well-formedness (e.g. length).",
        "Section 3 describes the implementation of our analysis in an experimental text-to-speech system, and Section 4 summarizes our main conclusions.",
        "Unless otherwise noted, the corpus we used as a source of observations on phrasing in human speech consisted of a taped professional dramatization of the Sherlock Holmes story The Speckled Band and a documentary about Mount Everest that includes both professional \"prepared\" narration and the spontaneous speech of interviews.",
        "The Holmes story involved two male speakers and one female speaker; the Everest documentary involved a male narrator and several male interviewees.",
        "Both of us independently transcribed the tapes according to our perceptions of prosodic phrasing.",
        "Other examples come from transcriptions of speech that we recorded at Bell Laboratories.",
        "In the transcriptions, we both distinguished three types of prosodic event: a primary phrase boundary, a secondary phrase boundary, and the absence of a boundary.",
        "The most salient characteristic of the primary phrase boundary was a pause, while that of the secondary boundary involved a change in pitch.",
        "In comparing the two transcriptions, we discarded cases in which there was a discrepancy between the two markings, which left us with a corpus of approximately 500 sentences against which the prosodic phrasing rules were tested."

        "(to pronounced /tu/) When it comes to sentence-level prosody, especially phrasing, it is often true, as we will see below, that a sequence of words dominated by the same syntactic node cohere more closely than a sequence of words dominated by two different nodes.",
        "This observation has led some researchers, e.g., Cooper and Paccia-Cooper (1980), to claim a direct mapping between the syntactic phrase and the prosodic phrase.",
        "However, this claim is controversial because of the misalignments that occur between the two levels of phrasing.",
        "For example, in considering the connection between syntax and phrasing, the linguistic literature most often refers to examples of embedded sentences.",

        "Instead, 12 has the prosodic phrasing in 13a.",
        "The phrasing in 13b, which most closely matches constituency, is strange at best.",

        "This is the cat II that caught the rat II that stole the cheese, b.",
        "?",
        "?This is lithe cat that caught II the rat that stole II the cheese.",
        "To account for such mismatches, \"readjustment rules\" that change constituent structure by adjoining each embedded sentence to the node dominating it have been posited.",
        "The result is a flattened structure that more accurately reflects the prosodic phrasing.",
        "In Chomsky and Halle (1968), this flattening process is not part of the grammar.",
        "Rather, it is viewed as \".. a performance factor, related to the difficulty of producing right branching structures such as [12]\" (p. 372).",
        "Thus phrasing, in their approach, is only indirectly related to syntax, since readjustment is done by special rules outside the grammar proper.",
        "Langendoen (1975) proposes readjustment rules similar to those of Chomsky and Halle, but he claims that the readjustment of structure is part of the grammar, not part of the performance model.",
        "He thus makes explicit what is often a tacit assumption in both the linguistic and psycholinguistic literature – that there is a direct connection between syntactic constituency and prosodic phrasing, with apparent misalignments readjusted before syntax interfaces with prosodic phonology.",
        "Langendoen's proposal works well for sentences such as 12 because it predicts that important prosodic phrase boundaries will coincide with sentence boundaries.",
        "But this does not always fit the prosodic facts – sentences that lack overt complementizers or relative pronouns often resist the insertion of a break to set them off.",
        "For example, when applied to They believe California sales are still off 75 percent, readjustment rules cause the embedded sentence to be set off prosodically, as in 14a.",
        "This seems quite unnatural compared with 14b (an observed example), where a boundary has been inserted not before the sentence, but after the embedded subject.",
        "Similarly, flattening the relative clause it saw in It was ready to bite the first person it saw has the questionable effect of inserting a prosodic phrase boundary before the relative clause, as in 15a.",
        "But in our data, this sentence actually has the phrasing in 15b, where the relative clause is not set off.",

        "However, Langendoen's claim that embedded clauses are flattened would nullify this difference.",
        "The flattening and consequent setting off of restrictive relatives would render sentences such as 16a unintelligible because the associated appositive reading forces a contradiction between who came from Plymouth and who came from Falmouth.",
        "We believe the only intelligible version of this sentence is 16b, where there has been no readjustment of the come from clauses.",

        "Where misalignments between the syntactic and the prosodic phrasing occur, however, the notion of readjusting the syntax to fit the prosody is problematic and, we believe, compares unfavorably with an approach that views the semantic and phonological components as contributing to prosodic phrase boundary determination."

        "In testing a prosodic phrase system, it is necessary to be clear about the goals of the work.",
        "At the level of basic inquiry, such a system should aim to correlate well with human speech production, assuming that we are able to abstract away from speaker variability.",
        "However, in working under the assumption that discourse plays a role, however limited, in prosodic phrase determination, the comparison of synthetic to human phrasing becomes less meaningful since factors unknown to our system influence the placement of phrase boundaries.",
        "At the level of system building, a prosodic phrasing system should aim to make a text-to-speech system easier to understand.",
        "In general, adding phrasing to a text-to-speech system will enhance synthetic speech both by breaking a run-on delivery into more easily processed chunks of speech and by allowing the pitch range to be increased, enhancing naturalness.",
        "The primary requirement for making synthetic speech easier to understand, however, is that the phrasing system should first do no harm, i.e., it should avoid misleading phrasings and phrasings like 38 that are difficult for a listener to process.",
        "38.",
        "?",
        "?This is lithe cat that caught lithe rat that stole lithe cheese.",
        "To address the issue of avoiding undesirable phrasings, a system like ours must be run against a set of utterances of disparate lengths and syntactic types to see where it breaks.",
        "To do this, we accumulated a set of syntactically varied test sentences, had them read by two speakers, marked the prosodic phrase boundaries as we had done with the Holmes and Everest data, and ran the sentences through our prosodic phrase system for comparison with the human speak-ers' phrasing.",
        "Phrasing in the speech of the two human speakers was almost identical; where the speakers failed to match, we depended on the speaker with the more detailed phrasing to obtain a single transcript for comparison.",
        "The sentences with the phrase markings produced by the system (S) and by the human speakers (H) are given in Appendix A.",
        "In addition, we used the sentences of Grosjean et al.",
        "(1979) to test our system; these were the same sentences used by G &G. They were produced by six subjects speaking each sentence at five different speaking rates.",
        "We chose these data both because they form an established, though small, corpus and because their phrase markings, derived by oscillographic tracings of pause duration, provide a check against the possibility of error in human judgments of pause location and salience.",
        "A comparison of these data with the output of our system is given in Appendix B.",
        "In comparing human and synthetic prosodic phrasing with an eye on synthetic phrasings that are either misleading or unprocessable, errors in the assignment of primary phrase boundaries are the most egregious.",
        "In the data in Appendix A, the human speakers produced 31 intrasenten-tial primary phrase boundaries, of which our system matched 16 with its equivalent of a primary phrase boundary.",
        "The other primary phrase boundaries in the human productions were matched in 9 cases with a secondary phrase boundary, and in 5 cases with a tertiary boundary.",
        "The system thus missed 1 primary boundary, the one after books in 17.",
        "In the absence of research on the relative significance of different boundary types, we are assuming that, with respect to the comprehensability and acceptability of synthetic speech, the difference between a primary and secondary phrase boundary is minimal.",
        "On the other hand, the tertiary boundary produced by our system is almost imperceptible and cannot be considered equivalent to the primary boundary.",
        "The system thus matched, either exactly or approximately, 80% of the primary boundaries.",
        "In looking at the primary phrase boundaries that the system failed to duplicate, we want to be sure that we avoid difficult phrasings like that of 38 rather than match any particular phrasing exactly.",
        "In sentences 9, 12, 17, and 21, where our system produced a tertiary boundary at the location of the human speakers' primary phrase boundary, comprehensibility has not been diminished.",
        "The listener is misled only in sentence 17, where our system generated a boundary at a location different from that of the human speakers.",
        "In the system's phrasing of 17, the boundary before books corresponds to an interpretation of the utterance in which the books are written by her uncle, which, while it is a possible phrasing, presumes a specific discourse setting.",
        "A comparison of the secondary phrase boundaries in Appendix A shows similar correspondences.",
        "The human speakers produced 26 secondary phrase boundaries.",
        "The PP-phph for+several days",
        "system matched 11 exactly and 12 with a primary or tertiary boundary.",
        "It thus failed to match 3 secondary boundaries, in sentences 9, 18, and 20, but only in sentence 18 is the absence of the boundary misleading.",
        "To sum up, there are 2 boundaries out of the 57 produced by the human speakers whose absence in the system's output is truly problematic.",
        "Evaluation of the prosodic phrase system, however, must also consider cases of overgen-eration.",
        "It is significant here that in the 21 sentences of Appendix A, the system never generated a primary phrase boundary that did not correspond to a boundary in the human productions, although the system overgenerated secondary phrase boundaries at 7 locations.",
        "(We ignore the overgeneration of tertiary boundaries as perceptually insignificant.)",
        "Three of these secondary boundaries are problematic.",
        "Those in sentences 17 and 18 were discussed above as resulting from the misplacement of a boundary.",
        "The other unwanted secondary boundary occurs after was in sentence 10 and results in an utterance that, like 38, is difficult to process.",
        "A comparison of our system's output with G &G's productions, given in Appendix B, shows similar results.",
        "Of the 14 primary phrase boundaries in G&G's sentences, the system matched 12 exactly.",
        "There were 2 primary boundaries, however, that the system missed completely.",
        "Both of these errors were due to the presence of a sentential subject.",
        "For sentence 6, no parse was produced, but otherwise the inability of our system to generate the correct result here stems from the fact that the system discards the syntactic sentence node in the derivation of the prosodic phrasing.15 With respect to overgeneration of phrase boundaries, the system overgenerated seriously only once, in sentence 4, where the subject is sentential.",
        "We find these results encouraging; with respect to matching, there were only four significant problems in the two corpora, and overgeneration of a primary boundary occurred only once.",
        "The suitability of our system for speech applications will depend on future tests to determine whether listeners prefer \"prosodized speech\" that is imperfect, i.e., speech that will have some phrasing errors, to the relatively \"flat\" speech of systems that lack our phrasing rules.",
        "The weak link in our current system is the parser: most problems with phrasing arise from parsing errors; in particular, incorrect part of speech assignment, incorrect analysis of pre-head modifiers, and failure to recognize idiomatic or semi-idiomatic expressions.",
        "Problems with the prosody rules come mainly from phenomena that we have not adequately studied, e.g. the proper treatment of material on the left periphery of a prosodic verb phrase and the status of complements to nouns and adjectives."

        "We have discussed the notion of discourse neutral prosodic phrasing in English and presented an analysis that characterizes this phrasing in terms of constituency, adjacency, and length.",
        "In our analysis, the contribution of syntax to discourse-neutral phrasing consists of lexical categorization; NP, PP, and AdjP constituency; and syntactic head identification.",
        "Length is an independent phonological factor.",
        "Because they refer to both syntactic and phonological information, phrasing rules are free to generate prosodic structures that may or may not resemble syntactic structures.",
        "Hence, in speech, it is possible but not expected that phrase boundaries will co-occur with major syntactic boundaries.",
        "Our results suggest that, in an implemented system, the parsing requirements for speech systems are quite different from those for systems providing information retrieval, machine translation, or text generation.",
        "In particular, there seems to be no need for a parser to identify VP and S constituents, nor to specify predicate-argument relations.",
        "The distribution of the phrasing of clause-final PPs given in Figure 4 may indicate the extent of the relation between the discourse neutral phrasing and the phrasing imposed by discourse.",
        "We assume that discourse phrasing may shift neutral boundaries in order to reflect, for example, emphasis, contrast, parallelism, coreference, and the particular structure of the discourse.",
        "The exact connection between the level of phrasing we describe and discourse-dependent phrasing is a question for future research.",
        "We need to know what aspects of the discourse are relevant for phrasing, as well as how the discourse information and the phrasing specifications should be related.",
        "For example, it is not clear whether the discourse-neutral phrasing represents a set of predetermined values that are reset when necessary by discourse features or whether this is a true default situation in which the discourse neutral phrasing is inserted when discourse phrasing is underspecified.",
        "Any contribution in this area will greatly enhance our understanding of the relation between the various components of the grammar – syntactic, semantic, and phonological."
