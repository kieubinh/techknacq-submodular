        "In the past few years, the computational linguistics research community has begun to wrestle with the problem of how to evaluate its progress in developing natural language processing systems.",
        "With the exception of natural language interfaces, there are few working systems in existence, and they tend to focus on very different tasks using equally different techniques.",
        "There has been little agreement in the field about training sets and test sets, or about clearly defined subsets of problems that constitute standards for different levels of performance.",
        "Even those groups that have attempted a measure of self-evaluation have often been reduced to discussing a system's performance in isolation – comparing its current performance to its previous performance rather than to another system.",
        "As this technology begins to move slowly into the marketplace, the lack of useful evaluation techniques is becoming more and more painfully obvious.",
        "In order to make progress in the difficult area of natural language evaluation, a Workshop on the Evaluation of Natural Language Processing Systems was held on December 7-9,1988 at the Wayne Hotel in Wayne, Pennsylvania.",
        "The workshop was organized by Martha Palmer (Unisys), assisted by a program committee consisting of Beth Sund-heim (NOSC), Ed Hovy (ISI), Tim Finin (Unisys), Lynn Bates (BBN), and Mitch Marcus (Pennsylvania).",
        "Approximately 50 people participated, drawn from universities, industry, and government.",
        "The workshop received the generous support of the Rome Air Defense Center, the Association of Computational Linguistics, the American Association of Artificial Intelligence, and Unisys Defense Systems.",
        "The workshop was organized along two basic premises.",
        "First, it should be possible to discuss system evaluation in general without having to state whether the purpose of the system is \"question-answering\" or \"text processing.\" Evaluating a system requires the definition of an application task in terms of input/output pairs that are equally applicable to question-answering, text processing, or generation.",
        "Second, there are two basic types of evaluation, black-box evaluation, which measures system performance on a given task in terms of well-defined input/output pairs, and glass-box evaluation, which examines the internal workings of the system.",
        "For example, glass-box performance evaluation for a system that is supposed to perform semantic and pragmatic analysis should include the examination of predicate-argument relations, referents, and temporal and causal relations.",
        "Since there are many different stages of development that a natural language system passes through before it is in a state where black-box evaluation is even possible (see Figure 1), glass-box evaluation plays an especially important role in guiding the development at early stages.",
        "With these premises in mind, the workshop was structured around the following three sessions: (i) defining the notions of \"black-box evaluation\" and \"glass-box evaluation\" and exploring their utility; (ii) defining criteria for \"black-box evaluation\"; and (iii) defining criteria for \"glass-box evaluation.\" It was hoped that the workshop would shed light on the following questions.",
        "• What are valid measures of \"black-box\" performance?",
        "• What linguistic theories are relevant to developing test suites?",
        "• How can we characterize efficiency?",
        "• What is a reasonable expectation for robustness?",
        "• What would constitute valid training sets and test sets?",
        "• How does all of this relate to measuring progress in the field?"

      "text": [
        "Before looking at the distinctions between \"black-box\" and \"glass-box\" evaluation, it is first necessary to examine the development of a natural language system a little more closely.",
        "There are several different phases, and different types of evaluation are required at each phase.",
        "The various phases are summarized in Figure 1.",
        "Steps",
        "1. Picking the application.",
        "2. Characterising the necessary phenomena.",
        "3. Selecting relevant theories, if available.",
        "4. Developing and testing algorithms that implement these theories.",
        "5. Implementing the first pass at the system, testing it, and identifying gaps in coverage.",
        "6. Characterising the new phenomena that have been discovered, especially those having to do with interactions between components.",
        "7. Fine-tuning algorithms to improve efficiency, and also replacing algorithms as the characterisation of the phenomena changes.",
        "8. Second pass at implementation, to extend coverage to these new phenomena and thus fill in the gaps.",
        "9. Third pass at an implementation in which a focus is placed on issues of extensibility.",
        "10. Fourth and final pass at the implementation in which the system moves into a production environment.",
        "This stage pays special attention to issues of robustness.",
        "Speaking very roughly, the development of a natural language processing system is usually sparked by the needs of the particular application driving it, whether it be question answering, text processing, or machine translation.",
        "What has happened in the past is that, in examining the requirements of such an application, it has quickly become apparent that certain phenomena, such as pronoun reference, are essential to the successful handling of that application.",
        "It has also quickly become apparent that for many of these phenomena, especially semantic and pragmatic ones, past linguistic analysis has very little to offer in the way of categorization.",
        "Even when it might offer a fairly rigorous account of the phenomenon, as in the case of syntax, it has very little to say about useful algorithms for efficiently producing syntactic analyses and even less to say about interaction between different types of phenomena.",
        "So, almost before beginning implementation, a great deal of effort in the computational linguistics community must of necessity be devoted to tasks that can rightly be seen as belonging to theoretical linguistics.",
        "The Discourse Canon that Bonnie Webber prepared for the Mohonk Darpa Workshop (1988) is an excellent example of the type of groundwork that must be done prior to serious attempts at implementation, and must be continued throughout and subsequent to said implementation.",
        "The field needs many more such \"canons\" for other semantic and pragmatic phenomena.",
        "Algorithm development is equally important, and can also be carried out independently of or in parallel with an implementation.",
        "We have several different algorithms for syntactic parsing, and ways of comparing them (and ways of proving that they are all equivalent), but very few algorithms for semantics and pragmatics.",
        "Implementing an algorithm for use in an application is a separate stage of development.",
        "Progress cannot, however, be measured in terms of accurate output until a system that uses particular algorithms to handle particular phenomena has been implemented.",
        "In addition to methods for measuring performance of entire systems, we also need ways of measuring progress in characterizing phenomena and developing algorithms that will contribute to system development.",
        "Once a system is up and running, the accuracy of its output can then be measured.",
        "The different types of the output can be associated with the phenomena that have to be handled in order to produce each type.",
        "For example, consider a phrase from the trouble failure report domain (Ball 1989): Replaced interlock switch with new one.",
        "In order accurately to fill in the slot in the database field associated with the new-part-installed(-) relation, the \"one\" anaphora has to be correctly resolved, requiring a complex interaction between semantic and pragmatic analysis.",
        "It is possible to have two systems that produce the same output, but do it very differently.",
        "This is where such issues as efficiency, extensibility, maintainability, and robustness come in.",
        "A more efficient implementation, for example, may be able to support a larger, more complex domain.",
        "With a more general implementation, it should be easier to extend the scope of the system's domain or to port the system to an entirely new domain.",
        "A system with a more convenient or more robust interface will be easier to use and, one would suppose, used more often.",
        "In a recent study comparing Lotus HAL (Lotus with a restricted natural language interface) to Lotus, not only was Lotus HAL judged to be more convenient to use, but the Lotus HAL users also had higher scores on the problem-solving tasks (Napier 1989)."

      "text": [
        "Black-box evaluation is primarily focused on \"what a system does.\" Ideally, it should be possible to measure performance based on well-defined I/O pairs.",
        "If accurate output is produced with respect to particular input, then the system is performing correctly.",
        "In practice, this is more difficult than it appears.",
        "There is no consensus on how to evaluate the correctness of semantic representations, so output has to be in terms of some specific application task such as database answering or template fill (Sundheim 1989).",
        "This allows for an astonishing amount of variation between systems, and makes it difficult to separate out issues of coverage of linguistic phenomena from robustness and error recovery (see Figure 2).",
        "In addition to the accuracy of the output, systems could also be evaluated in terms of their user-friendliness, modularity, portability, and maintainability.",
        "How easy are they to use., how well do they plug into other components, can they be ported and maintained by someone who is not a system expert?",
        "In general, it should be possible to perform",
        "black box evaluation without knowing anything about the inner workings of the system – the system can be seen as a black box, and can be evaluated by system users."

      "text": [
        "In contrast, glass-box evaluation attempts to look inside the system, and find ways of measuring how well the system does something, rather than simply whether or not it does it.",
        "Glass-box evaluation should measure the system's coverage of a particular linguistic phenomenon or set of phenomena and the data structures used to represent them (see Figure 3).",
        "And it also should be concerned with the efficiency of the algorithms being used.",
        "Many of these tests could be performed only by a system builder.",
        "They are especially useful in attempting to measure progress when a system is under development.",
        "Glass-box evaluation should also include an examination of relevant linguistic theories and how faithfully they are implemented.",
        "If a linguistic theory does not deal with all of the data and has to be modified by the developer, those modifications need be clearly documented, and the information relayed to the Figure 3 A \"glass-box evaluation ' addresses \"how the system works\".",
        "It attempts to look inside the system and find ways of measuring how well the system does something, rather than simply whether or not it does it.",
        "theory's developer.",
        "For example, as pointed out in Bonnie Webber's (Penn) presentation, there is a distinction between Tree Adjunction Grammar (TAG) as a linguistic theory and the several algorithms that have been used to implement TAG parsers: Extended CKY parser, Extended Earley parser, Two-pass extended Earley parser based on lexicalized TAGs, and a DCG parser using lexicalized TAGs.",
        "There is also a distinction between Centering as a theory for resolving anaphoric pronouns (Joshi and Weinstein 1981; Gross et al.",
        "1983), and the attempts to use a centering approach to resolving pronouns in an implementation (Brennan et al.",
        "1987).",
        "In addition, one way of looking inside a system is to look at the performance of one or more modules or components.",
        "Which components are obtained depends on the nature of the decomposition of the system.",
        "NL systems are commonly decomposed into functional modules (e.g., parser, semantic interpretation, lexical lookup, etc.",
        "), each of which performs a specified task, and into analysis phases during which different functions can be performed.",
        "A black-box evaluation of a particular component's performance could be seen as a form of glass-box evaluation.",
        "For example, taking a component such as a parser and defining a test that depends on associating specified outputs for specified inputs would be a black-box evaluation of the parser.",
        "Since it is an evaluation of a component that cannot by itself perform an application, and since it will give information about the component's coverage that is independent of the coverage of any system in which it might be embedded, this can be seen as providing glass-box information for such an overall system."

        "Since the workshop, MUCK II has been held with interesting and useful results, and the Treebank project at the University of Pennsylvania has received funding and has begun.",
        "This should eventually lead to a more formalized testing and comparisons of parsers.",
        "Evaluation is becoming a more prevalent topic at NL workshops, such as the one held at RADC in September 1989, and the Darpa Spoken Language Community is working hard to construct a general evaluation procedure for the various contractors.",
        "However, most of the other specific workshops suggested, such as Database Question-Answering, Generation, Knowledge Representation, and Pragmatics and Discourse do not have any funding sources available.",
        "The most difficult problems remain unresolved.",
        "There are still large classes of phenomena that have yet to be characterized in a scholarly fashion, and we do not have adequate methods for measuring progress of a system under development.",
        "A fundamental underlying snag is the difficulty in arriving at a consensus on the nature of semantic representation.",
        "If the community was in agreement on what the representation of a sentence is supposed to be – whether it was a sentence from a dialogue with an expert system, a sentence fragment from a tactical message, or a database query – then the task of assessing a system's performance would be much more straightforward.",
        "Given input X, does the system produce Y as an internal data structure?",
        "Unfortunately, there are now as many Y's for X as there are systems, so finding a reliable method of assessing a system in isolation, or of comparing two systems, becomes much more difficult.",
        "It is necessary to define the evaluation in terms of a task that is being performed (Sundheim 1989; Napier 1989).",
        "Then the system's score with respect to natural language competence becomes dependent on how well the system as a whole can elicit information from the expert system or the database, or can summarize the information in the message.",
        "Task-oriented black-box evaluations are useful and valid, and are certainly of primary concern to the end users who need the information, and do not really care how it is produced.",
        "But there are drawbacks in depending solely on this approach.",
