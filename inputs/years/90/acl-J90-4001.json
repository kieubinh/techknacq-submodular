        "In this paper' we present algorithms for handling three different sorts of anaphora within Slot Grammar (McCord 1980, 1989b, 1990).",
        "These algorithms are second-pass procedures that operate on the output of a Slot Grammar parser.",
        "The parser and the algorithms constituting the anaphora resolution component run in Prolog.",
        "In Section 2 we present a brief overview of Slot Grammar and the parser that implements it.",
        "This section also includes a description of an alternative network representation of parser output on which the algorithms operate.",
        "In Section 3 we propose an analysis of VP anaphora that involves applying rules of interpretation directly to S-structure (parsed surface structure) rather than to LF (logical form), as required by several recent accounts.",
        "We provide in Section 3.1 theoretical motivation for preferring our analysis to an LF treatment.",
        "In Section 3.2 we present a schematic statement of the algorithm that implements this analysis in Slot Grammar, and illustrate the algorithm with examples of its output.",
        "Section 4 is devoted to a syntactic filter on pronominal anaphora that identifies noncoreferential NP-pronoun pairs within a sentence.",
        "A more detailed presentation of the filter algorithm is given in Lappin and McCord (1990).",
        "Section 5 contains a rule for locating possible NP antecedents for anaphors (reflexive pronouns and reciprocals).",
        "The conjunction of the latter two algorithms has roughly the same extension as Chomsky's (1981, 1986a) binding theory.",
        "However, while the conditions of the binding theory are stated in terms of the configurational relation of c-corn-mand, the coreference filter and anaphor binding algorithm employ the head-complement structures defined by Slot Grammar.",
        "The three algorithms that make up the anaphora resolution component of Slot Grammar are fully modular in that they apply independently of each other.",
        "Any two algorithms in this set can be conjoined.",
        "Moreover, both the pronominal noncoreference filter and anaphor binding algorithms have been combined with the VP anaphora algorithm to construct an integrated system of anaphora resolution in which the two NP anaphora rules apply to the results of VP anaphora interpretation.3 In Section 6 we illustrate the operation of the integrated system with examples of the representations it generates."

        "The original work on Slot Grammar was done around 1976-1978 and appeared in McCord (1980).",
        "Recently, a new version (McCord 1989b, 1990) was developed in a logic programming framework, in connection with the machine translation system LMT (McCord 1989a, 1989c, 1989d).",
        "Slot Grammar is lexicalist and is dependency oriented.",
        "Every phrase has a head word (with a given word sense and morphosyntactic features).",
        "The constituents of a phrase besides the head word, also called the modifiers of the head, are obtained by \"filling\" slots associated with the head.",
        "Slots are symbols like subj, obj, and iobj representing grammatical relations, and are associated with a word (sense) in two ways.",
        "The lexical entry for the word specifies a set of complement slots, corresponding to logical arguments of the word sense, and the grammar specifies a set of adjunct slots for each part of speech.4 A complement slot can be filled at most once, and an adjunct slot can by default be filled any number of times.",
        "The phenomena treated by augmented phrase structure rules in some grammatical systems are treated modularly by several different types of rules in Slot Grammar.",
        "The most important type of rule is the (slot) filler rule, which gives conditions (expressed largely through unification) on the filler phrase and its relations to the higher phrase.",
        "Filler rules are stated (normally) without reference to conditions on order among constituents.",
        "But there are separately stated ordering rules.5 Slot/head ordering rules state conditions on the position (left or right) of the slot (filler) relative to the head word.",
        "Slot/slot ordering rules place conditions on the relative left-to-right order of (the fillers of) two slots.",
        "A slot is obligatory (not optional) if it must be filled, either in the current phrase or in a raised position through left movement or coordination.",
        "Adjunct slots are always optional.",
        "Complement slots are optional by default, but they may be specified to be obligatory in a particular lexical entry, or they may be so specified in the grammar by obligatory slot rules.",
        "Such rules may be unconditional or be conditional on the characteristics of the higher phrase.",
        "They also may specify that a slot is obligatory relative to the filling of another slot.",
        "For example, the direct object slot in English may be declared obligatory on the condition that the indirect object slot is filled by a noun phrase.",
        "One aim of Slot Grammar is to develop a powerful language-independent module, a \"shell,\" which can be used together with language-dependent modules, reducing the effort of writing grammars for new languages.",
        "The Slot Grammar shell module includes the parser, which is a bottom-up chart parser.",
        "It also includes most of the treatment of coordination, unbounded dependencies, controlled subjects, and punctuation.",
        "And the shell contains a system for evaluating parses, extending Heidorn's (1982) parse metric.",
        "The Slot Grammar evaluator is used not only for ranking final parses, as with Heidorn's, but also for pruning away unlikely partial analyses during parsing, thus reducing the problem of parse space explosion.",
        "Parse evaluation expresses preferences for close attachment, for choice of complements over adjuncts, and for parallelism in coordination.",
        "Although the shell contains most of the treatment of the above phenomena (coordination, etc.",
        "), a small part of their treatment is necessarily language dependent.",
        "A (language-specific) grammar can include for instance (1) rules for coordinating feature structures that override the defaults in the shell; (2) declarations of slots (called extraposer slots) that allow left extraposition of other slots out of their fillers; (3) language-specific rules for punctuation that override defaults; and (4) language-specific controls over parse evaluation that override defaults.",
        "Currently, Slot Grammars are being developed for English (ESG) by McCord, for Danish (DSG) by Arendse Bernth, and for German (GSG) by Ulrike Schwall.",

        "Our anaphora algorithms apply in a second pass to the parse output; the remainder of this section describes Slot Grammar syntactic analysis structures.",
        "A syntactic structure is a tree; each node of the tree represents a phrase in the sentence and has a unique head word.",
        "Formally, a phrase is represented by a term phrase(X,H,Sense,Features,SlotFrame,Ext,Mods), where the components are as follows.",
        "(1) X is a logical variable called the marker of the phrase.",
        "Unifications of the marker play a crucial role in the anaphora algorithms.",
        "(2) H is an integer representing the position of the head word of the phrase.",
        "This integer identifies the phrase uniquely, and is used in the anaphora algorithms as the way of referring to phrases.",
        "(3) Sense is the word sense of the head word.",
        "(4) Features is the feature structure of the head word and of the phrase.",
        "It is a logic term (not an attribute-value list), which is generally rather sparse in information, showing mainly the part of speech and inflectional features of the head word.",
        "(5) SlotFrame is the list of complement slots, each slot being in the internal form slot(Slot,Ob,X), where Slot is the slot name, Ob shows whether it is an obligatory form of Slot, and X is the slot marker.",
        "The slot marker is unified (essentially) with the marker of the filler phrase when the slot is filled, even remotely, as in left movement or coordination.",
        "Such unifications are important for the anaphora algorithms.",
        "(6) Ext is the list of slots that have been extraposed or raised to the level of the current phrase.",
