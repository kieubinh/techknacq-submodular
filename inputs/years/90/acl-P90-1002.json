        "The structure imposed upon spoken sentences by intonation seems frequently to be orthogonal to their traditional surface-syntactic structure.",
        "However, the notion of \"intonational structure\" as formulated by Pierrehumbert, Selkirk, and others, can be subsumed under a rather different notion of syntactic surface structure that emerges from a theory of grammar based on a \"Combinatory\" extension to Categotial Grammar.",
        "Interpretations of constituents at this level are in turn directly related to \"information struc-ture\", or discourse-related notions of \"theme\", \"rheum\", \"focus\" and \"presupposition\".",
        "Some simplifications appear to follow for the problem of integrating syntax and other high-level modules in spoken language systems.",
        "One quite normal prosody (b, below) for an answer to the following question (a) intuitively imposes the intonational structure indicated by the brackets (stress, marked in this case by raised pitch, is indicated by capitals): (1) a. I know that Alice prefers velvet.",
        "But what does MAry prefer?",
        "b.",
        "(MA-ry prefers) (CORduroy).",
        "Such a grouping is orthogonal to the traditional syntactic structure of the sentence.",
        "Intonational structure nevertheless remains strongly constrained by meaning.",
        "For example, contours imposing bracketings like the following are not allowed:",
        "(2) #(Three cats)(in ten prefer corduroy)",
        "•I am grateful to Steven Bird, Julia Hirschberg, Aravind Joshi, Mitch Marcus, Janet Pierrehumbert, and Bonnie Lynn Webber for comments and advice They are not to blame for any errors in the translation of their advice into the present form.",

        "DAAL03-89-00031.",
        "Halliday [6) observed that this constraint, which Selkirk [14] has called the \"Sense Unit Condition\", seems to follow from the function of phrasal intonation, which is to convey what will here be called \"information structure\" – that is, distinctions of focus, presupposition, and propositional attitude towards entities in the discourse model.",
        "These discourse entities are more diverse than mere nounphrase or propositional referents, but they do not include such non-concepts as \"in ten prefer corduroy.\"",
        "Among the categories that they do include are what Wilson and Sperber and E. Prince [13) have termed \"open propositions\".",
        "One way of introducing an open proposition into the discourse context is by asking a Wh-question.",
        "For example, the question in (1), What does Mary prefer?",
        "introduces an open proposition.",
        "As Jackendoff [7] pointed out, it is natural to think of this open proposition as a functional abstraction, and to express it as follows, using the notation of the A-calculus:",
        "(3) Ar [(prefer' x) maryl",
        "(Primes indicate semantic interpretations whose detailed nature is of no direct concern here.)",
        "When this function or concept is supplied with an argument corduroy', it reduces to give a proposition, with the same function argument relations as the canonical sentence:",
        "(4) (prefer' corduroy') maryi",
        "It is the presence of the above open proposition rather than some other that makes the intonation contour in (1)b felicitous.",
        "(That is not to say that its presence uniquely determines this response, nor that its explicit mention is necessary for interpreting the response.)",
        "These observations have led linguists such as Selkirk to postulate a level of \"intonational struc-ture\", independent of syntactic structure and re",
        "directionality of their arguments and the type of their result: (6) prefers := (SV V P)IN P : prefer'",
        "The category can be regarded as encoding the semantic type of their translation, which in the notation used here is identified by the expression to the right of the colon.",
        "Such functions can combine with arguments of the appropriate type and position by functional application:",
        "The involvement of two apparently uncoupled levels of structure in natural language grammar appears to complicate the path from speech to interpretation unreasonably, and to thereby threaten a number of computational applications in speech recognition and speech synthesis.",
        "It is therefore interesting to observe that all natural languages include syntactic constructions whose semantics is also reminiscent of functional abstraction.",
        "The most obvious and tractable class are Wh-constructions themselves, in which exactly the same fragments that can be delineated by a single intonation contour appear as the residue of the subordinate clause.",
        "Another and much more problematic class of fragments results from coordinate constructions.",
        "It is striking that the residues of wh-movement and conjunction reduction are also subject to something like a \"sense unit condition\".",
        "For example, strings like \"in ten prefer corduroy\" are not conjoinable: (5) *Three cats in twenty like velvet, and in ten prefer corduroy.",
        "Since coordinate constructions have constituted another major source of complexity for theories of natural language grammar, and also offer serious obstacles to computational applications, it is tempting to think that this conspiracy between syntax and prosody might point to a unified notion of structure that is somewhat different from traditional surface constituency."

        "(See [9], [18] and [19] for a discussion of the obvious problems for parsing written text that the presence of such \"spurious\" (i.e. semantically equivalent) derivations engenders, and for some ways they might be overcome.)",
        "An entirely unconstrained combinatory grammar would in fact allow any bracketing on a sentence, although the grammars we actually write for configurational languages like English are heavily constrained by local conditions.",
        "(An example might be a condition on the composition rule that is tacitly assumed below, forbidding the variable Y in the composition rule to be instantiated as NP, thus excluding constituents like *[at ihejv poi).",
        "The claim of the present paper is simply that particular surface structures that are induced by the specific combinatory grammar that are postulated to explain coordination in English subsume the intonational structures that are postulated by Pierrehumbert et al.",
        "to explain the possible intonation contours for sentences of English.",
        "More specifically, the claim is that that in spoken utterance, intonation helps to determine which of the many possible bracketings permitted by the combinatory syntax of English is intended, and that the interpretations of the constituents that arise from these derivations, far from being \"spurious\", are related to distinctions of discourse focus among the concepts and open propositions that the speaker has in mind.",
        "The proof of this claim lies in showing that the rules of combinatory grammar can be made sensitive to intonation contour, which limit their application in spoken discourse.",
        "We must also show that the major constituents of intonated utterances like (1)b, under the analyses that are permitted by any given intonation, correspond to the information structure of the context to which the intonation is appropriate, as in (a) in the example (1) with which the paper begins.",
        "This demonstration will be quite simple, once we have established the following notation for intonation contours.",
        "I shall use a notation which is based on the theory of Pierrehumbert [10], as modified in more recent work by Selkirk [14], Beckman and Pierrehumbert [1], [11], and Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg [12].",

        "The very obvious.",
        "As Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg point first of these tones or tone-sequences coincides with out, the latter tune seems to be used to mark some or the perceived major stress or stresses of the prosodic all of that part of the sentence expressing information phrase, while the second marks the righthand bound that the speaker believes to be novel to the hearer.",

        "It will help the exposi- the speaker assumes to be the subject of mutual intertion to augment Pierrehumbens notation with explicit est, and this particular tune marks a theme as novel prosodic phrase boundaries, using brackets.",

        "The reader may wonder at this point why we do not replace the category Theme by a functional category, say Utterance /Rheme, corresponding to its semantic type.",
        "The answer is that we do not want this category to combine with anything but a complete rheme.",
        "In particular, it must not combine with a function into the category Rheme by functional composition.",

        "We next define the various boundary tones as arguments to these functions, as follows:",
        "(As usual, we ignore for present purposes the distinction between intermediate and intonational phrase boundaries.)",
        "Finally, we accomplish the effect of interpolation of other parts of the tune by assigning the following polymorphic category to all elements bearing no tone specification, which we will represent as the tone 0: Syntactic combination can then be made subject to the following simple restriction: (21) The Prosodic Constituent Condition: Combination of two syntactic categories via a syntactic combinatory rule is only allowed if their prosodic categories can also combine.",
        "(The prosodic and syntactic combinatory rules need not be the same).",
        "This principle has the sole effect of excluding certain derivations for spoken utterances that would be allowed for the equivalent written sentences.",
        "For example, consider the derivations that it permits for example (16) above.",
        "The rule of forward composition is allowed to apply to the words Fred and ate, because the prosodic categories can combine (by functional application):",
        "The category X/x of the null tone allows intonational phrasal tunes like L-I-H* LH% tune to spread across any sequence that forms a grammatical constituent according to the combinatory grammar.",
        "For example, if the reply to the same question What did Fred eat?",
        "is FRED must have eaten the BEANS, then the tune will typically be spread over Fred must have eaten ..., as in the following (incomplete) derivation, in which much of the syntactic and semantic detail has been omitted in the interests of brevity:",

        "Sentences like the above, including marked theme and rheme expressed as two distinct intonational/intermediate phrases are by that token unambiguous as to their information structure.",
        "However, sentences him the following, which in Pierrehumberts terms bear a single intonational phrase, are much more ambiguous as to the division that they Convey between theme and rheme: (25) I read a book about CORduroy 14* IAL% ) Such a sentence is notoriously ambiguous as to the open proposition it presupposes, for it seems equally apropriate as a response to any of the following ques",
        "The division of the utterance into an open proposition constituting the theme and an argument constituting the rheme is appropriate to the context established in (16).",
        "Moreover, the theory permits no other derivation for this intonation contour.",
        "Of course, repeated application of the composition rule, as in (23), would allow the L+H* LH% contour to spread further, as in (FRED must have eatenXthe BEANS).",
        "In contrast, the parallel derivation is forbidden by the prosodic constituent condition for the alternative intonation contour on (15).",
        "Instead, the following derivation, excluded for the previous example, is now",
        "c. (IXread a book about CORduroy) It seems that we shall miss a generalisation concerning the relation of intonation to discourse information unless we extend Pierrehumberts theory very slightly, to allow null intermediate phrases, without pitch accents, expressing unmarked themes.",
        "Since the boundaries of such intermediate phrases are not explicitly marked, we shall immediately allow all of the above analyses for (26).",
        "Such a modification to the theory can be introduced by the following rule, which nondeterministically allows certain constituents bearing the null tone to become a theme: (29) E X/x Theme The symbol E is a variable ranging over syntactic categories that are (leftward- or rightward looking) S\\IP:eatqthe beans') Theme S: eat,(the, beans') fred' Utterance No other analysis is allowed for (25).",
        "Again, the 3.4 derivation divides the sentence into new and given information consistent with the context given in the example.",
        "The effect of the derivation is to annotate the entire predicate as an L+H* LH%.",
        "It is emphasised that this does not mean that the tone is spread, but that the whole constituent is marked for the corresponding discourse function – roughly, as contrastive given, or theme.",
        "The finer grain information that it is the object that is contrasted, while the verb is given, resides in the tree itself.",

        "It therefore seems most unlikely that intonational contour can be identified in isolation from word recognition.12 What the isomorphism between syntactic structure and intonational structure does mean is that simply structured modular processors which use both sources of information at once can be more easily devised.",
        "Such an architecture may reasonably be expected to simplify the problem of resolving local structural ambiguity in both domains.",
        "For example, a syntactic analysis that is so closely related to the structure of the signal should be easier to use to \"filter\" the ambiguities arising from lexical recognition.",
        "However, it is probably more important that the constituents that arise under this analysis are also semantically interpreted.",
        "The interpretations are directly related to the concepts, referents and themes that have been established in the context of discourse, say as the result of a question.",
        "These discourse entities are in turn directly reducible to the structures involved in knowledge-representation and inference.",
        "The direct path from speech to these higher levels of analysis offered by the present theory should therefore make it possible to use more effectively the much more powerful resources of semantics and domain-specific knowledge, including knowledge of the discourse, to filter low-level ambiguities, using larger grammars of a more expressive class than is currently possible.",
        "While vast improvements in purely bottom-up word recognition can be expected to continue, such filtering is likely to remain crucial to successful speech processing by machine, and appears to be characteristic of all levels of human processing, for both spoken and written language.",
        "Such an architecture is considerably simpler than the one shown earlier in Figure 1.",
        "Phonological form maps via the rules of combinatory grammar directly onto a surface structure, whose highest level constituents correspond to intonational constituents, annotated as to their discourse function.",
        "Surface structure therefore subsumes intonational structure.",
        "It also subsumes information structure, since the translations of those surface constituents correspond to the entities and open propositions which constitute the topic or theme (if any) and the comment or theme.",
        "These in \"The inclusion in the full grammar of further rules of type-raising in addition to the subject rule discussed above means that the set of categories over which E ranges is larger than it is possible to reveal in the present paper.",
        "(For example, it includes object complements).",
        "See the earlier papers and [17] for discussion.",
        "15 32 This is no bad thing.",
        "The converse also applies: intonation contour effects the acoustic realisation of words, particularly with respect to timing.",
        "it is therefore likely that the benefits of combining intonational recognition and word recognition will be mutual."
