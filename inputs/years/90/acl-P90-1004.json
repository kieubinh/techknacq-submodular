        "Difficulty in resolving structural ambiguity involving PPs arises because of the great variety of syntactic structures which PPs can modify and the varying distances PPs may be from the constituents with which they are associated.",
        "Simple schemes to resolve attachments utilize information drawn from reported tendencies in the human parsing mechanism, such as the preference for PPs to attach to constituents that immediately precede them.",
        "It is always tempting to utilize such schemes in computer NL processors because they provide clear models for resolution that are both easy and cheap (in terms of steps involved) to implement.",
        "The problem with these schemes is that they can easily be made to fail by manipulating parameters that they 'know' nothing about, such as semantics, context, and intonation.",
        "Clearly, more elaborate schemes for attachment resolution are needed, but what these schemes should contain and how they should be implemented remain open.",
        "This study attempts to find answers to the question of how a computer program should resolve attachment by examining naturally occurring PP attachments in a typed dialogue domain drawn from a study by Brunner, Whittemore, Ferrara, and Hsu (1989).",
        "Various previously developed theories of PP attachment are tested against the data to see how well they predict correct attachments of PPs in the typed dialogues.",

        "In response to this the Wizard, who had access to both computerized and hard-copy travel data, was instructed to engage in constructive and free-form dialogue with the participant in order to best obtain the reservations mid flight information required by them.",
        "Each dialogue took one and a half hours to complete, allowing enough time for about 70 sentences per dialogue",
        "for a total of 910 sentences.",
        "In another study, Whittemore, Ferrara, and Brunner (1989) quantify the occurrence of PPs in the 13 dialogues in terms of the syntactic types to which they attach and the overall syntactic environments in which they appear.",
        "Data is presented in terms of Tension Sites to illustrate possible syntactic attachment interpretations and actual interpretations that occurred.",
        "For instance in the sentence John eats his bananas in his backyard, potential attachment ambiguity lies in the fact that the PP in his backyard can attach to the noun phrase object has bananas or to the verb eats.",
        "Such positions were referred to as Tension Sites.",
        "All such Tension Sites for sentences with PPs were recorded along with actual attachments.",
        "Some instances were simple as in the example above with only a minimum of Tension Sites, while others were quite involved and had up to seven Tension Sites in which a verb and np-object along with the objects of five other prepositions were available as attachment sites.",

        "RA was used as the arbitrator whenever there remained an intra-conflict in a preferencing algorithm (and sometimes when there was inter-conflict between schemes).",
        "The use of plausthitity to talk about relationships between verbs or nouns and associated PPs was thought to be a necessary notion in that simple searches for only prepositions were deemed to be too weak of a notion.",
        "When verb or noun LP was at work, nouns and verbs sought out PPs (as opposed to single prepositions) that as a. whole had some attribute(s) necessary to fulfill some semantic requirements.",
        "Sometimes PPs also had to be concluded to be of a particular type in order to search out a unique kind of noun or verb.",
        "Apparently, PP Lexical Preferencing allowed PPs that were temporal or locative in nature to look for nouns and verbs that bore temporal or locative characteristics, respectively.",
        "Referential Success in its pure sense was a poor predictor of attachments.",
        "However, the related notions of presupposition regarding definites, indefinites, etc.",
        "were good predictors of at taclinleiit for a small number of PPs.",
        "Finally, a more cognitive finding resulting from the study was the great predictability of attachment, suggesting that there is something about the typed interactive mode of communication that constrains the possibilities on attachment such that attachment always goes with the unmarked case.",
        "There are at least three pressures that may help to make these constraints come about.",
        "One is the",
        "lack of the spoken element which carries with it intonation patterns and variations in pausing that can influence the ways that one parses.",
        "One must rely on only the cues available by written means to aid in disambiguating attachments.",
        "Secondly, the added comparative slowness at which interlocutors type and the resulting tendency to leave out unnecessary punctuation marks often useful in disambiguating text makes yet a further constrained subset.",
        "Thirdly, a speaker may be aware of the time lag (hence taxation on memory) that exists between typing some modified element and its associated PP.",
        "The lag may have an effect on how such pairs are presented.",
        "Prominent ways of highlighting the links may depend more on notions such as LP or RA that might not be needed as much in other modes of communication.",
        "These factors together may make it necessary for participants in typed interactive communication to rely on a set of default structures that each can cue on easily.",
        "Acknowledgements We wish to thank Joyce Conner for her time and energy spent in collecting and analyzing the data, Melissa Macpherson for her insights into the notions presented in the paper, and Laurie Whittemore and Jim Barnett for their editing efforts.",
        "Also, much of the work on this paper was carried out when Greg Whittemore and Kathy Ferrara were employees of MCC, and thanks goes to MCC personnel, particularly Elaine Rich, who made it possible for the study to be performed."
