        "In computing meaning representations from natural language, ambiguities arise at each level.",

        "Sometimes, syntactic ambiguities are resolved during semantic processing, but often remain even through coherence analysis at the discourse level.",
        "Finally, after syntactic, semantic, and discourse processing, the resulting meaning structure may still have multiple interpretations.",
        "For example, a news item from Associated Press, November 22, 1989, quoted a rescued hostage, The foreigners were taken to the Estado Mayor, army headquarters.",

        "Blood had been flown to Albuquerque, but further thought suggested that \"here in my room\" probably referred to some sleeping section in the army headquarters.",
        "But despite the guess, ambiguity remains.",
        "In a previous paper [Seo and Simmons 1989] we argued that a syntactic graph – the union of all parse trees – was a superior representation for further semantic processing.",
        "It is a concise list of syntactically labeled triples, supported by an exclusion matrix to show what pairs of triples are incompatible.",
        "It is an easily accessible representation that provides succeeding semantic and discourse processes with complete information from the syntactic analysis.",
        "Here, we present methods for transforming the syntactic graph to a functional graph (one using syntactic functions, SUBJECT, OBJECT, I-OBJECT etc.)",
        "and for transforming the functional graph to a semantic graph of case relations."

        "Most existing semantic processors for natural language systems (NLS) have depended on a strategy of selecting a single parse tree from a syntactic analysis component (actual or imagined).",
        "If semantic testing failed on that parse, the system would select another – backing up if using a top-down parser, or selecting another interpretation",
        "from an all-paths chart.",
        "Awareness has grown in recent years that this strategy is not the best.",
        "Attempts by Marcus [1989] to use a deterministic (look-ahead) tactic to ensure a single parse without back-up, fail to account for common, garden-path sentences.",
        "In general, top-down parsers with backup have unpleasant implications for complexity, while efficient all-paths parsers limited to complexity 0(N3) [Aho and Ullman 1972, Early 1970, Tomita 1985] can find all parse trees in little more time than a single one.",
        "If we adopt the economical parsing strategy of obtaining an all-paths parse, the question remains, how best to use the parsing information for subsequent processing.",
        "Approaches by Barton and Berwick [1985] and Rich et.",
        "al.",
        "[1987] among others have suggested what Rich has called ambiguity procrastination in which a system provides multiple potential syntactic interpretations and postpones a choice until a higher level process provides sufficient information to make a decision.",
        "Syntactic representations in these systems are incomplete and may not always represent possible parses.",
        "Tomita [1985] suggested using a shared-pacIced-forest as an economical method to represent all and only the parses resulting from an all-paths analysis.",
        "Unfortunately, the resulting tree is difficult for a person to read, and must be accessed by complex programs.",
        "It was in this context that we [Seo and Simmons 1989] decided that a graph composed of the union of parse trees from an all-paths parser would form a superior representation for subsequent semantic processing."

This saves many operations which must be done in other approaches which check syntactic trees one by one to make a semantic structure.",

        "The redundant arc was not dependent on subj(16) (in Figure 3) and thus remains in the semantic graph.",
        "The immediate consequence is simply a redundant arc that will not do harm; the implication is that the exclusion matrix cannot filter certain arcs that are indirectly dependent on certain forbidden interpretations.",
        "The utility of the resultant semantic graph can be appreciated by close study of Figure 5.",
        "The graph directly answers the following questions, (assuming they have been parsed into case notation): • Where does the monkey live?",
        "1. in tropical jungles near rivers and streams, 2. near rivers and streams, 3. in tropical jungles near rivers, 4. in tropical jungles.",
        "• Does the monkey live in jungles?",
        "Yes, by agt(1) and in(53) which are not exclusive with each other.",
        "• Does the monkey live in rivers?",
        "No, because in(52) is exclusive with conj(lO), and in(SS) is pointing to jungles not rivers.",
        "• Does the monkey live near jungles?",
        "No, because near(50) and conj(12) are exclusive, so no path from live through near(50) can go through eonj(12) to reach jungle, and the other path from live through near(51) goes to rivers which has no exiting path to jungle.",
        "Thus, by matching paths from the question through the graph, and ensuring that no arc in the answering path is forbidden to co-occur with any other, questions can be answered directly from the graph.",
        "In conclusion, we have presented a computational method for directly computing semantic graphs from syntactic graphs.",
        "The most crucial and economical aspect of the computation is the capability of applying tests and transformations directly to the graph rather than applying the rules to one interpretation, then another, and another, etc.",
        "When a semantic filtering rule rejects one implausible relation, then pruning all dependent relations of that relation directly from the syntactic graph has the effect of excluding substantially many syntactic interpretations from further consideration.",
        "An algorithm for finding such dependent relations is presented.",
        "In thispaper, we did not consider the multiple word senses which may cause more semantic ambiguities than we have illustrated.",
        "Incorporating and minimizing word sense ambiguities is part of our continuing research.",
        "We are also currently investigating how to integrate semantic graphs of previous sentences with the current one, to maintain a continuous context whose ambiguity is successively reduced by additional incoming sentences."
