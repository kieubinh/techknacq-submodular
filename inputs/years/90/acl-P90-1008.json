        "There are several reasons why developing any semantics for focusing subjuncts is a difficult task.",
        "First, focusing subjuncts are 'syntactically promiscuous'.",
        "They can adjoin to any maximal projection.",
        "They can occur at almost any position in a sentence.",
        "Second, focusing subjuncts are also 'semantically promiscuous'.",
        "They may focus (draw attention to) almost any constituent.",
        "They can precede or follow the item that they focus, and need not be adjacent to this item.",
        "The focus need only be contained somewhere within the syntactic sister of the focusing subjunct.",
        "Because of this behavior, it is difficult to determine the intended syntactic argument (adjunct) and focus of a focusing subjunct.",
        "Sentences `The work described in this paper was done at the University of Toronto.",
        "such as those in (1) can be ambiguous, even when uttered aloud with intonational effects.'",
        "1.",
        "John could also (SEE) his wife from the doorway (as well as being able to talk to her).",

        "4.",
        "John could also (see his wife from the DooRway) (as well as being able to do other things).",
        "Third, the location of intonational stress has an important effect on the meaning of a sentence containing a focusing subjunct.",
        "Sentences may be partly disambiguated by intonational stress: interpretations in which stress falls outside the intended focus of the focusing subjunct are impossible.",
        "For example, the sentence (2) *John could also see (his wife) from the DOORway.",
        "is impossible on the indicated reading, since stress on door cannot confer focus on his wife.",
        "On the other hand, stress does not help to disambiguate between readings such as (1.3) and (1.4).",
        "Fourth, focusing subjuncts don't fit into the slot-filler semantics that seem adequate for handling many other sentence elements (see Section 1.3).",
        "At best, their semantic effect is to transform the semantic representation of the constituent they modify in some predictable compositional way (Hirst, 1987, p. 72).",
        "Finally, focusing subjuncts carry pragmatic \"baggage\".",
        "The meaning of a focusing subjunct includes distinct asserted and non-asserted parts (Horn, 1969), (Karttunen and Peters, 1979).",
        "For example, 1ln the example sentences in this paper, small capitals denote intonational stress.",

        "• Focus and stress information can be used to advantage in a. semantic interpreter.",
        "• The hypothesis that focus may be optionally percolated to a parent node from a daughter explains the scope ambiguities observed in the interpretation of focusing subjuncts.",
        "• Rooth's method of obtaining the translation of a focusing subjunct by using p-sets to select \"domains of quantification\" can be adapted to translating a sentence into a frame representation.",
        "• Treating focusing sub juncts as operators on sentential semantic forms makes this translation possible.",
