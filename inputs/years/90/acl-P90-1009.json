        "A goal of natural language research is to provide a computer model capable of understanding English sentences.",
        "One approach to constructing this model requires the generation of an unambiguous internal representation for each sentence before attempting to represent subsequent sentences.",
        "Natural language systems that attempt to guess the intended meaning of a sentence without considering subsequent sentences usually make no provision for recovery from incorrect guesses since that would require storing information about the ambiguity of the sentence.",
        "Hence, this approach may require the processing of several sentences before enough information is available to determine the intended meaning of the sentence being represented.",
        "However, in order to make the inferences necessary to resolve some ambiguities, some internal representation is needed for both the current sentence as well as subsequent sentences.",
        "A more powerful approach is to leave the ambiguity unresolved in an intermediate representation until the necessary information has been processed.",
        "We adopt this second approach, which advocates mapping parsed sentences into an intermediate level of representation called logical form *This paper contains results from the author's thesis in the Computer Science Department at Brown -University.",

        "Pronouns and other noun phrases can be attached to a definite noun phrase in different ways.",
        "First, consider the effect embedded pronouns have on definite noun phrases.",
        "While simple definites (which are not intrasentential anaphors) seem to act like constants when they occur in a sentence with a universal noun phrase (e.g., 5a), definite noun phrases with embedded pronouns often cannot be described as constants (e.g., 5b).",

        "In this case, the mother who cares for every boy denotes one specific mother.",

        "Each definite function is defined by a unique name (i.e., def with a unique integer appended to it), a list of arguments, and a restriction.",
        "The restriction of a definite function is derived from the words following the determiner.",

        "Because a definite functicai has a unique name, we can differentiate two occurrences of the same definite noun phrase, in contrast to definite descriptions [Rus711 (for more information on the shortcomings of definite descriptions and definite quantifiers, see [Har90; Hin85]).",

        "The argument list of the function consists of the variables y and .z3.",
        "Notice that the pronoun his is also represented as a function of y and z.",
        "Anything that can affect the pronoun his picture will also affect the meaning of the definite noun phrase.",
        "Because a definite function is a composite representation for all possible meanings of a definite noun phrase, we must restrict the function in certain ways before a final interpretation for the sentence is available (or before deriving the meaning of an elided sentence from a trigger verb phrase containing a definite function, as discussed in [Har90]).",
        "The initial representation of a definite places an upper and lower bound on the definite's behavior.",
        "The lower bound is a constant, while the upper bound is the initial representation.",

        "If the definite is used anaphorically, we equate the definite function with some value consistent with its antecedent.",
        "Otherwise, we apply a constraint that limits the argument list of the function to include only necessary variables.",
        "If a definite is used anaphorically, it can be equated with some value depending on its antecedent (just like pronoun functions in [Har88]).",
        "For example, if the antecedent of a definite noun phrase occurs in another sentence, we would equate the definite function with a discourse entity.",
        "Antecedents for definite noun phrases can also occur",
        "within the same sentence.",
        "An intrasentential reference to an antecedent requires the definite function to have an argument list compatible with the representation of the antecedent4.",
        "Consider the initial representation of a sentence containing a potentially anaphoric definite shown in 9.",
        "Suppose the antecedent for his is every man and the antecedent for the old lady is his another.",
        "Then we can augment the logical form, as shown in 10.",
        "4It is unusual for a definite to have an antecedent corresponding to one of its arguments unless the variable corresponds to a quantified noun phrase which is not embedded in a relative clause but is embedded in another noun phrase.",
        "When the antecedent is represented as a function, its argument list must be a subset of (or it must be possible to limit it to be a subset of) the arguments of the anaphoric definite for the equality to be asserted.",
        "This example would be very difficult for an approach that uses either definite descriptions or definite quantifiers.",
        "Either approach would represent the old lady in a way equivalent to replacing the representation by a constant, because of uniqueness.",
        "Hence, any update of those representations to indicate the anaphora would violate formal consistency.",
        "Our approach, however, can easily handle the example.",
        "The other way to pinpoint a definite function applies once antecedents for embedded pronouns are known and once we know whether quantifiers corresponding to embedded quantified noun phrases (not embedded in relative clauses attached to noun phrases) should distribute over the definite.",
        "Consider the initial representation of the sentence in 8.",
        "The definite function def.'",
        "is a function of all of the variables that can potentially cause it to change.",
        "However, once we know the antecedent for its embedded pronoun, the argument list of the function should be limited.",
        "To limit the argument list, we make use of the insights gained from definite descriptions.",
        "Because of the uniqueness assumption, any definite description that does not contain variables bound by outside quantifiers acts like a constant.",
        "On the other hand, if a pronoun embedded in a definite description adopts the behavior of a universally quantified variable, then the definite description will change what it denotes depending on the instantiation of that variable.",
        "Hence, we conclude that a definite function should only change as a function of those variables bound by operators outside of its restriction (ignoring its own argument list).",
        "Once antecedent and embedded quantifier information is available, we can limit the argument list to precisely those arguments that are bound by operators outside of the restriction.",
        "If a pronoun function in the restriction of the definite function is equated with a variable bound outside its restriction or with another function which must be a function of a certain variable (based on its own restriction), then the argument must be retained.",
        "Additionally, other arguments that are free in the restriction must be retained (these correspond to embedded quantified noun phrases whose quantifiers are moved out of the restriction).",
        "Once we know the necessary arguments, we replace the original function by a new function over those arguments.",
        "By using this argument reduction constraint, we limit the initial composite representation of a definite noun phrase to its final meaning (given pronoun and quantifier information).",
        "Consider how we would limit the function (defi y z) from example 8 following pronoun resolution.",
        "If we decide that the antecedent of his is every boy, then we would update the logical form, as shown in 11,",
        "By using our argument reduction constraint, we can replace the function (clefi y z) by a function of z (since (his2 y z) is replaced with the variable r), as shown in 12.",
        "Equality here is equivalent to replacing the first function with the second value.",
        "Because of this fact and because of the meaning of the vertical bar in the restriction of the function, this representation can be simplified as shown in 13.",
        "To handle the readings where his is anaphorically dependent on other noun phrases, our approach would be similar.",
        "Our representation of pronouns has several strengths.",
        "First, the representation provides useful information to a semantic routine concerning possible intrasentential antecedents for the definite.",
        "Argument lists limit what can be the antecedent along with other factors like number and gender agreement and antecedent limitations particular to definites.",
        "To demonstrate a strength of this approach, consider the initial representation of the following sentence:",
        "Here the meaning of her response depends on the antecedent for her.",
        "What then are legal antecedents for her in this sentence?",
        "Certainly, the teacher is a fine candidate, but what about his mother.",
        "We cannot tell immediately whether his mother can be the antecedent for her.",
        "If the antecedent for his is every student, then his mother cannot be the antecedent for her.",
        "This accessibility problem results because the universal in the relative clause (i.e., every student) cannot have scope over her response, hence, his mother is not a good antecedent for her.",
        "Notice that (hers x w) is not immediately compatible with the representation for his mother (i.e., (def3 x y z)).",
        "Before we can assert that his mother is the antecedent for her we must pinpoint the meaning of that noun phrase, that is, we mast determine the antecedent for his.",
        "Then depending on our choice, the final meaning of his mother may or may riot be accessible to the pronoun.",
        "Hence, we can explain why some definites in relative clauses are accessible to pronouns in the matrix sentence and others are not.",
        "C-command does not accurately predict when definites are accessible as antecedents for anaphoric expressions.",
        "This is not surprising, given the fact that the final meaning of a definite determines its accessibility, and determining this meaning may require resolving pronouns and sc.oping ambiguities.",
        "In this paper, we have introduced a composite representation for definite noun phrases with two ways to update their meaning as more information becomes available.",
        "This approach is consistent with the three computational constraints discussed in section 2, and also provides a good model of definite behavior.",
        "We refer the reader to Harper [Har90] for discussion of a wider variety of examples.",

        "Neither representation allows us to handle intrasentential anaphoric definites while obeying our computational constraints.",
        "However, the in-place definite description is excellent for modeling definite subjects in verb phrase ellipsis and for capturing the behaviors of distributive definite noun phrases.",
        "On the other hand, a definite quantifier is not a good representation for a definite subject in verb phrase ellipsis (the strict meaning of The cat wants its toy.",
        "The dog does too cannot be provided because quantifiers do not have scope across sentences).",
        "In fact, to make the definite quantifier a feasible representation, we would have to make the binding properties of a definite quantifier different than the binding properties of a universal.",
        "Hornstein [Hor84] suggests that definite quantifiers have different binding properties than universals.",
        "His approach fails to consider how the process of pinpointing the meaning of a definite affects its ability to bind a pronoun.",
        "For more discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches, see Harper [Har90].",
        "Other approaches to handling definites include the work of [11ei82; Kam81; Rob87; Kle87; PP88].",
        "Each approach differs from ours both in scope and emphasis.",
        "We build an intermediate meaning for a sentence using only the constraints dictated by the syntax and local semantics and incrementally update it as we process contextual information.",
        "The work of Pollack and Periera [PP88] also attempts to gradually build up a final interpretation of a sentence using their semantic and pragmatic discharge interpretation rules.",
        "However, our representation of a definite noun phrase locally stores information about those quantifiers in the sentence that can potentially quantify over it, while Pollack and Periera's representation does not.",
        "The approaches of {Hei82; Kam81; Rob87; K1e87] require a large amount of contextual information before the representation of a sentence can be given (leading to a violation of our constraints)."
