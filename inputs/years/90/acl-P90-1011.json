        "There is something special about performative sentences, sentences such as \"I promise to return\": uttering them makes them true.",
        "How and when is this possible?",
        "Not all verbs can be uttered in the first-person present tense and thereby make the sentence true.",
        "In general, the successful verbs seem to correspond to those naming illocution-ary acts, but not to perlocutionary ones such as \"frighten.\" But, even some illocutionary verbs cannot be used performatively: e.g., \"I lie to you that I didn't steal your watch\" is self-defeating [12].",
        "So, which verbs can be use performatively, and in Searle's words [10], \"how do performatives work?\" Any theory of illocutionary acts needs to provide a solution to questions such as these.",
        "But, such questions are not merely of theoretical interest.",
        "Natural language database question-answering systems have been known to receive performative utterances [14], dialogue systems that recognize illocutionary acts (e.g., [6]) will need to infer the correct illocutionary force to function properly, dialogue translation systems [5] will have to cope with markers of illocutionary",
        "force that function performatively (e.g., sentence final particles in Japanese), and proposals for \"agent-oriented programming languages\" [7, 13], as well as Winograd and Flores' [15] COORDINATOR system, are based on performative communication.",
        "For all these systems, it is important to understand the semantics and pragmatics of such communicative acts, especially their intended effects.",
        "To do so, one needs a full theory of illocutionary acts, and a format theory that predicts how utterances can be made true by uttering them.",
        "The currently accepted theory of performatives is that they are in fact assertions, hence true or false, and additionally constitute the performance of the named illocutionary act, in the same way as an indirect reading of an illocutionary act is obtained from the direct illocutionary act.",
        "That is, the named illocutionary act is derived from the assertion as an indirect speech act.",
        "The most compelling defense of this performative-as-assertion analysis that we are aware is that of Bach and Hat-nish [1], who address many of the linguistic phenomena discussed by Sadock [9], but who, we believe, have misa,nalyzed indirect speech acts.",
        "However, in a recent paper, Searle [10] forcefully criticizes the performative-as-assertion approach on the following grounds:",
        "• Assertions commit the speaker to the truth of what is asserted • Performative statements are self-referential • \"An essential feature of any illocutionary act is the intention to perform that act\"",
        "Searle claims that accounts based on self-referential assertions are \"doomed to failure\" because one cannot show that being committed to having the intention to be performing the named illocutionary act entails that one in fact has that intention.",
        "Moreover, he questions that one should derive the named illocutionary act from an assertion, rather than vice-versa, However, Searle has imparted into Bach and Harnish's theory his notion of assertions as commitments to the truth without providing a precise analysis of commitment.",
        "What may be doomed to failure is any attempt to base an analysis of performatives on such a theory of assertions.",
        "This paper provides a formal analysis of performatives that treats them as declarative utterances, not initially as assertions, does not succumb to Searle's criticisms, and does not require an entirely new class of illocutionary acts (the \"declarations\") as Searle and Vanderveken [121 have proposed.",
        "The analysis is offered as another adequacy criterion for our theory of illocutionary acts.",
        "That theory, more fully explicated in [3], is based on an analysis of the individual rational balance agents maintain among their beliefs, goals, intentions, commitments, and actions [2].",
        "As desiderata for the theory of performatives, we demonstrate that the analysis meets two properties:",
        "• A sincere utterance of \"I request you to open the door\" is both a request and an assertion, yet neither illocutionary act characterization is derived from the other.",
        "• \"I lie that the door is open\" is self-defeating.",
        "Briefly, the ability to capture performatives is met almost entirely because such utterances are treated as indicative mood utterances, and because illocutionary acts are defined as attempts.",
        "Since attempts depend on the speaker's beliefs and goals, and these mental states are introspect able in our theory if a speaker sincerely says, for example, \"I request you to open the door,\" he must believe he did the act with the requisite beliefs and goals.",
        "Hence, the utterance is a request.",
        "To meet the desiderata we need first to present, albeit briefly, the theory of rational interaction, the treatment of declarative mood utterances, and then the illocutionary act definitions for requesting and asserting.",
        "Finally, we combine the various analyses natural language processor's task by making explicit the intended word sense of the action, and by reducing the combinatorics inherent in determining the attachment of the prepositional phrases."

        "Requesting works well as a performative verb because requesting requires only that the agent has made an attempt, and need not have succeeded in getting the hearer to do the requested action, or even to form the right beliefs.",
        "Some verbs cannot be used performatively, such as \"frighten,\" because they require something beyond a mere attempt.",
        "Renee, such verbs would name action expressions that required a particular proposition p be true after the utterance event.",
        "When the utterance event does not guarantee such a p, the use of the performative verb will not be possible.",
        "On the other hand, certain utterances (performative or not), when performed by the right people in the right circumstances, make certain institutional facts hold.",
        "So, when a clergyman, judge, or ship captain says \"I now pronounce you husband and wife,\" the man and woman in question are married.",
        "In our framework, there would be a domain axiom whose antecedent characterizes the circumstances, participants, and nature of the utterance event, and whose consequent asserts that an institutional fact is true.",
        "The axiom is justified not by the nature of rational action, but by the existence of an institution.",
        "Such utterances could be",
        "made with a performative prefix provided such attempts are made into successes by the institution.",
        "This paper has shown that treating performative utterances as declarative sentences is a viable analysis, in spite of Searle's criticisms.",
        "The performative use of an illocutionary verb is self-guaranteeing when the named illocutionary act consists in the speaker's making an attempt to make public his mental state.",
        "In such casts, if the speaker thinks he has done so, then he has.",
        "However, we do not derive the named illocutionary act from the assertion, nor vice-versa.",
        "Instead, both derivations may be made from the utterance event, but the assertive one is in fact harder to obtain as it has extra conditions that need to be satisfied."
