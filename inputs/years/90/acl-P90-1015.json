        "This paper aims to provide a psychologically plausible mechanism for putting the knowledge which a speaker has of the syntax of a language, the competence grammar, to use.",
        "The representation of knowledge of language I assume is that specified by Government Binding (GB) Theory introduced in [Chomsky, 1981].",
        "GB, as a competence theory, emphatically does not specify the nature of the language processing mechanism.",
        "In fact, \"proofs\" that transformational grammar is inadequate as a linguistic theory due to various performance measures are fundamentally flawed since they suppose a particular connection between the grammar and parser [Berwick and Weinberg, 1984].",
        "Nonetheless, it seems desirable to maintain a fairly direct connection between the linguistic competence and",
        "its processing.",
        "Otherwise, claims of the psychological reality of this particular conception of competence become essentially vacuous since they cannot be falsified but for the data on which they are founded, i.e. grammaticality judgments.",
        "Thus, in building a model of language processing, I would like to posit as direct a link as is possible between linguistic competence and the operations of the parser while still maintaining certain desirable computational properties.",
        "What are the computational properties necessary for psychological plausibility?",
        "Since human syntactic processing is an effortless process, we should expect that it take place efficiently, perhaps in linear time since sentences do not become more difficult to process simply as a function of their length.",
        "Determinism, as proposed by Marcus [1980], seems desirable as well.",
        "In addition, the mechanism should operate in an incremental fashion.",
        "Incrementality is evidenced in the human language processor in two ways.",
        "As we hear a sentence, we build up semantic representations without waiting until the sentence is complete.",
        "Thus, the semantic processor should have access to syntactic representations prior to an utterance's completion.",
        "Additionally, we are able to perceive ungrammaticality in sentences almost immediately after the ill formedness occurs.",
        "Thus, our processing mechanism should mimic this early detection of ungrammatical input.",
        "Unfortunately, a parser with the most transparent relationship to the grammar, a \"parsing as theorem proving\" approach as proposed by [Johnson, 1988] and [Stabler, 1990], does not fare well with respect to our computational desiderata.",
        "It suffers from the legacy of the computational properties of first order theorem proving, most notably undecidability, and is thus inadequate for our purposes.",
        "The question, then, is how much we must retreat from this direct instantiation so that we can maintain the requisite properties.",
        "In this paper, I attempt to provide",
        "an answer.",
        "I propose a parsing model which represents the principles of the grammar in a fairly direct manner, yet preserves efficiency and incrementality.",
        "The model depends upon two key ideas.",
        "First, I utilize the insight of [Abney, 1986] in the use of licensing relations as the foundation for GB parsing.",
        "By generalizing Abney's formulation of licensing.",
        "I can directly encode and enforce a particular class of the principles of GB theory and in so doing efficiently build phrase structure.",
        "The principles expressible through licensing are not all of those posited by GB.",
        "Thus, the others must be enforced using a different mechanism.",
        "Unfortunately, the unbounded size of the tree created with licensing makes any such mechanism computationally abhorrent In order to remedy this, I make use of the Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) framework [Joshi, 1985] to limit the working space of the parser.",
        "As the parser proceeds, its working structure is bounded in size.",
        "If this bound is exceeded, we reduce this structure by one of the operations provided by the TAG formalism, either substitution or adjunction.",
        "This results in two structures, each of which form independent elementary trees.",
        "Interestingly, the domain of locality imposed by a TAG elementary tree appears to be sufficient for the expression of the remaining grammatical principles.",
        "Thus, we can check for the satisfaction of the remaining grammatical principles in just the excised piece of structure and then send it off for semantic interpretation.",
        "Since this domain of constraint checking is bounded in size, this process is done efficiently.",
        "This mechanism also works in an incremental fashion."

        "Since many grammatical constraints are concerned with the licensing of elements, Abney [1986] proposes utilizing licensing structure as a more concrete representation for parsing.",
        "This allows for more efficient processing yet maintains the spirit of the abstract grammar.\" Abney's notion of licensing requires that every element in a structure be licensed by performing some syntactic function.",
        "Any structure with unlicensed elements is ill-formed.",

        "Correspondingly, licensing is unique: an element is licensed via exactly one licensing relation.",

        "Finally,",
        "Each licensing relation is a 3-tuple (D, Cat, Type).",
        "D is the direction in which licensing occurs.",
        "Cat is the syntactic category of the element licensed by this relation.",
        "Type specifies the linguistic function accomplished by this licensing relation.",
        "This can be either functional selection, subjecthood, modification or theta-assignment.",
        "Functional selection is the relation which obtains between a functional head and the element for which it subcategorizes, i.e. between C and IP, I and VP, D and NP.",
        "Subjecthood is the relation between a head and its \"subject\".",
        "Modification holds between a head and adjunct.",
        "Theta assignment occurs between a head and its subcategorized elements.",
        "Figure 1 gives an example of the licensing relations which might obtain in a simple clause.",
        "Parsing with these licensing relations simply consists of determining, for each lexical item as it is read in a single left to right pass, where it is licensed in the previously constructed structure or whether it licenses the previous structure.",
        "We can now re-examine Abney's claim that these licensing relations allow him to retain \"the spirit of the abstract grammar.\" Since licensing relations talk only of very local relationships, that occurring between sisters, this system cannot enforce the constraints of binding, control, and ECP among others.",
        "Abney notes this and suggests that his licensing should be seen as a single module in a parsing system.",
        "One would hope, though, that principles which have their roots in licensing, such as those of theta and case theory, could receive natural treatments.",

        "These are determined by examination of information in the lexical entries (such as using the theta grid to determine theta gives), examination of language specific parameters (using head directionality in order to determined directionality of gives, for example), and consultation of UG parameters (for instance as a result of the case filter, every DP maximal projection will have an associated case need).",

        "We may attach p as the sister of a node n on the right frontier of the developing structure, when p is licensed by rt either by a give in it and/or a need in the node p. Another possibility is that the previously built structure is attached as sister to a node, m, dominated by the maximal projection p, by satisfying a give in in and/or a need on the root of the previously built structure.",
        "In the case of multiple attachment possibilities, we order them according to some metric such as the one proposed by Abney, and choose the most highly ranked option.",

        "In such positions, they will never become satisfied.",

        "We posit an element to have been moved into a position exactly when it is licensed at that position yet its needs are not completely satisfied.",
        "After positing the empty category, we push it onto the trace stack.",
        "When a node has an unsatisfied give and no longer has access to the right frontier, we must posit some element, not phonologically represented in the input, which satisfies that give relation.",
        "If there is an element on the top of the trace stack which can satisfy this give, we pop it off the stack and attach it.3 Of course, if the trace has any remaining needs, it is returned to the trace stack since its new position is isolated from the right frontier.",
        "If no such element appears on top of the trace stack, we 'Note that the use of this stack to recover filler-gap structures forbids non-nested dependencies as in [Fodor, 19783.",
        "posit a non-trace empty category of the appropriate type, if one exists in the language.4 Let's try this mechanism on the sentence \"Harry laughs.\" The first token received is Harry and is projected to DP.",
        "No gives are associated with this node, but theta and case needs are inserted into the need set as a result of the theta criterion and the case filter.",
        "Next, tnslagr is read and projected to r, since it possesses f-features (cf. [Fulcui and Speas, 1986]).",

        "The previously constructed DP is attached as sister to the V node, thereby satisfying the subject and case gives of the I as well as the case need of the DP.",
        "We are thus left with the structure in figure 2.5 Next, we see that the theta need of the DP is inaccessible from the right frontier, so we push an empty category DP whose need set contains this unsatisfied theta need onto the trace stack.",
        "The next input token is the verb laugh.",
        "This is projected to a single bar level.",
        "Since laugh assigns an external theta role, we insert a leftward theta give to a DP into the V' node.",
        "This verbal projection is attached as sister to 10, satisfying the functional selection give of I.",
        "However, the theta give in V' remains unsatisfied and since it is leftward, is inaccessible.",

        "The resulting structure is easily seen to be well-formed since all gives and needs are satisfied.",
        "We have adopted a very particular view of traces: their positions in the structure must be independently motivated by some other licensing relation.",
        "Note, then, that we cannot analyze long distance dependencies through successive cyclic movement.",
        "There is no licensing relation which will cause the intermediate traces to exist.",
        "Ordinarily these traces exist only to allow a well-formed derivation, i.e. not ruled out by subjacency or by a barrier to antecedent government.",
        "Thus, we need to account for constraints on long distance movement in another manner.",
        "We will return to this in the next section.",
        "The mechanism I have proposed allows a fairly direct encoding for some of the principles of grammar such as case theory, theta theory, and the extended projection principle.",
        "However, many other constraints of GB, such as the ECP, control theory, binding theory, and bounding theory, cannot be expressed perspicuously through licensing.",
        "Since we want our parser to maintain a fairly direct connection with the grammar, we need some additional mechanism to ensure the satisfaction of these constraints.",
        "Recall, again, the computational properties we wanted to hold of our parsing model: efficiency and incrementality.",
        "The structure building process I have described has worst case complexity 0(n2) since the set of possible attachments can grow linearly with the input.",
        "While not enormously computationally intensive, this is greater that the linear time bound we desire.",
        "Also, checking for satisfaction of non-licensing constraints over unboundedly large structures is likely to be quite inefficient.",
        "There is also the question of when these other constraints are checked To accord with incrementality, they must be checked as soon as possible, and not function as post-processing \"filters.\" Unfortunately, it is not easily determinable when a given constraint can apply such that further input will not change the status of the satisfaction of a constraint.",
        "We do not want to rule a structure ungrammatical simply because it is incomplete.",
        "Finally, it is unclear how we might incorporate this mechanism which builds an ever larger syntactic structure into a model which performs semantic interpretation incrementally."

        "The parsing model which I have presented here is still rather preliminary.",
        "There are a number of areas which will require further development before this can be considered complete.",
        "I have assumed that the process of projection is entirely determined from lexical lookup.",
        "It is clear, though, that lexical ambiguity abounds and that the assignment of gives and needs to the projections of input tokens is not determinate.",
        "An example of such indeterminacy has to do with the assignment to argument maximal projections of theta needs as a result of the theta criterion.",
        "DPs need not always function as arguments, as I have been assuming.",
        "This problem might be solved by allowing for the statement of disjunctive constraints or a limited form of parallelism.",
        "If the duration of such parallelism could be tightly constrained, we might be able to retain the efficient nature of the current model.",
        "Other strategies for resolving such indeterminacies using statistical reasoning or hard coded rules or templates might also be possible, but these constructs are not the sort of grammatical knowledge we have been considering here and would entail further abstraction from the competence grammar.",
        "Another problem with the parser has to do with the incompleteness of the algorithm.",
        "Sentences such as Boris knew that Tom ate lunch will not be parsed even though there exist well-formed sets of elementary trees which can derive them.",
        "The problem results from the fact that the left to right processing strategy we have adopted is a bit too strict.",
        "The comple-mentizer that will be attached as object of know, but Tom is not then licensed by any node on the right frontier.",
        "Ultimately, this DP is licensed by the Ins/agr morpheme in the lower clause whose IP projection is licensed through functional selection by C. Similarly, the parser would have great difficulty handling head final languages_ Again, these problems might be solved using extra-grammatical devices, such as the attention shifting of [Marcus, 1980] or some template matching mechanism, but this would entail a process of \"compiling out\" of the grammar that we have been trying to avoid.",
        "Finally, phonologically empty heads and head movement cause great difficulties for this mechanism.",
        "Heads play a crucial role in this \"project and attach\" scheme.",
        "Therefore, we must find a way of determining when and where heads occur when they are either dislocated or not present in the input string at all, perhaps in a similar manner to the mechanism for movement of maximal projections I have proposed above."

        "In this paper, I have sketched a psychologically plausible model for the use of GB grammars.",
        "The currently implemented parser is a bit too simple to be truly robust, but the general approach presented here seems promising.",
        "Particularly interesting is that the computationally motivated use of TAG to constrain processing locality provides us with insight on the nature of the meta-grammar of possible grammatical constraints.",
        "Thus, if grammatical principles are stated over such a bounded domain, we can guarantee the existence of a perspicuous model for their use, thereby lending credence to the cognitive reality of this competence grammar.",
