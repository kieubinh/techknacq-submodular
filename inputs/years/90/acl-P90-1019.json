        "This paper describes an operational system which can acquire the core meanings of words without any prior knowledge of either the category or meaning of any words it encounters.",
        "The system is given as input, a description of sequences of scenes along with sentences which describe the [EVENTS] taking place as those scenes unfold, and produces as output, a lexicon consisting of the category and meaning of each word in the input, that allows the sentences to describe the [EVENTS].",
        "It is argued, that each of the three main components of the system, the parser, the linker and the inference component, make only linguistically and cognitively plausible assumptions about the innate knowledge needed to support tractable learning.",
        "The paper discusses the theory underlying the system, the representations and algorithms used in the implementation, the semantic constraints which support the heuristics necessary to achieve tractable learning, the limitations of the current theory and the implications of this work for language acquisition research."

        "Several natural language systems have been reported which learn the meanings of new words[5, 7, 1, 16, 17, 13, 14].",
        "Many of these systems (in particular [5, 7, 1]) learn the new meanings based upon expectations arising from the morphological, syntactic, se",
        "mantic and pragmatic context of the unknown word in the text being processed.",
        "For example, if such a system encounters the sentence \"I woke up yesterday, turned off my alarm clock, took a shower, and cooked myself two grimps for breakfast[51\" it might conclude that grimps is a noun which represents a type of food.",
        "Such systems succeed in learning new words only when the context offers sufficient constraint to narrow down the possible meanings to make the acquisition unambiguous.",
        "Accordingly, such a theory accounts only for the type of learning which arises when an adult encounters an unknown word while reading a text comprised mostly of known words.",
        "It can not explain the kind of learning which a young child performs during the early stages of language acquisition when it starts out knowing the meanings of few if any words.",
        "In this paper, I present a new theory which can account for the language learning which a child exhibits.",
        "In this theory, the learner is presented with a training session consisting of a sequence of scenarios.",
        "Each scenario contains both linguistic and non-linguistic (i.e. visual) information.",
        "The nonlinguistic information for each scenario consists of a time-ordered sequence of scenes, each depicted via a conjunction of true and negated atomic formulas describing that scene.",
        "Likewise, the linguistic information for each scenario consists of a time-ordered sequence of sentences.",
        "Initially, the learner knows nothing about the words comprising the sentences in the training session, neither their lexical category nor their meaning.",
        "From the two correlated sources of input, the linguistic and the non-linguistic, the learner can infer the set of possible lexicons (i.e. the possible",
        "categories and meanings of the words in the linguistic input) which allow the linguistic input to describe or account for the non-linguistic input.",
        "This inference is accomplished by applying a compositional semantics linking rule in reverse and then performing some constraint satisfaction.",
        "This theory has been implemented in a working computer program.",
        "The program succeeds and is tractable because of a small number of judicious semantic constraints and a small number of heuristics which order and eliminate much of the search.",
        "This paper explains the general theory as well as the implementation details which make it work.",
        "In addition, it discusses some limitations in the current theory, among which is one which prevents it from converging on a single definition of some words."

        "This three argument relation can be used to learn lexical category information by a technique summarized in Figure I.",

        "Given a lexicon and a sequence of sentences as input, the architecture could produce as output, a sequence of observations which are predicted by the sentences.",
        "This corresponds to language understanding.",
        "Likewise, given a lexicon and a sequence of observations as input, the architecture could produce as output, a sequence of sentences which explain the observations.",
        "This corresponds to language generation.",
        "Finally, given a sequence of observations and a sequence of sentences as input, the architecture could produce as output, a lexicon which allows the sentences to explain the observations.",
        "This last alternative, corresponding to language acquisition, is what interests us here.",
        "Of the five mental representations used by MAIMRA, only three are externally visible, namely the linguistic input, the non-linguistic input and the lexicon.",
        "Syntactic and semantic structures exist only internal to MAIMRA and are not externally visible.",
        "When using the cognitive architecture from Figure 3 for learning, the values of two of the mental representations, namely the sentences and the observations, are deterministic, since they are fixed as input.",
        "The remaining three representations may be nondeterministic; there may be multiple lexicons, syntactic structure sequences and semantic structure sequences which are consistent with the fixed input.",
        "In general, each of the three modules alone provides only limited constraint on the possible values for each of the mental representations.",
        "Thus taken alone, significant nondeterminism is introduced by each module in isolation.",
        "Taken together however, the modules offer much greater constraint on the mutually consistent values for the mental representations, thus reducing the amount of nondeterminism.",

        "Such a naive implementation would directly reflect the architecture given in Figure 3 and is illustrated in Figure 4.",
        "The predicate maimra would represent the conjunction of constraints introduced by the parser, linker and inference modules, ultimately constraining the mutually consistent values for sentence and observation sequences and the lexicon.",
        "Learning a lexicon would be accomplished by forming a conjunction of queries to maimra, one for each scenario, where a single Lexicon is shared among the conjoined queries.",

        "Each such parse tree sequence would be represented as a distinct backtrack possibility by the naive implementation.",
        "The actual implementation instead represents this nondeterminism explicitly as AND/OR trees and additionally factors out much of the shared common substructure to reduce the size of the mental representations and the time needed to process them.",
        "As noted previously, the individual modules themselves offer little constraint on the mental representations.",
        "A given sentence sequence corresponds to many parse tree sequences which in turn corresponds to an even greater number of semantic structure sequences.",

        "It turns out that there is no way to force MAIIVIRA to realize that the sentence describes the entire scenario and not just the first or last scene alone.",
        "Thus MAIMRA does not rule out the possibility that enter might mean \"to be somewhere.\"",
        "The reason MAIMRA is successful with the session from Figure 2 is that the empty semantics constraint rules out associating the sentences with just the first or last scene because the semantic structures representing those scene subsequences have too little semantic material to distribute among the words of the sentence.",
        "One way around this problem would be for MAIMRA to attempt to choose the lexicon which maximizes the amount of non-linguistic data which is accounted for.",
        "Future work will investigate this issue further.",
        "We make three claims as a result of this work.",
        "First, this work demonstrates that the combination of syntactic, semantic and pragmatic modules, each incorporating cognitively plausible innateness assumptions, offers sufficient constraint for !earning word meanings with no prior lexical knowledge in the context of non-linguistic input.",
        "This offers a general framework for explaining meaning acquisition.",
        "Second, appropriate choices of representation and algorithms allow efficient implementation within the general framework.",
        "While no claim is being made that children employ the mechanisms described here, they nonetheless can be used to construct useful engineered systems which learn language.",
        "The third 3 Although not strictly required by either the theory or the implementation, we currently incorporate into the training session given to MA1MRA , an initial lexicon telling it that 'John,' 'Mary' and 'Bill' are nouns, 'from' and 'to' are prepositions and 'the' is a determiner.",
        "This is to reduce the combinatorics of generating ambiguous parses.",
        "Category information is not given for any other words, nor is meaning information given for any words occurring in the training session.",
        "In theory it would be possible to efficiently bootstrap the categories for these words as well, via a longer training session containing a few shorter sentences to constrain the possible categories for these words.",
        "We have not done so yet, however.",
        "claim is more bold.",
        "Most language acquisition research operates under a tacit assumption that children acquire individual pieces of knowledge about language by experiencing single short stimuli in isolation.",
        "This is often extended to an assumption that knowledge of language is acquired by discovering distinct cues in the input, each cue elucidating one parameter setting in a parameterized linguistic theory.",
        "We will call this assumption the local learning hypothesis.",
        "This is in contrast to our approach where knowledge of language is acquired by finding data consistent across longer correlated sessions.",
        "Our approach requires the learner to do some puzzle solving or constraint satisfaction.4 It is normally believed that the latter approach is not cognitively plausible.",
        "The evidence for this is that children seem to have short \"input buffers.\"",
        "The limited size of the input buffers is taken to imply that only short isolated stimuli can take part in inferring each new language fact.",
        "MAIMRA demonstrates that despite a short input buffer with the ability of retaining only one scenario at a time, it is nonetheless possible to produce a disjunctive representation which supports constraint solving across multiple scenarios.",
        "We believe that without cross scenario constraint solving, it is impossible to account for meaning acquisition and thus the local learning hypothesis is wrong.",
        "Our approach offers a viable alternative to the local learning hypothesis consistent with the observed short input buffer effect."

        "While most prior computational work on meaning acquisition focuses on contextual learning by scanning texts, some notable work has pursued a path similar to that described here attempting to learn from correlated linguistic and non-linguistic input.",
        "In [16, 17], Salveter describes a system called MORAN.",
        "The non-linguistic component of each scenario presented to MORAN consists of a sequence of exactly two scenes, where each scene is described by a conjunction of atomic formula.",
        "The linguistic component of each scenario is a preparsed case frame analysis of a single sentence describing the state change occurring between those two scenes.",
        "From each scenario in isolation, MORAN infers what Salveter calls a Conceptual Meaning Structure (CMS) which attempts to capture the essence of the meaning of the verb in the sentence.",
        "This CMS is a subset of the",
        "two scenes identifying the portion of the scenes referred to by the sentence, with the arguments of the atomic formula linked to noun phrases replaced by variables labeled with the syntactic positions those noun phrases fill in the sentence.",
        "The process of inferring CMSs involves two processes reminiscent of tasks performed by MAIMRA, namely the figure/ground distinction whereby the inference component suggests possible subsets of the non-linguistic input as being referred to by the linguistic input (as distinct from the part which is not referred to) and the fracturing process whereby verb meanings are constructed by extracting out arguments from whole sentence meanings.",
        "MoRAN's variants of these tasks are much simpler than the analogous tasks performed by MAIMRA.",
        "First, the figure/ground distinction is easier since each scenario presented to MORAN contains but a single sentence and a pair of scenes.",
        "MORAN need not figure out which subsequence of scenes corresponds to each sentence.",
        "Second, the linguistic input comes to MORAN preparsed which relies on preexisting knowledge of the lexical categories of the words in the sentence.",
        "MORAN does not acquire category information, and furthermore does not deal with any ambiguity that might arise from the parsing process or the figure/ground distinction.",
        "Finally, the training session presented to MORAN relies on a subtle implicit link between the objects in the world and linguistic tokens used to refer to them.",
        "Part of the difficulty faced by MAIMRA is discerning that the linguistic token John refers to the conceptual structure fragment John.",
        "MORAN is given that information a priori by lacking a formal distinction between the notion of a linguistic token and conceptual structure.",
        "Given this information, the fracturing process becomes trivial.",
        "MORAN therefore, does not exhibit the cross-scenario correlational behavior attributed to MAIMRA and in fact learns every verb meaning with just a single training scenario.",
        "This seems very implausible as a model of child language acquisition.",
        "In contrast to MAIMRA, MORAN is able to learn polysemous senses for verbs; one for each scenario provided for a given verb.",
        "MORAN focuses on extracting out the common substructure for polysemous meanings attempting to maximize commonality between different word senses and build a catalog of higher level conceptual building blocks, a task not attempted by MAIMRA.",
        "In [13, 14], Pustejovsky describes a system called TULLY, which also operates in a fashion similar to MAIMRA and MORAN, learning word meanings from pairs of linguistic and non-linguistic input.",
        "Like MORAN, the linguistic input given to TULLY for each scenario is a single parsed sentence.",
        "The nonlinguistic input given along with that parsed sentence is a predicate calculus description of three parts of a single event, its beginning, middle and end.",
        "From this input, TULLY derives a Thematic Mapping Index, a data structure representing the 0-roles borne by each of the arguments to the main predicate.",
        "Like MORAN, the task faced by TULLY is much simpler than that faced by MAIMRA, since TULLY is presented with unambiguous parsed input, is given the correspondence between nouns and their referents and is given the correspondence between a single sentence and the semantic representation of the event described by that sentence.",
        "TULLY does not learn lexical categories, does not have to determine figure/ground partitioning of non-linguistic input and implausibly learns verb meanings from single scenarios without any cross-scenario correlation.",
        "Multiple scenarios for the same verb cause TULLY to generalize to the feast common generalization of the individual instances.",
        "TULLY however, goes beyond MAIMRA in trying to account for the acquisition of a variety of markedness features for 0-roles including [±motion], f±abstraci],[±direct], [Ipariiiive] and [±animaie]"

        "The MAIMRA system successfully learns word meanings with no prior lexical knowledge of any words.",
        "It works by applying syntactic, semantic and pragmatic constraints to correlated linguistic and nonlinguistic input.",
        "In doing so, it more accurately reflects the type of learning performed by children, in contrast to previous lexical acquisition systems which focus on learning unknown words encountered while reading texts.",
        "Although, each module implements a weak theory, and in isolation offers only limited constraint on possible mental representations, the collective constraint provided by the combination of modules is sufficient to reduce the nondeterminism to a manageable level.",
        "It demonstrates that with a reasonable set of assumptions about innate knowledge, combined with appropriate representations and algorithms, tractable learning is possible with short training sessions and limited processing.",
        "Though there may be disagreement as to the linguistic and cognitive plausibility of some of the innateness assumptions, and while the particular syntactic, semantic and pragmatic theories currently incorporated into MAIMRA may be only approximations to reality, nonetheless, the general framework shows promise of explaining how children acquire word meanings.",
        "In particular, it offers a viable al",
        "ternative to the local learning hypothesis which can explain how children acquire meanings that require correlation of experience across many input scenarios, with only limited size input buffers.",
        "Future work will attempt to address these potential shortcomings and will focus on supporting more robust acquisition of a broader class of word meanings."
