        "In recent years, a great deal of attention has been devoted to complex-feature based grammar formalisms-i.e. grammar formalisms in which syntactic elements are not atomic symbols, but rather complex elements, such as value-attribute or term structures; see Shieber (1986) for an overview.",
        "Typically such formalisms use a single mechanism – variable substitution – for all purposes, and the most widely used variable substitution mechanism is unification.1 Such complex-feature based grammars, then, are viewed as systems in which partial feature structures are built up, by the process of unification, into successively more specified structures.",
        "While it is formally elegant to use a single mechanism for a number of purposes, this theoretical elegance is realized in practice only if the mechanism does not require the other modules of the system to be complicated to achieve this \"elegance\".",
        "Currently, unification is used for at least four purposes: 11n thc mat of this paper, for convenience I will use the term \"unification\" instead of \"variable substitution\".",
        "since it is the most commonly used type of variable substitution, but it should be home in mind that the point being made hem hoick for variable substitution, in general.",
        "• to enforce formal agreement between purely syntactic features • to \"percolate\" features between a pre-terminal category and the phrase which it heads • to pass features between a dislocated element – such as a WE-phrase – and its trace • to build up semantic representations",
        "This paper will focus on the use of unification to enforce agreement and will present evidence from several natural languages which argues against its use in the case of purely formal syntactic features: when such features are lexically or morphologically underspecified, they remain so, even under agreement, contrary to the predictions of a system using unification for agreement.",
        "Moreover, it is worthwhile stressing at the outset that the main argument of this paper is not that there are certain constructions that present a problem for unification, and, hence, require some technical solution.",
        "The point is much stronger: even if some elaborate analysis can be devised that allows unification to be used to effect agreement, this would be the wrong tack to take.",
        "Rather, the argument will go, using unification to effect agreement is incorrect both for theoretical reasons – it presents a view of language which is contradicted by the facts – and for practical reasons – using unification to effect agreement can impede a system's robustness and transportability."

        "In the relative clause, \"is\" is marked as singular, and \"sheep\", interpreted as its subject via the relative connector \"that\", must also be singular.",
        "On the other hand, \"are\" in the matrix clause is marked as plural, and \"sheep\", its subject, must also be plural.",
        "Under a unification analysis, these facts are explained in the following way: \"sheep\" is syntactically unspecified for the feature number.",
        "The process of subject-verb agreement is effected by unification.",
        "Therefore, when \"sheep\" appears as the subject of a finite verb, unification will fix its number as singular or plural (unless the finite verb itself is ambiguous).",

        "However, when the ramifications of this analysis for semantics are considered, it becomes less tenable: while syntactic frameworks have been constructed in which features can take on underspecified values, most semantic frameworks require features such as singular/plural to be fully specified.",
        "That is, semantically, \"sheep\" can denote an individual or a set of individuals5 but it cannot denote something indeterminate.",
        "This suggests that \"sheep\" is not un-detspecified, or vague, but rather ambiguous.",
        "That is, there is not a single representation for \"sheep\", which is underspecified for number, but rather two distinct entries, fully specified for number in both its syntactic and semantic aspects.",

        "Once utterances like (38) are analyzed as not matching the agreement configuration in (3), it is possible to handle all the cases of morphological neutralization discussed in the previous section.",
        "Note that the feature involved in each example of neutralization discussed – Case in German and French, and definiteness on verbs in Hungarian – is either inherently formal, without semantic content (Case) or a feature that does not have any semantic ramification for the category in which it is neutralized: definiteness does affect the interpretation of noun phrases, but it serves purely as a formal agreement marker on verbs.",
        "If this observation is correct, then the solution to the apparent paradox runs along the following lines:",

        "(But see the discussion in the Section 4.)",
        "• Purely formal syntactic features, on the other hand, can be neutralized, producing truly underspecified representations, either through the use of value disjunction or through the use of a variable, rather than a constant, as a feature value.6 • Agreement is effected not by unification but rather by a non-distinctness check.",
        "That is, since we can view unification as logically composed of two parts – variable checking and variable substitution – agreement should be analyzed as involving only variable-matching, but not variable substitution.",
        "This would explain why constituents that neutralize a syntactic feature distinction are universally able to behave as if they are simultaneously marked for all the values of the feature that they neutralize: since agreement only involves variable matching, but not variable substitution, the original, underspecified representation is always available for agreement.",
        "To make this proposal clearer, I will present an analysis of the German and Hungarian facts,7 using a 6Pulimn and Zwicky (1986, p. 766) make a similar distinction between features \"freely chosen\" vs. those \"syntactically imposed...by rules of agreement ... or government\".",

        "However, the non-distinctness check differs from unification in what it returns.",
        "Unification, when applied to two evressions, typically returns either a distinguished symbol, such as Fail, if they do not unify, or a single substitution expression, which is the most general unifier of its input; see e.g. Pereira and Shieber (1987, pp.",
        "63-64).",

        "Certainly, given the strong lexical thrust of recent grammatical frameworks, in which syntactic structures, such as verbal complement structures, are projected from lexical representations, it is hard to see how such examples could not be analyzed as cases of ellipsis, at least in configurational languages.",

        "While Zaenen and Karttunen and Pull= and Zwicky agree with the present analysis in associating the neutralized constistuent with each conjunct of the conjunction directly, rather than through the conjunction as a whole, both of their analyses require this association to be stated as a separate principle.",
        "If the brief sketch presented at the end of the preceding section is correct, no such stipulation is necessary.",
        "Rather, the behavior of neutralization with respect to conjunction follows from the interaction of the general agreement procedure with the way in which heads are associated with their complements.",
        "Zaenen and Karttunen leave the bulk of the question of what features can be neutralized as a research topic.",
        "Pullum and Zwicky, on the other hand, limit neutralization to those features imposed by agreement.",
        "This is essentially the position argued for here, although there are subtle differences between the two proposals and some problematic data (which we will return to in Section 4).",
        "However, this proposal does seem to be fundamentally correct, and, combined with the view of agreement as non-distinctness, yields a more empirically valid theory of agreement than one which equates unification with agreement or which limits the effects of neutralization to conjoined structures.",
        "Moreover, this view of agreement should contribute to the portability of natural language systems across languages.",
        "While it might be possible to reconcile the type of agreement behavior discussed here with a formalism in which unification is used for agreement by the use of arrays of feature values or some even more byzantine mechanism, such an approach would increase the fragility of any system embodying it.",
        "In a theory such as the one here, it should be possible to distinguish cases of ambiguity from cases of neutralization straightforwardly and to assign the appropriate representation accordingly.",
        "In a system that tried to maintain the use of unification for agreement by means of elaborated representations, the designer of a grammar for a new language would be faced with the problem of either using the elaborated representation for all cases of morphological underspecification, and, perhaps, blowing up the size and complexity of the grammar, or reserving",
        "the elaborated representation for just those forms which enter into an agreement relation.",
        "This would require a thorough study of all the morphological forms of the language and the constructions they enter into before feature structures could be designed and might entail large scale changes later if previously unnoticed cases of neutralization were discovered."

        "The proposal that agreement is not effected by unification does not, however, mean that unification plays no role in grammar.",
        "On the contrary: in most complex-feature based systems, semantic features are also full-fledged parts of syntactic representations and unification is used to build up more complex terms out of simpler or less specified terms and to build up formulas out of terms.\" There is no argument at all in the data presented here that unification does not continue to play this role.",
        "In fact, there is a certain historical niceness in the picture of grammar that has been developed here: variable matching (non-distinctness) is used to effect agreement, and variable substitution (unification) is used to build up semantic representations.",
        "The reason why this view is historically satisfying is that it corresponds to views of agreement and semantic interpretation that were independently developed in theoretical and computational linguistics.",
        "In the earliest forms of generative grammar, it was recognized that certain constructions, such as the various types of ellipsis, depended on a notion of identity.",
        "Over the years, this notion of identity was refined into one of non-distinctness.",
        "Two linguistic representations agree if they are non-distinct from one another; they do not need to be identical (see Chomsky (1965, p. 181)).",
        "The view of agreement presented here accords with this well-established view.",
        "The use of unification for building up semantic representations, in turn, is based on Robinson's (1965) work on resolution theorem proving.",
        "Thus, using unification to build up semantic representations, but not for agreement, returns it to something close to its original use.",
        "There are two other places where unification may play a role in grammar, although other mechanisms are also possibile in these cases.",
        "The first is feature percolation and the second is the use of empty categories, such as traces.",
        "Whereas agreement has been used here to mean matching of features between sister nodes, typi-11See Pereira and Warren (1980), Shieber (1986), and Pereira and &get= (1987) for more detailed discussion of semantic interpretation in complex-feature based grammars.",
        "catty of distinct categories, feature-percolation involves the matching of features between one constituent and a constituent which it dominates, where the dominating constituent is a projection of the dominated, in the sense of the X-Bar theory of phrase structure (Chomsky (1970), Jackendoff (1977)).",
        "For example, a noun phrase has the same person and number features as its head noun, a verb phrase, the tense and mood of its head verb, etc.",
        "Unification has typically been used to effect feature-percolation and nothing in the data presented here suggests that it is wrong to use unification for this purpose.",
        "And while the proposal that agreement and feature-percolation are handled by different mechanisms is not usual in complex-feature based grammars, it is also not unprecedented.",
        "Ross's (1981) Local Grammar formalism is a complex-feature based grammar in which feature percolation and agreement are distinct.",
        "Finally, unification has been used to \"pass\" features between a \"dislocated\" element and its trace.",
        "Here again, unification remains a viable mechanism.",
        "However, there are alternatives mechanisms for both these functions, such as inheritance and delegation, whose use should probably be investigated."

        "First of all, there is the question of how the non-distinctness test for agreement can be incorporated into a system in which unification is used for semantic interpretation and other purposes.",
        "Since non-distinctness returns a subset of the values returned by unification, interaction between non-distinctness and unification should be straightforward.",
        "However, a system using both these mechanisms would also need to contain some method for specifying which features of which constituents are subject to unification and which are subject to non-distinctness.",
        "This suggests the necessity of some sort of type declaration system, in which features are declared as semantically relevant or not for a particular category.",
        "The BBN ACFG formalism (Boisen 1989a,b), a form of Definite Clause Grammar, already includes a type declaration system, which has proven very useful for maintaining the consistency of large grammars.",

        "A more problematic issue is the exact specification of the features which can be neutralized and those which can be ambiguous, and their contexts.",
        "In Section 3.1, it was suggested that semantically relevant features enter into ambiguity relations, while all others produce neutralization.",

        "Moreover, there are also judgements in the opposite direction.",
