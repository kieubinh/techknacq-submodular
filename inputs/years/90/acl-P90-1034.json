        "A variety of linguistic relations apply to sets of semantically similar words.",
        "For example, modifiers select semantically similar nouns, selectional restrictions are expressed in terms of the semantic class of objects, and semantic type restricts the possibilities for noun compounding.",
        "Therefore, it is useful to have a classification of words into semantically similar sets.",
        "Standard approaches to classifying nouns, in terms of an \"is-a\" hierarchy, have proven hard to apply to unrestricted language.",
        "Is-a hierarchies are expensive to acquire by hand for anything but highly restricted domains, while attempts to automatically derive these hierarchies from existing dictionaries have been only partially successful (Chodorow, Byrd, and Heidom 1985).",
        "This paper describes an approach to classifying English words according to the predicate-argument structures they show in a corpus of text.",
        "The general idea is straightforward: in any natural language there are restrictions on what words can appear together in the same construction, and in particular, on what can be arguments of what predicates.",
        "For nouns, there is a restricted set of verbs that it appears as subject of or object of.",
        "For example, wine may be drunk, produced, and sold but not pruned.",
        "Each noun may therefore be characterized according to the verbs that it occurs with.",
        "Nouns may then be grouped according to the extent to which they appear in similar environments.",
        "This basic idea of the distributional foundation of meaning is not new.",
        "Harris (1968) makes this \"distributional hypothesis\" central to his linguistic theory.",
        "His claim is that: \"the meaning of entities, and the meaning of grammatical relations among them, is related to the restriction of combinations of these entities relative to other entities.\"",
        "(Harris 1968:12).",
        "Sparck Jones (1986) takes a similar view.",
        "It is however by no means obvious that the distribution of words will directly provide a useful semantic classification, at least in the absence of considerable human intervention.",
        "The work that has been done based on Harris' distributional hypothesis (most notably, the work of the associates of the Linguistic String Project (see for example, Hirschman, Grishrnan, and Sager 1975)) unfortunately does not provide a direct answer, since the corpora used have been small (tens of thousands of words rather than millions) and the analysis has typically involved considerable intervention by the researchers.",
        "The stumbling block to any automatic use of distributional patterns has been that no sufficiently robust syntactic analyzer has been available.",
        "This paper reports an investigation of automatic distributional classification of words in English, using a parser developed for extracting grammatical structures from unrestricted text (Hindle 1983).",
        "We propose a particular measure of similarity that is a function of mutual information estimated from text.",
        "On the basis of a six million word sample of Associated Press news stories, a classification of nouns was developed according to the predicates they occur with.",
        "This purely syntax-based similarity measure shows remarkably plausible semantic relations."

        "(1) The clothes we wear, the food we eat, the air we breathe, the water we drink, the land that sustains us, and many of the products we use are the result of agricultural research.",
        "(March 22 1987) The parser aims to be non-committal when it is unsure of an analysis.",
        "For example, it is perfectly willing to parse an embedded clause and then leave it unattached.",
        "If the object or subject of a clause is not found, Fidditch leaves it empty, as in the last two clauses in Figure 1.",
        "This non-committal approach simply reduces the effective size of the sample.",
        "The aim of the parser is to produce an annotated surface structure, building constituents as large as it can, and reconstructing the underlying clause structure when it can.",
        "In sentence (1), six clauses are found.",
        "Their predicate-argument information may be coded as a table of 5-tupks, consisting of verb, surface subject, surface object, underlying subject, underlying object, as shown in Table 1.",
        "In the subject-verb-object table, the root form of the head of phrases is recorded, and the deep subject and object are used when available.",
        "(Noun phrases of the form a n1 of n2 are coded as n1 n2; an example is the first entry in Table 2).",
        "The parser's analysis of sentence (1) is far from perfect: the object of wear is not found, the object of use is not found, and the single element land rather than the conjunction of clothes, food, air, water, land, products is taken to be the subject of be.",
        "Despite these errors, the analysis is succeeds in discovering a number of the correct predicate-argument relations.",
        "The parsing errors that do occur seem to result, for the current purposes, in the omission of predicate-argument relations, rather than their misidentification.",
        "This makes the sample less effective than it might he, but it is not in general misleading.",
        "(It may also skew the sample to the extent that the parsing errors are consistent.)",
        "The analysis of the 6 million word 1987 AP sample yields 4789 verbs in 274613 clausal structures, and 26742 head nouns.",

        "A number of issues will have to be confronted to further exploit these structurally-mediated lexical constraints, including: Potysemy.",
        "The analysis presented here does not distinguish among related senses of the (orthographically) same word.",
        "Thus, in the table of words similar to table, we find at least two distinct senses of table conflated; the table one can hide beneath is not the table that can be commuted or memorized.",
        "Means of separating senses need to be developed.",
        "Empty words.",
        "Not all nouns are equally contentful.",
        "For example, section is a general word that can refer to sections of all sorts of things.",
        "As a result, the ten words most similar to section (school, building, exchange, book, house, ship, some, headquarter, industry, office) are a semantically diverse list of words.",
        "The reason is clear: section is semantically a rather empty word, and the selectional restrictions on its cooccurence depend primarily on its complement.",
        "You might wad a section of a book but not, typically, a section of a house.",
        "It would be possible to predetermine a set of empty words in advance of analysis, and thus avoid some of the problem presented by empty words.",
        "But it is unlikely that the class is well-defined.",
        "Rather, we expect that nouns could be ranked, on the basis of their distribution, according to how",
        "empty they are; this is a matter for further exploration.",
        "Sample size.",
        "The current sample is too small; many words occur too infrequently to be adequately sampled, and it is easy to think of usages that are not represented in the sample.",
        "For example, it is quite expected to talk about brewing beer, but the pair of brew and beer does not appear in this sample.",
        "Part of the reason for missing selectional pairs is surely the restricted nature of the AP news sublangu age.",
        "Further analysis.",
        "The similarity metric proposed here, based on subject-verb-object relations, represents a considerable reduction in the information available in the subjec-verbobject table.",
        "This reduction is useful in that it permits, for example, a clustering analysis of the nouns in the sample, and for some purposes (such as demonstrating the plausibility of the distribution-based metric) such clustering is useful.",
        "However, it is worth noting that the particular information about, for example, which nouns may be objects of a given verb, should not be discarded, and is in itself useful for analysis of text.",
        "In this study, we have looked only at the lexical relationship between a verb and the head nouns of its subject and object.",
        "Obviously, there are many other relationships among words -- for example, adjectival modification or the possibility of particular prepositional adjuncts that can be extracted from a corpus and that contribute to our lexical knowledge.",
        "It will be useful to extend the analysis presented here to other kinds of relationships, including more complex kinds of verb complementation, noun complementation.",
        "and modification both preceding and following the head noun.",
        "But in expanding the number of different structural relations noted, it may become less useful to compute a single-dimensional similarity score of the sort proposed in Section 4.",
        "Rather, the various lexical relations revealed by parsing a corpus, will be available to be combined in many different ways yet to be explored."
