        "Compared with the formalism of context-free grammars (CFGs), the rules of Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAGs) can be imagined intuitively as parts of context-free derivation trees.",
        "Without paying attention to the fact that there are some more restrictions for these rules, the recursion operation (adjoining) is represented as replacing a node in a TAG rule by another TAG rule so that larger derivation trees are built.",
        "This close relation between CFGs and TAGs can iinply that they are equivalent.",
        "But TAGs are more powerful than context-free grammars.",
        "This additional power – characterized as mildly context-sensitive – leads to the question of whether there are efficient algorithms to solve the word problem for TAGs.",
        "Up to now, the algorithm of Vijay-Shanker and Joshi with a time complexity of 0(n6) for the worst case was known, in addition to several unsuccessful attempts to improve this result.",
        "This paper's main emphasis is on the improvement of this result.",
        "An efficient parser for Tree Adjoining Grammars with a worst case time complexity of 0(n4 log n) is discussed.",
        "Al!",
        "known parsing algorithms for TAGs use the close structural similarity between TAGs and CFGs, which can be expressed by writing all inner nodes and all their sons in a TAG as the rule set of a context-free grammar (the context-free kernel of a TAG).",
        "Additionally, the constraint has to be tested that all further context-free rules corresponding to the same TAG tree must appear in the derivation tree, if one rule of that TAG tree is in use.",
        "Therefore, it is clear that a context-free parser can be the basis for extensions representing the test of the additional constraint.",
        "On the basis of the two fundamental context-free analysers, the different approaches for TAGs can be divided into two classes.",
        "One class extends an Earley parser and the second class extends a Cocke-Kasami-Younger (CKY) parser for CFGs.",
        "Here, we focus on the approaches with a CKY basis, because the relation between the resulting triangle mairtz and the encoded derivation trees is closer than for the aiem lists of an Earley parser.",
        "In particular, the paper is divided into the following sections.",
        "First, a short overview of the TAG formalism is given in order to have a common terminological basis with the reader.",
        "In the second section, the approach of Vway-Shanker and Joshi is presented as the natural way of extending the CKY algorithm for context-free grammars to TAGs.",
        "As a precondition for that analysis, it has to be proven that each TAG can be transformed into two form, a normal form restricting the outdegree of a node to be less three.",
        "In section 4, the main section of this paper, a normal form is defined as a precondition for a new and more efficient parsing algorithm.",
        "This form is more restricted than the two form, and is closely related to the Chomsky normal form for CFGs.",
        "The main emphasis lies on the description of the new parsing approach.",
        "The general idea is to separate the context-free parsing and the additional testing so that the test can run locally.",
        "On the triangle matrix which is the result of the CKY analysis with the context-free kernel, all complete TAG trees encoded in the triangle matrix are computed recursively.",
        "It is intuitively motivated that this approach needs fewer steps than the strategy of Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, which stores all intermediate states of TAG derivations, because the locally represented elementary trees can be interpreted as TAG derivations where equal parts are computed exactly once instead of individual representations in each derivation.",
        "In the summary, our experience with an implementation in CommonLISP on a Hewlett Packard machine is mentioned to illustrate the response time in an average case.",
        "Finally, different approaches for TAG parsing are characterized and compared with the approaches presented here."

        "First of all, the basic definitions for TAGs are revisited in order to have a common terminology with the reader (even though not defined explicitly here, CFGs are used as described, e.g., in [Hoperoft, Ullman 79D.",
        "In 1975, the formalism of Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAGs) was introduced by Aravind K. Joshi, Leon S. Levy and Al asako Takahashi (Poshi",
        "et al.",
        "75]).",
        "Since then, a wide variety of properties – formal properties as well as linguistically relevant ones – have been studied (see, e.g., Poshi 85} for a good overview).",
        "The following example describing the crossed dependencies in Dutch should illustrate the formalism (see Figure 1, where the node numbers written in slanted font should be ignored here; they make sense in combination with the description of the new algorithm, especially step (tag2)).",
        "A TAG is a tree generation system.",
        "It consists, in addition to the set of nonterminais N, the set of terminals T and the start symbol S, an extraordinary symbol in N, of two different sets of trees, which specify the rules of a TAG.",
        "Intuitively, the set I of initial trees can be seen as context-free derivation trees.",
        "This means the start symbol is the root node, all inner nodes are nonterminals and all leaves are terminals (e.g., in Figure 1 tree a).",
        "The second set A, the auxiliary trees, which can replace a node in an initial tree (which is possibly modified by further adjoinings) during the recursion process, must have a form, so that again a derivation tree results.",
        "The trees /31 and /32 demonstrate that restriction.",
        "A special leaf (the foot node) must exist, labelled with the same nonterminal as the root node.",
        "Further, it is obligatory that an auxiliary tree derives at least one terminal.",
        "The union of the initial and the auxiliary trees, so to speak the rule set of a TAG, is called the set of elementary trees.",
        "Tree y in Figure 1 shows a TAG derivation tree, which means an initial tree with an arbitrary number of adjoinings (here is adjoined at the node S1 in a and /32 at the node S in the adjoined tree fit).",
        "During the recursion process (adjoining), a node X in an initial tree a, which can be modified by further adjoinings, is replaced by an auxiliary tree with the same nonterminal label at root and foot node, that X is labelled with.",
        "The incoming edge in X (if it exists; this is true if X is not the root node of a) now ends in the root node of /3, and all outgoing edges of X in a now start at the foot node of 13.",
        "The set of all initial trees modified by an arbitrary number of adjoinings (at least zero) is called T(G), the tree set of a TAG G. The elements in this set can also be specified by building a series of triples (af, f3,, )i) (0 < i < n) – the derivation – where ao E 1, ai (1 < i < n) is the result of the adjoining of /3i_i in node X1...1 in ai_1' A (0 < i < n-1) is the auxiliary tree, which is adjoined in node Xi in tree a, and Xi (0 < i < n-1) is a unique node number in ai.",
        "This description has the advantage that structurally equal trees in T(G) which result from different adjoinings can be uniquely represented.",
        "L(G), the language of a TAG, is defined as the set containing all leaf strings of trees in T(G)' respectively all trees which can be constructed by adjoining as described in the corresponding derivation.",
        "Here, a leaf string means all labels of leaves in a tree are concatenated in order from left to right.",
        "In the tree 7 in Figure 1 Van Piet Marie c c zag laten zwemmen' is in L(G).",
        "The relation between TAGs and CFGs can be characterized by defining the context-free kernel",
        "K of a TAG G. K is a CFG and consists of the same sets N, T and S of G, but P(K) is the set of all inner nodes of all elementary trees in G interpreted as the lefthand side of a rule, where all sons in their order from left to right build the righthand side of that rule.",
        "E.g., in Figure 1 /32 has the corresponding context-free rules: (S, NP VP), (NP, N), (N, Jan), (VP, S V1), (V1, zag)• It is clear that having a context-free derivation tree (on the basis of the context-free kernel K of a TAG G) is a necessary, but not sufficient property for an input string, which is tested to be an element in L(G).",
        "In the following, this property motivates the extension of context-free parsing algorithms to accept TAGs a.s well.",
        "The following parsing algorithms are able to accept some extensions of the pure TAG definition without changing the upper time bound.",
        "Here, only TA Gs with Constraints are mentioned (for more information about other extensions, e.g., TAGs with Links, with Unification or Multi Component TAGs – some extending the generative capacity – see, e.g., [Joshi 85]).",
        "The motivation for TAGs with Constraints (TA G Cs) is to restrict the recursion operation of TAGs.",
        "Each node X in an elementary tree labelled with a nonterminal has an associated constraint set C, which has one of the following forms:",
        "• NA stands for null adjoining and means that at node X no adjoining can take place, • SA(B) stands for selective adjoining and means that at X the adjoining of an auxii",
        "iary tree (€ B) can take place (where each tree in B has the same root and foot node label as X) or • 0A(B) stands for obligatory adjogntng and means that at X the adjoining of an auxiliary tree (E B) must take place (where each tree in B has the same root and foot node label as X).",
        "When TAGs are mentioned in the following, the same result can be shown for TAGs with Constraints, which it is not explicitly outlined.",
        "Only the property of generative power is illustrated, to make clear that finding a parsing algorithm is not a trivial task.",
        "For more information about the linguistic relevance of TAGs, the reader is referred, e.g., to [Kroch, Joshi 851.",
        "A first impression comparing the generative power of TAGs and CFGs can be that they are equivalent, but TAGs are more powerful, e.g., the famous language an bn e en can be produced by a TAG with Constraints (the main idea in constructing this grammar is to represent the production of an a, a b and a c in one auxiliary tree).",
        "Thinking of the application domain of natural language processing, the discussion in the linguistic community becomes relevant as to how pow-erfu] a linguistic formalism should be (see, e.g., [Pullum 841 or [Shieber 85]).",
        "TAGs are mildly context-sensitive, which means that they can describe some context-sensitive languages, but not all (e.g., www with w E {a,b}, but ww is acceptable for a TAG).",
        "One thesis holds that natural language can be described very well by a mildly context-sensitive formalism.",
        "But this can only be empirically confirmed by describing difficult linguistic phenomena (here, the example in Figure 1 can only give an idea of the appropriateness of TAGs for natural language description).",
        "This property leads to the question of whether the word problem is solvable and if so, how efficiently.",
        "In the following section, two different polynomial approaches are presented in detail.",
        "The property of efficiency becomes important when a TAG should be used in the application domain mentioned above, e.g., one can think of a syntax description encoded in TAG rules which is part of a natural language dialogue system.",

        "In the CKY analysis used here, a cell [row i,column in the triangle matrix (1 <i, j < n, the length of the input string w = t1 ...t„, where without loss of generality n > 1, because the test for c, the empty string, E L(G) simply consists of searching for initial trees with all leaves labelled with c) contains an element X (E N) if there are rules to produce the derivation for ti+1...t1_1.",
        "This invariant is extended to represent a TAG derivation for ti+1...tj_i iff X E [i,j].",
        "Therefore additional information of each nonterminal in a cell has to be stored as to which elementary trees are under completion and what subtrees have been analyzed up to now.",
        "Important to note is that the list of trees which are under completion, can be longer than one.",
        "E.g., think of adjoinings which have taken place in adjoined trees as described in Figure 1.",
        "For realization of that information, a stack can he imagined.",
        "Here, the different stack elements are stored separately to use intermediate states in common.",
        "A stack element contains the information of exactly one auxiliary tree which is under construction, and a pointer to the next stack element.",
        "This pointer is realized by two additional positions for each cell in the triangle matrix ([i,j,k,ID, where k and I in the third and fourth position characterize the fact that from tk+i to",
        "t/_1 no information about the structure of the TAG derivation is known in this element and has to be reconstructed by examination of all cells [k,l,v,w] (k < v < to < 1).",
        "The stack cells which the elements point at must also be recursively interpreted until the whole subtree is examined (left and right stack pointer are equal).",
        "It is clear that in interpreting these chains of pointers the stack at each node X in the triangle matrix represents all intermediate states of TAG derivations with X as root node in an individual cell of the triangle matrix.",
        "The algorithm starts initializing cells for all terminal leaves (X E for ti with father X, 1 < i < n) and all foot nodes which can be seen as nonterminal leaves (X E [i, j, i,jJ where X is a foot node in an auxiliary tree, 0 < I < j < n-1).",
        "Just as the CKY algorithm tests all combinations of neighboring strings, here new elements of cells are computed together with the context-free invariant computation, e.g., if (Z,X Y) is a rule in the context-free kernel of the input TAG and X [i, j, k, 1],Y E[j-1,m, pi p] and X and IT are root nodes of neighboring parts in the same elementary tree, then Z is added to [i, m, k,1]).",
        "With the additional test to determine whether the rule (in the example (Z,X Y)) is in the same TAG tree as the two sons (X and Y) and whether the same holds for the subtrees below X and Y, it is clear that a whole TAG tree can be detected.",
        "If this is the case, i.e., that two neighboring stack elements should be combined, all elements of cells [k,l,m,p] are added to [i, j, m, p] iff X E is the root of an identified auxiliary tree.",

        "An equivalent description is presented in Figure 3 by storing the unique node number at which the pointer ends in the elementary tree and additionally a flag indicating whether the TAG tree is initial (I) or auxiliary (A) and whether the node is root node (T) of the tree or not (L).",

        "Actually, an implementation of the presented formalism exists written in Common LISP on a Hewlett Packard machine of the 9000 series (for more details about the implementation see [Buschauer et al.",
        "89]).",
        "To give an idea of the response time, the analysis of a sentence of about 10 to 15 words and a grammar of about 20 to 30 elementary trees takes at most 6 milliseconds.",
        "Currently, this implementation is extended to build a workbench supporting a linguist in writing and testing large TAG grammars (respectively TAGs with Unification).",

        "87] a linear time approach on 0(n9) processors and in [Palm, Shende 88] a sublinear (0(log2 n)) algorithm is described.",
        "One future perspective is to parallelize the new approach by the same method so that the expected result should be a linear time bound on 0(n2) processors.",
        "More concretely, an optimal layout for two processors is looked for, where independent subtrees have to be specified (candidates are not always total innermost trees, e.g., if only one TAG derivation exists where all innermost trees are nested).",
        "Further on, we concentrate on appropriate extensions of the TAG formalism for analysis as well as generation of natural language with the ambitious aim to verify that TAGs (in some extension) are appropriate for a bidirectional and integrated description of syntax, semantics and pragmatics."
