        "They also show that Iexicalized grammars are interesting from a computational point of view since lexicalization simplifies parsing techniques, because the parser uses only a relevant subset of the entire grammar: in a first stage, the parser selects a set of elementary structures associated with the lexical items in the input sentence, and in a second stage the sentence is parsed with respect to this set.",
        "As shown by Schabes, Joshi 1989, a parser's performances are thus improved.",
        "We show here that such lexicalization' should be extended to other components of the grammar as well, thus challenging the usual distinction between 'lexical' and 'syntactic' rules.",

Gross 1975) It also seems a lexical phenomenon that \"change but not \"transform\" allows for ergative alternation in English: The witch changed/transformed John into a wolf John changed into a wolf * John transformed into a wolf (G, Lakoff 1970) To take another example, dative shift (or there-insertion) is often thought of as applying to a semantically restricted set of verbs (eg verbs of communication or of change of possession, for dative), but this does not predict the difference between 'tell' that allows for it, and 'announce' or 'explain' which do not3: John told his ideas to Mary John told Mary his ideas John explained his ideas to Mary * John explained Mary his ideas Lexicalist frameworks such as GPSG, which handles such phenomena by metarules (defined on 'lexical' PS rules), or LFG, which defines them at the f-structure level (ie between 'lexical forms') could capture such restrictions.",
