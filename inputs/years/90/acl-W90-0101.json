        "As pointed out by many researchers (e.g., [Davey 1978; Mann 1983; Matthiessen & Kasper 1985; Patten 1988; Bateman Sz Paris 1989)), systemic linguistics offers many advantages to a sentence generation component of a text generation system.",
        "Perhaps the strongest asset of systemics is its view of the generation process as a goal directed enterprise.",
        "Its emphasis is on function rather than form [Halliday 1985; Fawcett 1980; Hudson 19711, where the functional distinctions that are required in the grammar manifest themselves in the eventual output form.",
        "While systemic linguists have remained agnostic with respect to certain processing decisions, a computer implementation of a systemic grammar requires that explicit decisions be made concerning realization operators and the structures available for manipulation at each point in the processing.",
        "The explicit decisions that were made in previous implementations of systemic",
        "grammar (e.g., [Mann 1983; Mann & Matthiessen 1985; Matthiessen & Kasper 1985]) have proven to be problematic in some respects.",
        "In particular, the current implementations have difficulty in generating certain sentences which exhibit discontinuities or long distance dependencies.",
        "To date, these can only be handled in a limited fashion, and the solutions provided are not very satisfying.",
        "We argue that Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) provides a structural unit that is precisely appropriate for the implementation of a systemic grammar for the generation task.",
        "Moreover, we believe our use of TAG for this purpose is completely consistent with the systemic paradigm and helps to overcome the above difficulties.",
        "In this paper we first introduce the notion of a systemic grammar and the processing paradigm it espouses.",
        "We indicate problems with current implementations of this paradigm.",
        "Next, we introduce the notion of lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammars, emphasizing their structural domains of locality, and justify that the basic structures of TAG are appropriate structures to be used in an implementation of a systemic grammar.",
        "Following this we indicate how a tree adjoining grammar can be used as the basis for an implementation of systemic grammar indicating the differences between the approach of current implementations of systemic grammar and that which would result from the incorporation of TAG.",
        "Finally, we indicate potential gains resulting from the incorporation of TAGs and the scope of current work."

        "Systemic linguistics deals with the meaning and function of an utterance.",
        "It is a semantics driven approach rather than a syntax driven approach.",
        "In systemics, form follows function.",
        "The grammar itself is factored into three metafunctional domains (each of which affect the final text): ideational (concerning the characteristics of the conceptual situation to be presented), interpersonal (concerning the interaction between speaker and hearer) and textual (concerning the coherence of",
        "the text as a whole).",
        "A systemic functional grammar consists of networks of grammatical choice alternatives, where individual networks are concerned with one of the metafunctional domains.",
        "In generation, these networks are traversed and fragments of grammatical structure are built up and manipulated using a set of realization operators which are associated with the various choice alternatives.",
        "The correct choice is made by consulting the information concerning the planned utterances.",
        "As the choices are made, the associated realization statements in the network are evaluated in order to realize the final structure.",
        "For instance, figure 1 contains a small fragment of a systemic grammar for clauses.",
        "The network indicates that a clause may either be simple or complex.",
        "If it is simple and full, then the grammatical function process is inserted (indicated by +process).",
        "The realization operation \"A subject process\" indicates that the subject should be ordered before the process in the final realization.",
        "Systemics deals with communicative function and its eventual surface manifestation at many levels.",
        "The basic processing starts with a semantically meaningful piece of representation which is decomposed into its component pieces via network traversal.",
        "The component pieces may then be further specified by re-entering the network.",
        "Given this rank-based decomposition (or stepwise decomposition), it is not unreasonable to assume that 1) decisions at a higher rank axe made prior to decisions at a lower rank – that is, the decomposition of a particular semantic unit may not be influenced by the eventual decomposition of its component pieces, and 2) the structural realizations of the component pieces of a decomposed unit must be handled independently.",
        "These criteria, which we call the independence criterion, are implicitly followed by current computer implementations of systemic grammar.",
        "Implementing a systemic grammar on computer has forced researchers to be very explicit about certain representational issues.",
        "Such explicitness (coupled with an implicit following of the independence criterion), has enabled the uncovering of certain constructions which appear to be problematic for the systemic framework.",
        "For instance, Matthiessen points out that: \"There are various structural relationships (e.g., discontinuity...) that do not pose a problem for the informal box diagram representation [used by systemic linguists] but prove to be a problem for explicit realization statements [necessary for computer implementations].\"",
        "[Matthiessen Kasper 1985, p. 6].",
        "We believe that the same applies to (so called) long distance dependencies.",
        "It can be argued that the problems uncovered by Matthiessen are not due to explicit realization statements, but rather result from using explicit realization statements coupled with the implicit assumption that grammatical functions are realized as atomic strings.",
        "We further argue that if the independence criterion is to be followed, the choice of realization operators, the scope of the realization operators, and the choice of appropriate units of realization must be considered together.",
        "Consider, for example, the problems which arise in generating a sentence containing a long distance dependency when atomic strings are taken as the structural unit of realization.",
        "Consider the sentence: \"It was Mary that John thought Bill liked\".",
        "A natural decomposition would result in the semantic subpieces which correspond to \"john thought\" and the dependent clause \"bill liked mary\".",
        "The extraction of \"mary\" will be done subsequent to this decomposition; this extraction should influence the realization of the structural unit for the dependent clause (and should not affect the functional decomposition).",
        "But notice, if we assume the structural units of realization are atomic strings, we can get \"John thought it was Mary that Bill liked\" but not our desired utterance \"It was Mary that John thought Bill liked\" because to do so would necessitate inserting one atomic string (\"John thought\") within another (\"It was Mary that Bill liked\").",
        "Two possible ways to get around this problem are: (1) to say that the intended sentence is made up of several independent but smaller functions (e.g., realized as \"john thought\", \"bill\", \"liked\", \"mary\").",
        "But this solution goes against the stepwise decomposition into semantically meaningful units.",
        "Moreover, this method is not sufficient because we can always consider a sentence that requires one more level of embedding which would necessitate a revision of units.",
        "(2) not to break up the sentence into the two functional constituents mentioned, but use some other decomposition.",
        "But this is not a correct solution because then one functional decision at a lower level (extraction of \"mary\") influences another which logically precedes the first (decomposition in the clause complex network).",
        "In order to follow the independence criterion (i.e., realization of different independent functions do not influence each other), the structural units being built as the realization of a grammatical function must be capable of localizing all structural dependencies because they must embody all constraints specified with that function.",
        "In addition, the chosen structural units must be composable in such a way as to allow the surface string of one unit to be interspersed with the surface string for another (as was required in our example).",
        "If this is the case, then it makes sense that these structural units should be taken as the bounding domain for the realization operators.",
        "The structures used by TAGs have precisely these qualities and are thus an appropriate choice for a structural unit of realization in an implementation of systemic grammar.",
        "The structures used in a TAG have an enlarged domain of locality that factor all dependencies (e.g., agreement constraints, predicate-argument structure, filler-gap depen",
        "dencies or movement).",
        "Also the composition operations allow for the interspersing of words to obtain the ordering of utterances with or without discontinuity.",
        "In this paper we argue that if the structures used by TAG are taken as the structural units for systemic grammar with the operations of composition of TAG used to fit structures built at lower ranks into the evolving structures, then the generation of the above sentence can be done in a straight forward and general manner while at the same time maintaining the independence criterion.",
        "This sentence could be generated by adjoining a tree corresponding to \"John thought\" into the third tree shown in figure 3 which, after lexical insertion, corresponds to the string \"It was Mary that Bill liked\".",
        "As we will show later, this tree (rather than the other two trees in figure 3) is considered because of the decision to extract \"mary\".",
        "Notice that the adjoining operation allows the strings for the two independently derived clauses to be interspersed with each other."

        "Since the elementary structures of TAGs are \"minimally complete\" to allow for the factoring of dependencies, we have argued that they are appropriate structures that can be built and manipulated in an implementation of systemic grammar.",
        "They also form appropriate bounding domains for the realization operators.",
        "Our preliminary work on incorporating TAGs in the systemic framework gives us encouragement to believe that this is indeed the case.",
        "Second, in addition to justifying the use of TAG structures for systemics, we can show that we can handle the discontinuity (which we did not explicitly discuss for lack of space) and long distance dependency problem which plague other implementations of systemic grammars.",
        "The key point to make here is that not only are these handled but that generation of utterances with discontinuity or long distance dependencies is conceptually no different than generation of utterances without any form of discontinuity.",
        "Third, systemic grammar places emphasis on function over form and makes clear that functional distinctions in the input manifests themselves in the different available forms.",
        "It is clear that our approach brings this aspect of systemics to the fore front.",
        "Note that the different trees in a tree group yield various syntactic realizations of a single predicate-argument structure.",
        "As we step through the network, various choices are made on the basis of the functional content of the planned utterance.",
        "These choices will result in choosing one syntactic realization over another.",
        "Finally, what we have suggested calls for putting together two formalisms so that a mainly semantics driven processor (systemics) is able to reap some of the advantages of a syntax driven (TAG) approach.",
        "Currently a systemic network employs limited mechanism for carrying through the syntactic consequences of the decisions that it makes.",
        "Thus one of two things has to happen: 1. the network designer must anticipate all syntactic consequences and explicitly state each of them at the time a decision is made.",
        "This is not an ideal solution, especially when the network becomes very large.",
        "2. the system must depend on the environment being consistent in order to carry out the desired consequences.",
        "In this case the syntactic consequences are strung throughout the network (perhaps prompted by different questions that are asked).",
        "The environment must be counted on to answer those questions in a consistent fashion.",
        "Even if the information is straightforwardly captured in the environment (which is unclear), due to lack of the ability to carry out syntactic consequences, it becomes necessary to ask questions of the environment (to make choices) that are redundant.",
        "In addition, this arrangement goes against the systemic enterprise in which the environment keeps track of semantic content.",
        "The addition of TAG allows an independent mechanism (e.g., the TAG processing) to maintain consistent syntactic consequences of decisions made.",
        "For example, agreement constraints are precompiled into the tree.",
        "Also, for example, given the choice of a particular lexical item – once the trees for that item have been narrowed to one, the tree itself will contain the information about what functions must be expanded.",
        "Thus this information need not be included in the network as well.",
        "We believe that network design will be simpler because the incorporation of TAG makes possible clear demarcation of semantic choices from syntactic consequences.",
        "Also it allow for the separation of lexical idiosyncrasies into the lexicon rather than the network.",
        "Our work so far has been concerned with identifying the TAG structures as appropriate structural units in a computer implementation of a systemic grammar.",
        "The implementation decisions that have been discussed are given to indicate the logical consequences of incorporating the TAG formalism in the systemic paradigm.",
        "These consequences would necessarily be handled in any actual implementation (e.g., breaking processing into regions, associating elementary trees with regions, the nature of realization operators).",
        "Considerable work remains to be done.",
        "We need to investigate the consequences of using the TAG formalism on the design of the systemic network especially in terms of uncovering redundancy and separation of syntax, semantics, and lexicon design.",
        "While currently used networks will be helpful in this task, we anticipate considerable revisions in the network design due to the incorporation of TAG.",
        "Furthermore, we have only examined some functional domains and a subset of realization operations that will be required.",
        "These topics are the focus of our current research."
