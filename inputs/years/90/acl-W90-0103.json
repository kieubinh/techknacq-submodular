        "Syntactic and other knowledge mediates this computation of relevance.",

        "FIG is based on a large semantic network.",
        "Words are nodes in the network, the activation they receive represents evidence for their relevance.",
        "The basic FIG algorithm is:",
        "1. each node of the input is a source of activation 2. activation flows through the network 3. when the network settles, the most highly activated word is selected and emitted 4. activation levels are updated to represent the new current state 5. steps 2 through 4 repeat until all of the input has been conveyed",
        "Thus FIG is an incremental generator.",
        "Its network must be designed so that, when it settles, the node which is most highly activated corresponds to the best next word.",
        "This paper discusses only the network structures which encode syntactic knowledge.",

        "I have used a connectionist model because it is a good way to explore interactivity, parallelism, emergents, not because of fondness for connectionism-for-its-own-sake.",
        "Thus I have not attempted to develop a distributed connectionist model.",
        "Distributed models do have various advantages, such as elegant handling of generalizations and the potential for learning.",
        "Yet the current state of PDP technology does not seem up to building an interactive model of a complex task like language generation.",
        "I therefore developed FIG as a structured (localist) connectionist system.",
        "I have also not attempted to make FIG a 'pure' connectionist model.",
        "For example, updating constructions is currently done by a special process that goes in and changes activation levels and moves the cursor.",
        "(This process uses the third elements in the constituent descriptions of Figures 1-3, not previously discussed.)",
        "FIG could be made more 'pure' by doing this connectionistically, perhaps by adding new nodes with special properties.",
        "But this change would not improve F1G's performance, since there seems no need for the update process to interact with the other processes.",
        "A connectionist model of computation allows parallelism and emergents, but it certainly does not require them.",
        "Indeed, other generators built using structured connection-ism (Kalita & Shastri 1987; Gasser 1988; Kitano 1989; Stokke 1989) do not appear to exploit parallelism much, nor do they exhibit emergent properties.",
        "For example, Gasser's CHIE relies heavily on winner-take-all subnetworks, which cuts down on the amount of effective parallelism.",
        "Also, far from exploiting emergents, CHIE uses 'neuron firings' to model syntactic choices; these happen sequentially and the",
        "exact order and timing of firings seems crucial.",
        "Currently FIG has about 350 nodes and 1000 links.",
        "Before each word choice, activation flows until the network settles down, with cutoff after 9 cycles.",
        "This takes about .2 seconds per word on average, simulating parallel activation flow on a Symbolics 3670 (1.6 seconds on a Sun 3/140).",
        "The correct operation of FIG depends on having correct link weights.",
        "I have no theory of weights, indeed finding appropriate ones is still largely an empirical process.",
        "However there are regularities, for example, all 'inhibit' links have weight .7, almost all links from syntactic categories to their members have weight .5, and so on.",
        "Many of the weights have a rationale: for example, the link from np-1 to articles has a relatively high weight because articles get very little activation from other sources.",
        "No single weight is meaningful; the way it functions in context is.",
        "For example, the exact weight of the link from the first constituent of sub j-pred to noun is not crucial, as long as the product of it and the weight on the agentr relation is appropriate.",
        "FIG's knowledge is, of course, very limited.",
        "Adding new concepts, words or constructions is generally straightforward; they can be encoded by analogy to similar nodes, and usually the same link weights suffice.",
        "Occasionally new nodes and links interact with other knowledge in the system in unforeseen ways, causing other nodes to get too much or too little activation.",
        "In these cases it is necessary to debug the network.",
        "Sometimes trial-and-error experimentation is required, but often the acceptable range of weights can be determined by examination.",
        "This is a kind of back-propagation by hand; it could doubtless be automated."

        "I have proposed a new way to handle syntax for generation.",
        "The proposal also relies heavily on parallelism: part-wise parallelism, competition, and cooperation.",

        "This promises improved output quality without sacrificing speed, on parallel hardware.",
        "The proposal also relies heavily on emergents – it does not make syntactic choices nor build up representations of syntactic structure.",
        "The network representations of linguistic knowledge affect word choice and order directly.",
        "This work is not traditional linguistics, artificial intelligence, or connectionism, but uses techniques from all three fields.",
        "I hope this will stimulate further work in empirical computational linguistics, modeling human language production, and building useful parallel generation systems."
