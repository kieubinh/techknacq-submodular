        "Natural language generation is the deliberate production of text to meet the communicative goals of some underlying application program.",
        "It consists of the following major activities: (1) determining what information is to be communicated, (2) imposing a suitable order on the elements of this information consistent with the constituent structure of language and expressing the relative salience and newness of the elements, and (3) determining what wording and syntactic constructions to use.",
        "The first two of these activities are generally considered \"text planning\" and its output is the \"plan\".",
        "The third activity is \"realization\" and generally handles all of the linguistic decision making.",
        "While it is recognized that this division is problematic (Hovy, et al.",
        "1988), nearly all generation systems today make this division.",
        "One of the chief accomplishments of my work has been to bridge the gap between these two activities through the introduction of a new representational level that simplifies both their responsibilities.",
        "It both provides the choices available to the text planner to allow it to take advantage of the expressiveness of natural language and, through that control of the choices, prevents it from composing an utterance that is not expressible in the language.",
        "Most state of the art text planning systems follow a common design (see for example McKeown 1985, Derr & McKeown 1984, Paris 1987, or Hovy 1988).",
        "They start from a set of propositions, each typically verb-based and able to be realized independently as a simple sentence.",
        "Then they organize the propositions into a coherent discourse by combining them according to the dictates of predefined \"schemas\" representing plausible discourse relationships.",
        "Subsequent choices of concrete surface resources1 are all local to the propositions and not sensitive to the schemas or other context, except for the discourse-level connectives used in combining the propositions into complex sentences and occasionally a shallow discourse history governing the use of pronouns.",
        "In these approaches to natural language generation there is a gap between the plan, which is usually represented in the terms of the application program, and the resources used by the realization component to carry out that plan, which are the concrete words, syntax, morphemes, etc.",
        "The gap occurs because the text planner selects units from the application program and organizes them without simultaneously considering what linguistic resources are available for expressing them.",
        "These systems thus have no principled way of ensuring that their message is expressible in language.",
        "Of course, they do successfully produce texts: they ensure their plans are expressible by accepting limits to their expressive competence, e.g. each atomic unit in the plan is required to be a proposition, and thus can always be realized as a clause.",
        "Each unit can be independently translated into language using the linguistic realization component since there are few restrictions on the connection between clauses.",
        "Clauses can be connected with coordinate or subordinate conjunctions (e.g. \"and\", \"because\") or simply made into separate sentences.",
        "However, this kind of approach does not take advantage of the full expressive power of language, in which units can be much more tightly composed.",
        "In order to exercise the full expressiveness of language, text planning needs to address the internal composition of clauses and not just their organization into larger structures.",
        "Clauses in actual texts reflect a combination of multiple atomic units.",
        "Systems that ignore this and begin with units that are inevitably realized as kernel clauses (e.g. Mann & Moore 1981, Derr & McKeown 1984, Hovy 1988) have two major deficiencies: (1) they are presuming underlying programs have units of this size that may be simply selected for inclusion in the message and then realized intact, and (2) they are underutilizing the power of natural language, which can use complex noun phrases, nominalizations, adverbial phrases, and other adjuncts to pack information from multiple units into one clause.",
        "Moreover, the process of composing multiple units into one clause is a much more complex problem than simply ordering propositions in a text plan.",
        "What compositions are possible depends on what linguistic resources are available to realize the units involved.",
        "For example, an Army battalion that has been assigned a defensive mission can be said to be \"defending\", but if we say that a battalion that has been assigned an offensive mission is \"offending\" we mean something very different.",
        "There is no comparable resource available to fit that textual niche and either a different, more complex resource must be used or the whole text changed (e.g. \"attack\".",
        "Furthermore, different types of resources have different constraints on their composition: one can \"make an important decision\", but one cannot \"decide importantly\".",
        "In this paper, I address the problem of how we can constrain the actions of a text planner to ensure that it will never compose an utterance that cannot be realized and can still make use of the full expressive power of language.",
        "To do this, I introduce the notion of an abstract linguistic resource which groups together as the reified terms to be used by the planner just those combinations of concrete linguistic resources that are expressible.",
        "I have defined a level of representation in terms of these abstract resources, the Text Structure, which is used by the text planner to state its \"plan\".",
        "This intermediate level of representation bridges the \"generation gap\" between the representation of the world in the application program and the linguistic resources provided by the language.",
        "The terms and expressions in the Text Structure are abstractions over the concrete resources of language.",
        "They provide the text planner with terms that define the possible combinations of features that express the semantic categories available in the language, such as event, process, or instance-of-a-kind.",
        "By providing the text planner with a set of semantic categories, rather than letting it freely choose from the individual linguistic features that define the categories, the planner is prevented from choosing a combination of features that is not realizable.",
        "These abstractions in Text Structure further constrain the composition of the utterance by defining what kinds of constituents can be extended and how the semantic categories can compose.",
        "In this paper, I define the notion of an abstract linguistic resource for text planning by looking at (1) what are the concrete resources that the language provides and what are their abstract properties, and (2) which of those properties are appropriate to a text planner trying to compose an utterance from an application program.",
        "I then show a preliminary set of abstractions which is used in the text planner of the Spokesman generation system.",
        "This set was arrived at by both applying research results from linguistics and lexical semantics and empirically by connecting the generation system to an application program and producing text.",
        "The long range challenge of this work will be the continued development and refinement of this vocabulary of abstract linguistic terms to cover the full expressive power of natural language and determining the compositional constraints which will maintain the expressibility criteria."

        "In what follows we ground the notion of concrete resources by looking closely at one fairly simple sentence:",

        "The phrase structure is also a concrete resource, which expresses how the constituents group together and certain kinds of relations between them; in this example, the phrase structure tells us that \"movies\" are what is watched, that \"watching movies\" is what is liked, and that \"Karen\" is the one that likes watching movies.",
        "What is not there also expresses information.",
        "The fact that there is no determiner (\"a\" or \"the\") with \"movies\" indicates that it is not a particular set of movies being referred to (as in \"the movies\") but a general sample of movies.",
        "Note that it is not just the lack of the determiner that provides this information, but the features of the whole constituent the particular noun is in and the fact that it is plural: if the noun phrase were singular, then there would have to be a determiner before \"movie\" (*\"Karen likes watching movie\").",

        "The identification of which grammatical resources non-linearly co-occur and grouping those sets into single abstract resources is a powerful method of constraining the text planner to keep its choices only those that are expressible in language, as we shall see in the next section where we develop abstraction resources for the sets of concrete resources that appear in the example."
