        "Effective generation of prose demands not only knowledge of rhetorical structure but also rich models of entities, events and states, knowledge of tense and aspect, and mechanisms to track focus of attention with respect to discourse, time, and space.",
        "McKeown [1982] used discourse focus (DF) [Sidner, 1979, 1983] to guide the selection, order, and realization of rhetorical schema-based descriptions of database contents.",
        "McKeown suggested the following focus shift preferences to mediate among competing propositional content:",
        "1. shift DF to an entity mentioned in the previous proposition 2. maintain current DF 3. resume a past DF 4. shift DF to an entity most related to the current DF",
        "The three global registers (past, current, and potential focus) tracked DF and were updated by examining the content of a rhetorical proposition (instantiated with information from a knowledge base) guided by the type of the rhetorical predicate (e.g., identification, attributive).",
        "In contrast to schema-based systems, recent work based on Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) [Mann and Thompson, 1987] attempts to produce effective text using plan-based strategies.",
        "Only Hovy's [1988] implementation of RST has examined the task of conveying events and states.",
        "Hovy's [1988] \"structurer\" uses his sequence RST operator to produce the following narration of events in a naval domain (where C4 indicates a condition or level of operational readiness): Knox, which is C4, is en route to Sasebo.",
        "Knox, which is at 18N 79E, heads SSW.",
        "It arrives on 4/24.",
        "It loads for 4 days.",
        "To produce this text, Hovy's sequence operator is given a beginning \"action.\"",
        "The nucleus of the sequence operator allows the text to \"grow\" and indicate the circumstances, attributes, and/or purpose of this action.",
        "Similarly, the satellite of the sequence operator allows the text to indicate the at and/or details of the next contiguous action in some sequence.",
        "The satellite also includes a recursive call to the sequence operator for the next action.",
        "Unfortunately, Hovy's operators, like text schema, fail to indicate what effects these orderings or the addition of information at growth points have on the hearer.",
        "Therefore, they fail to characterize the motivation for selecting among the different arrangements that narrative employs to achieve specific effects on the hearer (e.g., creating interest, suspense, or mystery).",
        "In addition, the plan operator does not consider states as first order objects in some causal chain (the fact \"Knox is C4\" is just an attribute extending off the \"en route\" event).",
        "This is important because states have complex relations (e.g., enablement, causation) to other states and events in the world.",
        "Finally, sequences are assumed to be contiguous and yet events are often simultaneous or overlapping in time [Allen, 1984].",
        "This purely RST-based approach was improved upon by Hovy and McCoy [1989] by incorporating Focus Trees [McCoy and Cheng, 1988] to guide the ordering and interrelationships of sentence topics.",
        "This combined approach produced: With readiness C4, Knox is en route to Sasebo.",
        "It is at 79N 18E heading SSW.",
        "It will arrive 4/24 and will load for four days.",
        "Text coherence is improved not only by regrouping content (a result of restrictions on the traversal of the Focus Tree) but also by using tensed verbs (e.g., future tense of \"arrive\" in the last utterance) to explicitly indicate",
        "the temporal relations among events.",
        "Unfortunately, no details of how this tense is generated are provided.",
        "Furthermore, examination of human generated prose indicates that not only DF but additional constraints on temporal focus and spatial focus are necessary to produce lengthier prose.",
        "Therefore, the remainder of this paper rust details a tripartite theory of focus and proposes focus shift rules.",
        "Next an ontology of events and states is introduced that serves as the basis for a model of tense and aspect which, guided by temporal focus, is used to verbalize events and states.",
        "The temporal organization and realization of events is exemplified in the context of report generation.",
        "Finally, an example from a route planner is given to illustrate spatial organization and the use of spatial focus."

        "Saliency is determined by the frequency, uniqueness, importance, and so on of events in the domain as detailed in the previous section.",
        "After events are grouped topically in order of salience, the narrate-temporal-sequence plan shown in Figure 2 selects salient events and then exploits their temporal order to sequence them.",
        "As plan operator decompositions are achieved, they are recorded in a hierarchical text plan (a communicative action decomposition) which records the structure, order, and content of the final text (see Figure 3).",
        "Each node in the text plan corresponds to a plan operator which formalizes a communicative act.",
        "The leaf nodes of the text structure indicate speech acts with associated rhetorical propositions, rhetorical predicates instantiated with propositional content from the event/state structure.",
        "In Figure 3, the event sequence is introduced by describing the mission package which initiated the previous run of the simulation (#<air-strike-10>) by informing the hearer of its logical definition (i.e., superclass and distinguishing features) and then by indicating its constituents or components.",
        "Next events are narrated in topical groups, each of which is temporally sequenced.",
        "The text plan is linearized and each speech act with its rhetorical proposition is linguistically realized using a unification-based surface generator [Maybury, 1989].",
        "The final surface form of the text structure in Figure 3 is shown in Figure 4.",
        "The surface generator includes an orthographic layout module that examines the text structure and begins a new paragraph when a new discourse segment begins (e.g., before the introduction and after each topical narration sequence).",
        "While the plan operators guide the ordering of propositional content (and thus focus shifts), global registers for DF, TF, and SF are updated by examining the propositional content selected by the text planner.",
        "These registers are used by the surface generator to guide surface choice.",
        "For example, a noun phrase is pronominalized if it is given (versus new) and was the previous current DF.",
        "And by examining the relationship of speaker time (S), event time (E), and reference time (R based on TV), the realization component is able to choose appropriate verb tense (e.g., if E=R<S then use simple past).",
        "Similarly, the realization of temporal adverbs, which help to convey temporal relations among events, (e.g., \"and then\", \"three minutes later\", \"simultaneously\", \"before\", \"after\") is guided by the relationship of past to current TF.",
        "For example if the time of the current TF equals that of the past TF then connectives such as \"simultaneously\" or \"at the same time\" introduce utterances.",
        "Both temporal and spatial adverbs (exemplified in the next section) often refer anaphorically to the current TF (e.g., \"ten minutes later\") or SF (e.g., \"three miles away\").",
        "During realization, events that are of the same class, occur at the same time and share a semantic patient are combined as in \"One minute later Erfurt-A and Erfurt-D simultaneously fired a missile at offensive counter air mission 102.\"",
        "The adverb \"again\" is used when an event has already occurred, and thus functions as an anaphor.",
        "Other classes of adverbs can also enrich the event description.",
        "These include adverbs regarding manner (e.g., \"deftly\", \"sadly\"), rate (e.g., \"slowly\", \"rapidly\"), duration (e.g., \"for twenty minutes\"), frequency (\"every ten minutes\"), and numeration (e.g., \"seventeen times\").",
        "Some adverbs (e.g., manner, rate, durative, locative) regard internal properties of the event whereas others relate the current event to other events and therefore are external such as temporal adverbs (e.g., \"simultaneously\", \"yesterday\") or \"anaphoric\" adverbs (e.g., \"again\", \"as before\").",
        "The relationship of these and other classes of adverbials to DF, TF, and SF remains an interesting area for further work.",
