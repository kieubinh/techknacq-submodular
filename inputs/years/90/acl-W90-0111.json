        "Most models of natural language generation, be they computational or psychological, recognize that the task of text planning (also called conceptualization [14], [10]), comprises the following essential subtasks: (1) content selection and (2) content organization.",
        "The task of content selection (hereafter, selection) is concerned with computing, or retrieving from a knowledge base, the primary content of texts.",
        "Selection may also include a phase of content expansion, also called additional topic inclusion [8].",
        "Content expansion consists in inferentially generating or selecting additional material for expression in text, once the primary material is selected.",
        "The task of content organization, also called topic organization [8], content ordering or linearization [13], [14] deals with ordering the chosen content into a sequence of propositional (linear) representations, appropriate for realization into coherent text.",
        "Many text planning models concentrate chiefly on content organization and perhaps content expansion.",
        "Such planners accept as input a pre-selected, and to some extent, pre-sequenced collection of representations that serve as the raw material of text content.",
        "The knowledge base from which these input elements are selected, as well as the selection process itself, are treated to be external to the text planner.",
        "In such systems, whatever selection is performed by the text planner is confined to the task of choosing a subset of the input elements according to control exercised by knowledge sources resident within the text planner.",
        "Other examples of systems in which preselected content is input to the text planner include natural language generation front-ends to expert systems, database systems or other application programs in other words, a problem-solver or a host system which is devoted to domain-level non-linguistic activities.",
        "In some other models, such as those of Paris [23], the knowledge base from which much of the text content is drawn is resident within the text generation system itself.",
        "Selection in such systems is totally a responsibility of the text planner.",
        "In the TAILOR system of [23], for instance, facts describing objects are stored in a knowledge base, and the textual component selects the content of the description from the knowledge base under the regulatory influence of a user model.",
        "The urge to generate text is input to the generator in the form of a request for the definition of an object.",
        "In all cases, the beholder of the natural language output sees the text as coming from a single program which can perform domain-level tasks as well as text production tasks: the speaker and the thinker are one and the same.",
        "If the beholder were a text planning researcher, she could be inclined to pose questions about the origin of text content.",
        "Our recent research has been motivated and directed by the adoption of such a role.",
        "The problem of selection in texts (in our case, multisentential descriptive texts) led us to examine the nature of input to the text planner, and the boundary between the domain-level program and the text planner.",
        "When we regarded the thinker and the speaker as a unified whole, we were led to search for very general factors that influenced selection in diverse domains of discourse production.",
        "When we viewed domain-level activities and text planning activities as distinct tasks, we examined the division of duties between the text planner and its underlying program in the task of selection, and explored the conditions under which the modular boundary between the domain-level and the text-planning level could be kept intact and those under which it might break down.",
        "This paper is devoted to a presentation of our research on some issues pertinent to selection in text planning.",
        "We found that the fundamental notions that were crucial to understanding selection in text planning were salience and relevance.",
        "These are not altogether unfamiliar notions.",
        "Conklin and McDonald [2] and Waltz [33] describe some effects of salience in generating scene descriptions.",
        "Researchers in natural language understanding have studied salience and relevance in some detail and have used",
        "them profitably in their accounts.",
        "However, in the natural language generation research community, the terms are used in their literal sense, and often interchangeably, whereas in fact they are distinct notions.",
        "In this paper we present the notions of salience and relevance as they pertain to natural language generation, in particular, to (content) selection.",
        "Our presentation in section 2 is a synthesis of several analyses of salience and relevance in the disciplines of language understanding, psycholinguistics and communication.",
        "In section 3 we consider the coupling between domain-level tasks and text planning tasks from the point of view of selection.",
        "Our work in the domain of route description generation is presented in section 4.",
        "In this domain, interesting questions emerge regarding mode of knowledge representation, connections between text planning and domain-level problem solving, and selection.",
        "In the concluding section we briefly state our current work and research plans for the near future."

        "Salience explains the prioritization or foregrounding of objects or information.",
        "Such prioritization may arise from direct perception of the world or context, or from conceptual knowledge, built up by shared perceptual experiences of the speaker and the hearer.",
        "According to Sridhar [30] and Levelt [14], salience guides the direction of the speaker's attention by making certain aspects of a situation stand out relative to others.",
        "By virtue of being ascribed to factors of context, situation or background, salience is a relatively fixed notion, invariant with respect to specific perceivers.",
        "Salience information can therefore be lexicalized, stored as an invariant component of the knowledge base, incorporated as a structural property of the design of the knowledge base, and/or built into the control processes that select text content from the knowledge base.",
        "Perceptual salience arises from the prominence of external characteristics such as size (bigness), amplitude of sound (loudness), colour (brightness), etc.",
        "Osgood and Bock [22] call this factor vividness.",
        "Conceptual salience originates in (shared) experiential knowledge.",
        "For example, the slyness of foxes, the strength of gorillas, and other such distinguishing characteristics are conceptually salient [4].",
        "The head of a queue of people is a conceptually salient part of the queue with respect to its function [7].",
        "Conceptual salience also arises from the degree of unexpectedness, unusualness or deviation from the norm of an object or event, giving the object or event of description its information value and thus motivating its selection in the planned text.",
        "Salience is attributed to properties of objects as well as to components of complex objects.",
        "An important implication of salience for objects that possess it is the ease of their availability in the knowledge base or knowledge structure [34].",
        "The higher the level of salience of an object, the higher is its level of activation in the speaker's mind, and therefore, the greater is its probability of being selected in the speaker's description, and the earlier is it likely to be mentioned in the description.",

        "Input to the text planner is a sequence of skeletal plans generated by the route finder.",
        "The planner consists of two major submodules that correspond to two ordered stages of processing: (1) selector and (2) realization-specification (r-spec) synthesizer.",
        "The details of the r-spec synthesizer and other aspects of the route description generation system will be presented in [27].",
        "The selector augments the skeletal plan with additional information retrieved (or computed) from the knowledge base (map), possibly under the control of various knowledge sources.",
        "The output of the selector is an expanded plan.",
        "The expanded plan is input to the r-spec synthesizer, which accommodates the information in the plan into one or more r-specs.",
        "It attends to such tasks as forming predicates, choosing the utterance type and certain language-oriented tasks like topicalization, choice of verb modality and tense.",
        "The r-specs are input to the realization module which generates surface sentences.",
        "The text planner thus deals with two distinct sorts of representations, one of which is closer to the domain (knowledge-base) and one, to the language.",
        "What kind of extra information is selected?",
        "The following are some of the kinds of information selected at this stage.",
        "• Direction or orientation, as in the descriptions On West Pender going westbound it's bus number 19.",
        "Walk north on Renfrew.",
        "• Distance information, for realizing such descriptions as You walk north on Burrard one block as far as West Pender.",
        "• Landmarks and location descriptions for sources and destinations of route sections, as included in the descriptions Get off at Hastings and Kootenay right by the Kootenay Loop.",
        "On Hastings in front of the loop transfer to bus number 28 called Phi bbs Exchange.",
        "• Additional descriptions of route sections involving landmarks, as in Will cross Second Narrows Bridge to Phibbs Exchange on the other side.",
        "• Straightforward matters like retrieving names corresponding to route labels in the skeletal plan (bus number, bus name, etc).",
        "How is the information derived?",
        "Computation of direction (orientation) information requires availability of a coordinate system and additional inference modules.",
        "The text planner (selector) uses additional procedural domain knowledge for retrieving or computing orientation information.",
        "Information so computed is expressed linguistically as north, left, right, and so on, and incorporated into the text plan.",
        "The search and computation of orientation from a map using qualitative or quantitative information forms a separate subject matter of study by itself.",
        "Distance is expressed in route descriptions in terms of various units, as, for example, in one block, 200 yards or three stoplights, but may not be represented in the map in the same terms.",
        "In our system we simplify the task of distance estimation/evaluation by directly representing distances in terms required by the text planner.",
        "Retrieving landmarks for describing locations of sources and destinations requires examining finer-grainer spatial layout information at the neighbourhood of these points.",
        "Salience plays a key role in the choice of landmarks chosen for location description.",
        "Along with the tAsir of choosing the landmark comes the task of computing the locative relation between the two objects (for example, adjacence), and expressing the relation in language (as in right by).",
        "Salience also influences the choice of landmarks chosen for describing long route sections (as in will cross Second Narrows Bridge...).",
        "In our implementation we have represented certain landmarks along the bus mute stages.",
        "Given the endpoints of a route section, the landmarks along the way can be selected for description.",
        "It is to be noted that landmarks like the Second Narrows Bridge aren't quite points, but are idealized as points and represented in the knowledge base as such.",
        "Our implementation at present doesn't include the detailed representations and procedures necessary for deriving orientation, distance and location information.",
        "We sidestep the task by incorporating such information in the form required by the text planner.",
        "What is the rationale for selecting such information?",
        "The kinds of information described in this section are common in route descriptions, but are nevertheless secondary to the essential information contained in the skeletal plans.",
        "When a route section should be covered by a walk or a drive, some kind of distance information is required.",
        "Location information is crucial at transfer points (intermediate destinations).",
        "Additional descriptions of",
        "routes in terms of landmarks crossed give the prospective traveller a feel for how long she needs to be on the bus, train, etc, and assure her that she is still on the right track.",
        "Orientation information is given in bus route descriptions when the listener has to take a bus after a spell of walk (self-navigation), as evident in the description ...you want to walk north on Burrard one block as far as West Pender... and on West Pender going westbound it's bus number 19...",
        "But one cannot always attribute motives for including additional material in route descriptions.",
        "At present we include in the text plan all additional relevant material that can be extracted from the knowledge base.",
        "How is the selected information incorporated in the plan?",
        "Additional information selected at this stage is incorporated in a skeletal plan like",
        "by adding to the list or by argument-adjunction and replacement.",
        "For example, the skeletal plan given above may be expanded as: [source(lougheed_mall),dest(d(hastings@kootenay), loc(next(kootenay_loop))), rlabel(busid(busnumber(151),busname(vancouver))), via(brentwood_mall)] Discussion.",
        "We have used the skeletal plan as a substrate on which further information is deposited by the selector in the text planner.",
        "At the same time, the information available in the skeletal plan enables fast access to the information needed by the selector, by providing the route-label, source and destination names.",
        "This corresponds to our intuition regarding route description generation using visual search over maps: once we spot the endpoints of a route section, we can easily spot the additional relevant objects around the endpoints and over the route-section connecting them.",
        "The selector derives the information from the same knowledge base (map) consulted by the route fmder.",
        "The text plan thus has a dual function: (1) for selection from the knowledge base, in its skeletal form and (2) for conversion into text eventually, in its expanded form.",
        "The expanded plan also has a third important function: a copy of the expanded plan is retained in the discourse record for consultation when the corresponding r-spec and sentences, and the next expanded plan are generated.",
        "It thus provides a record of the objects that have been introduced in the discourse, and forms the basis for decisions on pronominalization, referential expression generation and other factors that govern text coherence.",
        "It is to be noted that the domain of route description generation involves the use of a knowledge base which is primarily object-oriented.",
        "The knowledge base consists of points, landmarks, bus routes, streets and so on.",
        "The route finder works with the knowledge base and gives some objects the status of source, destination and route-label in particular instances of route finding.",
        "The selector in the text planner picks up some more objects, endowing them with such attributes as landmarks, distance, direction.",
        "As the expanded plan stands now, it can just as well be expressed pictorially as a route-sketch."
