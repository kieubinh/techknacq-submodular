        "In this paper, we describe the high-level structure of naturally-occurring, extended explanations and contend that the organizational strategies currently employed for structuring short explanations are inadequate for generating this characteristic high-level structure.",

        "Evidence for the non-recursive nature of this structure is provided by repetition, which is frequently used in extended explanations for a wide variety of purposes.",
        "This device, whose use has been neglected by current explanation research, exhibits a distinct relationship to the structure of extended explanations, implying that it, too, cannot be generated by recursive strategies.",
        "Our analysis is based on several sources, the primary of which is the testimony before congressional committees regarding the Three Mile Island (TMI) accident ([Representatives, 1979], [Representatives, 19801).",
        "These explanations were punctuated with numerous interruptions and characteristically involved the operation of complex physical devices and extended causal chains of events.",
        "The majority of these explanations were planned beforehand and required many pages of text - typically five, ten, or more, exclusive of interruptions.",
        "Furthermore, the testimony comes from a variety of sources: operators who were on the scene as the accident developed; engineers who gave post-accident evaluations; executives from the company that designed the plant.",
        "This variety allowed examination of explanations of the same set of events from many perspectives.",
        "A secondary source was transcripts of a medical class involved in patient diagnosis.",
        "While these transcripts differed greatly form those of TMI - in particular, the explanations provided were relatively short; they were unplanned; and they were concerned with diagnostic strategy as opposed to causal events - they exhibited many of the characteristics found in the TMI explanations.",
        "The next section provides a brief overview of current models for structuring text, followed by a description of the basic block, the unit of discourse on which our model of discourse is based.",
        "We then identify three types of repetition whose use supports our contentions of the non-recursive nature of basic block structure.",
        "We conclude by describing the characteristics of high-level structure of extended explanations, followed by a brief description of our strategy for computationally generating this structure.",

        "The ideal case is one in which each child of the candidate accounts for approximately the same number of concepts.",
        "The balance each candidate achieves can be determined by comparing the counters of its children.",
        "At the same time, the candidate will be rated according to how closely its blocks conform to the ideal size.",

        "For example, if we know the user is familiar with the location in which the events occurred, basic blocks based on location should be given higher ratings; organizing an explanation around a framework with which the listener is familiar will facilitate his assimilation of the information.",
        "Once this process has been accomplished, the candidate with the highest rating will be selected as the best overall framework.",
        "At this point, the material has been effectively partitioned about the resulting basic blocks; the material within each individual block can then be organized using a top-down methodology (e.g., RST or schemas), and then realized into text."

        "This paper has identified several characteristics of naturally-occurring explanations that cannot be accounted for by recursive text organization strategies.",
        "While recursive methods such as RST and schemas are",
        "adequate for local organization of text, they are insufficient for the determination of high-level structure, providing neither criteria which describe what constitutes an acceptable framework for a discourse nor any clues as to how this framework should be constructed.",
        "We have presented a computational strategy for generating the high-level structure for extended explanations that addresses both issues.",
        "Our strategy is based on the basic block, a discourse unit consisting of an organizational focus and text structured about that focus.",
        "We contend that basic block structure cannot be adequately generated by recursive structuring methods, but must be identified by bottom-up strategies driven by the information to be conveyed.",
        "Support for our contentions is provided by repetition, a device frequently used in extended explanations for a variety of purposes.",
        "Our analysis of high-level structure suggests a strategy for generating extended explanations which we are currently implementing as part of a larger system designed to generate extended explanations in an interactive environment.",
        "The system is intended as a testbed for identifying viable organizational strategies and recovery techniques due to user interruptions within the basic block paradigm.",
        "We believe that our analysis of basic block structure provides criteria necessary for bridging the gap between the generation of short explanations and the successful generation of extended explanations by explicating how the framework of an extended explanation can be constructed and how repetition can be cohesively incorporated into it."

        "That is a very quick summary of the sequence of events.",
        "Let me turn to what we consider to be the significant factors in the accident.",
        "[Slide] We have identified six here.",
        "These are the same six factors which the NRC has developed and has discussed in some of their proceedings.",
        "Certainly, the delayed auxiliary feedwater was a significant factor.",
        "Auxiliary feedwater block valves should have been open.",
        "They were not.",
        "They stayed closed for about 8 minutes.",
        "That produced behavior in the reactor coolant system which the operators were not familiar with from their previous experience or from training, and inhibited their ability to get the accident under control.",
        "The second significant factor was the pilot-operated pressurizer relief valve not reseating.",
        "That was a straight mechanical failure.",
        "Probably of greater significance was the lack of recognition of that fact until 2 and one quarter hours into the event.",
        "A third significant item was the securing of the shut-off of the high-pressure injection flow prematurely.",
        "As you recall, I indicated that the high-pressure injection came on at approximately 1,600 pounds, as designed.",
        "And some of the pumps were shut down in subsequent minutes of the transient.",
        "And our calculations indicate that had those pumps been left on and allowed to perform the high-pressure injection function, that there would not have been core damage, there would not have been release of radioactivity at the level that was observed at the Three Mile Island incident.",
        "The fourth significant factor is related to containment isolation.",
        "We have talked a little bit about that here.",
        "The containment isolation design at Three Mile Island was one in which the isolation occurs at a 4-pounds-per-square-inch reactor building pressure.",
        "In other designs there are other events which trigger containment isolation.",
        "The significance of this isolation situation is that in the early phases of the accident GPU had an automatic transfer of fluid from the sump of the reactor building into the waste tanks.",
        "And in the early phases, when we were blowing the water, the steam, out of the relief valve into the quench tank and then alternately when the rupture disk broke into the bottom of the reactor building, fluid was being automatically transferred out of the reactor building into the waste tanks.",
        "The waste tanks overflowed and spilled onto the floor of the auxiliary building, and radiation was released from the auxiliary building.",
        "And this occurred in the period prior to the 4-pound, achieving the 4-pound pressure in the reactor building, and the isolation associated with that.",
        "I think this certainly calls for some reassessment.",
        "What are the signals on which you isolate the reactor building, and, I think equally important, the question of what lines do you isolate and what lines do you not isolate?",
        "Because there are some lines, such as the supply to seal injection and the reactor coolant pumps, you do not want to isolate; you want to leave those open.",
        "Other lines clearly you do want to isolate.",
        "So, I think it indicates a complete reassessment of the containment isolation philosophy.",
        "The fifth item, identified as the \"inappropriate emphasis on pressurizer level indication,\" early in the days following the accident there was a good deal of talk about erroneous pressurizer indication.",
        "And we have done a fair amount of investigation and satisfied ourselves that the level indication as displayed on the control panel was indicating essentially the amount of water that was in the pressurizer, that there was not an erroneous instrumentation reading, and that in fact he had an indication of how much water was in that pressurizer.",
        "The point here is that he interpreted that, apparently - we are doing a lot of reading between the lines here - but apparently he interpreted that indication as meaning he had a full reactor system when in fact what he had was a system where he had the temperature of the water in the hot leg of the reactor coolant system at the saturation pressure, and flashing and creating steam in the reactor coolant system, even though he had indications of full pressurizer all during the time that he was continuing to blow steam out of the pilot-operated relief valves.",
        "But I think the significant factor here is the inappropriate emphasis that was placed on the pressurizer level alone at a time when he had other indications available to him that should have triggered his concern about what conditions existed in the reactor coolant system.?",
