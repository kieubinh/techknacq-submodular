        "In the process of generating text, competent speakers/writers try to generate utterances which are best suited to attain their communicative goals with respect to a particular audience [Hovy 1987].",
        "In particular, speakers often anticipate the effect an intended message is likely to have on their listener/readers', and if this effect is adverse in some respect, the intended message is either withdrawn or complemented with rhetorical devices which counteract the effect.",
        "Although it is often the case that speakers use stereotypical information about their audience to accomplish this task, this information is usually sufficient to allow them to generate competent discourse.",
        "Computational models for discourse generation presented to date fall into a broad spectrum, where at one end we find the plan-based approach [Appelt 19821, and at the other the schema-based approach [McKeown 1985, Kukich 1983, Paris 1988].",
        "In the plan-based approach, a text plan which achieves a communicative goal is produced by reasoning about the effect of various speech acts on a listener's beliefs.",
        "In the schema-based approach, standard patterns of discourse are encoded using rhetorical predicates.",
        "Hybrid approaches which combine both strategies have been proposed by [Hovy 1988] and [Moore and Swartout 1989].",
        "In particular, Moore and Swartout expand the capabilities of a discourse planner to enable it to generate clarifying explanations in a dialogue.",
        "However, both types of discourse generation strategies are based on the implicit",
        "assumption that once an information item is understood, the only modifications that will take place in a listener's beliefs result directly from this item, and hence the listener will immediately acquire the presented information.",
        "That is, these strategies do not take into consideration the effect of indirect inferences drawn from the presented information on a listener's beliefs or the indirect effect of his/her existing beliefs on the acquisition of this information.",
        "Therefore, they fail to account for rhetorical devices which address beliefs that are indirectly related to a speaker's communicative goal.",
        "For instance, in the sample text in Figure 1 (shortened version from [Lynch et al.",
        "1979]) the communicative goal is for the listener to know the distributive law, however, the discourse which accomplishes this goal is preceded by a Contradiction to the applicability of bracket simplification to algebraic terms and a Revision of the application of bracket simplification to numbers.",
        "In this paper, we present a discourse planning mechanism which emulates a speaker's behaviour in a knowledge acquisition setting2 in order to generate a class of rhetorical devices (RDs), denoted Peripheral RDs, which comprises Contradictions, Revisions and Motivations.",
        "Given a communicative goal to convey an Intended Message (IM) to a listener, these rhetorical 2 The term knowledge acquisition setting describes a situation where one agent transfers an intended message to another agent with the communicative goal that second agent learn the transferred information.",
        "Hence, in such a setting, intended messages are not withdrawn.",
        "devices address beliefs presumably entertained by the listener which may affect the acquisition of the IM, but, unlike the beliefs addressed by Instantiations and Descriptions, are not directly instrumental to its comprehension [Zukerman 1990b].",
        "Our mechanism is based on ideas introduced in [Zukerman and Cheong 19881, and it follows the tenet that Peripheral RDs are generated to invalidate anticipated impainnents to a listener's comprehension process.",
        "To this effect, our mechanism departs from the existing discourse generation strategies, and adopts a predictive approach, whereby the effect of a message is simulated on a shallow model of a listener's beliefs.",
        "If an impairment to the comprehension process is anticipated by this model, the generation of a remedial rhetorical device is called for.",
        "In the following section, we briefly consider a model of a listener's beliefs capable of predicting commonly drawn inferences.",

        "We represent a listener's beliefs by means of a network whose nodes contain individual information items and whose links contain the relationships between the nodes (see Figure 2).",
        "The information in the network is represented at a level of detail which is consistent with the level of expertise required to learn the subject at hand, e.g., for a high-school student learning algebra, well-known concepts, such as numerical addition and subtraction, are primitive, whereas relatively new or complex concepts, such as bracket simplification, are represented in terms of more primitive concepts.",

        "This is a valid assumption for discourse generation, since one can not say more than one knows.",
        "However, for this mechanism to generate effective discourse on a continued basis, the model of the listener's beliefs must be updated by an independent assessment of the his/her understanding.",
        "In addition, our mechanism must be implemented on different domains and larger networks to test both its response time and the adequacy and number of the proposed rhetorical devices.",
        "As stated above, this may reveal the need to adjust procedure Impairment-Invalidate to enable it to control the number of the proposed Peripheral RDs.",
        "At present, research is in progress to extend the impairment invalidation paradigm to the generation of other types of rhetorical devices, such as Descriptions, Instantiations and Causal explanations, and to devise an algorithm to sort the generated messages according to rhetorical considerations (Zukerman 1990b).",
        "In addition, an alternative representation for MBs which keeps track of the sources of an inference is being considered.",
        "Further research is required to recognize and rectify possible misconceptions in the Common-sense Inference Rules, and to characterize conditions for the generation of rhetorical devices which satisfy a number of communicative goals.",
        "Finally, the effect of the knowledge representation and the rules of inference on the types of the proposed rhetorical devices needs to be further investigated."

        "This paper offers a text planning mechanism which supports the generation of explanations tailored to particular types of users.",
        "Our mechanism generates Peripheral RDs which help convey an intended message by anticipating and preventing potential impainnents to a listener's comprehension process.",
        "To this effect, it characterizes these impairments in terms of a model of a listener's beliefs and inferences, and simulates a listener's comprehension process on this model.",
        "Clearly, this process does not dispense with the need to interact with a listener, but it addresses commonly occurring impairments, thereby focusing the interaction.",
        "Furthermore, it is envisioned that the impairment invalidation mechanism will become a useful tool to guide the generation of cogent responses to user follow-up queries, as it can point to issues which are potentially troublesome."
