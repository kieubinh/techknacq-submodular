        "In German (and in many other SOV languages, such as Korean, Hindi and Japanese), a constituent of an embedded clause may be moved from that clause into the matrix clause.",
        "Consider, for example, sentences (1) in Figure 1.",
        "In German, the object of the embedded clause can be \"moved\"' to any position in the matrix clause, as in sentences (lb) and (lc).",
        "based on • process of \"verb cluster formation\", which avoid inter-clausal movement altogether.",
        "However, since embedding is recursive, the verb clusters cannot all be listed in the lexicon.",
        "Hence, from a formal point of view, a lexical or morphological analysis of verb cluster formation poses exactly the sante problems as scrambling interpreted as syntactic movement.",
        "A striking feature of scrambling is its freedom: there appear to be no systematic syntactic restrictions on the number of verbal arguments that undergo \"movement,\" nor on the distances over which they may move.",
        "Thus, any ordering of the arguments from all clauses is possible.",
        "To illustrate this freedom we will present two additional examples in which scrambling of a more complex nature occurs.",

      "heading": "3 A TAG Analysis",
      "text": [
        "The TAG formalism (for a recent introduction, see [Joshi 1987a]) is well suited for linguistic description because (1) it provides a larger domain of locality than a CFG or other augmented CFG-based formalisms such as IIPSG or LFG, and (2) it allows factoring of recursion from the domain of dependencies.",
        "This extended domain of locality, provided by the elementary trees of TAG, allows us to \"lexicalize\" a TAG grammar: we can associate each tree in a grammar with a lexical item [Schabes et al. 1988, Schabes 1990]4.",
        "The tree will contain the lexical item, and all of its syntac",
        "tic dependents.",
        "As has been shown previously, certain long-distance phenomena such as topicalization and wh-movement can be handled naturally within TAG [Kroch and Joshi 1985].",
        "Here, \"naturally\" means that dependencies are stated within the larger domain of locality (the elementary tree), i.e., each clausal tree still contains a verb and all of its arguments.",
        "Thus, in a lexicalized TAG, the effects of long-distance movement are achieved by adjunction.",
        "The word order freedom possible in the context of unconstrained scrambling, however, eludes the scope of TAGs.",
        "In this section, we will informally argue this formal result.",
        "By an argument very similar to Shieber's argument for Swiss German [Shieber 1985], it can be shown that the string language of scrambled High German is not a context-free language.",
        "However, the linguistic facts of German do not allow an extension of the argument: we cannot show that the string language is not a Tree Adjoining Language.",
        "From a linguistic perspective, the existence of some grammar that generates the string language of German scrambling is not in itself of much interest.",
        "For example, if we define a TAG grammar that generates the strings of scrambled German in which, however, some trees pair a verb with the arguments of some other verb, then we have not adequately described the linguistic facts.",
        "We are really only interested in linguistically motivated grammars, namely those that exploit the extended domain of locality and whose trees obey the constraint of containing a lexical item and all of its syntactic dependents (and nothing else).",
        "We will refer to such restrictions as \"co-occurrence constraints\".",
        "We can show that no TAG meeting the co-occurrence constraints can generate the sentences of German scrambling.",
        "We will argue this point in two complementary ways.",
        "First, we will consider the case of clauses with two overt nominal arguments.",
        "Then, ive will consider the case of clauses with one overt nominal argument.",
        "In the first case, the verb of the embedded clause subcategorizes for three NPs, one of which is an empty subject (PRO).",
        "There is no verb in German that subcategorizes for three NPs and an S, so in this case a recursively embedded structure is impossible, and we have only one level of embedding.",
        "We show that the language",
        "cannot be generated by a TAG that contains only elementary trees obeying the co-occurrence restraints.",
        "A linguistically plausible set of two such trees is shown in Figure 2.",
        "Consider the string NP?NPi NP1NP?",
        "V2 VI, which corresponds to the ordering in sentence (2b).",
        "It can easily be seen that this string cannot be generated by a TAG of the specified sort: after an adjunction the yield of the adjoined tree is segmented into at most two sections, while the yield of both trees would need to be segmented into three sections in order to be composed into the desired string.",
        "In the second case, the verbs of the embedded clauses subcategorize for two NPs, one of which is again an empty subject (PRO), and an S. We will argue that the language {a-(NP,, , NPOI/k .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "Vi I k E N and or a permutation) cannot be generated by a TAG which obeys the co-occurrence constraints, i.e., whose elementary trees have only two (non-vacuous) terminal leaves, NPi and•.",
        "The idea in selecting this language is as follows: we keep the verbs at the end in the inverted order required by embedding, and then consider all possible permutations of the NPs.",
        "For k < 4 TAGs that generate the possible permutations can be constructed; for k = 4 the construction is not obvious, but we will not give the details here.",
        "However, for k = 5 it is impossible.",
        "Consider the string w = NP3NP,NP5NP2NP4V5V4V3V2%/i.",
        "For this string, it can be shown that it is impossible to construct a TAG which meets the co-occurrence constraints discussed above and that generates the string.",
        "The proof is fairly involved; for details, see [Becker and Rambow 1990].",
        "In deciding whether scrambling as a linguistic phenomenon can adequately be described by a TAG or a TAG-equivalent formalism, it is crucial to decide",
        "whether or not sentences corresponding to the strings given above are indeed grammatical.",
        "In the case of the embedded two-argument clauses, examples are readily available, as in sentences (2a) and (2b).",
        "In the case of the embedded one-argument sentences, it is more difficult (but not impossible) to construct an adequate example because of the great depth of embedding.",
        "However, one might argue that there is a limit on the number of clauses over which a scrambled NP may move.",
        "If this were true, the number of resulting structures would be finite, so that they could be handled trivially by simple formalisms.",
        "Sentences (3a) and (3b) show scrambled NPs can move over two clauses, and we know of no evidence that convincingly establishes such a limit for higher numbers.",
        "The reluctance that some native speakers show to accept the more complex sentences is due mainly to processing difficulties, rather than to the ungrammaticality of the sentences.",
        "A similar phenomenon occurs when native speakers reject multiply center-embedded sentences as \"ungrammatical\".",
        "In summary, long-distance scrambling provides linguistic evidence that shows that scrambling is beyond the formal generative capacity of TAGs.",
        "In the next two sections, we will investigate two ways of extending the TAG formalism in order to achieve the necessary power.",
        "In the first approach, we will relax the immediate dominance relation of the elementary trees.",
        "In the second approach, we will relax the linear precedence relations of the elementary trees.",
        "In both cases, our concern will be to preserve the key properties of TAGs, namely their extended domain of locality, and the factoring of recursion from dependencies."

      "heading": "4 A Multi-Component TAG (MC-TAG) Approach: Relaxed ID",
      "text": [
        "One approach is to relax the ID (Immediate Dominance) relation within one elementary tree.",
        "Even in a standard TAG, the ID relation between a mother and a daughter node is not necessarily an immediate dominance relation because of the possibility of adjoining another tree at the daughter node.",
        "We propose to relax some of the ID relations of the auxiliary tree when it is adjoined.",
        "This can be seen as splitting up the auxiliary tree into parts, while still keeping a dominance constraint between the parts.",
        "As we will show, such a splitting of the elementary trees, interestingly, leads to a previously defined extension of TAGs: namely, that of Multi-Component TAGs (MC-TAG)",
        "[Joshi 1987a, Weir 1988].6 As shown in Section 3, a TAG meeting the co-occurrence constraints cannot derive the string NPPIP1- NP1 NP?V2Vi.",
        "It is obvious that in order to get this variation from the trees in Figure 2, the yield of the adjoined tree has to be broken up into three segments, which means that ig has to be broken up into two parts that are then adjoined to different nodes of a.",
        "This is exactly what relaxation of the ID relation can achieve.",
        "If the tree /3 in Figure 2 is split at the interior S node, i.e. by relaxing the ID relation between the two S nodes, we can construct a pair of auxiliary trees as shown in Figure 3, where the dashed line indicates a dominance relation.",
        "Sets of trees are exactly what the MC-TAG formalism introduces.",
        "In an MC-TAG, instead of auxiliary trees being single trees we have auxiliary sets, a set containing more than one (but still a fixed number) 6MC-TAGs have already been • used by Kroch and Joshi (Kroch and Joshi 1986] for the analysis of extraposition.",
        "It is interesting to note that the additional requirement that the foot node of one of the components of an auxiliary set dominate the root node of the other component in the same auxiliary set was also used by them.",
        "of auxiliary trees.",
        "For details of the definition of MC-TAG see [Joshi 1987a, Weir 1988].",
        "In an MC-TAG, adjunction is defined as the simultaneous adjunction of all trees in a set to different nodes.",
        "It is not possible to adjoin trees from the same set into each other.",
        "Thus, we can interpret TAGS with relaxed dominance as MC-TAGs, by identifying subtrees containing only ID relations with trees in an MC-TAG tree set.",
        "However, we need to introduce an additional constraint: the foot node of the first tree (/3) in the tree set of Figure 3 has to dominate the root node of the second tree (f32) after adjoining the tree set.",
        "This is indicated by the dashed link between the foot node of th and the root node of 132.",
        "For example, Figure 4 shows the effect of adjoining the tree set of Figure 3 into tree a of Figure 2, which yields the ordering of scrambled sentence (2b), NPa NPi NP1 NP?",
        "V2 .7 In defining adjunction for MC-TAGs, an issue arises that is irrelevant in the case of simple TAGs: do we restrict adjunction in such a way that members of a tree set must be adjoined into the trees of an elementary tree set, or do we allow adjunction into derived tree sets as well?",
        "With the restricted definition of adjunction (called \"local MC-TAG\"), MC-TAG has been shown to have a slightly greater generative power than TAG; however, local MC-TAGs still belong to the class of Mildly Context Sensitive Grammar formalisms (MCSG).",
        "Weir [Weir 1988] has also shown that MC-TAGs are equivalent to the Linear Context Free Rewriting Systems (LCFRS), which are the best known characterization of the MCSG formalism (though they are not an exhaustive characterization of MCSG).",
        "In particular, we know that local MC-TAGs are polynomially parsable.",
        "However, it can be shown that local MC-TAGs are not adequate for deriving all possible scrambled sentences in German (for a detailed discussion, see [Becker and Rambow 1990]).",
        "In fact, no LCFRS is powerful enough to capture scrambling.",
        "It is obvious that MC-TAG with the more liberal definition of adjunction (called \"nonlocal MC-TAG\") can produce all the possible versions of scrambled embedded sentences for any level of embedding.",
        "However, nonlocal MC-TAG has not yet been studied in detail, and it is currently not known whether nonlocal MC-TAGs are polynomially parsable.",
        "An alternative formalism, which we will call FO-TAG (Free Order TAG), is closely based on the LD/LPTAG framework presented in [Joshi 1987b].",
        "As does an LD/LP-TAG grammar, a FO-TAG grammar consists of a set of elementary structures.",
        "Each elementary structure is a pair consisting of one linear dominance (LD) structure (i.e., an unordered tree) and corresponding LP rules.",
        "The LD structure (which will, imprecisely, be referred to as a \"tree\" in this paper) is either an initial or an auxiliary structure.",
        "The LP rules may relate any two nodes of the tree unless one linearly dominates the other.",
        "However, these precedence rules can only be stated with respect to the nodes of an elementary tree; it is impossible to relate nodes in different trees.",
        "When an auxiliary tree /3 is adjoined into an initial tree a, the nodes of /3 are not ordered with respect to the nodes of a.",
        "However, even in languages with relatively free word order there are restrictions on movement.",
        "In order to capture these, we introduce two linguistically motivated constraints, the integrity constraint and the inheritance constraint.",
        "The integrity constraint, written A, allows us to express the fact that German does not allow scrambling into or out of certain constituents, such as NPs and CPs (tensed clauses).",
        "If we have AX for some node X, then any node which is not in the subtree rooted at X and which does not dominate X must either precede or follow every node in the subtree rooted in X.",
        "The inheritance constraint, written $, forces inheritance and allows us to capture the clause-final position of the verb in German.",
        "If we have $X for a node X, then when the tree of which X is a node is adjoined into another tree at node A, X inherits all LP rules specified for A.",
        "As an example, consider sentences (2a) and (2b) given in Section 2.",
        "The initial trees along with the LP rules and constraints are shown in Figure 5.",
        "Adjunction yields the structure shown in Figure 6.",
        "Note that only one of the possible orderings of the nodes, corresponding to sentence (2b), is shown.",
        "It is easy to see that FO-TAG can generate all scrambled configurations, while obeying' the co-occurrence",
        "constraint.",
        "As in the case of nonlocal MC-TAGs, it is immediately obvious that FO-TAG is not an LCFRS; the question of polynomial parsability remains open, as does the question of the generative power of FO-TAG.",
        "We are currently investigating these issues.",
        "From a linguistic point of view, it is interesting that the same linguistic phenomenon can be handled by two very different formalisms.",
        "Scrambling is currently attracting much attention from syntacticians working in the GB framework.",
        "One question as yet unresolved is whether clause-internal scrambling is the same type of syntactic movement as long-distance scrambling.",
        "In FO-TAG, both types of movement are created by the same formal device, namely the underspecification of LP rules.",
        "In the case of MC-TAG, only long-distance scrambling can be simulated by multicomponent adjunction; clause-internal scrambling must be handled by some other means (such as metarules, which function as an abbreviatory device for listing a finite set of elementary trees), since it is impossible to adjoin one tree into another tree of the same tree set.",
        "There are several other syntactic issues which are currently being debated in the linguistic literature, and for which the two formalisms make different predictions.",
