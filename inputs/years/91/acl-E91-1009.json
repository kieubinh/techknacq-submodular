        "(1) A NP can bind pronouns in its scope",
        "Taken that the \"scope of a NP\" means the scope of the (generalized) quantifier the NP translates to, and that pronouns are semantically represented by individual variables, Binding principle (1) more or less directly corresponds to the conditions on variable binding in predicate logic, and therefore has a great deal of intuitive plausibility with it.",
        "Accordingly, it is explicitly or silently assumed as the basic principle for pronoun binding in many theoretical and computational approaches to the semantics of natural language.",
        "Principle (1) makes correct predictions for a wide range of natural language examples (we disregard the distinction between reflexive and non-reflexive pronouns throughout this paper).",

        "(4) Every professor who owns [Np a bookii reads iti",
        "This is the well-known \"donkey-sentence problem\" which motivated the DRT-style reformulation of natural language semantics (Discourse Representation Theory: Kamp 1981; File Change Semantics: Heim 1982).",
        "The solution that DRT provides for the donkey sentence problem can be roughly outlined as follows: The common semantic function of non-anaphorical noun phrases is the introduction of a new discourse referent, which is in turn available for the binding of anaphoric expressions.",
        "Beyond this basic function, non-anaphorical noun phrases subdivide into genuine quantifiers (e.g., every professor), and non-quantificational NPs (e.g., the indefinite NP a book).",
        "Only the former bear scope.",
        "An every-NP, e.g., triggers the introduction of a complex condition of the form K1 K2, where K1 and K2 are sub-DRSes representing the restriction and the scope of the quantification respectively.",
        "Indefinite NPs just contribute a new discourse referent (together with some descriptive material in terms of conditions on the discourse referent), which is placed in a larger structure.",
        "This larger structure can be the top-level DRS or some sub-DRS according to the sentence-internal environment of the analyzed NP.",
        "Indefinite NPs do not have scope by themselves.",
        "It follows that Principle (1) cannot apply to Sentence (4), if it is taken literally.",
        "However, the model-theoretic interpretation for complex conditions is defined in a way that indefinite NPs share quantificational force and scope with their \"host quantifier\" (i.e., the quantificational NP whose representation contains the discourse referent introduced by the indefinite on the top-level of its restriction part).",
        "Accordingly, an indefinite NP should observe the restrictions on binding imposed by that larger quantificational structure.",
        "Therefore, the original binding principle (1) must be replaced by something like (5).",
        "(5) A NP a can bind a pronoun 3 provided that f3 is in the scope of the host quantifier of a's discourse referent.",
        "Actually, the revised binding principle (5) permits binding in (4), whereas the indicated binding in (6) is excluded under the preferred reading where every professor outscopes a book, which is in accordance with intuitions.",

        "Standard DRT tries to give a general account for the constraints on anaphoric binding by specifying an accessibility relation between positions in a complex DRS.",

        "The former corresponds to the constituent structure of (7), the latter is due to a \"delayed application\" of the existential NP, which can be brought about by different syntactic and semantic techniques (e.g., Quantifier Raising: May 1985, Cooper Storage: Cooper 1983).",
        "Scope variation leads to an additional difficulty with the binding principle (1): If NPs (i.e., quantifier terms, on the standard account) are applied in situ, their semantic scope precisely parallels their c-command domain in surface structure.",

        "That the pronoun his is in the scope of the quantifier is obviously insufficient to license binding, which seems to be blocked by the fact that the object NP does not c-command the pronoun.",
        "This pheno-tnenon, the so-called \"Weak-Crossover Effect\", shows that the semantic principle (1) is too weak to properly constrain anaphoric binding, and has lead to a syntactic binding principle the classical formulation of which is given in (9) (cf. Rein-hart 1983, Williams 1986).",
        "(9) A NP can bind pronouns in its c-command domain.",
        "As more recent theoretical work has shown, the c-command condition is only an approximation to reality (cf. Stowell 1989).",
        "However, the precise definition of the c-command relation and the syntactic condition as a whole is not crucial for the argument.",
        "The important point is that anaphoric binding is apparently dependent on genuinely syntactic facts: The decision of whether a pronoun can be bound by a NP cannot be made on the basis of semantic information only.",
        "There are basically two possible ways out: On the one hand, one can pass the task of specifying anaphoric relations completely to syntax (this is the answer of GB grammarians).",
        "On the other hand, one can make certain portions of syntactic information available for semantic processing (proposals are made in Pollack/Pereira 1988, Latecki/Pinkal 1990).",
        "The choice between the two solutions seems to some extent to be a matter of taste: Plausibility reasons as well as efficiency considerations for natural language processing speak against the first solution.",
        "The fact that one has to import and process syntactic information within semantic interpretation seems to be a certain methodological drawback.",
        "I will come back to the question after having discussed a further complication in the next section.",
        "scope ambiguity and its consequences for anaphoric binding have been considered on the background of the standard semantic framework.",
        "Obviously, a two-reading analysis for sentences like (7) must be provided in a DRT-based analysis, as well, although it must be accounted for in a slightly different way.",
        "The two readings of (7) do not differ in the relative scope order of two quantifiers.",
        "Rather, the difference is that on the narrow scope reading, the discourse referent introduced by a book occurs inside the complex condition established by the universal NP (its host quantifier), whereas on the wide-scope reading it occurs on the top-level of the DRS.",
        "Scope ambiguities are not treated in the original DRT version; they are difficult to model with procedural DRS construction rules that operate on surface syntactic structures.",
        "There is however a convenient and straightforward way to combine the DRT formalism with the technical means of lambda-abstraction.",
