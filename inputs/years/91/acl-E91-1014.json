        "In explorations of the relationship between syntax, phonology and phonetics, it is now generally agreed that hierarchical prosodic representations are an important organising concept.",
        "As Pierrehumbert and Beckman (P&B, 1988), vividly put it 'We speak trees, not strings'.",
        "One influential view of the geometry of tree representations is Selkirk's (1981) Strict Layer Hypothesis.",
        "For Selkirk and others, prosodic structures and syntactic structures are objects of different kinds.",
        "Yet the nature of the mapping between them remains a question to which explicit, accurate and declarative answers have still to be formulated.",
        "This paper presents an alternative view in which phonetic constraints are incrementally associated directly with syntactic derivations.",
        "More exactly, derivations must simultaneously meet the well-formedness conditions on syntactic and prosodic labelling, thereby guaranteeing the declarative nature of the syntax-prosody interface.",
        "In turn, prosodic labels are associated with a set of equational constraints on phonetic objects.",
        "The theory is illustrated with a treatment of prosodic phrasing and tone scaling in standard, i.e. Tokyo, Japanese.",
        "The possibility of equating syntactic and prosodic structure in this way follows from a view of syntax with two characteristics.",
        "First, some commonly assumed syntactic constituents which never correspond to prosodic units are insufficiently motivated, so such constructions are given an alternative syntactic analysis which respects prosodic constituency.",
        "Secondly, the derivation of an expression with a given semantic interpretation, and hence its prosodic structure, may be systematically under-determined by that interpretation.",
        "Syntactic structure is thus at least partly motivated by prosodic data, in accord with the concrete view of syntax presupposed in constraint-based grammars.",
        "Conversely, the results of Kubozono's (1987) careful phonetic experiments point to the existence of prosodic structures that are organised recursively and in other ways incompatible with the Strict Layer Assumption.",
        "Distinctions in syntactic constituency which have been argued to be unimportant for prosodic phrasing do appear to have clear phonetic exponents under controlled conditions, weakening the argument for autonomous prosodic structures.",
        "The paper is organised as follows.",
        "The elements of the syntactic model used in the analysis of Japanese are presented.",
        "We then approach the syntax-prosody interface from the opposite end, and look at the prosodic phonetics of Japanese utterances, trying to classify features of pitch contours.",
        "First, several relatively uncontroversial elements in the phonology of Japanese prosody are discussed – the minor phrase, the accentual and phrasal tones, declination and downstep.",
        "Then the Strict Layer Hypothesis and its application to minor phrasing and tone scaling are considered.",
        "Data from Kubozono (1987) is introduced to argue instead for the theory assumed here, and a preliminary treatment is presented."

      "text": [
        "I will identify the fundamental unit of Japanese syntax with the traditional category bunsetsu (phrase), comprising an open-class item with cliticised closed-class affixes.",
        "The open class lexical items are broadly classifiable as nouns and verbs.",
        "As described in Whitelock (1987), the closed-class items may be classified in two orthogonal dimensions.",
        "First, they form phrases with items of a certain category.",
        "Second, they indicate that such a phrase stands in some syntactic relationship (e.g. subject, modifier) to another phrase with a certain category.",
        "Thus the phrases of the language fall into the following four categories:",
        "The bunsetsu generally behaves as a prosodic unit.",
        "Although the syntactic structure of a phrase like (1) is generally taken to be as in (la), its prosodic structure must be as in (lb).",
        "Proposals to handle such 'bracketing paradoxes' have been made within the framework of extended Categorial Grammar (e.g. Moortgat, 1989).",
        "We will assume a Categorial Unification Grammar (CUG) (Uszkoreit (1986), Kartunnen (1987)).",
        "Whereas an extended CG might capture the polymorphism of a bunsetsu by the derivation step of type-raising, in CUG it may be represented simultaneously by the use of multiple features in the complex categories.",
        "Syntactic bracketings such as that shown in (la) are never assigned.",
        "Each complex category or sign includes a set of self features, plus the sign-valued features argument and result, which together with a direction constitute a function.",
        "The relevant structure of a typical sign, for the bunsetsu keiko ni, is shown in (2).",
        "(2) self:incat:n function:arg:(21self:cat:s dir: right res:[2]self:iobj:(11 This sign says 'if a functor is looking for me, it probably needs to know I'm a noun.",
        "But I am also a function from a sentence of which I am the indirect object into itself'.",
        "Note the assumption that well-formedness of the functional representations (i.e. those which include subj, obj etc.)",
        "is independently characterised (cf.",
        "Coherence and Completeness in LFG (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982)).",
        "This leads to a massive simplification in the combinatorial syntax.",
        "Karttunen (1987) proposes a similar treatment for Finnish.",
        "Furthermore, I treat free verb forms as S, an approach motivated by the zero-pronominal property of Japanese (see Whitelock 1991 for further details).",
        "Also note, contra other work in extended CG (e.g. Barry and Pickering (1990)), that this formulation identifies the function in a combination with the dependent in a functional dependency representation, and the argument with the head.",
        "The syntactic rules define three ways of building signs.",
        "(3) shows rule A (essentially function application) in PAIR-II notation.",
        "The backward version of this rule (L) is the rule of morphological combination.",
        "Unlike a syntactic functor, a morphological functor, i.e. an affix, will typically have quite distinct values of <function arg> and <function result>.",
        "The chaining rule (C) in (4) constructs the mother sign with self features from the functor sign rather than the result sign.",
        "Finally, the merging rule (M) in (5) combines two functors looking for the same argument:",
        "(5) M – > D1,D2 (M)",
        "Though the details are specific to Japanese, it is possible to develop rules of these types for other -76-languages.",
        "Like an extended CG, but unlike the Lambek calculus, CUG is not structurally complete (i.e. not every substring may be given an analysis).",
        "Merging and chaining both correspond approximately to composition in extended CG.",
        "However, the CUG formulation brings out the essential difference between them.",
        "A constituent built by chaining represents a head lacking a dependent, while merging combines dependents lacking a head.",
        "Their effect on derivation depends on the headedness of the language concerned.",
        "The main effects are summarised in Fig. 1 (where <=> denotes truth equivalence).",
        "left-branching right-branching language language",
        "The important aspects of this model are as follows.",
        "First, all structures are directly generated by the grammar.",
        "The <=> is not a rule for deriving one structure from another.",
        "Secondly, the branching structure may be sensitive to constraints other than semantic ones.",
        "In particular, applicatively right-branching structures may be given alternative, psychologically more plausible, analyses.",
        "Such analyses are useful in modelling intonation phenomena such as the prosodic bracketing of English phrases like (6) (generated using the English Chain rule), whose applicative bracketing is given in (6a).",
        "In Fig 3a, the division of the utterance into minor phrases (g) (P&B's accentual phrase) is highlighted.",
        "A minor phrase shows exactly one pitch peak; in this utterance, the minor phrases correspond exactly to bunsetsu.",
        "In the section on minor phrasing below, we will look more closely at the relationship between the two.",
        "Fig.",
        "3b draws attention to the distinction in shape between the first and the latter two minor phrases.",
        "The steep drop in pitch from ma to i in umai, and from mi to mo in nomimono, represents the pitch accent proper.",
        "The presence and location of a pitch accent is a lexical property, and its shape is fixed.",
        "In contrast, the gentle fall covering the rewa of sorewa is a result of sore's lexical specification as unaccented.",
        "In such cases, a lower pitch peak than the accented one is realised early in the minor phrase.",
        "In fact, in minor phrases with a late accent, this early peak is also distinguishable, so this 'phrasal' tone can be assumed present in all minor phrases.",
        "Note the phonetic justification of this prosodic category as the domain of high tone linking.",
        "The diagram is annotated according to the notation of Pierrehumbert (1980).",
        "The pitch accent is represented as a sequence of tones, here H+L, with the tone that is aligned with the text marked *, hence H*+L.",
        "The L tone of the accent is aligned with respect to this.",
        "The phrasal H tone and the boundary L tones, L%, are also shown.",
        "P&B clearly demonstrate that their sparse tone model, built from pitch accents, phrasal H tones and boundary L tones, is superior to the standard Autosegmental account (e.g. Haraguchi, 1977), where each mora has a fully specified tone.",
        "Their careful phonetic experiments show that pitch is a simple interpolation between certain critical points.",
        "In this paper, the alignment of tones will not be considered.",
        "In English, the repertoire of pitch accents leads to phrases with a variety of tunes, including alignment contrasts such as that between H+L* and H*+L.",
        "But in Japanese, the tunes are restricted to the ones in (8).",
        "I have bracketed the boundary tones at both ends to indicate that they belong to both preceding and following phrases - they are ambiphrasal.",
        "More exactly, I treat a boundary tone between two minor phrases as a property of the major phrase which dominates both of them, though I don't discuss L-tone scaling in the paper.",
        "In fig. 3c, the overall downward slope of the pitch trace is picked out.",
        "Such a slope, about 10Hz/sec, is often cited as an intonational universal and linked to physiological properties of the speech system.",
        "Experiments demonstrate that the second of two equal tones is typically perceived as higher.",
        "This phonetic property, declination, must be clearly distinguished from the phonological property downstep or catathesis, as also illustrated in fig. 3c.",
        "• • •• • • • I downstep •••••40 • • • • • declination• • • • •.° • • • so re wa u ma i no mi mo no•.. •",
        "The pitch difference between the accent H tones of the last two phrases is significantly greater than can be accounted for by declination alone.",
        "Several authors (Poser, 1987, P&B, Kubozono) have demonstrated that this effect occurs precisely because an accent lowers all tones in a subsequent phrase.",
        "P&B quantify the fact of downstep with a speaker specific constant C, 0.5, in a pitch range normalised to 1).",
        "In effect, a tone in a phrase following an accented phrase is c times the height it would be following an unaccented phrase.",
        "The prosodic category major phrase is justified phonetically as the domain of downstep; the precise character of major phrases is a point at issue in this paper.",
