        "There is an increasingly widespread view that linguistic behaviour results from the complex interaction of multiple sources of partial information.",
        "This is exemplified by the rapidly growing body of work on natural language syntax and semantics such as the Unification-Based Grammar Formalisms.",
        "Similarly, in phonology there is a popular view of phonological representations as having the same topology as a spiral-bound notebook, where segments (or slots) are strung out along the spine and each page gives a structural description of that string according to some descriptive vocabulary.",
        "Crucially only those segmental strings which are licensed by all of the independent descriptions are acceptable.",
        "The practical difficulty is to come up with a model of grammatical organization which allows the right information to be brought to bear at the right stage.",
        "One model which looks particularly attractive in this regard considers the traditional modules of grammar (i.e. syntax, semantics and phonology) not in series where the output of one feeds into the input of the next, but rather in parallel, where each module exerts independent constraints.",
        "For example, a morpheme may be represented as a complex consisting of a semantic expression, a constraint on (morpho)syntactic distribution, and a phonological description.",
        "The combination of morphemes is then subject to three independent calculi, one per domain.",
        "The result is a compositional account of the relationship between form and meaning, as evidenced in the work of Bach (1983), Hoeksema & Janda (1988) and Wheeler (1988).",
        "However, all these proposals have assumed that phonological representations are merely linear I We are indebted to Mike Reape, Ewan Klein and members of the Edinburgh Applied Logic group for discussions of the material presented here.",
        "We are grateful for the support of ESPRIT Basic Research Action 3175 (DYANA) and SERC post-doctoral fellowship B/ITF/255.",
        "sequences of segments.",
        "Such a restriction renders a theory incapable of expressing the observations which have been made in the non-linear phonology literature (e.g. Goldsmith 1990).",
        "Bird & Klein (1990) and Bird (1990) have endeavoured to show how the compositional approach can be liberated from a purely linear segmental view of phonology.",
        "This paper exemplifies and extends those proposals.",
        "The first section presents a logical language for phonological description.",
        "The second section shows how it has sufficient expressive power to encompass a variety of observations about syllable structure.",
        "The final section discusses further observations which can be made about Arabic syllable structure, and provides an illustrative treatment of so-called non-concatenative morphology in the perfect tense verb paradigm."

        "Therefore, the conjugations are not merely sequences of complete syllable templates, but rather they are sequences bounded by unsyllabified (or extrametrical) consonants.",
        "The definition of II should therefore be modified to be Mac A M (cr A (po)) A M (cr A (u)) 1°.",
        "This is intended to leave open the possibility for the final consonant to be syllabified with the second syllable or with the third syllable, while simultaneously requiring it to ultimately be syllabified somewhere."

        "In this article we have presented an application of interval based tense logic to 'non-linear' phonology (specifically, 'autosegmental' phonology, Goldsmith 1990), and exemplified it using data from Arabic (McCarthy 1981).",
        "The chief difference between this view of phonology and its purely segmental predecessors is its use of overlapping intervals of time.",
        "As argued in (Bird 1990), the three primitives: dominance, precedence and overlap are sufficient to represent hierarchically and temporally organized phonological structure.",
        "Here we have taken a standard language of interval based tense logic, augmented it with an extra operator 0 to express phonological dominance, and employed nominals to enable us to label nodes.",
        "A universal theory of syllable structure was expressed in L, to which further generalizations were added for Arabic.",
        "We then showed how so-called `non-concatenative' morphology might be treated, and indicated how the phonological notions of exrrametricality and licensing were cashed out.",
        "The analysis of Arabic did not require recourse to separate consonant and vowel tiers (following Hudson 1986).",
        "Rather, consonantisms (and vo-calisms) are simply partially specified phonological structures which may be combined using logical conjunction.",
        "Even so, the exemplification given was for but a tiny fragment of Arabic phonology and much work is still to be done.",
        "For example, nothing was said about the vocalisms.",
        "The move from linear to non-linear phonology parallels the move from a purely Priorean tense logic in F and P to interval based systems in F, P and 0.",
        "The view of phonology emerging from the present study is significantly more formal than many of its contemporaries (cf. Bird & Ladd 1991), and suggests that enhanced modal formalisms may provide a natural foundation for rigorous phonological theorizing.",
        "Finally, there would seem to be good reasons for being confident that complex phonological descriptions can now be fully incorporated into feature structure based grammar frameworks.",
        "Reape's (1991) logical foundation for these frameworks and the phonological arguments in favour of adopting feature structures (Hayes 1990, Bird 1991) are but two parts of the one story.",
        "I°Note that the exhaustiveness condition L(a -+ i V j) and the sequencing constraints in the earlier version of (II) must be expressed here also.",
        "They are omitted for the•sake of readability."
