      "text": [
        "When a text-to-speech synthesis system is used, it is likely that the text being processed will contain a few words which do not appear in the lexicon as entries in their own right.",
        "If the lexicon consists only of whole-word entries, then the method for producing a pronunciation for such \"unknown\" words is simply to pass them through a set of letter-to-sound rules followed by word stress assignment rules and vowel reduction rules.",
        "The resulting pronunciation may well be inaccurate, particularly in English (which often shows a poor relationship between spelling and pronunciation).",
        "In addition, the default set of word classes assigned to the word (noun, verb, adjective) will be too general to be of much help to the syntactic parsing module.",
        "However, if the lexicon contains individual morphemes (both \"bound* and \"free\"), an unknown word can be analysed into its constituent morphemes.",
        "Stress assignment rules will then be more likely to yield the correct pronunciation, and any characteristic suffix that may be present will allow for the assignment of a more accurate word class or classes (eg.",
        "+nese denotes a noun, +ly an adverb).",
        "Morphological analysis of words will therefore allow a significantly larger number of \"unknown\" words to be handled.",
        "Novel forms such as hamperance, and thatcherisation would probably not exist in a whole-word dictionary, but could be handled by morphological analysis using existing morphological entries.",
        "Also, the ability to deal with compound words would allow for significantly higher accuracy in pronunciation assignment.",
        "A problem arises, however, if one or more of the word's constituent morphemes are not present in the morphological dictionary.",
        "In this case, the morphological analysis will fail, and the entire word will be passed to the letter-to-sound rules, with concomitant probable loss of accuracy in pronunciation assignment and word class assignment.",
        "It is far more likely that the missing morpheme will be a root morpheme rather than an affix, since the latter morphemes form a closed class which may be exhaustively listed, whereas the former form an open class which may be added to as the language evolves (eg.",
        "ninja, Chunnel, kluge, yomp).",
        "Therefore, it would be preferable if any closed-class morphemes in a (putatively) polymorphemic un-- 101 - known word could be recognised and separated from the remaining material, which would then be assumed to be a new root morpheme.",
        "Letter-to-sound rules would then be applied to this putative new root morpheme (the pronunciation of the known material would be derived from the lexicon).",
        "The advantages of this method are that the pronunciation and word stress assignment are more likely to be accurate, and also that, if there is a suitable suffix, the correct word class may be assigned (eg.",
        "in yomping, from yomp (unknown root) and +ing (known verb or noun suffix), which will be characterised as a verb or noun).",
        "Thus, in the case of preamble, the stripping of the prefix pre will allow for the correct pronunciation /p r ii ambe 1/: if the entire word had been passed to the letter-to-sound rules, the incorrect pronunciation /p r ii m b C 1/ would have resulted.",
        "In addition to affixes, known root morphemes could also be stripped to leave the remaining unknown material.",
        "For example, without morphological analysis, penthouse may be wrongly pronounced as /p e nth au s/, with a voiceless dental fricative.",
        "It is known that letter-to-sound rules are more accurate if they are not allowed to apply across morpheme boundaries (see [1, Ch.",
        "6]), and this method takes advantage of that fact.",
        "Thus greater accuracy is obtained, for polymor-phemic unknown words, if known morphs can be stripped before the application of letter-to-sound rules.",
        "It is this task that the work described below attempts to carry out.",
        "The Alvey Natural Language Tools Morphological System ([5],[6]), already provides a comprehensive morphological analyser system.",
        "This system allows morphological analysis of words into morphemes based on user-defined rules.",
        "The basic system does not offer analysis of words containing unknown morphemes, nor does it provide a rank ordering of the output analyses.",
        "Both these latter features have been added in the work described below.",
        "The system consists of a two tier process: first a morphological analysis, based on Kosken-niemi's two-level morphology ([3[); secondly the statement of morphosyntactic constraints (not available in Koskenniemi's system) based on a GPSG-like feature grammar.",
        "The morphographemic rules are specified as a set of high level rules (rather than directly as finite state transducers) which describe the relationship between a surface tape (the word) and a lexical tape (the normalised lexical form).",
        "These rules specify contexts for pairs of lexical and surface characters.",
        "For example a rule +:e { < s:s h:h > s:s x:x z:z y:i } --- 0:8 specifies that a surface character e must match with a lexical character + when preceded by one of sh, s, x, z or the pair y: i (as in skies to sky+s), and succeeded by s. The \"---\" denotes where the rule pair fits into the context.",
        "For example the above rule would admit the following match lexical tape: box+s surface tape: b o x e a The exact syntax and interpretation is more fully described in [5, Sect.",
        "3] and [6, Ch.",
        "2].",
        "In addition to segmentation each lexical entry is associated with a syntactic category (represented as a feature structure).",
        "Grammar rules can be written to specify which conjunctions of morphemes are valid.",
        "Thus valid analyses require a valid segmentation and a valid morpho-syntax.",
        "In the larger descriptions developed in the system a \"categorial grammar\"-like approach has been used in the specification of affixes.",
        "An affix itself will specify what category it can attach (\"apply\") to and what its resulting category will be.",
        "In the work described here, the basic morphology system has been modified to analyse words containing morphemes that are not in the lexicon.",
        "The analysis method offers segmentation and morphological analysis (based on the word grammar), which results in a list of possible analyses.",
        "An ordering on these possible analyses has been defined, giving a most likely analysis, for which the spelling of the unknown morpheme can then be reconstructed using the system's original morphographemic rules.",
        "Finally, the pronunciation of the unknown morpheme can be assigned, using letter-to-sound rules encoded as two-level rules."

        "The method used to analyse words containing unknown substrings proceeds as follows.",
        "First, four new morphemes are added to the lexicon, one for each major morphologically productive - 102 - category (noun, verb, adjective and adverb).",
        "Each has a citation form of **.",
        "The intention is that the unknown part of a word will match these entries.",
        "Thus we get two-level segmentation as follows lexical tape: * 0 0 0 * +ing+s surface tape: Opar0OingOs The special character 0 represents the null symbol (i.e. the surface form would be parings without the nulls).",
        "This matching is achieved by adding two two-level morphological rules.",
        "The first rule allows any character in the surface alphabet to match null on the lexical tape, but only in the context where the lexical nulls are flanked by lexical asterisks matching with surface nulls.",
        "The second rule deals with constraining the *:0 pairs themselves.",
        "It deals with two specific points.",
        "First, it ensures that there is only one occurrence of ** in an analysis (i.e only one unknown section).",
        "Second, it constrains the unknown section.",
        "This is done in two ways.",
        "Rather than simply allowing the unknown part to be any arbitrary collection of letters, it is restricted to ensure that if it starts with any of {h j1mnqrvxy z}, then it is also followed by a vowel.",
        "This (rightly) excludes the possibility of an unknown section starting with an unpronounceable consonant cluster e.g. computer could not be analysed as co input +er).",
        "Second, it ensures that the unknown section is at least two characters long and contains a vowel.",
        "This excludes the analysis of resting as rest +ing.",
        "These restrictions on the unknown section are weak and more comprehensive restrictions would help.",
        "They are attempts at characterising English morphemes in terms of the minimal English syllable.",
        "A more complex characterization, defining valid consonant clusters, vowels, etc.",
        "would be possible in this formalism, and the phonotactic constraints of English syllables are well known.",
        "However, the resulting rules would be clumsy and slow, and it was felt that, at this stage, any small gain in accuracy would be offset by a speed penalty.",
        "The rules make use of sets of characters.",
        "Anything is a set consisting of all surface characters, BCDFGKPSTW and HJLMNQRVXYZ are sets consisting of those letters, V is the set of vowels and C the consonants.",
        "The character $ is used to mark word boundaries.",
        "The above rules are somewhat clumsily formulated.",
