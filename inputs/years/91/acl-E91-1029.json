        "In this paper we consider an approach to coordination involving \"composite\" feature structures, which describe coordinate phrases, and present the augmentation to the logic of feature structures required to admit such feature structures.",
        "This augmentation involves the addition of two connectives, composite conjunction and composite disjunction, which interact to allow cross-categorial coordination data to be captured exactly.",
        "The connectives are initially considered to function only in the domain of atomic values, before their domain of application is extended to cover complex feature structures.",
        "Satisfiability conditions for the connectives in terms of deterministic finite state automata are given, both for the atomic case and for the more complex case.",
        "Finally, the Prolog implementation of the connectives is discussed, and it is illustrated how, in the atomic case, and with the use of the freeze/2 predicate of second generation Prologs, the connectives may be implemented."

        "Given a modern unification-based grammar, such as HPSG, or PATR/FUG-style grammars, where feature structure descriptions are associated with the constituents of the grammar, and unification is used to build the descriptions of constituents from those of their subconstituents, providing a treatment of coordination, especially cross-categorial coordination, is problematic.",
        "It is well known that coordination is not restricted to like categories (see (1)), so it is too restrictive to require that the syntactic category of a coordinate phrase be just the unification of the syntactic categories of the conjuncts.",
        "Indeed, the data suggest that the syntactic categories of the conjuncts need not unify.",
        "(1) a. Tigger became famous and a complete snob.",
        "b. Tigger is a large bouncy kitten and proud of it.",
        "Furthermore, it is only possible to coordinate certain phrases within certain syntactic contexts.",
        "Whilst the examples in (1) are grammatical, those in (2) are not, although the same constituents are coordinated in each case.",

        "*Famous and a complete snob chased Fido.",
        "b.",
        "*A large bouncy kitten and proud of it likes Tom.",
        "The difference between the examples in (1) and (2) is the syntactic context in which the coordinated phrase appears.",
        "The relevant generalisation, made by Sag et al.",
        "(1985) with respect to GPSG, is that constituents may coordinate if and only if the description of each constituent unifies with the relevant description in the grammar rule which licenses the phrase containing the coordinate structure.",
        "Example (la) is grammatical because the phrase structure rule which licenses the constituent became famous and a complete snob requires that famous and a complete snob unify with the partial description of the object sub-categorised for by became, and the descriptions of each of the conjuncts, famous and a complete snob, actually do unify with that partial description: became requires that its object be \"either an NP or an AP\", and each of famous and a complete snob is \"either an NP or an AP\".",
        "(lb) is grammatical for analogous reasons, though is is less fussy about its object, also allowing PPs and predicative VPs to fill the position.",
        "(2a) is ungrammatical as chased requires that its subject he a noun phrase.",
        "Whilst this is true of a corn 167 - plete snob, it is not true of famous, so the description of famous does not unify with the description which chase requires of its subject.",

        "Two approaches to this problem are immediate.",
        "Firstly, we may try to capture the intuition that each conjunct must unify with the requirements of the appropriate grammar rule by generalising all grammar rules to allow for coordinated phrases in all positions.",
        "This general approach follows that of Shieber (1989), and involves the use of semi-unification.",
        "Note that this does not involve a grammar rule licensing coordinate constituents such as a and /3: following this approach a and f3 can never be a constituent in its own right.",
        "An alternate approach is to preserve the original grammar rules, but generalise the notion of syntactic category to license composite categories – categories built from other categories – and introduce a rule licensing coordinate structures which have such composite syntactic categories.",
        "That is, we introduce a grammar rule such that if a and /3 are constituents, then a and /3 is also a constituent, and the syntactic category of this constituent is a composite of the syntactic categories of a and /3.",
        "Within a unification-based approach, this generalisation of syntactic category requires a generalisation of the logic of feature structures, with an associated generalisation of unification.",
        "This is the approach which we adopt in this paper.",
        "One of the consequences of this approach is that for (almost) any constituents a and /3, the grammar should also license the string a and # as a constituent, irrespective of whether there are any contexts in which this constituent may occur.",
        "Thus our grammar might admit in the garden and chases Fido as a constituent, though there may be no contexts which license such a constituent.",
        "Our approach differs from other approaches to cross-categorial coordination (such as those employing generalisation, or that of Proudian & Goddeau (1987)) which have been suggested in the unification grammar literature in that it involves a real augmentation of the logic of feature structures.",
        "Other approaches which do not involve this augmentation tend to over-generate (the approaches employing general isation) or under-generate (the approach of Proudian & Goddeau).",
        "Generalisation over-generates because in generalisation conflicting values are ignored.",
        "In the case of became, assuming that we analyse became as requiring an object whose description unifies with [CATEGORY NP V AP], generalisation would license (la), as well as both of the examples in (3).",

        "*Tigger became famous and in the garden.",
        "b.",
        "*Tigger became a complete snob and in the garden.",
        "This is because the generalisation of the descriptions of the two conjuncts ([CATEGORY AP] and [CATEGORY PP] in the case of (3a) and [CATEGORY NP] and [CATEGORY PP] in the case of (3b)) is in each case [CATEGORY 1], which unifies with the [CATEGORY NP V AP] requirement of became.",
        "It is not clear how the approach of Proudian & Goddeau could be applied to the became example: the disjunctive subcategorisation requirements of became cannot be treated within their approach.",

        "To incorporate conjunctive composite values we introduce structure on A, requiring that for all finite subsets X of A, A X is in A. Satisfiability of formulae involving composite conjunction is defined as follows:",
