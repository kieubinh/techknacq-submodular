        "Programs now existing give the following options: – marking the vocabulary by a feature presented as a list of words; – compiling lists of words possessing a common feature or a set of features named; – compiling lists of documents containing information about the lexeme named, as well as about a given feature or a set of features; – compiling alphabetical lists of words and features mentioned in the BBD; such lists may play, for the user, the role of a catalog representing the running state of the BBD.",

        "Semantic features are the main subject of the present paper.",
        "The notion of semantic feature is associated, in the first place, with the name of U.Weinreich (1967), who proposed a useful distinction between a paradigmatic semantic feature (approximately as in componential analysis , cf.Bendix 1965) and a transfer feature.",
        "This distinction made it possible to use the notion of semantic feature in a broader sense than in transformational grammar (TG) where semantic features are strictly opposed to syntactic ones, namely, to selection features and to features of strict categorization: in TG semantic features do not take part in formulation of grammatical rules.",
        "In Weinreich's conception semantic feature serves several different purposes:",
        "- 194 - 2) it explains deviant and metaphorical readings (as in a grief ago, before the wall etc.",
        "); 3) it adds provisional semantic contents to a potentially ambiguous word in order to impose semantic agreement where strictly speaking (i.e. under literal interpretation) there is none; thus, in example (1), from BeiiHpefix 1981, p.159, the word house, with the inherent semantic feature [-Time], acquires in the given context feature [ +Time] as a transfer feature imposed by the governing verb occur; as a result, the word house is interpreted as an event, e.g., as an event of somebody's perception of a house while passing by: (1) A red house occurred twice.",
        "In example (2), from BeiiHpeilx 1981, p.159, the word craft acquires the feature [ +Aircraft], as a transfer feature imposed by the verkto fly: (2) They flew the craft.",
        "Thus, following Weinrcich, we divide semantic features into two groups.",
        "Categorial feature of a word (usually, of a noun) is understood as its own characteristics, possibly, as a common property of its referents; cf. such features as [ + Person] or [4-Place] of the words man and house correspondingly.",
        "Transitive feature of a word (usually, of a predicate) is a semantic condition imposed on one of the arguments - namely, on the semantic necessity of its presence in the utterance with the given word and on its categorial features.",
        "Thus, verbs of emotional state, such as to hope, possess the following transitive feature: their subject (necessarily existent) has a categorial feature + Person].",
