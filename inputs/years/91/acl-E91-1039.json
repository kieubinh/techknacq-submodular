        "Young children and natural language processing programs face a common problem: everyone else knows a lot more about words.",
        "Children, it is hypothesized, catch up by observing the linguistic and non-linguistic contexts in which words are used.",
        "This paper focuses on the value and accessibility of the linguistic context.",
        "It argues that linguistic context by itself can provide useful cues about verb meaning to an artificial learner.",
        "This is demonstrated by a program that exploits two particular cues from the linguistic context to classify verbs automatically into those whose sole sense is co,ne describing a state, and those that have a sense describing an event.' The approach described here accounts for a certain degree of noise in the input due both to misapprehension of input sentences and to their occasional malformation.",
        "This work shows that the two cues are available and are reliable given the statistical methods applied.",
        "Language users, whether natural or artificial, need detailed semantic and syntactic classifications of words.",
        "Ultimately, any artificial language 'The input sentences are those compiled in the Lancaster/Oslo/Bergen (LOB) Corpus, a balanced corpus of one million words of British English.",
        "The LOB consists primarily of edited prose.",
        "user must be able to add new words to its lexicon, if only to accommodate the many neologisms it will encounter.",
        "And our lexicographic needs grow with our understanding of language.",
        "A number of current approaches to satisfying the lexical requirements for artificial devices do not involve unsupervised learning from examples.",
        "Boguraev and Briscoe (1987) discusses interpreting the information published in on-line dictionaries, while Zernik and Dyer (1987) discuss tutored learning in a controlled environment.",
        "But any method that requires explicit human intervention â€“ be it that of lexicographers, knowledge engineers, or \"tutors\" --- will lag behind both the growth of vocabu- lary and the growth of linguistics, and even with the lag their maintenance will be expensive.",
        "By contrast, dictionaries constructed by automated learners from real sentences will not lag behind vocabulary growth; examples of current language use are free and nearly infinite.",
        "These observations have led several researchers, including Hindle (1990) and Smadja and McKeown (1990), to begin investigating automatic acquisition of semantics.",
        "Hindle and Smadja and McKeown rely purely on the ability of one particular word to statistically predict the occurrence of another in a particular position.",
        "In contrast, the approach described here is targeted at particular semantic classes that are revealed by specific linguistic constructions."

        "The classifier acts on .1% bound only if the sample-size is large enough to guarantee the bound with 95% confidence.",
        "Accuracy in ascribing non-stative senses according with this technique is excellent â€“ no purely stative verbs are misclassified as having non-stative senses.",
        "In fact, this result is not very sensitive to raising the minimum progressive frequency from .1% to as high as .6% or .7%, since most verbs with non-stative senses yield observed frequencies of at least two or three percent.",
        "Now consider the other side of the problem, classifying verbs as purely stative.",
        "Here the program takes verbs that fail the test for having a non-stative sense, and in addition whose true frequency in the progressive falls below a given upper bound with sufficient confidence.",
        "The rate-adverb construction is not used, except insofar as the verbs must fail the .1% lower bound, because this construction turns out to be so rare that only a few of the most frequent verbs provide sufficiently tight bounds.",

        "Two of these, hear and agree, have relatively rare non-stative senses, meaning to imagine one hears (\"I am hearing a ringing in my ears\") and to communicate agreement (\"Rachel was already agreeing when Jon interrupted her with yet another tirade\").",
        "If the upper bound on progressive frequency is tightened to 1.20% then hear and agree drop into the \"indeterminate\" category of verbs that pass neither test.",

        "This work demonstrates a promising approach to automatic semantic classification of verbs based only on their immediate linguistic contexts.",
        "Some sort of statistical smoothing is essential to avoid being permanently mislead by anomalous and misunderstood utterances, and this work demonstrated the sufficiency of anâ€¢approach based on binomial confidence-intervals.",
        "These methods, in combination with pure collocational methods like those of [Hindle, 1990] and [Smadja and McKeown, 1990], may eventually yield substantial progress toward automatic acquisition of word meaning, or some aspects thereof, by language using devices.",
        "The initial results described here suggest many more experiments, some of which are already underway (see Brent and Berwick, 1991).",
        "These include attempting to take into account the ability of local syntactic context to influence a verb's meaning as well as to reveal it.",
        "For example, think that is stative while think about and think of are not.",
        "Separating these two senses automatically could add substantial power to our classifier.",
        "Next, there are many more linguistic cues to verb meaning to be detected and exploited.",
        "For example, the ability to take both a direct object and a propositional complement, as in \"tell him that he's a fool\", reveal verbs of communication.",
        "While the progressive cue is not available in Romance languages, the ability to take a direct object and a propositional complement seems to be diagnostic of communication verbs in Romance as well as in English.",
        "It would be valuable to demonstrate cues like this on non-English text.",
        "It would also be valuable to apply these techniques to a greater variety of input sentences, including transcriptions of mother's speech to their children.",
        "Finally, substantially larger corpora should be used in order to enlarge the number of verbs classified.",
        "All of these planned extensions serve the goal of automatically classifying thousands of verbs by dozens of different syntactic criteria, and thereby yielding a valuable, adaptable lexicon for natural language processing and artificial intelligence."
