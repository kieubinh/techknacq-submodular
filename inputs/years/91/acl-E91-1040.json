        "in recent years, it has become increasingly clear that the limited size of existing computational lexicons and the poverty of the semantic information they contain represents one of the primary bottlenecks in the development of realistic natural language processing (NLP) systems.",
        "The need for extensive lexical and semantic databases is evident in the recent initiation of a number of projects to construct massive generic lexicons for NLP (project GENELEX in Europe or EDR in Japan).",
        "The manual construction of large lexical-semantic databases demands enormous human resources, and there is a growing body of research into the possibility of automatically extracting at least a part of the required lexical and semantic information from everyday dictionaries.",
        "Everyday dictionaries are obviously not structured in a way that enables their immediate use in NLP systems, but several studies have shown that relatively simple procedures can be used to extract taxonomies and various other semantic relations (for example, Amster, 1980; Calzolari, 1984; Chodorow, Byrd, and Heidorn, 1985; Markowitz, Ahlswede, and Evens, 1986; Byrd et al., 1987; Nakamura and Nagao, 1988; Veronis and ldc, 1990i Klavans, Chodorow, and Wacholder, 1990; Wilks et a!., 1990).",
        "However, it remains to be seen whether information automatically extracted from dictionaries is sufficiently complete and coherent to be actually usable in NLP systems.",
        "Although there is concern over the quality of automatically extracted lexical information, very few empirical studies have attempted to assess it systematically, and those that have done so have been restricted to consideration of the quality of grammatical information (e.g., Akkerman, Maserecuw, and Meijs, 1985).",
        "No evaluation of automatically extracted semantic information has been published.",
        "The authors would like to thank Lisa Lassck and Annc Gilman for their contribution to this work.",
        "In this paper, we report the results of a quantitative evaluation of automatically extracted semantic data.",
        "Our results show that for any one dictionary, 55-70% of the extracted information is garbled in some way.",
        "These results at first call into doubt the validity of automatic extraction from dictionaries.",
        "However, in section 4 we show that these results can be dramatically reduced to about 6% by several means--most significantly, by combining the information extracted from five dictionaries.",
        "It therefore appears that even if individual dictionaries are an unreliable source of semantic information, multiple dictionaries can play an important role in building large lexical-semantic databases."

        "Our strategy involves automatically extracting hypernyms from five English dictionaries for a limited corpus.",
        "To determine where problems exist, the resulting hierarchies for each dictionary are compared to an \"ideal\" hierarchy constructed by hand.",
        "The five dictionaries compared were: the Collins English Dictionary (CED), the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary (OALD), the COIJUILD Dictionary, the Longman's Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) and the Webster's 9th Dictionary (W9).",
        "We begin with the most straightforward case in order to determine an upper bound for the results.",
        "We deal with words within a domain which poses few modelling problems, and we focus on hyperonymy, which is probably the least arguable semantic relation and has been shown to be the easiest to extract.",
        "If the results are poor under such favorable constraints, we can foresee that they will be poorer for more complex (abstract) domains and less clearly cut relations.",
        "An ideal hierarchy probably does not exist for the entire dictionary; however, a fair degree of consensus seems possible for carefully chosen terms within a very restricted domain.",
        "We have therefore selected a corpus of one hundred kitchen utensil terms, each representing a concrete, individual object--for example, cup, fork, saucepan, decanter, etc.",
        "All of the terms are count nouns.",
        "Mass nouns, which can cause problems, have been excluded (for example, the mass noun cutlery is not a hypernym of knife).",
        "Other idiosyncratic cases, such as chopsticks (where it is not clear if the utensil is one object or a pair of objects) have also been eliminated from the corpus.",
        "This makes it easy to apply simple tests for hyperonymy, which, for instance, enable us to say that Y is a hypernym of X if \"this is an X\" entails but is not entailed by \"this is a Y\" (Lyons, 1963).",
        "Chodorow, Byrd, and Heidorn (1985) proposed a heuristic for extracting hypernyms which exploits the fact that definitions for nouns typically give a hypernym - 227 - term as the head of the defining noun phrase.",
        "Consider the following examples: dipper a ladle used for dipping... (CED] ladle a long-handled spoon... ICED) spoon a metal, wooden, or plastic utensil... [CED] In very general terms, the heuristic consists of extracting the word which precedes the first preposition, relative pronoun, or participle encountered in the definition text.",

        "In addition, space and readability restrictions, on the one hand, and syntactic restrictions on phrasing, on the other, may dictate that certain information is unspecified in definition texts or left to be implied by other parts of the definition.",
        "3.1.1.",
        "Attachment too high : 21-34% The most pervasive problem in automatically extracted hierarchies is the attachment of terms too high in the hierarchy.",
        "It occurs in 21-34% of the definitions in our sample from the five dictionaries (figure 8).",
        "For example, while pan and bottle are vessels in the CED, cup and bowl are simply containers, the hypemym of vessel.",
        "Obviously, \"this is a cup\" and \"this is a bowl\" both entail (and are not entailed by) \"this is a vessel\".",
        "Further, other dictionaries give vessel as the hypemym for cup and bowl.",
        "Therefore, the attachment of cup and bowl to the higher-level term container seems to be an inconsistency within the CED.",
        "The problem of attachment too high in the hierarchy occurs relatively randomly within a given dictionary.",
        "In dictionaries with a controlled definition vocabulary (such as the LDOCE), the problem of attachment at high levels of the hierarchy results also from a lack of terms from which to choose.",
        "For example, ladle and dipper are both attached to spoon in the LDOCE, although \"this is a dipper\" entails and is not entailed by \"this is a ladle\".",
        "There is no way that dipper could be defined as a ladle (as, for instance, in the CED), since ladle is not in the defining vocabulary.",
        "As a result, hierarchies extracted from the LDOCE are consistently flat (figure 7).",
        "3.1.2.",
        "Absent hypernyms : 0-3% In some cases, strategies like that of Chodorow, Byrd and Heidorn yield incorrect hypernyms, as in the following definitions: grill A grill is a part of a cooker... [COBUILD] corkscrew a pointed spiral piece of metal... [W9) dinner service a complete set of plates and dishes... [LDOCE, not included in our corpus] The words part, piece, set, are clearly not hypernyms of the defined concepts: it is virtually meaningless to say that grill is a kind of part, or that corkscrew is a kind of piece.",
        "In these cases, the head of the noun phrase serves to mark another relation: part-whole, member-class, etc.",
        "It is easy to reject these and similar words (member, series, etc.)",
        "as hypemyms, since they form a closed list (Klavans, Chodorow, and Wacholder, 1990).",
        "However, excluding these words leaves us with no hypernym.",
        "We call these \"absent hypernyms\"; they occur in 0-3% of the definitions in our sample corpus (figure 8).",
        "The absence of a hypernym in a given definition text does not necessarily imply that no hypernym exists.",
        "For example, \"this is a corkscrew\" clearly entails (and is not entailed by) \"this is a device\" (the hypernym given by the COBUILD and the CED).",
        "In many cases, the lack of a hypernym seems to be the result of concern over space and/or readability.",
        "We can imagine, for example, that the definition for corkscrew could be more fully specified as \"a device consisting of a pointed spiral piece of metal...\" In such cases, lexicographers rely on the reader's ability to deduce that something made of metal, with a handle, used for pulling corks, can be called a device.",
        "However, for some terms, such as cutlery or dinner service, it is not clear that a hypernym exists.",

        "Also, further research is required to determine which phrases function as markers for which kind of information, and to determine how consistent their use is.",
        "More importantly, such information is sporadic, and its extraction may require more effort than the results warrant.",
        "We therefore seek more \"brute force\" methods to improve automatically extracted hierarchies.",
        "One of the most promising strategies for refining extracted information is the use of information from several dictionaries.",
        "Hierarchies derived from individual dictionaries suffer from incompleteness, but it is extremely unlikely that the same information is consistently missing from all dictionaries.",
        "For instance, the CED attaches cup to container, which is too high in the hierarchy, while the W9 attaches it lower, to vessel.",
        "It is therefore possible to use taxonomic information from several dictionaries to fill in absent hypernyms, missing links, and to rectify cases of too high attachment.",
        "To investigate this possibility, we merged the information extracted from the five English dictionaries in our database.",
        "The individual data for the five dictionaries was organized in a table, as in figure 9.",
        "Merging these hierarchies into a single hierarchy was accomplished automatically by applying a simple algorithm, which scans the table line-by-line, as follows: 1) regard cells containing multiple heads conjoined by or as null, since, as we saw in section 3.2.1, they do not reliably provide a hypernym.",
        "2) if all the cells agree (as for ladle), keep that term as the hypernym.",

        "This algorithm must be applied recursively, since, for example, it may not yet be known when evaluating basin that container is a hypernym of vessel, and vessel is a hypernym of bowl, until those terms arc themselves processed.",
        "Therefore, several passes through the table are required.",
        "Note that if after applying the algorithm several terms are left as hypernyms for a given word, we effectively create an overlap in the hierarchy.",

        "We evaluate the quality of the resulting combined hierarchy using the same strategy applied in section 3.",
        "It is interesting to note that in the merged hierarchy, all the absent hypernym problems (including absence due to or-heads) have been eliminated, since in every case at least one of the five dictionaries gives a valid hypemym.",
        "In addition, almost all of the attachments too high in the hierarchy and missing overlaps have disappeared, although a few cases remain (5% and 1%, respectively).",
        "None of the dictionaries, for instance, gives pot as the hypemym of teapot, although three of the five dictionaries give pot as the hypernym of coffeepot.",
        "A larger dictionary database would enable the elimination of many of these remaining imperfections (for example, New Penguin English Dictionary, not included in our database, gives pot as a hypernym of teapot).",
        "Merging dictionaries on a large scale assumes that it is possible to automatically map senses across them.",
        "For our small sample, we mapped senses among dictionaries by hand.",
        "We describe elsewhere a promising method to automatically accomplish sense mapping, using a spreading activation algorithm Ode and Vdronis, 1990).",

        "The fact that \"it is not impossible for what is intuitively recognized as a conceptual category to be without a label\" has already been noted (Cruse, 1986, p. 147).",
        "The lack of a specific term fora recognizable concept tends to occur more frequently at the higher levels of the hierarchy (and at the very lowest and most specific levels as well--e.g., there is no term to designate forks with two prongs).",
        "This is probably because any language includes the most terms at the generic level (Brown, 1958), that is, the level of everyday, ordinary terms for objects and living things (dog, pencil, house, etc.).",
        "Circularity, as well as the use of or-conjoined terms at the high levels of the hierarchy, results largely from the lexicographers' efforts to approximate the terms they lack.",
        "For example, there is no clear term to denote that category of objects which fall under any of the terms utensil, tool, implement, instrument, although this concept seems to exist.",
        "Clearly, these terms are not strictly synonymous--there are, for example, utensils that one would not call tools (e.g., a colander).",
        "If a term, let us say X, for the concept existed, then the definitions for utensil, tool, implement, and instrument - 231 - could simply read \"an X that...\".",
        "Since this is not the case, lexicographers define each term with a list including the others, which enables the delineation of a concept which encompasses all of them.",
        "One way to resolve difficulties at the higher levels of extracted hierarchies is to introduce \"covert categories\", that is, concepts which do not correspond to any particular word.",
        "We therefore do not merge circular terms into a single concept, but instead create a common \"covert\" hypernym for all of them.",
        "In this way, tool, utensil, implement, and instrument each appear in the hierarchy as kinds of INSTRUMENTAL-OBJECT (covert categories names are capitalized).",
        "We need a means to determine when and where covert categories are necessary.",
        "Circularities in dictionary definitions clearly indicate the presence of covert categories.",
        "However, we obviously cannot use a single dictionary to determine them, because the loops contained in one dictionary rarely include all of the terms that may be involved in the \"constellation\" representing a given covert category.",
        "For instance, the CED contains the loop tool-implement-utensil, while the COBUILD contains a loop for tool-instrument; this provides strong evidence that all four terms should be involved in a constellation.",
        "Supporting information can he derived by looking at the hyponyms for each of the candidate terms in different dictionaries.",
        "The word fork, for example, is defined as tool (COBUILD), implement (CED, OALD, W9), and instrument (LDOCE), while spoon is defined as object (COB UILD), utensil (CED, OALD), tool (LDOCE) and implement (W9),which adds further support to the idea that tool, utensil, instrument, and implement belong to the same constellation.",
        "Even if it is relatively easy to automatically detect circularities, the final determination of which covert categories to create and the terms that are involved in them must be done manually.",
        "However, this task is not as daunting as it may first appear, since it involves only the higher levels of the hierarchy, and likely involves a relatively small number of covert categories."
