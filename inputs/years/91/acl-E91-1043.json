        "The aspect of bidirectionality has been gaining importance since the growing rate of research on natural language generation over the last years offers us deeper insights into this cognitive ability of humans.",
        "There are theoretical as well as practical reasons for adopting bidirectionality.",
        "Theoretically, the assumption of common knowledge sources for both generation and analysis is essential for the view of language as \"an interpersonal medium and an interface to thought\" (McDonald 1987).",
        "From a psychological point of view, there is a certain amount of empirical evidence for shared processors or facilities (Jackendoff 1987).",
        "From a system engineering view, a bidirectional system produces utterances only from that subset of language that it is capable to understand.",
        "Therefore, inconsistencies of the language behaviour of the system can be avoided (Jacobs 1988).",
        "A fundamental requirement of a bidirectional knowledge base is that it be represented declaratively (Appelt 1987).",
        "From this viewpoint one can distinguish two different types of bidirectional natural language systems: * Thanks to Klaus Netter, Karel Oliva, Norbert Reithinger, Harald Trost and Hans Uszkoreit for fruitful discussions about the aspects of the paper's contents.",
        "• systems that use uniform knowledge sources, but different processes • systems that use uniform knowledge sources as well as uniform processes1",
        "Up to now, systems that are capable of analysing and producing language fall into the first class, i.e. they use different operations for both directions (cf. Hoeppner et al.",
        "1983; Busemann and Hauenschild 1988; Allgayer et al.",
        "1989) Currently, it is an open question what degree of bidirectionality should or could be desired (cf. Appelt 1987; Mann 1987; McDonald 1987; Shieber 1988; Jacobs 1988).",
        "One of the reasons could be that the formal specification of some tasks (e.g., the determination of content in generation) is currently not well understood in order to decide whether they could be bidirectional in principle.",
        "But in some research areas uniform processing models have been developed that are based on formalisms which are well suited for uniform representation and processing, e.g., Koskenniemi's (1984) two-level model of morphology.",
        "Recently, there are first approaches ,to uniform architectures for grammatical processing (e.g., Shieber 1988; Dymetman and Isabelle 1988; Dymetman et al.",
        "1990).",
        "These architectures are based on Pereira and Warren's (1983) paradigm of parsing as deduction.",

        "1Besides these two classes there arc also systems that use different knowledge sources that are compiled from the same source (e.g., Horacek and Pyka 1988) and systems that use common basic representation devices (e.g., Lancel et,al.",
        "1988; Neumann and Finkler 1990).",

        "• that both tasks take place independently from each other, i.e. an utterance is either generated or parsed and • that grammatical processing can be performed without considerations of discourse.",
        "A great problem with this view is that it offers no solution of the problem of choice between paraphrases in generation: The proposed approaches assume - more or less explicitly modularity between the conceptual and grammatical component of a natural language system.2 A great advantage of a modular design especially for uniform architectures is that it is possible to view the grammatical component as relatively autonomous and self-contained (cf. Appelt 87).",
        "But then the following problems emerge: The conceptual component will be unable to exactly specify the logical form as input to the grammatical component that will precisely lead to the utterance that reflects the intended meaning unless the conceptual module has detailed information about the grammar and knows when to use a specific construction (which renders the modular design meaningless).",
        "On the other hand, when parsing and generation are performed within the grammatical component by a single process only then the opposite view of computing all possible parses of an utterance is the computation of all possible paraphrases of a logical form.",
        "When grammatical processing should be modelled by means of a bidirectional grammar, the declarative structure of the grammar must not contain pragmatical or stylistical information because of the modular design.",
        "But then the process can only choose randomly between paraphrases during generation and this means that the intended meaning will possibly not be conveyed.",
        "Ideally, a logical language would be helpful which necessarily and sufficiently represents all meaning distinctions of natural 2By a conceptual component I mean either the what-to-say component of a generation system or the component that performs inference, plan recognition or anaphora resolution of an understanding system.",

        "But as Shieber (1988) states \"this ... is just the central problem of knowledge representation for natural language in general\".",
        "Currently, there exist only approximate solutions to this problem for example the use of canonical logical forms (cf. Shieber 88).3 But this still offers no solution of the problem of choice between paraphrases.",
        "In this paper it will be argued that the following two points will contribute to an approximate solution:",
        "• interleaved parsing and generation • using the language use of interlocutors as an additional access criterion to linguistic knowledge",
        "Interleaved parsing and generation means that both tasks take place in parallel (see section 2).",
        "In principle this results in a bidirectional and incremental flow of information during natural language processing (see section 4.1).",
        "An important point during the use of language is that the choice of linguistic material is influenced by the language use of others (see section 3).",
        "This leads to more flexibility: not all necessary parameters (e.g., pragmatical values) need to be specified in the input of a generator because decision points can also be set dynamically during runtime.",
        "A promising approach to realize these two features will be to base grammatical processing 'on a uniform process that is parametrized by means of a declaratively specified preference structure of knowledge sources.",
        "But, it is necessary to be aware that the grammatical component must be assumed to be an integrated part of a whole natural language system (in particular in models for performing dialogs) in order to realize this solution.",

        "In doing so, partial results of the parsing process can be used directly during generation (e.g., if a paraphrase will be generated).",
        "In such flow of control it will be possible that generation can be used for completing the resulting structure of elliptic, underspecified or ill-formed input during the process of understanding or for generating paraphrases in due time.",
        "• During generation interleaved parsing could help to avoid the construction of ambiguous utterances.",

        "On the other side, in a bidirectional system the resulting structures of the parsing task can be used directly during generation.",
        "E.g., in general a set of alternative lexemes is specified during the process of lexical choice which are synonymous in the actual situation or when the semantic input cannot be sufficiently specified (e.g., in German, some drinking-devices can be denoted either 'Tasse' (cup) or 'Becher' (mup) because their shape cannot be interpreted unequivocally).",
