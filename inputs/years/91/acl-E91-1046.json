        "By applying this method the precoded concepts are invoked again and again during the process of text analysis, regardless of the changes and the new concepts being constituted by the ongoing text.",
        "The function of a text, however, is not confined to concept selection as in current knowledge-based applications.",
        "In addition, textual mechanisms are used to operate on concepts and to compose them to actual contexts, i.e. to constitute (new) concepts.",
        "Textually the contexts are established by the thematic and by the referential structure.",
        "Thus, new mechanisms are required which permit the textual organization to control the creation and manipulation of concepts in text processing.",
        "In a way, this is to tie linguistic and knowledge-based approaches to text processing together into a single method."

        "There are five layers of text representation: sentence structure thematic structure referential structure view background knowledge The lowest layer is the basis for textual communication.",
        "It is a formal representation of concepts modeling an open world and serves as background knowledge.",
        "Since we allow for the construction of new details and concepts, an organization of concepts is provided which supports this task.",
        "Our background knowledge differs from traditional knowledge bases in that it does not represent a particular domain model which assigns a predefined and fixed structure to the concepts.",
        "It is rather organized around expressions and models their referential potential in terms of concepts.",
        "It resembles a meaning dictionary (like e.g. [CO-BUILD87] which is used as the basic material), where with expressions concepts are constituted and used to explain other concepts.",
        "Basically all concepts are of the same rank with respect to an open world.",
        "During discourse the concepts are accessed via explicitly modeled perspectives on them [Kunze90] [Melcuk87] depending on the actual textual development (e.g. actual state of contexts, c.f.",
        "2.2 discourse state).",
        "The next layer, the view, models the subject matter of the text using the concepts which are defined in the background knowledge.",
        "The ongoing discourse selects concepts from the background knowledge or the already existing view, reorganizes their structure and (re-)integrates them coherently into the already existing view.",
        "The concepts constructed in the view during discourse provide the text specific perspective on the background knowledge.",
        "The layer of the referential structure represents reference objects and their relationships.",
        "It drops details of the concept definition in accordance with the abstraction level of references in the text, and represents those complexes as units which are explicitly referred to by linguistic means in the text.",
        "The layer of thematic structure traces the discourse development.",
        "It represents the contextual clustering of reference objects and traces the development of their clustering.",
        "This trace represents the progression of themes and the development of focusing.",
        "The notion of thematic structure is based on the Prague School approaches to the thematic organization (e.g. [Danes70][Hajicova/ Sgall88][Hajicovg/Vrbova82]), which we refine by distinguishing the mechanisms involved in terms of the textual function of linguistic means with respect to the different layers of the text representation.",
        "In our model the units of the layer of thematic structure are contexts.",
        "By context we understand a cluster of reference objects, where within a context the relationship between a reference expression and its reference object is unequivocal.",
        "During the ongoing discourse, however, this relationship and the groups of reference objects which are clustered together change.",
        "Whether or not linguistic means create new contexts, and which kind of clustering of reference objects they effect, depends on their textual function and on the state of discourse they operate on (examples of this are given below).",
        "Contexts are the units of the thematic progression.",
        "It is this grouping of reference objects that is referred to by linguistic means immediately, that is changed, resumed, revised and tied up to during discourse.",
        "The thematic structure is the result of creating, closing and referring to contexts.",
        "The movement of contexts traces the growth of the view.",
        "It should be noted that complex progression types can be constructed.",
        "This is due to the ability of predicative expressions to cover several themes by virtue of their arity and due to the textual possibility of changing the structure of a contextually clustered concept by changing the focus when referring to a context.",
        "Therefore hierarchical structures as proposed by different approaches to describing the structuring of actual texts are not sufficient to cope with the ability of natural language texts to constitute contextual relations (cf. content oriented structures: e.g. thematic progression [Danes70] – at least the five forms elaborated are hierarchical – ), or discourse segmentations: e.g. discourse constituent units [Polanyi88], context spaces [Reichman85], rhetorical structures [Mannahompson88], superstructures and ma-crostructures [vanDijk83]) .",

        "Reference objects group conceptual definitions into units which can be referred to by ensuing linguistic expressions.",
        "The sequence of thematizing defines a clustering of reference objects into contexts.",
        "Whilst the lower layers contain more static information which is independent of the actual sequence of the textual presentation, the dynamic of discourse, i.e. the growth of the view during the ongoing discourse, is represented in the layers of thematic structure and sentence structure.",
        "The modeling allows for a text driven control of operations on the knowledge base and on the view, because the manipulations of the lower layers depend on the interpretation of the upper layer phenomena.",
        "We define the types of manipulations necessary in terms of the contribution linguistic means make to the layers of the text representation.",
