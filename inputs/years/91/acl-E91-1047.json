Apresjan 1989: 154)."

        "Aspect is considered to be a grammatico-semantical category for expressing various temporal references in relation to the speech act moment.",
        "Regardless of the great number of special meanings that can be expressed by the perfective or imperfective aspect (p.asp./i.asp.",
        "), there are two oppositions representing the systematic or basic aspectual meanings, namely +TOTALITY/ +LIMITEDNESS versus -TOTALITY/-LIMITEDNESS (see Bondarko 1990).",
        "In this paper we will discuss the transfer of tense and aspect, a problem which arises immediately in Machine Translation and differs from language pair to language pair.",
        "This mainly depends on how aspect is expressed in the particular languages concerned.",
        "It is obvious that aspect in several languages has a rather heterogeneous formal reflection in the verb system.",
        "Aspect and tense are closely connected with each other.",
        "In English, e.g., the two aspect constructions perfective and progressive can be seen as realizing the basic contrast of the action viewed as complete or as incomplete (for details see van Eynde 1988).",
        "In contrast to the languages mentioned above, aspect meaning in German, which doubtlessly exists, has no explicit formal expression.",
        "Therefore, aspect information required for translation into Russian has to be extracted from different levels of text representation.",
        "This is necessary since without the correct choice of Russian aspect serious translation errors in the target language could occur.",
        "In our German-Russian MT project VIRTEX we have approached this problem by constructing a hierarchic procedure for aspect choice (presented in the next paragraph), which takes a complex of contextual, morphological and semantical criteria into account.",
        "If the aspect choice algorithm fails to select one of the two aspect forms, wider context (beyond the boundaries of sentence) or background knowledge must be taken into consideration.",
        "To meet this difficulty VIRTEX is provided with a system of inquiries.",
        "If necessary, human interaction is entered to make a final decision (in the sense of Personal MT, see Boitet 1990).",
