        "'Lexical Transfer' has always been one of the main sources of problems in Machine Translation (MT)[Melby, 1986][Nirenburg, 1988].",
        "Research in transfer-based MT systems has focussed on discovering an appropriate level of linguistic description for translation, at which we can specify 'translation relations' (or transfer rules) in a simple manner.",
        "However, lexical differences between languages have caused problems in this attempt.",
        "Besides structural changes caused by lexical transfer, selecting appropriate translations of source lexical items has been one of the hardest problems in MT.",
        "Because languages have their own ways of reflecting the structure of the world in their lexicons, and the process of lexicalization is more or less arbitrary, bilingual knowledge about lexical correspondences is highly dependent on language pairs and individual words.",
        "We have to prepare a framework in which such idiosyncratic bilingual knowledge about lexical items can be systematically accumulated.",
        "Our approach in this paper follows the general trend in computational linguistics which emphasizes the role of the lexicon in linguistic theory.",
        "In particular, our idea of bilingual signs shares a common intuition with [Beaven, 1988] and [Whitelock, 1988).",
        "As with their proposal, we too specify local structural correspondences between two languages in bilingual lexicons.",
        "Unlike former approaches, however, we explicitly define bilingual signs and use them as predicates in logical formulae (bilingual pivot expressions).",
        "Bilingual signs in our framework not only link the local linguistic structures of two languages where the corresponding two monolingual signs appear, but also, by behaving as logical predicates, they connect linguistic-based processes in MT with inference processes.",
        "Complicated structural changes, which are often required in translation of remote language pairs like English and Japanese, are captured by logical inferences [Tsujii, 1990].",
        "The framework has the following advantages over conventional methods.",
        "(i) Reversibility of bilingual dictionaries (lexical transfer rules) (ii) Natural interfaces between knowledge-based (inference) processes and MT (iii) Ease of paraphrasing using different words (see section 6) 2.",
        "Bilingual signs as logical predicates and their definition",
        "The basic idea of bilingual signs is simple.",
        "Instead of using predicates corresponding directly to surface words, we use bilingual pairs of lexical items as predicates.",
        "That is, we use [RUN:JIKKOOSURU] and [RUN:UN'EISURU] as basic predicates expressing the meanings of run in the following sentences.",
        "(1) The teacher runs the program.",
        "(2) The teacher runs the company.",
        "Corresponding to the obvious meaning difference of run in (1) and (2), we have to use different surface verbs in Japanese, \"jikkoosuru\" for (1) and \"un'eisuru\" for (2).",
        "The bilingual sign [RUN:JIKKOOSURU] is a predicate which expresses the truth condition which an event should satisfy in order to be described by run in English and jikkoosuru in Japanese.",
        "Note that [RUN:JIKKOOSURU] expresses not only one disambiguated sense of run but also one disambi-- 275 - guated sense of the Japanese verb jikkoasurut.",
        "Our system is a conventional transfer based MT system where the monolingual analysis and transfer phases are executed separately.",
        "The analysis phase of English produces the following schema of logical formulae (3) as the description of (1).",
        "(For simplicity, we ignore articles, quantifiers, etc.)",
        "(3) ([RUN:?1](e) & ARG1(e,x) & ARG2(e,y) & [TEACHER:?2](x) & [PROGRAM:?3](y)) (3) is not a logical formula in the ordinary sense but a schema which represents a set of possible formulae.",
        "[RUN:?1] is a predicate schema, and by binding the variable IF to a specific Japanese verb, we get a specific predicate such as [RUN:JIKKOOSURU], [RUN:UN'EISURU], etc.",
        "The transfer phase is taken to be a phase which identifies appropriate predicates in a schema of logical formulae produced by the analysis phase.",
        "As in LFG [Kaplan, 1982], we assume that semantic representations (logical forms) are related lexically with a certain level of linguistic descriptions.",
        "Because a bilingual sign is defined by two languages (here English and Japanese), the two relationships of (logical form <---> English) and (logical form <-4 Japanese) are specified in the same place.",
        "In order to avoid further complications caused by changes of grammatical functions (passive constructions, etc.",
        "), we use thematic role representations as linguistic descriptions in the definitions of bilingual signs.",
        "The following definition shows the predicate [RUN:UN'EISURU] has arity two (argl and arg2) and the arguments have sortal restrictions.",
        "This example is rather simple, since local linguistic structures in both languages are the same.",
        "That is, the agent and the object in English correspond to the constituents with the same I jikkoosuru can be translated into several English verbs including run, carry ma, execute, implement, practice, etc.",
        "2 Angle brackets '< >' show a path description and exclamation-mark '1' in the angle brackets means the smallest description block (shown by braces '{ }') which contains the description block in which the 'I' appears.",
        "thematic roles.",
        "Note that these correspondences are expressed through argl and arg2 of the defined predicate.",
        "However, many cases have been observed where lexical transfer causes structural changes..",
        "It is also the case that objects or events describable by single words in one language are described by phrases or clauses in other languages (see section 3).",
        "We may expect that classes of objects/events which can be expressed by single words in one language correspond to natural classes of objects/events, the classes whose truth conditions are naturally captured by single predicates in logical forms.",
        "Therefore, we prepare single bilingual signs for expressing their truth conditions if at least one of the languages has lexical items [Emele, 1990].",
        "That is, we define a single bilingual sign which corresponds to a complex linguistic object in one language, if the other language expresses the same \"meaning\" by a single word.",
        "As [Sadler, 1990] pointed out, compared with other methods using arbitrary predicates in meaning representation, our method is well-motivated in selecting basic predicates.",
        "In fact, the required fineness of distinction of word senses depends highly on the target language (source words are translationally ambiguous [Tsujii, 1988]).",
        "We can expect the set of bilingually defined predicates to have appropriate, at least necessary if not sufficient, granularity of the semantic domains for translation of the two given languages.",
        "Furthermore, we can use logical formulae to specify mutual relationships among bilingual signs, which means that we can specify explicitly 'logical' relationships among lexical transfer rules (see section 4).",
        "3.",
        "Complex structural changes – complex bilingual signs",
        "The following show how our framework treats structural changes caused by lexical correspondences.",
        "[A] Case changes The English sentence 'I like him.'",
        "is usually translated into 'Il me plait.'",
        "in French.",
        "(5) (Def-Pred [LIKE:PLAIRE] (argl := ,",
        "In our framework, corresponding case elements in the two languages are linked with each other through the same argument names of bilingual signs.",
        "[B] Lexical inclusions of arguments A Japanese verb nuru, for example, is translated as paint, varnish, spread (bread with butter), apply (paint) etc., depending on the material being applied.",
        "Some of the English verbs (paint, varnish, etc.)",
        "include the objects (of the Japanese) in their meaning.",
        "For example, the structural change between (6a) and (6b) is treated by the definition",
        "Note that the Japanese verb nuru governs three dependents but one of them is in this definition filled in advance by a specific noun (penlci – paint in English).",
        "The definition shows that the phrase penki-wo nuru in Japanese corresponds to the English paint and that this correspondence defines a predicate as a basic unit of semantic representation.",
        "[C] Head switching One of the well-known examples is the correspondence between the English verb like and the Dutch adverb graag (which roughly corresponds to pleasantly in English).",
        "The same kind of phenomena has often been observed in translation between English and Japanese.",
        "The event expressed by the verb manage (in the usage of manage to do something) is captured by an adverb nantoka (`somehow or other' or 'with great effort' in English) in Japanese.",
        "The adverb is used to modify the event expressed as an infinitive clause in English.",
        "The correspondence between (8a) and (8b) is captured by the definition (9).",
        "In this example, though the adverb nantoka is not the head of the Japanese deep case description (`jpn'), it is converted into the predicate [MANAGE:NANTOKA] in the logical formula, and the rest of the `jpn' description into arg2.",
        "[Kaplan, 1989] proposed two ways of treating such head-switching phenomena, one monolingual and the other bilingual.",
        "Our treatment in this paper is basically bilingual in the sense that the non-head construction in Japanese is directly related with the English construction in which the corresponding element is expressed as the head.",
        "However, if we deem the logical level of representation a separate, more abstract but monolingual level of representation, then our method is quite close to the monolingual treatment suggested by [Zajac, 1990].",
        "Our contention is that such an abstract level of representation is hard to justify by purely monolingual considerations but only possible by bilingual (or multilingual) considerations."

        "But this continuity of argument structures through sorts is not necessarily guaranteed.",
        "A sort can have multiple supersorts and so the continuity of argument structures from different supersorts may conflict with each other.",
        "Furthermore, it is sometimes the case that the arities of events change between a sort and its subsorts.",
        "For example, suppose that we have two event sorts [APPLY:NURU] (this event-sort corresponds to the usage of apply in apply glue/paint to ...) and [PAINT:PENKI-WONURU], and that we define the latter as a subsort of the former.",
        "Then, one of the arguments in the supersort [APPLY:NURU] is lexically included in the subsoil [PAINT:PENIU-WO-NURU] so that these two sorts basically have different arities.",

        "(a) Transforming from thematic role structures of source sentences into schema of logical formulae(like (3)) - 278 - (b) Determining logical formulae by descending/ascending sort hierarchies: during this phase, inferences based on knowledge are made, and questions are asked to users, if necessary.",

        "All of these steps are performed by referring to the definitions of bilingual signs.",
        "We can index each bilingual sign by the surface word whose 'meaning' is expressed by the sign.",
        "Roughly speaking, a word indexing a bilingual sign is either the word which appears as head in the linguistic form definitions or the word which is the value in a feature marked by '/' (like nantoka in the example [MANAGE:NANTOKA]).",
        "Step (a) in the above is a rather straightforward process which can be recursively performed through thematic structures.",
        "At each recursion level, the system identifies the (semantic) head of the level, retrieves the vaguest possible bilingual signs for the head word transforms the local structures governed by the head word according to the definition of the bilingual signs retrieved at (ii).",
        "Because a predicate schema of a word may have several possible vaguest sorts, step (a) produces several formulae which step (b) tries to transform into more appropriate formulae.",
        "The processes of descending in sort hierarchies (disambiguation processes necessary for translation) are performed for different predicate schemata simultaneously (for verbs and nouns which are related to each other).",
        "Ascending the hierarchies is also: required, because the system has to instantiate all the predicate schemata contained in formula, and constraints imposed by different predicates in a schema of formulae may conflict with each other.",
        "It may also happen that there are no corresponding target lexical items for source items.",
        "In these cases, the system has to loosen constraints by ascending hierarchies.",
        "Therefore, step (b) is a kind of relaxation process which tries to find the most accurate solutions satisfying all constraints.",
        "During this process, some general inference mechanisms may be invoked to infer necessary information for navigating in hierarchies and, if necessary, questions will be posed to human users.",
        "[Estival, 1990] also proposed using a partial order of transfer rules to choose preferred translations or prevent less preferred translations from being generated.",
        "He assumes that such a partial order of rules can be automatically computed in terms of specificities of conditions on individual transfer rules.",
        "We also use a partial order of rules (in our case, lexical transfer rules) to choose translations, but the specificity relationships in our system are concerned with lexical semantics and are not automatically computed but defined externally by a human based on his/her bilingual intuition.",

        "We think at present that most of the global structural changes in conventional transfer systems, though necessary for natural translations, actually change the \"meanings\" of source sentences and should be treated by inference mechanisms external to the \"linguistic\" processing in translation.",
        "Though we only treat the predicates and arguments of bilingual signs, we would have to treat adjuncts as well in order to translate a whole sentence.",
        "This is related to how to control the rule application and how to ensure that all the parts of the source structure are processed.",
        "The method of formulating questions for disambiguation is still incomplete, though our method seems promising.",
        "We have to investigate what sorts of paraphrasing are really helpful for making bilingual ambiguities obvious to monolingual users."
