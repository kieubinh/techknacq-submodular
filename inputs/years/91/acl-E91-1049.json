        "In the Eurotra framework, the E-framework [Bech et al.",

      "text": [
        "Preference has been defined in a number of ways, e.g. as adual fulfilment of semantic constraints Wass and-Wilks 1983], as a lexically induced syntactic bias [Ford et al.",
        "1982], as a parsing strategy independent of linguistic criteria [Frazier and Fodor 1978, Pereira 1985], and as a system based on multiple judgements reflecting the complexity of psychological processes [Jackendoff 19851.",
        "Our approach, which is greatly indebted to Jacken-doff's theory of preference rule systems, is based on the following assumptions: - Preference is a method which, on the basis of some preference criteria, chooses the best one among a set of possible interpretations which are all correct according to the grammar.",
        "- Each preference criterion is expressed as a set of statements, where a statement is either a binary relation between competing interpretations or the description of a subtree which satisfies some defined criteria.",
        "- There is no unique preference criterion according to which the best interpretation can be chosen: preference criteria are multiple, and possibly contradictory.",
        "A preference mechanism must be able to accommodate such multiplicity.",
        "- Preference criteria are heuristic principles which may vary according to the language and the text type: therefore, they are not hardwired in the system.",
        "In the previous Eurotra preference mechanism [Petitpierre et al.",
        "1987], preference statements were only defined as binary relations between subtrees.",
        "Since comparing subtrees is a rather expensive operation from the computational point of view, and since a number of preference cnteria - e.g. the principle of right-low attachment cannot be expressed in binary terms, we have allowed both binary and non-binary preference rules.",
        "The application algorithm of p-rules and the way in which various preference criteria are combined are also new with respect to the previous system."

      "text": [
        "The mechanism proposed is an independent module which is activated on the results output by the parser.",
        "The module consists of preference rules of two possible kinds, which we call binary and unary rules.",
        "A binary rule establishes a preference relation between two corresponding (sub)trees (from here on, (sub)tree will be used in the sense of a representation of an interpretation or a part of this representation).",
        "A unary rule picks up a (sub)tree on the basis of its own properties, thus implicitly establishing a preference relation between this (sub)tree and all its competitors.",
        "Each preference rule - be it binary or unary - is associated with a score, which is assigned to the preferred (sub)tree as a result of the application of the rule.",
        "Correspondences: The notion of correspondence between (sub)trees is central to preference rules of the binary type.",
        "A number of definitions of this concept can be envisaged: i.",
        "The correspondence between two (sub)trees is established by the user, who states that some specified contraints hold between parts of them.",
        "ii.",
        "A correspondence is only assumed to exist between full parse trees, and the correspondence between two subtrees is defined by specifying their derivation paths from the top node.",
        "iii.",
        "The system produces a parse graph which will be a synthesis of the various parse trees, where parts common to several trees are shared; two subtrees correspond if they share a given part.",
        "The most challenging solution is we have not adopted it because of computational problems connected with the introduction of structure-sharing into the E-framework.",
        "The easiest solution to implement is (ii): this is the approach chosen in the earlier Eurotra preference tool.",
        "The solution we have adopted is (i), which unlike (ii) allows the user to state constraints on subtrees, regardless of their position in the complete parse tree.",
        "In other words, our system allows for very local and modular statements.",

        "LHS and RHS are (sub)tree descriptions of any depth and relevant parts of them may be labelled with Prolog variables, called indexes.",
        "These labels are used to express simple or complex correspondence constraints in the annotation part of the rule.",
        "A simple constraint states for instance that two indexed subtrees must or must not have the same structure.",
        "Simple constraints may be combined with the operators 'and' and 'or' to form complex constraints.",
        "Scores, which have the function of driving p-rule interaction, are positive integers.",
        "They may be either assigned by the user or generated automatically on statistical grounds, as explained below.",
        "Examples of both rule types are given in the appendix.",
        "General Algorithm: All the parse trees have an initial null score before preference rules are applied.",
        "For each pair of trees, if they contain two subtrees respectively matching the LHS and the RHS of a binary p-rule, while the constraints in the annotation part of the rule hold, the rule applies.",
        "Similarly, for each parse tree, if a subtree matching the LHS of a unary b-rule can be extracted, and all the constraints expressed in the rule are satisfied, the rule applies.",
        "In both cases, as a result of p-rule application, the score of the object that contains the preferred subtree is incremented by the score of the rule.",
        "When all binary rules have been tried out on all the possible pairs of trees in all the possible ways, and all unary rules have been fired on all the single trees, results are collected.",
        "All parse trees are partitioned into equivalence classes according to their score.",

        "Therefore, we claim that problems (1) and (2) are equivalent.",
        "Now, problem (2) has no exact solution whenever N is greater than n. However, it can be solved by converting it into a constraint optimization problem whereby optimum scores for p.-rules will emerge.",

        "The algorithm will eventually come up with the desirable set of parameters when all alternatives have been exhausted throughout the preceding iterations.",

        "It seems to us that two basic tendencies can be observed in the literature with respect to the treatment of preference.",
        "On the one hand, preference is conceived of as an essentia linguistic or psycholinguistic principle or sumo principles (cf. the LFG approach in [Ford et al.",
        "1982]); although it has important consequences for the parser, preference is not directly connected to a specific parsing method.",
        "On the other hand, preference has been studied in the context of parsing: in such treatments (cf. [Pereira 1985]), preference amounts to a deterministic procedure, which is not necessarily motivated by linguistic evidence.",
        "In our approach preference is established on the basis of rules defined by the user and applied by a post-processor.",
        "We have in fact focussed on a method to express linguistically meaningful preference statements rather than on a particular parsing strategy.",
        "We are aware of the fact that, in a system where parsing is seen as a constraint satisfaction problem, preference criteria of the type we are interested in can be treated on the same level as other linguistic constraints and used to resolve ambiguity at parse time (cf. [Van Henteryck 1989]).",
        "However, such an approach would have meant too radical a change to the underlying Eurotra formalism.",
        "In accordance with the general practice in Eurotra, our preference mechanism does not plead allegiance to any specific linguistic theory.",
        "We have, however, been influenced by a theoretical framework, namely the theory of preference rule systems described in [Jackendoff 1985].",
        "According to this framework, preference can only been decided on the basis of a number of criteria, and a preference mechanism is not based on a dichotomy between correct and wrong results, but on a scale of degrees of acceptability.",
        "One of our main concerns in designing the system, in fact, has been allowing various and even contradictory criteria to be combined in a declarative fashion.",
        "The use of scoring is in this sense crucial.",
        "The system has been implemented and successfully tested on real input which showed overgeneration due to PP and adverbial attachment, coordination, pronominal resolution and lexical ambiguity.",
