        "Motivation Rcasearch on natural language processing systems today strives for the construction of robust and portable systems.' A system is robust, if it can handle a large variety of user inputs without giving up or producing unexpected results.",
        "A system is portable in the sense intended here, if it is not geared to a single subject domain, but can be ported with a reasonable effort to a variety of subject domains.",
        "It is common understanding that there exists a central fragment of a language which I. is required fir dealing with virtually any subject domain, and 2. is invariant with respect to meaning and use accross subject domains.",
        "It is of course a non-trivial empirical question whether such a central fragment really exists, and if so, to say what it is, but a number of researchers seem to share the assumption that it does (cf. e.g. Alshawi et al.",
        "(1988)).",
        "Any robust and portable system would then have to handle this core fragment.",
        "In this paper I am concerned with a second – related – assumption, namely that there exists a core vocabulary which is needed for handling any subject domain.",
        "This assumption is also shared by many researchers, and it underlies the production of basic vocabularies for language learning such as Oehler (1980).",
        "l isually the authors claim that their word lists are based on statistical investigations, but they also emphasize that.",
        "they did not slavishly stick to the statistics but used additional criteria such as \"usage value\", \"availability\", \"familiarity\", or \"learnahility\" without ever saying how these are established.2 I will address the following questions:",

        "occur with a drastically higher frequency than in the other sections, which of course can be attributed to subject matter.",
        "But personal pronouns, in particular 1st and 2nd person pronouns, also show a much higher frequency, and this can hardly be attributed to subject matter, rather to different communicative functions of feuilletonistic writing and say economic news.",
        "All of this relates of course to the much discussed issue of what constitutes a representatitve corpus for statistical linguistic analysis.",
        "Since specific subject matters and communicative functions vary in importance for different speakers of a language, it will be difficult if not impossible to eliminate arbitrariness.",
        "Rather, a definition of representative corpus must take into account the research goals pursued.",
        "For a natural language system which is supposed to analyze and generate texts, to engage in dialogues with users, and which is to acquire knowledge from the analysis of definitions and rules formulated in natural language, one needs a corpus of texts where all these aspects are sufficiently represented.",
        "We were able to draw upon a variety of corpora none of which would show all the features required, but the combination of them seems to be quite reasonable.",
        "We compared the following five word lists:",
        "I. Oehler (1980): Grundwortschatz consisting of 2247 words, 2.",
        "Erk (1972): scientific texts from 34 disciplines, 1283 words with frequency 20, 3.",

        "I7or a core vocabulary to be set up for a natural language system, I think, one must strive for linguistic closure, since otherwise, one ends up with words one cannot use.",
        "This means that you cannot base the core vocabulary on frequency counts alone.",

        "I propose to formulate all of these types of rules in natural language for /33 trying to stay within at least the vocabulary of 111 , to add the words used in the formulations to the original set, and continue until one cannot think of further rules.",
        "I claim that one can achieve a fixed point from where on no new words arc added to the set, and that at this moment one has reached a rather good approximation to a semantic core vocabulary.",
        "There is undoubtedly a relationship between frequency and semantic relevance: since taxonomic relations arc often exemplified by anaphoric references, since semantic compatibility constraints lead to the co-occurrence of ap- 304 - propriate words, and since other more complex semantic relationships arc bound to be exhibited in the various threads of discourse, one has all reason to expect a certain amount of congruence between frequency counts and the semantic core vocabulary as defined above.",
        "The work on formulating taxonomic relations, semantic constraints and other meaning rules is underway, and since it will involve all of the vocabulary, linguistic closure will be achieved at the same time.",

        "This highlights a big problem in the natural language formulation of meaning rules: how is ambiguity dealt with?",
        "Space does not permit a full discussion here, therefore suffice it to say that it is one of our research goals to formulate meaning rules which specify criteria for disambiguation."
