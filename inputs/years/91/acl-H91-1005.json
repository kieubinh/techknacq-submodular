        "One of the most obvious and natural applications for speech technology is in providing a gateway to information services over the telephone network Already a significant growth is occurring the provision of information from a centralised computing system using stored messages or synthetic speech derived from text files.",
        "Most of these systems however currently rely on the use of touch tone input for selection of the information.",
        "In the UK only 15% of homes and businesses have tone dialling, although the network is currently able to support around 50% tone dialling.",
        "The ability to recognise a small number of words or even the digits without the user requiring to train the system therefore has widespread application.",
        "As the scope of the information service expands so also does the need for more intelligent dialogues with much larger vocabularies for speech understanding.",
        "The SUNDIAL project, led by Logica Cambridge, is currently one of Europe's largest collaborative projects in speech technology involving partners from the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Sweden in 170 man years of effort over five years.",
        "The project which is part funded by the Commission of the European Communities under the ESPRIT programme, commenced in September 1988 and will end in July 1993.",

        "The systems are planned to support a speaker independent vocabulary of up to 1000 - 2000 words in four languages (English, French, German and Italian).",
        "The project builds on experience gained by partners in previous ESPRIT projects such as P26 - \"Advanced Algorithms and Architectures for Speech and Image Processing\", P316 - ESTEAM and P1015 - \"Palabre\", as well as other projects funded by national programmes such as VODIS (UK) and SPICOS (FRG) (Fissore et al. 88, Niemann et al. 88, Peckham 89, Brenner 89) A number of these projects have already demonstrated speaker dependent speech understanding with vocabularies of around 1000 words."

        "A common architecture has been agreed amongst the partners in order to fulfil two main purposes;",

        "• to allow the implementation of different processing strategies by modifying the control parameters and the flow of data between the modules.",
        "The architecture is of a 'Distributed Database ' type which uses bidirectional interfaces, currently only between each major module.",
        "The Distributed Database Architecture (DDA) is most fully exploited at the present time within the Dialogue Manager module and this is described more fully in a section 6.",
        "The major modules and architecture of the system are shown in figure 1.",
        "These modules make use of knowledge-based techniques for dialogue management and rule-based as well as statistical natural language processing.",
        "Recognition is based on an acoustic pattern-matching technique which uses Hidden Markov Models (HMM's) of phoneme sized speech units, thus providing a means of more efficiently handling a large vocabulary and the coarticulation effects associated with fluent speech.",
        "It is planned to carry out experiments during 1991 on the use of predictions at various levels within the architecture.",
        "These include passing down predictions generated by the dialogue module to the Linguistic processor.",
        "This module may in turn provide lexical constraints at the acoustic-word decoding stage.",
        "Four separate language demonstrators are being built with applications covering Intercity Train times (Germany and Italy) and Flight Enquiries/Reservations (UK &France).",
        "The acoustic-phonetic decoding is aimed at speaker independence with the aim of operation over the telephone network.",
        "In all cases the goal is to recognise naturally spoken sentences, relevant to the chosen application domains.",
        "The interactive dialogue component is expected be a crucial part of any robust speech based computer information system, providing graceful error recovery and dialogue repair as well as eliciting further information, handling clarification and confirmation.",
        "Examples of the type of dialogue which SUNDIAL aims to support are shown below for a flight enquiries application.",

        "In order to provide insight into user requirements a number of 'Wizard of Oz' simulations have been performed for some of the selected applications.",
        "In addition analysis has been carried out on a large corpus of human-human dialogues relating to flight enquiries and reservations, in order to inform the simulations and also to provide a baseline for unconstrained dialogues.",
        "The methodology for Wizard of Oz simulations is that a human accomplice takes the role of the computer speech understanding component and the output to the user is provided by either synthetic speech or vocoded natural speech (Fraser and Gilbert, 90).",
        "Subjects are presented with various scenarios to enable them to make enquiries about flights or hotels.",
        "The human accomplice is given certain constraints to attempt to emulate the performance of a speech understanding system.",
        "These constraints, in some of the simulations, were imposed through a menu-driven tool which restricted the flexibility of the systems output at any stage in the dialogue.",
        "(Ponamale et al., 90).",
        "A small database was also used to access the requested information.",
        "The simulations therefore provide a useful means of assessing the potential impact on users of the expected limitations or constraints of a future computer speech understanding and cooperative dialogue system.",
        "The corpora derived from these simulations have been analysed to define the spoken language phenomena which occur, as well as the required lexicon, grammar, semantics and dialogue rules for the chosen applications.",
        "It is already clear from analysing the corpora from the first round of simulations that many of the requirements in terms of dialogue strategies are common to the four languages studied and to the different applications.",
        "It is expected that these requirements will also prove to be generic to other information service domains."

        "To support the development of speaker independent phone models a number of large multispeaker corpora have already been recorded for each language, mostly over the telephone.",
        "These contain a set of phonetically balanced sentences for each language (for English these are similar to the TIMIT and SCRIBE sentences) and a set of application specific sentences.",
        "Preliminary results for the acoustic-phonetic decoding module show that continuous density HMM's (CDHMM) achieve 75.83% word accuracy on sentences, compared to 67.13% for discrete density HMM's, using 305 phonetic units for the Italian language and around a 1000 word vocabulary (Fissore et al., 90).",
        "Word accuracy includes insertions, deletions and substitutions.",
        "These results are for speaker independent recognition of telephone quality sentences; however they do not take into account the effect of the linguistic processing module on sentence understanding performance.",
        "Some benchmarlcing experiments have been done and is also ongoing using the DARPA TIMIT and Resource Management Databases.",

        "All tests were carried out with telephone quality speech.",
        "Following this work a small vocabulary over-the-telephone speaker-independent recogniser has been developed with a vocabulary of around 50 words, suitable for a telephone banking application.",

        "It is a major goal of SUNDIAL to handle a number of the observed attributes of normal human-human dialogue such as: turn taking, anaphora and ellipsis (utterances which depend on their context for their meaning), hesitations, coughs, changing the subject, strategies for dealing with communication failure, implicit and explicit confirmation, and resolution of ambiguity via questioning.",
        "After some initial prototyping and the development of a common (to all partners) functional specification, a prototype Dialogue Manager which is based on a distributed database architecture has been implemented.",
        "In this approach, various modules or agents (shown in figure 6) communicate with each other, maintaining their own histories or knowledge bases (the so called distributed database).",

        "It may propose a next move for the system and inform the message planner, and send a set of possible next caller moves to the linguistic interface module, as predictions.",
        "These predictions are elaborated into linguistic patterns that can serve to constrain the parser.",
        "After the caller's input has been processed, it is assumed that a best prediction instantiation has been found, and this is translated into dialogic terms by the linguistic interface and passed back to the dialogue module.",
