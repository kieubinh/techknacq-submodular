        "Eleven of the papers were presented by DARPA SLS contractors, and three were from non-DARPA sites.",
        "Five papers dealt with speech recognition systems: (1) The group at Dragon Systems reported speaker-dependent system results for the Resource Management (RM) test set, using the word-pair grammar [1].",
        "Dragon's results were obtained on a 25 Mhz 80486-based PC, with an RM vocabulary modelled using \"roughly 30,000 phonemes in context or PICs\", and making use of the Dragon rapid match module.",
        "(2) Doug Paul of MIT Lincoln Laboratory reported speech recognition results for both the RM and ATIS SPREC test material [2].",
        "Recent work includes: variations in semiphone modelling, a \"very simple improved duration model\" responsible for reducing the error rate by about 10%, a new training strategy, and modifications to the recognizer to use back-off bigram language models.",
        "(3) The Spoken Language Group at MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science also reported results for both the RM and ATIS SPREC test material [3].",
        "The MIT SUMMIT system is a \"segment-based\" speech recognition system, including a front end that incorporates a model of the (4) Francis Kubala et al.",
        "reported on BBN's BYBLOS results for both the RM and ATIS SPREC test material [4].",
        "The reported RM speaker-independent results include results for a SI model built using only 12 training speakers.",

        "\"The first is a controlled condition using a specific training set and bigram grammar\" [similar to that used by Paul [2]].",
        "The second condition makes use of augmented training data (collected at BBN) and a 4-gram class grammar.",
        "(5) A collaborative effort involving Mari Ostendorf and her colleagues at Boston University and others at BBN makes use of a general formalism for integrating two or more speech recognition technologies [5].",
        "\"In this formalism, one system uses the N-best search strategy to generate a list of candidate sentences; the list is rescored by other systems; and the different scores are combined to optimize performance.\"",
        "Ostendorf et al.",
        "\"report on combining the BU system based on stochastic segment models and the BBN system based on hidden Markov models.\"",
        "Six papers were presented by DARPA contractors describing integrations of speech and natural language processing into ATIS systems.",
        "(1) The Spoken Language Group at MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science presented a status report on the MIT ATIS system [6].",
        "A context-independent version of the SUMMIT system (described in [3]) including a word-pair grammar with perplexity 92 has been incorporated.",

        "Results are reported for both the February '91 ATIS benchmark test set and for a test set collected at MTT.",
        "(2) The Speech and Natural Language Groups at SRI reported results for both the RM and ATIS SPREC speech recognition test sets and for the ATIS NL and SLS tests [7].",
        "The primary emphasis of the SRI presentation was to describe improvements to the SRI DECIPHER speech recognition system, a component in SRI's ATIS system.",
        "Recent \"significant\" performance improvements are attributed to the addition of tied-mixture HMM modelling.",
        "Other approaches discussed include experiments with male-female separation, speaker adaptation, rejection of out-of-vocabulary input, and language modelling (including the use of multi-word lexical units).",
        "SRI's \"simple serial integration of speech and natural language processing\" is said to work well \"because the speech recognition system uses a statistical language model to improve recognition performance, and because the natural language processing uses a template matching approach (described elsewhere in this proceedings) that makes it somewhat insensitive to recognition errors\".",
        "(3) Wayne Ward presented one of two papers from CMU describing the CMU ATIS System, \"PHOENIX\" [8].",
        "The speech recognition component consists of a recent vocabulary-independent version of SPHINX, presently without incorporation of out-of-vocabulary models.",
        "PHOENIX's \"concept of flexible parsing combines frame-based semantics with a semantic phrase grammar,\" so that the \"operation of the parser can be viewed as 'phrase spotting.'\"",
        "Language modelling included a bigram model for the recognizes and a grammar for the parser.",
        "(4) The second paper from CMU, by Sheryl Young, described the \"structure and operation of SOUL (for Semantically-Oriented Understanding of Language)\" [9].",
        "SOUL can use semantic and pragmatic knowledge to correct, reject and/or clarify the outputs of the PHOENIX case frame parser in the ATIS domain.",
        "(5) BBN's NL group reported on the BBN DELPHI natural language system and the integration of this system with the BBN BYBLOS system (described in [4]), using an N-best architecture [10].",
        "The BBN authors cite a number of improvements to the DELPHI system that are described in other papers in this Proceedings.",
        "(6) Recent work on the Unisys ATIS Spoken Language System was described by Norton et al.",
        "[11].",
        "\"Enhancements to the system's semantic processing for handling non-transparent argument structure and enhancements to the system's pragmatic processing of material in answers displayed to the user\" are described.",
        "In addition to the Unisys system's NL results, results were reported for the case of SLS systems consisting of the Unisys natural language system coupled with two ATIS speech recognition systems: (1) the MIT SUMMIT system (described in [3]) and (2) the MIT Lincoln Labs system (described in [2]).",
        "The Unisys system's natural language",
        "constraints were also used to select the first-best of N-best speech recognition results (for the SPREC tests) based on syntactic, semantic and pragmatic knowledge.",

        "A keyword slot-filling approach is used, rather than a \"standard parser for English.\"",
        "(2) In one of two papers from AT&T Bell Laboratories included in this session, Evelyne Tzoukermann described \"The Use of a Commercial Natural Language Interface in the ATIS Task\" [13].",
        "Tzoukermann relates their \"experience in adapting [a commercial natural language interface] to handle domain dependent ATIS queries.\"",
        "The discussion of error analysis notes that, in contrast to the \"well-formed\" written English for which the commercial product was designed, spontaneous speech contains repetitions, restarts, deletions, interjections and ellipsis, as well as the omission of punctuation marks that \"might give the system information\".",
        "(3) The second AT&T Bell Laboratories paper, by Pieraccini, Levin and Lee, proposes \"a model for a statistical representation of the conceptual structure in a restricted subset of spoken natural language\" [14].",
        "The \"technique of case decoding\" is applied to the Class A sentences in the ATIS domain, with sentences analyzed in terms of 7 general cases: QUERY, OBJECT, ATTRIBUTE, RESTRICTION, Q[UERY] ATTRIBUTE, AND, and DUMMY.",
        "Unlike other papers in this session, this paper implements a non-standard test paradigm that prevents explicit comparisons with the results cited for other systems.",
        "To address this shortcoming, the authors indicate that they \"are developing a module that translates the conceptual representation into an SQL query\".",
        "Presumably the SQL queries, in conjunction with the ATIS relational database, will permit use of existing DARPA ATIS query-answer performance evaluation procedures."

      "heading": "III. DISCUSSION",
      "text": [
        "Following review of the posters, a number of issues were discussed.",
        "(1) Differences between ATIS Test Sets:",
        "It was noted that there were a number of differences between the June 1990 and February 1991 ATIS test sets, including evidence of greater-than-expected incidence of dysfluencies in the speech and \"skewed\" or disproportionate representation of some syntactic/semantic phenomena.",
        "Doug Paul noted that the test set perplexity for the June 1990 \"Class A\" test set was 18, in contrast with 22 for the present \"Class A\" test set, and a perplexity of 45 for the \"non-Class A\" test material (i.e., all other utterances).",
        "Inferences about \"progress\" or \"trends\" may thus be complicated by these differences between test sets.",
        "(2) Limited training material:",
        "Also noted was the fact that only a limited amount of fully \"canonized\" training material – for training acoustic models and for studying such phenomena as dialogue modelling – was available prior to this meeting, in some cases limiting system development.",
        "This factor was cited in a number of papers e.g., [2, 4, 8, 10]).",
        "(3) Limitations on the future value of the Resource Management Corpora:",
        "Hy Murveit noted his belief that demonstrable progress in recognizing speaker independent RM1 speech was limited by \"how much information we can tease out of [3990] training",
        "utterances\".",
        "Richard Schwartz took exception to this, citing steady progress in recognizing RM speech.",
        "(4) Properties of ATIS-domain speech:",
        "Richard Schwartz shared some analysis of the ATIS-domain test set speakers.",
        "He noted that there was one speaker in the test set with \"24 instances of 'uh' in 12 sentences\", [which leads to] \"a 50% word error rate\" for that speaker.",
        "On the basis of his analysis, he noted that \"people don't know how to talk to a system\", and suggested that there ought to be more user/speaker feedback during the data collection process so that the incidence of dysfluencies would be reduced.",
        "In response, Hy Murveit noted that if we regard the two worst speakers in the test material as atypical, then \"the current word error rate is close to 15%, and with some success in modelling the 'urns' and 'ers', the error rate may be only 10%, or about twice as bad as for RM\".",
        "Correlation was noted between difficulty in recognizing both the speech and [in understanding] the natural language for the \"bad\" speakers, so that the suggestion that these speakers may be atypical may be warranted.",
        "Patti Price noted that the [speech recognition] error rates suggest that \"ATIS is more difficult, but we don't know why\".",
        "It may be that ATIS speech is \"more casual\", but we need to study these issues in more detail, especially as they affect data collection.",
        "(5) Selection of the February ATIS test material:",
        "Victor Zue and Rich Schwartz asked about selection of the February 1991 ATIS test set, asking if there had been screening to select or reject potential test material on the basis of the incidence of dysfluencies noted in the transcriptions.",
        "NIST noted that the only such screening was to partition some of the utterances into the \"Optional\" categories on the basis of evidence of verbal deletions in the \"lexical SNOR\" transcriptions, since this evidence does not appear in the conventional SNOR transcriptions.",
        "For the June test set, there was no such screening, since attention had not been directed to the subset containing verbal deletions.",
        "(6) Use of \"Baseline\" or \"Reference\" Conditions:",
        "John Makhoul noted that there \"too many uncontrolled variables\" (e.g., algorithms, training materials, grammar) to make comparisons of the ATIS speech recognition systems beneficial using the SPREC results.",
        "BBN had advocated use of a \"baseline\" condition and provided SPREC data for both a \"baseline\" and an \"augmented\" training condition to permit such comparisons [4].",
        "MIT/LL also made use of this \"baseline\" condition [2].",
        "Makhoul noted that a similar situation (i.e., \"too many uncontrolled variables\") applies for the case of the NL results.",
        "Hy Murveit noted that SRI's reluctance to \"lock into a baseline condition\" was based on a reluctance to choose one with the 'wrong operating point\"', based on inadequate training.",
        "Francis Kubala noted, however, that choosing a \"baseline that undershoots\" [performance] ought not to be a problem if one wished to \"demonstrate clear wins\", and that such a baseline could be changed over time.",
        "John Makhoul also noted that reporting error rates is in general preferable to reporting \"scores\"."

        "For the Class A subset, results are tabulated for 7 SLS systems at 5 DARPA contractors' sites.",
        "Non-DARPA contractors declined to participate in the SLS tests.",
        "The weighted error ranges considerably, from 90.3% to 41.4%, with the best (lowest weighted error) results for the SRI system described in [7] and in other SRI papers in this proceedings.",
        "The low SRI SLS weighted error rate (41.4%) appears to be a consequence of both a well-performing ATIS speech recognition component and a well-performing natural language component (i.e., a SPREC test word error rate of 18.0% and an NL weighted error rate of 31.0%).",
        "Not surprisingly, weighted error figures for complete SLS systems are higher than for corresponding NL components (processing the lexical SNOR formatted versions of the same utterances).",
        "The relative increase in weighted error rate appears to correspond to the relative performance of the speech recognition component.",
        "By comparing comparable data from Tables 3 and 4, note that for the SRI system the weighted error rate for the Class A subset increases from 31.0% (for the NL component) to 41.4% (for the complete SLS system.",
        "Two SLS systems made use of BBN's BYBLOS ATIS SPREC data: the BBN HARC system (sys16-a) and the Unisys-BBN SPREC system (sys22-a).",
        "Comparing the increases of weighted error rates for NL vs. SLS systems, one can note an approximate increase in weighted error rate of only 8 or 9 percentage points for these systems (i.e., from 49.0% for the BBN DELPHI NL system to 57.2% for the BBN HARC SLS system, and from 51.7% for the Unisys NL system to 60.7% for the Unisys-((BBN SPREC)) SLS system).",
        "This relatively small increase in error rate is probably attributable to the BBN \"augmented training\" (sys18-a) SPREC test word error rate of (only) 16.1%, which is not significantly different from SRI's SPREC test results of 18.0%.",
        "In contrast, a substantially larger increase in error rate can be noted for the CMU systems (i.e., 35.9% and 31.0% for the two CMU NL systems vs. 65.5% for the SLS system), probably due to performance of the CMU SPREC system with error rates that are significantly higher than for the SRI SPREC system.",
        "Unisys reported results for three system configurations: using speech recognition results provided by the MTT/LCS ATIS SPREC system (designated sys10-a), by the MIT/LL ATIS SPREC system (sys 11-a), and by the BBN BYBLOS/ATIS system (sys22-a).",
        "In this case, better performance on the SLS test (i.e., lower weighted error) correlates with better performance on the SPREC results, as would be expected.",
