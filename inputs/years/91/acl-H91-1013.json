        "While most successful systems to date have been based on hidden Markov models (HMMs), there may be utility in combining the HMM approach with some other very different approach.",
        "For example, the research group at Boston University is exploring the use of the Stochastic Segment Model (SSM) [9,11] as an alternative to the HMM.",
        "In contrast to the HMM, the SSM scores a phoneme as a whole entity, allowing a more detailed acoustic representation.",
        "In previous work [6], it was demonstrated that the SSM is effective in the task of phoneme recognition, with results on the TIMIT database using context-independent phoneme models that are comparable to context-dependent HMMs.",
        "Thus, there is a good possibility that, with the proper use of context, the performance may surpass that of the HMM system.",
        "Unfortunately, the computation required for the SSM is considerably greater than that for HMMs, making it impractical to implement the standard optimal dynamic programming search algorithms.",
        "In this paper, we introduce a general formalism for integrating different speech recognition technologies, which also enables evaluation of word recognition performance with the SSM.",
        "In this approach, one recognition system uses the N-best search strategy to provide a list of sentence hypotheses.",
        "A second system (presumably more complex) is used to rescore these hypotheses, and the scores of the different sys"

        "If the errors made by the two systems differ, then combining the two sets of scores would yield an improvement in overall performance (either in terms of the percent of correct sentences or the average rank of the correct sentence).",
        "The N-best formalism offers a means of reducing the computation associated with combining the results of two systems by restricting the search space of the second system.",
        "It therefore also provides a lower cost mechanism for evaluating word recognition performance of the SSM by itself, through simply ignoring the scores of the HMM in reranking the sentences.",
        "In the following section, we describe the integration methodology in more detail.",
        "Next, we present experimental results combining the stochastic segment model with the BBN By-blos system, including a result that incorporates statistical grammar scores as well as a benchmark result using the word-pair grammar.",

        "An exact, but somewhat expensive algorithm for finding the N best sentence hypotheses was also described in [3].",
        "Since then, several sites have adopted the N-Best strategy for combining speech recognition with natural language.",
        "In addition, more efficient approximate scoring algorithms for finding the N Best sentences have been developed (e.g., [12,13]).",
        "These algorithms introduce only a short delay after finding the 1-Best hypothesis for finding the N-Best hypotheses.",
        "This same N-best scoring paradigm can be used for the integration of different recognition techniques.",
        "The main difference is that, for the rescoring application, it is useful to have the word and/or phoneme boundaries associated with this hypothesis.",

        "Here we use a stochastic segment model in rescoring, but any acoustic model would be useful in this formalism.",
        "(For example, a neural network model of phoneme segments is used in [1].)",
        "The constrained recognition search is particularly useful for segmental acoustic models, which have a significantly larger recognition search space than frame-based hidden Markov models.",
        "If the phoneme segmentations are given and assumed fixed, the computation required for rescoring is extremely small.",
        "If the phoneme segmentations are not given for the N hypotheses, then rescoring is essentially automatic segmentation.",
        "The maximum likelihood segmentation is given by a dynamic programming algorithm, typically with minimum and maximum phoneme duration constraints, as in [9].",
        "Scoring a sentence with the optimal segmentation for a model will yield better results than scoring according to the segmentation determined by a different model, but the cost in computation is significant (roughly a factor of 300 more than using fixed segmentations).",
        "Since we have found the stochastic segment model performance to be fairly sensitive to boundary location, we anticipate that optimal segmentation may be very important.",
        "A compromise strategy is to find the optimal segmentation subject to the constraint of being within a fixed number of frames of the HMM segmentation.",
        "The constrained dynamic programming solution appears to suffer no loss in performance and saves a factor of 30 in computation relative to the unconstrained algorithm.",
        "A slight variation of the segmentation algorithm involves searching for the optimal phone sequence and its segmentation, given a word sequence.",
        "In other words, we allow alternative pronunciations in rescoring a sentence hypothesis.",
        "We hypothesize that the use of alternative pronunciations will significantly improve SSM word recognition performance, mainly because SSM phoneme recognition performance is much higher on the carefully hand-labeled TIMIT database than it is on the Resource Management Task (in which case we assume that the phone sequence assigned by the BBN single pronunciation recognizer is \"correct\").",
        "However, we have not investigated this question on a dictionary with a sufficiently rich set of pronunciations.",

        "The results reported here yield some improvement in performance, but we anticipate a greater effect with future improvements to the SSM.",
        "Improvements can also be gained from further research on score combination, since the weight estimation technique was found to be very sensitive to initial starting points.",
        "In addition, scores from very different types of knowledge sources could be combined to improve the performance of a speech understanding system.",
