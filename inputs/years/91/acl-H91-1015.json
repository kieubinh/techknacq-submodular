        "The DARPA ATIS Spoken Language System (SLS) task represents significant new challenges for speech and natural language technologies.",

        "Spontaneous speech is a significant challenge to speech recognition, since it contains false starts, and non-words, and because it tends to be more casual than read speech.",
        "It is also a major challenge to natural language technologies because the structure of spontaneous language differs dramatically from the structure of written language, and almost all natural language research has been focused on written language."
