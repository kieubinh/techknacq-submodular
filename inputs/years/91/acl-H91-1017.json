        "The DARPA speech and natural language community has recently adopted the domain of air travel information for its spoken language systems.",
        "The domain has been named ATIS, for air travel information system.",
        "Training and test data are gathered for this common task by employing speakers to verbally interact with a database in order to solve one or more randomly assigned, predefined problems with predefined goals and prefererpes.",
        "To perform their task, speakers must verbally query an air travel database.",
        "Speakers are not required to use complete, well formed or syntactically correct utterances.",
        "They can ask for any information, regardless of whether the request is reasonable, or whether the information contained in the database.",
        "Hence, true spontaneous speech is generated.",
        "Data is collected by recording both subject utterances and database responses as speakers perform these verbal tasks.",
        "The recorded data is then divided into training and test sets of use by the DARPA community.",
        "Thus far, the utterances selected for evaluation test sets are highly constrained, being restricted to those utterances which can be answered using the information in the database and can either be interpreted and answered in isolation, or by using only the context of a preceeding utterance.",
        "All utterances that are ambiguous, refer to objects and actions not included in the database, request information that is not available, or contain spontaneous speech phenomena such as mid-utterance oral edits and corrections are removed from the official test sets.",
        "For these evaluations, we designed the Soul.",
        "system to enhance the performance of the CMU ATIS system when operating in isolated or limited context modes.",
        "The system operates in an opportunistic manner.",
        "It is only called upon to perform post processing when there is reasonable uncertainty in the case-frame output.",
        "This uncertainty can result from large regions of unaccounted-for speech, multiple, competing interpretations and seemingly incomplete or un-meaningful interpretations.",
        "Input to SOUL is the utterance, all the words and phrases matched by the case-frame parser, PHOENIX, and a set of hypothesized interpretation frames (or instantiated case-frame).",
        "SOUL outputs either an error message (e.g. No information in database on BOULDER) or a single interpretation composed of corrections, deletions, and all forms of modifications to the instantiated case-frame It does this by using a large semantic and pragmatic knowledge base in conjunction with abductive reasoning and constraint satisfaction techniques.",
        "A by-product of the SOUL design is that it also provides much of the semantic and pragmatic knowledge required for our complete dialog and prediction facilities, previously called MINDS system (1988, 1989a,b, 1990) [1, 2, 3, 4].",
        "As SOUL was designed to deal with all spontaneously generated utterances, we expect there will be some advantages for using the system while processing the required, highly restricted data, but that the system will be far more valuable when processing unrestricted input.",
        "To evaluate the effectiveness and relative payoff of SOUL, we investigated the following two issues.",
        "First, we wanted to see how much, if any impact use of a large semantic and pragmatic knowledge base would have in reducing error relative to a semantically based (by definition) case-frame parser [5, 6, 7] when processing only isolated utterances or utterances that can be interpreted using only very limited context.",
        "Caseframe parsers employ both semantic and syntactic knowledge.",
        "They do not use an extensive knowledge base or inferencing procedures.",
        "However, they have proven to be very robust and effective in producing interpretations of both well formed and ill-formed user input.",
        "Secondly, we wanted to determine if the use of a knowledge base alone would allow us to process all types of utterances, including those which are un-answerable, request information not in the database and outside the definition of system capabilities,",
        "are ambiguous, as well as to be able to detect those utterances which can only be answered by using unavailable contextual information.",
        "To evaluate these questions, we assessed performance of our case-frame speech parser, PHOENIX, both with and without SOUL on four independent test sets.",
        "Two of the test sets contained unrestricted data -- every utterance generated was processed.",
        "The other two test sets (DARPA ATISO and ATIS1) contained restricted utterances, as described above.",
        "The remaineder of this paper describes how SOUL uses semantic and pragmatic knowledge to correct, reject and/or clarify the outputs of the POENDC case-frame parser in the ATIS domain.",

        "To summarize, SOUL was designed to deal with ambiguous, unanswerable, illegal and context removable utterances.",

        "When processing unrestricted input, as required in real world applications, the addition of a semantic and pragmatic postprocessor for performing fine grained analyses results in significant improvements in accuracy.",

        "Results of Test Set 3 indicate reasonable detection abilities (70%).",
        "In summary, semantic and pragmatic knowledge can be effectively used to enhance a system's accuracy of interpretation rates.",
        "This effect holds even in isolated utterance processing tasks, which provide a great deal less data than can be derived from a complete dialog.",
        "In the absence of dialog, the accuracy improvements are more marked in more difficult processing conditions than when processing constrained, relatively straight forward utterances."
