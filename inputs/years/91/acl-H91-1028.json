        "This paper presents, in a first part, the detailed results of several field evaluations of the CNET speaker independent speech recognition system in a context of 2 voice-activated servers accessible by the general French public over the telephone.",
        "The analysis of roughly 11 000 user's tokens indicates that the rejection of incorrect input is a major problem and that the gap between the recognition rates observed in real use conditions and in the most \"realistic\" laboratory tests remains very large.",
        "The second part of the paper describes the current improvements of the system : better rejection procedures, enhancement of the recognition performances resulting from both the introduction of field data in the training data and the increase of the number of parameters, automatic adjustments of the I-IMM topology allowing to either reduce overall model complexity or improve recognition performance.",
        "Tested on long distance telephone databases (450 to 750 speakers), the current version of the CNET recognition system yields a laboratory error rate of 0.7 % on the 10 French digits and of 0.95 % on a 36 word vocabulary."

        "The connected speech recognition algorithm developed at CNET in 1986 [1] uses the 1-IMM approach and has been implemented on several devices (RDP 20 and RDP 50 boards) [2].",
        "In the implemented version of the algorithm, 6 Mel cepstral coefficients, the energy and its derivative are computed every 16 ms to obtain the input vectors.",
        "The observation probabilities are represented by gaussian functions with diagonal covariance matrices and are tied to the transitions of the Markov chains.",
        "Various kinds of modelling can be implemented : either word units or sub-word units such as phonemes, diphones or allophones.",
        "For each application, the network is fully compiled and includes initial and final silence models for each word.",
        "This system has been tested on several databases of isolated and connected words recorded over the telephone network with willing subjects (mainly long distance lines, speakers representing different regional accents) : DIGITS-1 (455 speakers, 10 French digits), NUMBERS (730 speakers, 00...99 in French), TREGOR (513 speakers, 36 French words).",
        "For each database, one half of the data was used for training, the other half for testing.",
        "Using word models, the obtained word error rates (for the first version of the system) were 2.1 % for DIGITS-1, 2.7 % for TREGOR and 9.6 % for NUMBERS."

        "In 1988, an experimental, one-port voice interactive system, MAIRIEVOX [3], was built on a PC computer using the RDP 50 board (word models, 13 states/word, 3 gaussian pdfs per state).",
        "Designed to give various informations about local services around the city of Lannion (20 000 inhabitants), MAIRIEVOX is accessible by the general public over the telephone since mid-88.",
        "The input interface for the user is restricted to voice input without any keypad complementary command.",
        "A tree structure is used to access information.",
        "The complete vocabulary contains 21 words (extracted from the 36 words TREGOR data-base) but the dialogue module limits the active vocabulary to 6 words at each step.",
        "Since that time, MAIRIEVOX has been the subject of several field trials allowing to identify its critical points and to substantially improve both the speech recognition performances and the acceptability of the service.",
        "The first evaluations (during which the input signal was not recorded) mainly allowed to improve the ergonomy of the service.",
        "For example, it appeared extremely usefull to authorize the recognition of the speech commands during the delivery of the voice messages : this allows the regular users of the service to anticipate the commands and therefore to quickly reach the required information in the dialogue-tree.",
        "An echo-cancellation procedure (non recursive filter with a 8 ms window) was thus introduced on the speech recognition board.",
        "The dialogue strategy was also modified to take into account the necessity of recovering from the largest part of recognition errors (\"confirmation\" procedures with Yes/No commands in case of recognition difficulties).",
        "With these two main improvements, the acceptability of the isolated-word,",
        "menu-driven speech command server has been demonstrated (less than 10 % failure in the access to the requested informations).",
        "During 1990, a new set of evaluations has been done : roughly 4600 voice inputs (corresponding to 340 telephone calls) were systematically recorded, listened to and labelled as \"correct inputs\" (55.5 %), \"incorrect speech inputs\" (i.e. non permitted by the dialogue) (17.8 %) and \"noise\" (26.7 %).",
        "From the application point of view, the rejection of incorrect inputs appears therefore to be a crucial point : despite clear instructions to the caller, roughly 45 % of the inputs to MAIRIEVOX are incorrect (words outside the vocabulary or noise).",
        "The simple rejection procedure used in MAIRIEVOX (all the vocabulary words are candidates at any time even if the dialogue module filters the words which are not valid in the context, use of a simple duration-based rejection threshold) allowed to limit the false rejection error rate to roughly 10 % (\"correct inputs\").",
        "For incorrect inputs, 82 % are corectly rejected but 18 % induce an error (false acceptance).",
        "From the recognition point of view (\"correct inputs\" only), we observed a 12.2 % error rate (21 valid words), 36 % of which being due to bad end point detection (truncated words).",
        "On the other hand, contrary to previous observations, the need for modelling hesitations (or surrounding speech) didn't really appear to be crucial : less than 5 % of the speech inputs contain hesitations or supplementary words (the design of the dialogue seems to play an essential role in this phonemenons)."

        "A commercial voice-activated server \"HOROSCOPE\" was operating since April 1990 over the 9 taxation areas of the French telephone network.",
        "Based on the same recognition technology as MAIRIEVOX, it involves the recognition of the 12 horoscope signs spoken in an isolated manner.",
        "The calling person had the ability to ask for a horoscope sign at any time (branching factor of 12), any number of times, by waiting for the end of a message playback, or by interrupting it.",
        "The very direct dialogue procedure prevented the use of any dialogue-driven rejection process (contrary to MAIRIEVOX).",
        "During June 1990, 6446 tokens from 1724 calls [4] were recorded, listened to and labelled as \"correct speech inputs\" (73 %), \"incorrect speech inputs\" (speech without a vocabulary word) (15 %) and \"noise\" (12 %).",
        "Here again the rejection problem seems to be more important than the \"word spotting\" problem : less than 2 % of the \"correct speech\" inputs contain hesitations or supplementary words.",
        "The lack of perfect noise/speech discrimination in the endpoint detector aggravates the problem, as already observed for MAIRIEVOX : from the 27.1 % word error rate observed on \"correct inputs\", roughly 50 % are due to bad endpoint detection.",
        "The very low recognition score observed here results from 3 main short comings in the realisation of this industrial system : 1) only 1 gaussian/state was used in the 13 state word models, 2 only 150 speakers were used for training the models, 3 the implemented echo-cancellation procedure was a very simplified version of the procedure proposed by CNET (a 10 dB difference was observed between the 2 attenuation rates).",
        "In conclusion, after assessing two general-public word-recognition applications in use over the French telephone network, it was found that, despite clear instructions to the caller, a considerable proportion of the input lies outside the permitted vocabulary.",
        "These extraneous inputs are either incorrect speech tokens or non-speech tokens for which the caller is not always responsible (DTMF dialing, line bursts, outside noise etc...).",
        "There is therefore an urgent need for efficient rejection procedures.",
        "Moreover, the gap between the recognition error rates observed in real use conditions and in the laboratory tests is very large : a multiplicative factor of 3-4 is observed ; it can reach 10 if the application is carelessly designed and modelized !..."

        "Half of the data was used for training, the other half for testing.",
        "The first rejection procedure uses 3 sink models trained with the \"extraneous\" tokens (incorrect or noise inputs) of the training corpus and imposes thresholds on word-model scoring : the rejection threshold is applied on a \"corrected score\" which is the word HMM score minus the contribution of the silence models.",
        "The second rejection procedure operates on the \"trace\" of the HMM (i.e. informations on the optimal Viterbi path).",
        "It involves the extraction of the HMM trace from a given input token and the classification of this trace into \"acceptance\" or \"rejection\" by a multilayer perceptron (MLP).",
        "This rejection procedure is independent from the recognition process : it uses HMMs designed with the sole purpose of producing informative traces.",
        "For the \"trace\" rejection procedure, the best results were obtained with a trace containing 1) the number of frames observed per gaussian, 2) the average energy coefficient and 3) the average first Mel frequency coefficient of the frames observed per gaussian, i.e. with a trace exhibiting both a duration and a signal representation.",
        "The results of both procedures are illustrated on Figure 1 where the sum of the SE rate and the FR rate measures performance on correct tokens and the FA rate measures performance on extraneous tokens.",
        "Although the performances of both procedures appears to be similar within the confidence interval, there is one aspect unique to the rejection by trace : its ability to reject a large proportion of the substitution errors instead of proposing them to the user (substitution rejection error rate of 66 %).",
        "Work is currently underway to refine the trace-based procedure.",
        "Another promising direction seems to be to combine this two complementary methods."

        "Automatic adjustments of the structure of HMM models Using whole word basic units is generally a good choice for small vocabulary isolated word recognition, and increasing the size of the models usually leads to better performance.",
        "However, this also increases the computation time, due to the number of observation probabilities (gaussian functions) that must he computed for each frame.",
        "Thus, in order to use the best possible model in real time industrial devices, it was usefull to investigate the possibility of reducing the number of gaussian functions by clustering \"similar\" pdfs.",
        "This was done by iteratively merging the 2 gaussian pdf's inducing the smallest decrease of the total probability of the training observations, until the desired number of pdfs is reached [8].",
        "On the 36 word TREGOR database, this procedure allowed to reduce by 40 % the number of gaussian functions while keeping identical performances.",
        "Using sub-word basic units leads to more compact models (since all the occurrences of a given unit share the same set of pdfs), but it is difficult to increase the a priori size of the acoustical models (they may become too long).",
        "An algorithm has thus been developped [8] around the two following basic ideas : splitting the pdf s having the highest contribution to the probability of the training data, and discarding the transitions which are scarcely used.",
        "These two operators (splitting and discarding) are applied successively, and the model is retrained after each modification.",
