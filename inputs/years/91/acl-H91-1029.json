        "Performance estimates given for speech recognition/understanding systems are typically based on the assumption that users will behave in ways similar to the observed behavior of laboratory volunteers.",
        "This includes the acoustic/phonetic characteristics of the speech they produce as well as their willingness and ability to constrain their input to the device according to instructions.",
        "Since speech recognition devices often do not perform as well in the field as they do in the laboratory, analyses of real user behavior have been undertaken.",
        "The results of several field trials suggest that real user compliance with instructions is dramatically affected by the particular details of the prompts supplied to the user.",
        "A significant amount of real user speech data has been collected during these trials (34,000 utterances, 29 hours of data).",

        "Until the advent of a high performance continuous speech, unconstrained vocabulary/grammar, interactive speech understanding system, users must constrain their spoken interactions with speech recognition/understanding systems.",
        "Constraints may require speaking words in isolation, conforming to a limited vocabulary or grammar, restricting queries to a particular knowledge domain, etc.",
        "The users' willingness to comply with instructions specifying these constraints will determine the success of the technology.",
        "If users are willing or even able to confine themselves to one of two words (e.g., yes or no), a two-word speech recognition system may succeed.",
        "If users are non-compliant (e.g., say the target words embedded in phrases, say synonyms of the target words, reject the service as a result of the constraining instructions), the technology will fail in the field; despite high accuracy laboratory performance.",
        "How compliant are real users?",
        "The answer may be application-specific, dependent on particulars such as 1. frequency of repeat usage of the system, 2. motivation of the users, 3. cost of an error, 4. nature of the constraint, etc.",
        "It would be useful to understand the factors that predict compliance, and to know whether generalizations can be made across applications.",
        "In addition, it would be useful to have a better understanding of how to maximize user compliance.",
        "Moreover, there is value in analyzing non-compliant behavior.",
        "To the extent that non-compliance takes the form of choosing synonyms of the target words, the recognizer's vocabulary must be expanded.",
        "If non-compliance takes the form of embedding the target word in a phrase, word spotting or continuous speech recognition is required.",
        "If non-compliance is manifested by the user consistently wandering outside the knowledge domain of the speech recognition/understanding system, better instructions may be required.",

        "It seems intuitively obvious that to maximize the probability of successfully automating an application with speech recognition, a recognizer should be trained and tested on real user speech.",
        "This requires the collection of data from casual users interacting with an automated or pseudo-automated system, thereby producing spontaneous goal-directed speech under application conditions.",
        "These databases can be difficult and expensive to collect and so it is not surprising that speech recognition systems are most typically trained and tested on speech data collected under laboratory conditions.",
        "Laboratory databases can be gathered relatively quickly and inexpensively by recording speech produced by cooperative volunteers who are aware that they are participating in a data collection exercise.",

        "It has not been possible to collect databases that are matched with respect to speakers for telephone speech, probably because the anonymity of the users of telephone services makes it difficult to obtain read versions of spontaneously-produced speech from the same set of talkers.",
        "Therefore, there is little published data on the effects of read vs. spontaneous speech on the performance of recognition systems for telephone applications.",
        "Differences in speakers not withstanding, there is recent data to suggest that recognition performance can be significantly poorer when testing on real user telephone speech as compared to tests using telephone speech collected under laboratory conditions ([1], [2]).",
        "In summary, laboratory and real user behavior can be characterized along at least two important dimensions: compliance and speech characteristics.",

        "The longer term goal of the work summarized above is to develop speech recognition/understanding systems that maintain high accuracy performance in real telephone applications.",
        "Comparisons between a real user and a laboratory speech database highlight how apparently superficial differences between the two database types can result in dramatic differences in recognition performance.",
        "Having accounted for this kind of effect, there appears to be an approximately 6% performance difference that can be attributed to differences in the speech signal itself, even for a small vocabulary isolated-word recognition task.",
        "This is the subject of further investigation.",
        "The differences reported in the literature when comparing laboratory to field performance for continuous speech recognition typically exceeds 6% ([1], [2]).",
        "It seems likely that differences between read and spontaneous speech are minimized in the production of isolated words.",
        "Future research will include continued study of the differences between real user and laboratory speech and its effects on recognition/understanding performance for a continuous speech task."
