        "In many applications of automatic speech recognition, it is desirable for the talker to have hands and eyes free for concurrent tasks.",
        "Typical examples include parcel sorting, product assembly and inspection, voice dialing for cellular telephones, and data plotting and manipulation in a situation room.",
        "The user frequently needs to move around in the workspace, which often is noisy and reverberant, while issuing commands to the speech recognizer.",
        "Electrical tethers, close-talking microphones and body-worn sound equipment represent undesirable encumbrances.",
        "Ideally, one would like an acoustic system able to capture high-quality sound from natural conversational exchanges in the work space.",
        "Speech-seeking autodirective microphone arrays enable unencumbered freedom of movement, while providing sound pickup quality approaching that of close-talking microphones.",
        "Low-cost high-quality electret microphones, in combination with economical signal processing, permit sophisticated beam-forming and dynamic beam positioning for tracking a moving talker.",
        "Multiple beam formation permits \"track while scan\" performance, similar to phased-array navigational radars, so that multiple sound sources can be monitored and algorithmic decisions made about the signals [1, 2].",
        "Beamforming has been found to be more useful than adaptive noise filtering for sound pickup in noisy, reverberant enclosures [3].",
        "This report mentions the acoustic principles involved in dynamic beamforming and the design factors governing the ability of steered arrays to combat noise and room reverberation.",
        "It discusses the as-yet rudimentary algorithms for sound source location and speech/non-speech detection.",
        "It then describes an initial application of an autodirective array and a limited-vocabulary connected-word speech recognizer for voice control of a video/audio teleconferencing system.",
        "It concludes by indicating the directions for research needed to refine further the capabilities of hands-free natural sound pickup."

        "The time-harmonic term is omitted for compactness.",

        "It is convenient to make a change of variables and define k' as k' = – k , where k„ is the unit vector in the c wavevector k' direction, c is the speed of sound, and r„ • k = - n .",

        "This frequency also depends upon the steering parameters but has a lower bound of fupper = cI2 d. Alternatively the spacing is chosen as d= Xupper/2.",
        "The lowest frequency for which useful spatial discrimination occurs depends upon the overall dimensions of the array.",
        "For speech pickup applications, the desired bandwidth of the array is greater than three octaves.",
        "The magnitude of k\" in (4) is proportional to frequency, hence the beamwidth and directivity are inversely proportional to frequency.",
        "A design artifice to combat this frequency dependence is to use \"harmonic nesting\" [1,2] of the sensors, so that different harmonically-spaced groups of sensors are used to cover contiguous octaves.",
        "Some sensors in the nest serve every octave band.",
        "Figure 1 shows a nested two-dimensional array of sensors, its directivity index as a function of frequency, and its beam pattern when the an 's of (4) are Chebyshev weighted for 30 dB sidelobes.",
