        "The study reported in this paper addresses three issues related to phonetic classification: 1) whether it is important to choose an appropriate signal representation, 2) whether there are any advantages in extracting acoustic attributes over directly using the spectral information, and 3) whether it is advantageous to introduce an intermediate set of linguistic units, i.e. distinctive features.",
        "To restrict the scope of our study, we focused on 16 vowels in American English, and investigated classification performance using an artificial neural network with nearly 22,000 vowels tokens from 550 speakers excised from the TIMIT corpus.",
        "Our results indicate that 1) the combined outputs of Seneff's auditory model outperforms five other representations with both undegraded and noisy speech, 2) acoustic attributes give similar performance to raw spectral information, but at potentially considerable computational savings, and 3) the distinctive feature representation gives similar performance to direct vowel classification, but potentially offers a more flexible mechanism for describing context dependency."

        "More precisely, a feature is a minimal unit which distinguishes two maximally-close phonemes; for example /b/ and /p/ are distinguished by the feature [voicE].",
        "Sounds are more often confused in relation to the number of features they share, and it is believed that around 15 to 20 distinctive features are sufficient to account for phonemes in all languages of the world.",
        "Moreover, the values of these features, such as [-I-HIGH] or [- RO U N D], correspond directly to contextual variability and coarticulatory phenomena, and often manifest themselves as well-defined acoustic correlates in the speech signal [3].",
        "The compactness and descriptive power of distinctive features may enable us to describe contextual influence more parsimoniously, and thus to make more effective use of available training data.",
        "In order to fully assess the utility of this linguistically well-motivated set of units, several important issues must be addressed.",
        "First, is there a particular spectral representation that is preferred over others?",
        "Second, should we use the spectral representation directly for phoneme/feature classification, or should we instead extract and use acoustic correlates?",
        "Finally, does the introduction of an intermediate feature-based representation between the signal and the lexicon offer performance advantages?",
        "We have chosen to answer these questions by performing a set of phoneme classification experiments in which conditional variables are systematically varied.",
        "The usefulness of one condition over another is inferred from the performance of the classifier.",
        "In this paper, we will report our study on the three questions that we posed earlier.",
        "First, we will report our comparative study on signal representations.",
        "Based on these results, we will then describe our experiments and results on acoustic attribute extraction, and the use of distinctive features.",

        "First, to facilitate comparisons of different results, we restrict ourselves to use the same classifier for all experiments.",
        "Second, the classifier must be flexible in that it does not make assumptions about specific statistical distributions or distance metrics, since different signal representations may have different characteristics.",
        "Based on these two constraints, we have chosen to use the multilayer perceptron (MLP) [7].",

        "Each of these responses is a 40-dimensional spectral vector.",

        "To obtain the mel-frequency spectral and cepstral coefficients (MFSC and MFCC, respectively), the signal is preemphasized via first differencing and windowed by a 25.6 ms Hamming window.",
        "A 256-point discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is then computed from the windowed waveform.",

        "The MFSC and MFCC representations performed worse than the auditory-based representations and slightly better that the DFT.",
        "At first glance, it may appear that the discrepancies are small, since the error rate is only increased slightly (from 33% to 38%).",
        "However, previous research on human and machine identification of vowels, independent of context, have shown that the best performance attained is around 65% [11J.",
        "Looking in this light, the difference in performance becomes much more significant.",
        "One legitimate concern may be that principal component analysis has been applied to SAM PC, but not to MFCC.",
        "However, the cosine transform used in obtaining the MFCC performs a similar function to principal component analysis.",
        "Experiments have been conducted using the first 40 principal components of MFCC, and the classification accuracy (61.3%) shows that principal component analysis has no statistically significant effects on performance.",
        "It may also be argued that too many MFCC coefficients have been used, and this may degrade its performance.",
        "But further experiments have shown that classification accuracy increases with the number of MFCC used, and using 40 MFCC yielded the highest performance.",
        "Therefore, we may tentatively conclude that auditory-based signal representations are preferred, at least within the bounds of our experimental conditions.",
        "Performance on noisy speech for the various representations follows the trend of that on clean speech, with the exception that the range of accuracy increased substantially.",
        "The degradation of the SAM representations was least severe - about 12%, whereas the mel-representations showed a drop of 17%.",
        "The DFT is most affected by noise, and its performance degraded by over 24%.",
        "We believe that training with clean speech and testing with noisy speech is a fair experimental paradigm since the noise level of test speech is often unknown in practice, but the environment for recording training speech can always be controlled.",
        "Our investigation on the use of acoustic attributes is partly motivated by the belief that these attributes can enhance phonetic contrasts by focusing upon relevant information in the signal, thereby leading to improved phonetic classification performance when only a finite amount of training data is available.",

        "Another advantage of using acoustic attributes is a saving on runtime computations through reduction of input dimensions.",
        "Table 3 compares the total number of connections in the one or more MLP within each condition in our experimental paradigm.",
        "With a small amount of preprocessing, the use of acoustic attributes can save about half of the computations required by the direct use of spectral representation.",
        "One potential source of discrepancy in our experiments has to do with pitch normalization, which was not performed on the mean-rate response.",
        "However, a pitch-normalized spectral center of gravity measure was used to extract acoustic attributes, since it can eliminate singularities that complicate the search for a maximum FDC value in the optimization process.",

        "While we do not feel that pitch normalization has any significant effect on the outcome of our experiments, further experiments are clearly necessary.",
        "To introduce a set of linguistically motivated distinctive features as an intermediate representation for phonetic classification, we first transform the acoustic representations into a set of features, and then map the features into vowel labels.",
        "While one may argue that such a two-step process is inherently sub-optimal, we nevertheless were able to obtain comparable performance, corroborating the findings of Leung [7].",
        "Such an intermediate representation can offer us a great deal of flexibility in describing contextual variations.",
        "For example, all vowels sharing the feature [-AROUND] will affect the acoustic properties of neighboring consonants in predictable ways, which can be described more parsimoniously.",
        "By describing context dependencies this way, we can also make use of training data more effectively by collapsing all available data along a given feature dimension.",
        "Figure 5 shows that performance on some features is worse than others, presumably due to inadequacies in the attributes that we use.",
        "For example, performance on the feature [TENSE] should be improved by incorporating segment duration as an additional attribute.",
        "When a second classifier is used to map the feature values into vowel labels, a 4-5% accuracy increase is realized such that the performance is again comparable to cases without this intermediate feature representation.",
        "This result suggests that the acoustic-phonetic information is preserved in the aggregate of the features, and that the subsequent performance recovery may be a consequence of the redundant nature of distinctive features, as well as the ability by the second classifier to capture various contextual effects.",
        "Based on the results of our experiments, we may tentatively conclude that the auditory-based representations are preferred.",
        "Furthermore, the use of acoustic attributes can significantly reduce runtime computation for vowel classification with no cost to accuracy.",
        "Finally, the introduction of an intermediate representation based on distinctive features can potentially provide us with a flexible framework to describe contextual variations and make more effective use of training data, again at no cost to classification performance."
