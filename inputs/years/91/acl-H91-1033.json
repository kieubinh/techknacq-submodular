        "\"Subcategorization\" refers to the constraints that a verb (or other syntactic head) places on the type and relative order of the phrases that serve as its arguments and (by some definitions) the effect of these argument phrases on the meaning of the whole clause.",
        "It is thus an important issue for any system which seeks to understand natural language, or to distinguish grammatical natural utterances from ungrammatical ones.",
        "Many past approaches have sought to represent subcategorization declaratively, often using an approach based on the unification of feature values.",
        "Such approaches as Definite Clause Grammar [11], Categorial Grammar [1], PATR-1I [13], and lexicalized TAG [12] include in one form or another a notion of \"subcategorization frame\" that specifies a sequence of complement phrases and constraints on them.",
        "Some have also advocated using the feature system to encode semantic information (as for example [9]), and this has recently characterized our own approach [3].",
        "\"Mapping unit\" subcategorization is partly inspired by these approaches, but it handles several kinds of variation in natural language utterances which cause difficulty for them.",
        "These forms of variation are not in any sense marginal phenomena, but are instead repeatedly seen in the naturally derived data for the ATIS SLS common task domain.",
        "The phenomena fall into three classes: The first is variation in argument order, as seen in fly from Denver to Boston fly to Boston from Denver Such variation can be handled by the frame approach, but only at the cost of specifying one frame for each order.",
        "Besides such lexically-specific variation of order, other sources of order variation include interpolation of elements traditionally considered adjuncts (\"What flights leave at 3 pm from Denver\") and heaviness effects (\"Show on the screen the fares and departure times of all the flights from Boston to Dallas\").",
        "The second is the optionality of arguments, and the different consequences thereof, including zero anaphora: \"What restrictions apply?\" (= apply TO SOMETHING IN CONTEXT) default value: \"Show the flights.\" (= show the flights TO ME) existential quantification: \"fly to Boston\" (AT WHATEVER TIME) and independent truth-conditions: \"The Rockettes kicked.\" Each verb that has optional arguments tends to have different preferences for what to do with the omitted argument places, as the above examples make clear.",
        "The frame approach can handle them, but again only at the cost of specifying multiple frames.",
        "The third and final type of variation is the metonymic coercion of arguments, as seen below:"

        "In both examples there is a superficial clash of types which is meant to be reconciled through the interposition of an implicit binary relation between the objects having those types.",
        "Our work postulates a distinction between two kinds of metonymy: \"referential\", where the argument is taken to be an indirect reference to an object of the proper type, and \"predicative\", where only the argument slot of the predicate is coerced and the referent is taken literally.",
        "This distinction will be discussed in more detail below.",
        "Most verbs in the ATIS corpora (\"fly\", \"arrive\", etc.)",
        "have flight, source, destination, time of day, and day of the week arguments, most of which are not obligatory and can occur in almost any order.",
        "The number of frames necessary is combinatorially impractical, and to this situation the phenomenon of metonymic coercion, which makes the variation potentially open-ended, only provides the final blow.",
        "A fundamentally different framework from that of subcategorization frames is needed."

      "text": [
        "The central idea of the mapping unit approach is that there are several different types of subcategorization constraints, which ought to be represented as separate constraints, rather than enumerating the \"cartesian product\" of their possible combinations in fixed patterns.",
        "The basic building block is the \"mapping unit\", a structure which represents the constraints on a particular phrasal argument and the contribution this argument makes to the semantics of the clause.",
        "Mapping units do not \"know\" whether they are optional or not, or in what order they occur with respect to other mapping units; this information is instead represented in the grammar and in a larger structure called a \"map\", of which the mapping unit is a component.",
        "The following is an example of a mapping unit:",
        "Each mapping unit has the four components shown here: a grammatical relation (SUBJECT, DIRECT-OBJECT, OTHER-PP etc), a syntactic pattern, a type requirement, and semantic role information.",
        "The syntactic pattern is a unification pattern, and thus retains all the advantages of being able to handle partial information that are associated with unification.",
        "The syntactic pattern (in the example just NP) also includes slots for semantic translation (\":trans\").",
        "The semantic type requirement (here \"FLIGHT\") is also enforced by unification, but separately, so that a failure due to semantic type clash can be distinguished from one that violates syntactic constraints.",
        "In this way, if the type requirement is not met, the mapping unit can be metonymically coerced, filling the semantic role not with the original complement translation but with an indefinite object related to it via a binary relation that resolves the clash.",
        "For example, the unit above could be coerced to accept an object of type AIRLINE via the binary relation FLIGHT-AIRLINE-OF, which maps flights to their airlines, thus handling the utterance \"What airlines fly to Dallas\".",
        "A final separate representation is the contribution the semantics of the argument makes to the semantics of the clause, which is indicated by a semantic role constraint.",
        "The role is set (with the equality symbol \"=\") in the case of ordinary complement arguments and restricted (with \"<\") in the case of iterable temporal or locative adjunct modifiers (\"in Harvard Square at Out of Town News next to the foreign magazine section\").",
        "A semantic role can only be set once in any given clause (which of course does not exclude it from being set to a conjunctive element), but can be restricted arbitrarily many times.",
        "The mapping units are combined in a larger structure called a \"map\", of which the following is a (much reduced) example for the verb \"fly\":"

        "The completion condition must be satisfied by any complete clause with the verb as head, and includes requirements on the instantiation of semantic roles.'",
        "In the example map, the FILLED completion predicate requires that the roles FLIGHT-OF and DEST-CITY be filled by a literal argument to the verb, while the FILLED-OR-ANAPHOR completion predicate allows the role ORIG-CITY to be be implicitly filled by a discourse entity.",

        "Any semantic role can be filled only once, so that overgeneration from multiple mapping units assigning the same role (\"fly Boston from Denver\", \"fly Denver from Denver\") is prevented.3 Certain grammatical relations can also be assigned only once in the derivation of any clause.",
        "These are the \"major\" grammatical relations – SUBJECT, DIRECT-OBJECT, INDIRECT-OBJECT.",
        "The OTHER-(cat) relations can be assigned arbitrarily many times, subject only to the constraint that semantic roles be filled only once.",
        "Multiple mapping units that assign the same major grammatical relation are also allowed, subject only to the above constraint and of course to the constraint on the unique assignment of semantic roles.",
        "This is useful for handling certain types of polysemy – specifically, the semantic overloading of syntactic argument positions.",
        "For modifiers which are normally treated as adjuncts, such as temporal or locative modifiers, our framework provides a notion of \"free\" mapping units associated with distinguished roles (such as TIME-OF-DAY, etc.).",
        "Such units do not have to be included in the map for individual lexical items whose labeled-argument predicate translation includes the role.",
        "In the example map above, TIME-OF-DAY is such a \"free\" mapping unit.",

        "However, as is well known, English, unlike Italian or Greek, requires an overt subject in finite clauses.",
        "This requirement is imposed by the grammar, rather than by individual lexical items.",
