        "Furthermore, as research activities tackle broader domains and if the research results are to scale up to realistic applications, handcrafting knowledge must give way to automatic knowledge base construction.",
        "An alternative to traditional parsers is represented in FIDDITCH (Hindle, 1983), MITFP (deMarcken 1990), and CASS (Abney, 1990).",
        "Instead of requiring complete parses, a forest is frequently produced, each tree in the forest representing a non-overlapping fragment of the input.",
        "However, algorithms for finding the semantics of the whole from the disjoint fragments have not previously been developed nor evaluated.",
        "We are comparing several differing algorithms from various sites to evaluate both the effectiveness of such a strategy in correctly predicting fragments and the effectiveness of syntactic/semantic algorithms for combining fragments.",
        "One question our research is trying to answer is how well the linguistic expression of entities and the relational structures among them can be recovered for data base update without determining global syntactic structure and without full information regarding the vocabulary items.",
        "A second question is how well an algorithm to learn lexical semantic knowledge from examples will perform."
