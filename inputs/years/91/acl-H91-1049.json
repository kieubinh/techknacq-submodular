        "The variable length of an observed phoneme was handled either by modeling a fixed-length transformation of the observations [6] or by assuming the observation was a partially observed sample of a trajectory represented by a fixed-length model [7].",
        "In the first case, the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters can be obtained directly, but the Estimate-Maximize algorithm [2] may be required in the second case.",
        "Unfortunately, the joint Gaussian model suffers from estimation problems, given the number of acoustic features and the analysis-frame rate that modern continuous speech recognizers use.",
        "Therefore, a more constrained assumption about the correlation structure must be made.",
        "In previous work [3], we chose to constrain the model to a time-inhomogeneous Gauss-Markov process.",
