        "This session on corpora and evaluation was composed of two distinct parts.",
        "Before the break, four papers dealing with a range of important aspects of evaluation of written language systems and spoken language systems were presented.",
        "A printed version of each of these papers is included in the conference proceedings.",
        "After the break, a series of informal reports (not included as proceedings papers) were given summarizing the work of the Corpora and Performance Evaluation Committee (CPEC) of the DARPA Spoken Language Systems (SLS) Program, with specific reports from several working groups which have been dealing with various aspects of corpora collection and performance evaluation in the SLS Program.",
        "A lively and extended discussion followed these working group reports, including presentations of a number of alternate viewpoints."

      "text": [
        "Beth Sundheim reported on the MUC-3 evaluation effort, for which a dry run had just been completed during the week prior to the Speech and Natural Language Workshop.",
        "The general sense of the presentation was that much progress had been made relative to prior MUC evaluation efforts.",
        "The number of sites reported had increased to twelve.",
        "The evaluation was broader in scope than previous ones in most respects, including text characteristics, task specifications, and performance measures.",
        "Specifically, the overgeneration and fallout measures were new in this round.",
        "A semi-automated scoring program had been developed and distributed to all sites, including computation of recall, precision, overgeneration, and fallout measures designed specifically for the MUC task.",
        "A selected set of dry run results was presented, most of which are summarized in the printed paper.",
        "It was emphasized that the dry run results should not necessarily be expected to be predictive of the results of official testing, which will take place in May 1991.",
        "As an item of interest, Sundheim noted tests which had been performed at NYU using a \"system\" which ignored all but the dateline of each message, and which actually outperformed some \"serious\" systems in some of the evaluation dimensions.",
        "In the discussion, Paul Bamberg suggested that the scoring could be modified so that a \"trick\" system could not perform well by simply relying on a priori probabilities and guessing the most likely message.",
        "The new scoring procedure would favor systems which produced the right information for unlikely input messages."

      "text": [
        "Ezra Black reported, on behalf of a group of fourteen co-authors/grammarians, on a new method of quantitatively comparing parses provided by different grammarians, when each grammarian provides the single parse which he/she would ideally want his/her grammar to produce.",
        "The comparison method is well-defined, relatively simple, and, more importantly, has been agreed upon by all the grammarians/coauthors.",
        "The procedure judges each parse only by its constituent boundaries (and not by the names assigned to these constituents), compares the parse to a standard parse, and produces two scores (the Recall Rate and the Crossing Parentheses Rate) for the candidate parse.",
        "Initially, the standard parse was taken as a majority parse derived from the grammarians' parses.",
        "Then it was determined that an independent standard parse (the \"hand parse\" from the University of Pennsylvania Treebank) worked just as well.",
        "The UPenn Treebank parse was then accepted as the standard parse.",
        "Based on the scores produced on a test sample consisting of 14 sentences from the Brown corpus, the hand parses produced by the grammarians were very consistent (average Recall 94% and average Crossing Rate <1%).",
        "Black stated that a key next step will be to apply this evaluation procedure to machine parses, and remarked that initial tests had indicated that the grammars did not do nearly as well as the grammarians (the Recall Rate on the best of four machine parsers tested so far was about 60%).",
        "One questioner from the audience asked how the 14 sentences were selected (\"pseudo-randomly\"), and whether 14 was enough for a meaningful test.",
        "Black suggested that 14 was a reasonable start, and that it was intended that 50 sentences would be used for test in the next round, which would involve machine parsers.",
        "All those with suitable machine parsers were invited to participate in this next test.",
        "A second questioner asked whether the use of semantic knowledge by the grammarians made the test unfair to syntactic grammars.",
        "Black responded that the main issue was to develop a comparative measure for parses, independent of what knowledge sources were used."

        "He explained the relationship between text categorization, and the more-frequently-evaluated task of text retrieval.",
        "He defined the system effectiveness measures of recall, precision, and fallout, in terms of a contingency table for binary decisions, and discussed the difficult issue of defining a standard of correctness on test data sets.",
        "He contrasted \"microaveraging\" and",
        "\"macroaveraging\" strategies in evaluation of retrieval systems, and commented that MUC uses microaveraging, where all decisions made on a document are considered as a single group when computing recall, precision, and fallout.",
        "He described indirect evaluation methods, wherein text categorization is evaluated based on the performance of a system (e.g., text retrieval or text extraction) which uses the results of the text categorization.",
        "The paper serves to place in perspective a number of important techniques, as well as issues which must be addressed, in evaluation of text categorization systems."

        "The examples in this paper dealt directly with the Air Travel Information System (ATIS) task being used in the SLS program, hence this paper served as a good bridge to the ATIS-oriented presentations after the break.",
        "The first proposal suggested a methodology for comparing systems based on their ability to handle diverse utterances in context.",
        "For example, each system would be tested with a specific \"context-setting\" query pair, followed by a set of (say, 10) alternative \"next-utterances,\" each of which would directly follow the context-setting query pair.",
        "The system would be judged based on its answers for each of the alternative \"next-utterances.\" The second proposal suggested a modification of the performance metric to encourage partial understanding.",
        "This proposal was aimed at permitting systems some leeway in responding to partially-understood queries, as well as providing credit for reasonable responses.",
        "It was noted that the judgment of whether an answer was reasonable would almost certainly have to be made by human arbiters.",
        "Both proposals in this paper were offered for further consideration by the SLS evaluation committees."
