        "Text retrieval systems find or route texts in response to arbitrary user queries or interest profiles.",
        "Evaluation has been a focus of research in text retrieval since the beginning, and standard evaluation methods are in wide use.",
        "A smaller, but significant, body of work has examined a task variously known as machine-aided indexing, automated indexing, authority control, or text categorization.",
        "Text categorization is the assignment of texts to one or more of a preexisting set of categories, rather than classifying them in response to an arbitrary query.",
        "Categorization may be performed for a wide range of reasons, either as an end in itself or as a component of a larger system.",
        "The literature on text categorization is widely scattered and shows little agreement on evaluation methods.",
        "This makes it very difficult to draw conclusions about the relative effectiveness of techniques so that, unlike the situation in query-driven retrieval, there is no consensus on a set of basic evaluation methods for text categorization.",
        "In this paper I discuss measures of effectiveness for text categorization systems and algorithms.",
        "Effectiveness refers to the ability of a categorization to supply information to a system or user that wants to access the texts.",
        "Measuring effectiveness is just one of several kinds of evaluation that should be considered [Spa81a, C1188, PF90].",
        "After considering effectiveness evaluation for text categorization we will turn to a related task, text extraction, and consider what role the effectiveness measures discussed for categorization have there.",
        "A common theme is the need to consider in an evaluation the purpose for which information is generated from the text.",
        "I will have occasion in the following to repeatedly refer to a chapter by Tague [Tag81] in Sparck Jones' collection on information retrieval experimentation [Spa8la].",

        "While a number of different effectiveness measures have been used in evaluating text categorization in the past, almost all have been based on the same model of decision making by the categorization system.",

        "Complexities arise, however, in how to compute and interpret these measures in the context of a text categorization experiment.",
        "The bulk of the discussion concerns these complexities.",
        "Consider a system that is required to make n binary decisions, each of which has exactly one correct answer (either Yes or No).",
        "The result of n such decisions can be summarized in a contingency table, as shown in Table 1.",
        "Each entry in the table specifies the number of decisions of the specified type.",
        "For instance, a is the number of times the system decided Yes, and Yes was in fact the correct answer.",
        "Given the contingency table, three important measures of the system's effectiveness are:",
        "(1) recall = a/(a c) (2) precision = a 1(a + b) (3) fallout = b/ (b + d)",
        "Measures equivalent to recall and fallout made their first appearance in signal detection theory [Swe64], where they play a central role.",
        "Recall and precision are ubiquitous in information retrieval, where they measure the proportion of relevant documents retrieved and the proportion of retrieved documents which are relevant, respectively.",
        "Fallout measures the proportion of nonrelevant documents which are retrieved, and has also seen considerable use.",
        "A decision maker can achieve very high recall by rarely deciding No, or very high precision (and low fallout) by rarely deciding Yes.",
        "For this reason either recall and precision, or recall and fallout, are necessary to ensure a non-trivial evaluation of a decision maker's effectiveness under the above model.",
        "Another measure sometimes used in categorization experiments is overlap:",
        "(4) overlap = a/(a + b + c)",
        "This measure is symmetric with respect to b and c, and so is sometimes used to measure how much two categorizations are alike without defining one or the other to be correct.",
        "It is appropriate at this point to mention some of the limitations of the contingency table model.",
        "It does not take into account the possibility that different errors have different costs; doing so requires more general decision theoretic models.",
        "The contingency table also requires all decisions to be binary.",

        "Another lesson from IR research is that people find it very difficult to judge the quality of indexing in the absence of retrieval data.",
        "Strongly held intuitions about the relative effectiveness of indexing languages and indexing methods for supporting document retrieval have often been shown by experiment to be incorrect [Spa8lb].",
        "If the primary purpose of extracted information is to support querying, then indirect evaluation, i.e. testing with actual queries, is very important."

        "Text categorization plays a variety of roles in text-based systems.",
        "Evaluation of categorization effectiveness is important, both for confidence in operational systems and for progress in research.",
        "Several good measures, based on a model of binary decision making, are available for evaluating the effectiveness of a categorization.",
        "I have discussed some of the issues to consider in using these measures, and stressed that the purpose for which categorization is being done needs to be considered.",
        "The use of both indirect and direct evaluation is preferable.",
        "I also discussed how some of the work done by text extraction systems can be viewed as categorization and evaluated in a similar fashion, though new measures are needed as well."
