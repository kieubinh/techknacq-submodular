        "The experiments that we report on in this paper represent some initial steps in combining speech knowledge with syntactic and semantic knowledge.",
        "These experiments have been performed using the MIT VOYAGER system [10], which provides navigational assistance for finding directions and locations of various objects (e.g., hotels, restaurants, banks) in a geographic region (Cambridge, MA).",
        "VOYAGER accepts spoken queries from untrained users and produces answers in the form of a map, written answers, and spoken output.",
        "The system has a vocabulary of some 320 words and handles questions, indirect questions, and various forms of interactive dialogue, including anaphoric reference and clarification dialogue.",
        "In this research, we have taken an incremental approach to combining speech and language.",
        "First, we have explored how use of combined knowledge sources can influence the shape of the search space, by changing the overall scores as-'This research was supported by DARPA under Contract N0001489-J-1332, monitored through the Office of Naval Research.",
        "sociated with competing hypotheses.",
        "In addition, the use of combined knowledge sources can change computational efficiency by applying language constraints to predict possible next words, thus achieving significant pruning of the recognition search space.",
        "In this paper, we report primarily on experiments that change the shape of the search space; this work has been done on our loosely-coupled system using the N-best interface [11].",
        "However, we also report briefly on the status of our experiments on the tight coupling of speech recognition and language understanding."

        "In order to obtain adequate recognition results for continuous speech recognition, it is imperative to provide some sort of language constraints.",
        "The usual approach is to adopt simple but efficient word-pair or bigram \"language models,\" which specify the set of words that can follow a given word.",
        "Such models have the advantage of being automatically derivable from training data and computationally efficient.",
        "However, they lose any non-local language constraints and, of course, provide no linguistically relevant structural description.",
        "Furthermore, it is difficult, even when steps are taken to generalize words to their semantic category (i.e. \"Boston\" 4 all city names), to assure sufficient coverage in an independent test set.",
        "Given adequate training data, the simple word-pair or bigram language model will overgenerate, since it fails to take larger context into account.",
        "Thus the system is allowed to recognize many sentences that are ungrammatical or incoherent or inappropriate in the overall context.",
        "The obvious solution is to bring linguistic knowledge to bear.",
        "One way is to take the best acoustic candidate and use a flexible, semantically-based phrase-spotting system to assign a meaning to the sequence of words [8].",
        "This provides a robust interface which can ignore many recognition errors and abandons the notion of a linguistically well-formed overall sentence.",
        "It almost always produces some interpretation.",
        "However, since it adds no real linguistic constraints, it may produce many false positives (misinterpretation of the input).",
        "A second possiblity which has been explored at some sites [1] is to have the recognizer produce a word lattice, with (acoustic) transition probabilities between words.",
        "The language system can then search this lattice for the best candidate.",
        "Another approach, which is the baseline for these experiments, uses an N-best interface between the recognizer and the language understanding system.",
        "In this interface, the recognizer produces sentence hypotheses in decreasing order of acoustic score.",
        "The role of the language understanding system is to filter these hypotheses, choosing the first one that can be fully processed.",

        "As a result, most sentences in TINA have only one parse.",
        "TINA uses a best-first heuristic search in parsing, storing alternate candidate parse paths while it pursues the most promising (most probable) path.",

        "A lexicon provides word pronunciations which are expanded through phonological rules into a network of alternate pronunciations for each word.",
        "The control strategy to align the segmental acoustic-phonetic network with the lexical word-pronunciation network uses an N-best interface which produces the top N candidate word sequences in decreasing order of total path score.",
        "It makes use of an A* search algorithm [3,4] with an initial Viterbi search serving as the mechanism for establishing a tight upper-bound estimate of the score for the unseen portion of each active hypothesis.",
        "Language constraints include both a local word-pair constraint and a more global linguistic constraint based on parsability.",
        "The word-pair constraint is precompiled into the word network, and limits the set of words that can follow any given word, without regard to sentence context.",
        "Allowable word pairs were determined automatically by generating a large number of random sentences from the grammar [7].",
        "The linguistic constraints are incorporated either as a filter on full-sentence hypotheses as they come off the top of the stack, or with a tighter coupling in which active partial theories dynamically prune the set of allowable next-word candidates during the search."

        "This section describes our procedure for training the probabilities in the grammar automatically from a set of parsed training sentences.",
        "From each training sentence is derived a set of context-free rules needed to parse that sentence.",
        "The entire pool of rules is used to train the grammar probabilities, with each rule occurring one or more times in the training data.",
        "By training on a set of some 3500 sentences within the VOYAGER domain, we were able to reduce the perplexity on an independent test set by a factor of three [10].",
        "Our approach to training a grammar differs from that of many current schemes, mainly in that we have intentionally tried to set up a framework that easily produces a probability estimate for the next word given the preceding word sequence.",
        "We feel that a next-word probability is much more appropriate than a rule-production probability for incorporating into a tightly coupled system, since it leads to a simple definition of the total score for the next word as the weighted sum of the language model probability and the acoustic probability.",
        "While rule-production probabilities can in fact be generated from the probabilities we provide, they will not, in general, agree with the probabilities as determined by a procedure such as the inside/outside algorithm [6,2].",
        "In our approach, the grammar is partitioned into rule sets, according to the left-hand side (LHS) category in the context free rule set.",
        "Within each partition, the categories that show up on the right-hand side (RHS) of all the rules sharing the unique LHS category for the partition are used to form a bigram language model for the categories particular to that partition.",
        "Thus the language model statistics are encoded as a set of two-dimensional tables of category-category transition probabilities, one table for each partition.",
        "A direct consequence of this bigram model within each partition is that new sibling \"chains\" may form, producing, in many cases, combinations that were never explicitly mentioned in the original rule set.",
        "The parser is driven only by the set of local node-node transitions for a given LHS, so that any new chains take on the same status as sibling sets (RHS) that appeared explicitly in the original grammar.",
        "While this property can at times lead to inadvertent rules that are inappropriate, it often yields prmductive new rules and allows for faster generalization of the grammar.",
        "Given a particular parse tree, the probability for the next word is the product of the node-node transition probabilities linking the next word to the previous word.",
        "The overall next-word probability for a given initial word sequence is then the sum over all parse trees spanning the entire word sequence.",
        "A specific example should help to elucidate the training",
        "process.",
        "Imagine that a training set provides a set of five rules as shown in Table 1.",
        "The training algorithm produces a transition network, as shown in Figure 1, with probabilities established by counting and normalizing pair frequencies, as would be done at the word level in a traditional bigram language model.",
        "Rule production probabilities can be regenerated from these pair transition probabilities, giving the result shown in the column \"Derived Probability\" in the table, to be compared with \"Original Probability.\" The derived probabilities are not the same as what one would get by simply counting rule frequencies.",
        "The probabilities are correct up to the point of the category NOUN; that is, there is a 2/5 probability of getting the rule group (1,4) and a 3/5 probability of getting the group (2,3,4).",
        "However, the transitions out of NOUN are conditional on the rule group.",
        "That is, rules that start with (ART NOUN) have a 50/50 chance of being followed by an ADJUNCT, whereas the remaining rules have a 1/3 chance.",
        "The method of ignoring everything except the preceding node has the effect of smoothing these two groups, giving all of them an equal chance (2/5) of finding an ADJUNCT next.",
        "This is a form of deleted-interpolation [5] and it helps to get around sparse data problems, although it is making an independence assumption: whether or not a noun is followed by an adjunct is assumed to be independent of the preceding context of the noun.",
        "In this example, no new rules were introduced.",
        "If we had, however, no training for Rule 4, it would still get a nonzero probability, because all of its sibling pairs are available from other rules.",
        "That is to say, not only does this method smooth probabilities among rules, but it also creates new rules that had not been explicitly seen in the training set.",
        "The grammar itself includes syntactic and semantic constraints that may cause a particular next-sibling to fail.",
        "There is also a trace mechanism that restores a moved category to its deep-structure position.",
        "Both of these mechanisms disrupt the probabilities in ways that are ignored by the training method.",
        "While it is possible to renormalize on the fly by checking all next-siblings against the constraints and accumulating the total probability of those that pass, we did not in fact do this, in the interest of computation.",
        "We do plan to incorporate this normalizing step in a future experiment, to assess whether it offers a significant improvement in the probability estimates.",
        "We do currently make some corrections for the gap mechanism.",
        "Rather than using the a priori statistics on the likelihood of a node whose child is a trace, we simply assume that node occurred with probability 1.0.",
        "While neither of these is absolutely correct, the latter is generally much closer to the truth than the former.",
        "The TINA grammar has been trained on more than 3500 sentences.",
        "The parse score is computed as the sum of the log probabilities of the node-node transitions in the parse tree.",
        "The probability of a given terminal is taken to be 1/K, where K is the number of lexical items having the same lexical class.",
        "It would not be difficult to incorporate more sophisticated estimates of lexical items, for example, using unigram probabilities within a given lexical class, but we did not do that here, to avoid sparse data problems.",
