        "Prosodic structure and syntactic structure are not identical; neither are they unrelated.",
        "Knowing when and how the two correspond could yield better quality speech synthesis, could aid in the disambiguation of competing syntactic hypotheses in speech understanding, and could lead to a more comprehensive view of human speech processing.",
        "In a set of experiments involving 35 pairs of phonetically similar sentences representing seven types of structural contrasts, the perceptual evidence shows that some, but not all, of the pairs can be disambiguated on the basis of prosodic differences.",
        "The phonological evidence relates the disambiguation primarily to boundary phenomena, although prominences sometimes play a role.",
        "Finally, phonetic analyses describing the attributes of these phonological markers indicate the importance of both absolute and relative measures."

        "The syntax of spoken utterances is frequently ambiguous.",
        "Yet listeners usually arrive at something close to the intended meaning.",
        "Information listeners might use in disambiguation includes knowledge of the world, shared context, and a source of non-syntactic information that is under-represented in written communication: the prosody of the utterance.",
        "By 'prosody' we mean suprasegmental information in speech, such as phrasing and stress, which can alter perceived sentence meaning without changing the segmental identity of the components.",
        "Since prosody plays an important role in speech communication, a clear understanding of the mapping between prosodic and syntactic structure would reveal significant aspects of the cognitive processes of speech production and perception.",
        "In addition, it would provide guidelines for the synthesis of more natural-sounding speech.",
        "Further, any contribution that prosody can make to the resolution of structural ambiguities will be particularly helpful in spoken-language understanding, where lexical and structural ambiguities of written forms are compounded by difficulties in finding word boundaries and in identifying words reliably in automatic speech recognition.",
        "Here, we study the mapping between prosody and syntax by minimizing the contribution of other possible cues to the resolution of ambiguity.",
        "This study forms the foundation for further work on modeling prosody by assessing a set of syntactic environments in which prosody alone might be used to disambiguate sentences, and by analyzing the correspondence between the phonological and phonetic attributes of the prosodic structure of utterances and their perceived meanings.",
        "We begin by discussing previous work on the relationship between prosody and syntax.",
        "We then describe the recording of the corpus, and present results for the experimental studies which consider: (1) the accuracy and confidence of listeners in disambiguating different types of syntactic structures, (2) the phonological analysis of prosodic cues associated with the different structures, and their relation to the disambiguation results, and (3) a phonetic analysis of the phonological markers.",
        "Finally, we discuss the implications of these results, and raise some unresolved questions that suggest directions for future research."

      "text": [
        "With few exceptions (e.g., [9]), previous studies have focussed either on relating phonological aspects of prosody to syntax (e.g., [8], [14],[3], [12]), or on relating phonetic/acoustic evidence to syntax and perceived differences (e.g., [19], [4], [20], [7], [11], [6], [21]).",
        "A few studies, e.g., [16], have considered the mapping from phonology to acoustics.",
        "The more phonetic/acoustic studies typically used a small number of minimal pairs of utterances in order to facilitate the acoustic measurements and to control parameters more precisely (exceptions include [10], and [5] where larger data sets were used).",
        "In contrast, the more phonological studies have focussed either on 'illustrative examples' or on text to which prosodic markers have been assigned on the basis of the syntax of the sentence.",
        "These studies have typically ignored the fact that there are several possible prosodic choices for a given syntactic structure.",
        "The focus in recent theoretical linguistics on human competence for language production, has resulted in neglect of actual language production and neglect of an area required for speech understanding (by human or by machine): the mapping from acoustics to meaning.",
        "Clearly, speech communication involves both production and perception, and it involves performance as well as competence.",
        "The work presented in this paper extends previous work, including the important contribution of [13], in several ways.",
        "First, focussing only on surface-structure ambiguities (since earlier work indicates that these are good candidates for disambiguation), we investigate the ability of listeners to disambiguate sentences for different types of syntactic structures, using several instances of each type.",
        "Second, our focus here is on both production and perception.",
        "We tried to avoid exaggeration of any disambiguating strategies on the part of speakers and listeners by separating the ambiguous pairs from each other in time (no two members of an ambiguous pair occurred in the same session either for speakers or for listeners).",
        "Third, to increase reliability without assessing a large pool of subjects, we used four professional FM radio announcers, who have proved to be very consis",
        "tent speakers in our pilot studies.",
        "Fourth, in analyzing the cues used in disambiguation, we have investigated the possible use of prominence associated with pitch accents, in addition to prosodic phrase boundary cues.",
        "Finally, to compare durational structures across the various sentences used, and to facilitate generalization beyond the specific sentences used, we present results in terms of relative, rather than absolute, durational patterns.",
        "By combining phonological analyses of prosodic elements such as boundary tones and prominences with investigation of their acoustic correlates and their perceptual effects, we hope to shed some light on both the mapping between syntactic and prosodic structure, and on the role of prosody in resolving various types of syntactic ambiguity."

        "In a pilot study, we found the FM radio style to have more clearly and consistently marked prosodic cues than a non-professional speaking style [18].",
        "Our hope was that this style would be easier to label prosodically, and therefore the contributions of specific phonological cues would be easier to identify.",
        "The announcers were presented with the written sentences in context paragraphs, with the sentence types and A/13 members of the pairs assigned to two recording sessions, so that the two contrasting members of a pair did not occur in the same session.",
        "The speakers were not told that there were special target sentences within the paragraphs.",
        "The recording sessions were separated by at least a few days and often several weeks, to minimize the possibility that the announcers would produce unnatural versions in an attempt to emphasize potential differences between the two members of a pair.",

        "Another intonational cue was a perceived drop in pitch baseline and range in a parenthetical phrase, relative to the rest of the sentence.",
        "This pitch range change was not always perceived for appositives.",
        "In examining the associated fundamental frequency (FO) contours, we observed a region of reduced FO excursion during the period of perceived range change.",
        "Though intonation is an important cue, duration and pauses alone provide enough information to automatically label break indices with a high correlation (greater than 0.86) to hand-labeled break indices 1151.",
        "Since prominence was not consistently associated with specific syntactic structures in any systematic pattern (with the exception of particles), it appears that the disambiguating role of prominences (or pitch accents) differs from that of boundary phenomena, being associated more with the semantics rather than with the syntax of an utterance.",
        "In other words, we suspect, with others, that prominence is related more to the contextual focus of the sentence."

      "text": [
        "We have confirmed that, for a variety of syntactic classes, but not all, naive listeners can reliably separate meanings on the basis of differences in prosodic information.",
        "We have further shown phonological and phonetic evidence bearing on how they might do this: by the tendency to associate relatively larger prosodic breaks with larger syntactic breaks.",
        "Further, syntactic boundaries of clauses that contain complete sentences nearly always coincide with the boundaries of major prosodic constituents (as marked, e.g., by syllable-final lengthening, a boundary tone and perhaps a pause).",
        "Syntactic constituents within these major constituents may be associated with any of several different levels of prosodic boundaries, i.e., speakers have more choice in phrasing, and prosodic boundaries need not correlate perfectly with syntactic ones, though they often do.",
        "We have also shown the importance of the relative size of prosodic breaks within a sentence.",
        "Though evidence relating to boundary phenomena appeared to be most important, there were some structures for which phrasal prominence either was the only cue or played a supporting role in distinguishing between the two versions.",
        "Several aspects of the design of our experiment require comment involving the interpretation of our results.",
        "First, the disambiguation of some of the sentences may have been confounded by prosodic cues related to non-syntactic factors, e.g., given vs. new information, focus, contrastive stress, etc.",
        "However, the use of several sentences and of several speakers should minimize these effects, and should make it unlikely that there is a systematic correlation between such effects and the A and B versions of the sentences.",
        "Clearly, to fully elucidate the relationship between prosody and syntax will require the investigation of far more examples of far more syntactic constructions than we have been able to use in this study.",
        "Second, our finding of a correlation between the syntax and the phonological markers of prosody may have been corrupted by the fact that the labelers typically knew which version they were listening to.",
        "However, the labelers did not know the relative accuracy of the responses of the naive subjects.",
        "Therefore, these labels are relevant insofar as they account for both the accurate and the inaccurate responses.",
        "Third, we did not investigate the role of syntactic constituent length, which others have found to influence the placement of prosodic boundaries [1].",
        "Lastly, the use of read speech by professional radio announcers as speakers raises questions about generalizing the results to spontaneous speech by more average talkers.",
        "We believe that the use of the professional speakers has",
        "allowed us to obtain initial results using far fewer speakers than would be needed using non-professionals.",
        "We hypothesize that the prosodic cues will be similar for non-professional speakers, although less consistently used and not as clearly marked.",
        "Our results have both theoretical and empirical implications.",
        "We have shown that naive listeners can use prosody to separate structurally ambiguous sentence pairs, and we have further shown phonological and acoustic evidence of how they might do this.",
        "In speech generation applications, such information is useful since different prosodic markers will affect the interpretation of a sentence.",
        "Prosodic cues are particularly important in computer speech understanding applications, where the semantic rules available to the system are limited relative to the capabilities of human listeners.",
        "In addition, in these applications, prosodic cues can be used prior to semantic analysis, to reduce the number of syntactically acceptable parses by eliminating those inconsistent with the prosody [15]."

      "heading": "FUTURE DIRECTIONS",
      "text": [
        "The results reported here provide evidence for some systematic relationships between prosody and syntax that should be explored further in several ways.",
        "First, a larger number of syntactic structures must be examined in order to make the prosody/syntax relationship more explicit.",
        "Second, we note that some sentences were successfully disambiguated with cues that were not represented in our labeling scheme.",
        "Since prominences were not differentiated as to type of pitch accent, a more detailed classification of intonation in such contexts could yield more information.",
        "Finally, for computer speech understanding applications, it will be important to investigate the extension of these results to spontaneous speech by non-professional speakers, where hesitation phenomena and speech errors will affect the prosodic structure."
