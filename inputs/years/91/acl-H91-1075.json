        "Spoken language processing is a difficult problem, in part because of the many ambiguities inherent in natural language.",
        "Syntactic ambiguity arises when a given expression can be described by more than one syntactic structure, and represents an important problem in natural language processing.",
        "In particular, attachment ambiguities occur frequently in language, e.g., \"Show the fares for [the cheapest flights on the screen].\" \"Show [the fares for the cheapest flights] on the screen.\" Several factors may be involved in resolving such ambiguities, including semantics, discourse and syntactic bias.",
        "In spoken language, prosody, or the suprasegmental information in an utterance, is an important additional cue.",
        "Experimental evidence has shown that listeners can resolve several types of syntactic ambiguities by using prosodic information [13,8].",
        "In [13], ambiguous sentences were read in contexts in which only one interpretation was reasonable, and the recordings edited to remove the context.",
        "Human subjects then listened to the ambiguous sentences, and were asked to select the intended meaning, which they were able to do reliably (86% correct identification) for six out of seven types of structural ambiguity.",
        "In addition, it appeared that the relative size and location of prosodic phrase boundaries provided the principal prosodic clue for resolving ambiguities.",
        "Thus, it seems likely that automatically detected prosodic phrase breaks could be used by speech understanding systems to reduce syntactic ambiguity.",
        "In previous work [10], a hierarchical set of break indices was proposed as a representation of prosodic phrase boundaries and automatically detected break indices were used in a parser to provide constraints on rules that would prevent prosodically inconsistent parses.",
        "Here, we propose a scoring algorithm to rank candidate parses based on an analysis-by-synthesis method which involves: (1) using an algorithm to predict prosodic break locations for each candidate syntactic structure; (2) automatically detecting prosodic breaks in the spoken utterance; and (3) ranking the parses according to a similarity score between predicted and observed prosodic structure.",
        "Using the database of ambiguous sentences from [13], this approach achieves performance close to that of the human subjects.",
        "The following section describes the speech corpus and prosodic break index representation.",
        "We then examine synthesis algorithms for predicting the phrase structure of a sentence and evaluate them in relation to the hand-labeled speech corpus.",
        "Next, we describe an automatic method of labeling the prosodic phrase structure and a measure of the similarity between the predicted and detected prosodic structures.",
        "We then present experimental results, based on the ambiguous sentence corpus, demonstrating the utility of this approach.",
        "In conclusion, we discuss future work suggested by these results."

        "(Their goal was to predict psycholinguistic \"performance structures;\" however, we will only be interested in the prosodic tree.)",
        "The algorithm consists of a sequence of rules that progressively groups words and phrases based on syntactic structure and constituent length constraints.",
        "The rules are constrained to operate within, but not across, basic sentence clauses.",
        "First, function words and simple modifiers are grouped into 0-phrases using a right-branching structure.",
        "These 0-phrases are then grouped into I-phrases according to syntactic constituency, again using a right-branching structure.",

        "X[VY] o otherwise [XV]Y",
        "These constituents are then further bundled using a left-branching rule until all elements in the clause are included, and then clauses are bundled in a left branching structure.",
        "The degree of separation between two words, which we will refer to as a 0-break, is given by the number of nodes in the tree dominated by and including the node at this boundary.",
        "A second performance structure algorithm, the Psy Algorithm, is proposed by van Wijk [14] as being more directly tied to linguistic notions of prosodic structure.",
        "The Psy algorithm requires knowledge of the location of intonational phrase boundaries and is based on a flatter prosodic structure.",

        "Modifications to the Phi algorithm have been proposed by Bachenko and Fitzpatrick for speech synthesis applications [1].",

        "The verb balancing rule, using either method of counting constituent length, did not always yield breaks that were",

        "3 0 1 5 1 0 Based on this and other examples, we proposed the following revised verb balancing rule: o If N(X)+N(V)> N(V)+N(Y) X[VY] o otherwise [XV]Y Using this algorithm with a constituent counting function based on words rather than on phonological words seemed to be somewhat more consistent with our data, but this aspect should be confirmed through further study.",
        "A second area where problems occured was in allowing prosodic units to contain clause boundaries.",

        "0 3 0 5 0 In our observations, parenthetical phrases are bracketed by nearly equal breaks.",
        "We therefore added a rule to increase the smaller 0-break at a parenthetical boundary to the size of the break at the other side of the parenthetical phrase, as in They know, you realize, your goals.",
        "0 5 0 5 0 Evaluation The different synthesis algorithms were evaluated by computing the correlation between the predicted 0-breaks and the hand-labeled break indices.",
        "A potential problem is that the hand-labeled indices are constrained to range from 0 to 6, while the 0-breaks are theoretically unbounded.",
        "However, there seemed to be a roughly linear association between the two labeling schemes in principle, apart from the specific rules for predicting groupings, and therefore it was felt that correlation would be a meaningful measure.",
        "The correlations given in Table 1 represent the average over seventy sentences from each of four speakers.",
        "The original Phi algorithm actually had the highest performance, although average performance was similar for all four algorithms.",
        "The Phi algorithm predictions are more highly correlated to observed data in most syntactic categories in our database.",
        "Relative to the Phi algorithm, the Bachenko/Fitzpatrick algorithm offered slight improvements for parentheticals, main-main structures, and far attachments.",

        "Our algorithm was generally better than the Bachenko/Fitzpatrick algorithm, except for a significant performance degradation for left attachments.",
        "Overall, results indicate that, while relaxation of clause boundary constraints is useful, a more conservative set of",
        "rules may more accurately reflect observations.",
        "The verb association rule introduced here addresses one problem, that of verb attachment across a clause boundary.",

        "The difficulty with this approach is that it has been shown that major phrase breaks alone are often insufficient to disambiguate an utterance [13].",
        "Thus we need to assign a score based on the agreement between the synthesisized break hierarchy and the automatic labels for an utterance.",
        "The simplest method, and the one used here, is to compute the correlation between the two sets of labels.",

        "This scoring method is effectively a matched filter detection system, with the exception that we are not normalizing for \"signal energy\".",

        "In summary, we have demonstrated that automatically detected prosodic break indices contain enough information to achieve disambiguation close to the level of human performance.",
        "We have considered different synthesis algorithms which appear to be quite useful for this task.",
        "Little difference was observed between the synthesis algorithms, but evaluation on a larger task domain would probably yield more insight into this issue.",
        "While these results demonstrate feasibility of the analysis-by-synthesis approach to disambiguation, the work needs to be extended in several ways.",
        "First, the current synthesis algorithm is not implemented automatically because we did not have access to machine parses for these sentences.",
        "Automatic implementation of the synthesis algorithm and integration with a parser is an important next step.",
        "As mentioned earlier, additional modifications to the synthesis algorithm or investigation of a variation based on the Psy algorithm might also be useful.",
        "Second, the automatic break index labeling algorithm needs to be extended to achieve closer agreement with the hand labels.",
        "Although the correlation between the two is already 0.86, there is a loss of disambiguation performance.",
        "The principal reason for this loss can been seen by noting that the machine label differs from the hand label by no more than one 93% of the time for all the boundaries except those with hand labels of 3 and 4.",
        "These boundaries correspond to intermediate and intonational phrases [12] and in these cases, the current algorithm produces labels within 1 of the hand labels only 57% of the time.",
        "This is hardly surprising since intermediate and intonational phrases are marked by intonation [2] and our labeling algorithm currently has no pitch features.",
        "Thus a principal extension which needs to be investigated, is the inclusion of intonation features such as boundary tones.",
        "Since these are the principal cue for the larger breaks, we expect that their inclusion will improve performance considerably.",
        "In addition, it might be useful to investigate other similarity measures.",
        "In particular, a measure which more highly weighted the larger break indices might be useful.",
        "Finally, it will be important to consider spontaneous speech domains, which may require an entirely different synthesis algorithm for predicting phrase breaks."
