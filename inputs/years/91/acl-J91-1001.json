        "Much current research in linguistics is concerned with textual or discourse bases for linguistic structure; within lexical semantics, such research is directed at particular lexical relations and at correlations between syntax and semantics.",
        "This paper addresses the textual underpinnings of antonymy between predicative adjectives, following up research reported by Charles and Miller (1989).",
        "Antonymy is a special lexical association between word pairs.",
        "That it is lexical and not simply semantic follows from the fact that different words for the same concept can have different antonyms; for example, big-little and large-small are good antonym pairs, but large-little is not.",
        "The classic work on associations among adjectives, and between antonymous adjectives in particular, is by Deese (1964, 1965), analyzing the results of stimulus-response word-association tests.' Charles and Miller (1989) argue, contrary to more complex psycholinguistic theories, that the primary source of these associations is a tendency they hypothesize for antonyms to co-occur within the same sentences in discourse.",
        "This paper supports and extends their hypothesis.",
        "Deese's work on word association for adjectives was based on a list of the 278 most frequent adjectives in the Thorndike-Lorge (1944) count, those having a frequency of 50 per million or more.",
        "Thirty-four pairs of these words had a reciprocal property: each member of the pair was the most frequent response to the other on word-association",
        "tests.",
        "These pairs were all antonymic (e.g., good-bad, big-little, large-small).",
        "Essentially reciprocal were 5 additional antonym pairs overlapping with these 34: easy-hard (cf. hard-soft), heavy-light (cf. light-dark), left-right (cf. right-wrong), long-short (cf. short-tall), and new-old (cf. old-young).",
        "For these pairs, member A has B as its most frequent response, while B is the second most frequent response to A (A's most common response being its antonym in the original list of 34 pairs).",
        "A general finding of word-association studies is that the part of speech of the response usually agrees with that of the stimulus.",
        "Deese's data are consistent with this, and suggest further that at least the most frequent antonymous adjectives are associated more directly with each other than with other adjectives.",
        "Deese (evidently) did not find antonymic responses to be the most frequent for some 200 of the 278 adjectives he studied.",
        "These were generally of lower frequency than those that were each other's most common responses; Deese (1962, 1964:347) showed that the most common responses to lower-frequency adjectives are typically nouns that those adjectives often modify, as in administrative decision, cited by Deese and actually used in the Brown Corpus (see Section 2.1).",
        "In addition, the words with reciprocal responses were almost all morphologically simple and etymologically native (i.e., of Old English origin).",
        "In human contingency judgment studies (see Shanks and Dickinson 1987 for a recent review), the formation of associations among events is found to depend upon temporally close occurrence of the associated events.",
        "Lexical associations, and in particular the word pairs linked as stimulus and response in word-association tests, have thus been accounted for by positing frequent temporal proximity of lexical access of the words involved; Charles and Miller contrast two such accounts, the substitutability hypothesis, introduced by Ervin-Tripp (1961, 1963), and their own co-occurrence hypothesis.",
        "Because responses to higher-frequency stimuli in association tests tend to agree in part of speech, and because parts of speech are defined linguistically by mutual substitutability within a context, psycholinguistic accounts have sought explanations for antonymic associations as side-effects of part-of-speech associations; this is an economical kind of account, since part-of-speech agreement requires an explanation in any event.",
        "The key idea of the substitutability hypothesis is that the context in which one word occurs in a sentence may call to mind other words syntactically substitutable in that context, so that substitutable words are activated mentally in close temporal proximity.",
        "Under such a hypothesis, the greater the syntactic and semantic appropriateness of a substitutable word in a context, the greater its mental activation.",
        "Part-of-speech agreement often suffices for syntactic appropriateness; and, intuitively, the use of an adjective that characterizes the position of a noun's referent in one region of a semantic dimension seems sensible mainly when another region cannot be ruled out as inconsistent.",
        "Accordingly, antonymous adjectives should frequently be called to mind in each other's environment.",
        "Charles and Miller (1989) dispute the substitutability of antonymous adjectives, showing that their sentential contexts normally leave only one member of the pair plausible.",
        "They suggest instead the simplest form of associative explanation, that the forms in question do in fact tend to co-occur in close temporal contiguity â€“ in particular, that antonymous adjectives occur more frequently than expected by chance in the same sentence.",
        "As supporting evidence they provide counts showing a higher than expected number of sentences containing both members of each of the antonym pairs big-little, large-small, public-private, and strong-weak;2 they conclude that it is sentential",
        "clausal or phrasal contexts that are otherwise word-for-word repetitions of each other, apart from pronominalization or ellipsis in some cases.",
        "We propose that, while training for antonym association takes place via co-occurrence, it is their substitution in repeated contexts that makes this training particularly effective."

        "The co-occurrence hypothesis calls for high observed/expected ratios; a 3% increase in these ratios does not significantly bias in favor of the hypothesis, since the ratios we calculate are all more than 2:1 and average around 10:1.",

        "Grammatical class associations that may form on the basis of the usual sentential contexts of adjective occurrences evidently do not account for the formation of the lexical association between antonyms specifically.",
        "We have verified the conjecture that lexical antonyms co-occur sententially far more than would be expected by chance.",
        "We have also shown that this is a very general phenomenon: it characterizes all antonym pairs involving a frequent adjective, whether or not they show strongly reciprocal responses in word-association tests.",
        "These results support the co-occurrence hypothesis for the formation of the lexical association between nonmorphological antonyms, in that both the existence of the phenomenon and its generality are crucial to this acquisitional hypothesis.",
        "Accordingly, sentences with antonym co-occurrences do seem to be the crucial ones for understanding the formation of antonymic associations.",
        "Based on our analysis of these sentences, we are able to elaborate the original co-occurrence hypothesis: we now characterize the co-occurrence phenomenon not simply in terms of its excess over chance expectation, but in terms of regular syntactic patterns that they exhibit; and we have identified a mechanism for association formation, antonym alignment via phrasal substitution.",
        "This is the essence of the theory we propose: co-occurrence takes place via substitution, substitution yields antonym alignment, and alignment leads to association.",
        "It is crucially a co-occurrence theory â€“ the improbably high rates of co-occurrence of antonyms result in the formation of associations between them; furthermore, co-occurrence takes place mainly by substitution in repeated phrases, and phrasal repetition with a substitution of antonyms evidently occurs mainly when these phrases occur very near one another, particularly in the same sentence.",
        "Perhaps less crucially, it is also a substitution (not substitutability) theory: phrasal substitution provides a mechanism, antonym alignment, that yields an explicit pairing of the antonyms and enhances the efficacy of training on the association between them.",

        "1.",
        "One implicit assumption of a co-occurrence hypothesis for acquisition of a lexical association is a high enough frequency of co-occurrence to provide adequate training for the association.",
        "We find mostly quite high rates of occurrence of adjectives with their antonyms, averaging about once per 15 sentences having the less frequent member of an antonym pair; and overall, about 1 sentence in 150 includes the co-occurrence of an antonym pair from our study.",
        "2.",
        "Such high rates should normally suffice to yield associations, but this is not the case when they can occur by chance.",
        "For example, most sentences containing a given adjective also contain the word the, so that the article occurs with that adjective at a higher rate than does any genuinely associated word, including an antonym.",
        "Conversely, lower rates of co-occurrence may be equally effective (provided they achieve some threshold assuring adequate training) if these co-occurrences are substantially more surprising (i.e., improbable under a hypothesis of chance co-occurrence).",
        "3.",
        "Finally, some contexts in which words co-occur highlight the fact of their co-occurrence, increasing their inherent potential for forming associations; such contextual enhancement of associability may be required for forming associations between infrequently occurring (or co-occurring) words.",
        "We have found that antonyms habitually substitute",
        "for one another in otherwise essentially identical phrases within the same sentence, and that this powerfully supports their association via antonym alignment.",
        "This is probably the single most important pattern increasing the efficacy of co-occurrence in fostering the development of a lexical association between antonyms, and probably between members of any one grammatical class.",
        "Other patterns raise associability as well; adjacency, for example, is especially effective in raising the associability of members of different grammatical classes, such as nouns with their modifying adjectives.",
        "Justeson and Katz Co-occurrences of Antonymous Adjectives Under this formulation of the co-occurrence theory, acquiring the lexical relation of antonymy requires a certain amount of training for the association, and as the frequency of adjectives declines, so must the frequency of training for its associations.",
        "On the whole, then, very infrequent training should result in weaker associations; more generally, adjective frequency should correlate with the strength of lexical associations.",
        "One consequence of this correlation for the formation of a lexical association between semantically opposed adjectives is that, as the frequency of adjectives declines, so does the proportion of those adjectives that have good antonyms (apart from morphological antonyms, which can be derived by rule with no associative training); we have verified this gradient for adjectives in the Brown Corpus.",
        "Another consequence is that semantic (especially synonymic) associations should be stronger relative to the lexical (especially antonymic) associations for lower-frequency adjectives.",

        "We illustrate the phenomenon using the antonym pair good-bad; they co-occur 16 times in the corpus, which is highly improbable as a chance effect (having probability 5 x 10-12), and all 16 co-occurrences are in highly associable syntactic patterns.",
        "Finally, the co-occurrence rate as defined in Section 2, which is the conditional probability of encountering good in a sentence containing bad, is quite high (16/125), about once per 8 sentences.",

        "Among adjectives, none has a significantly greater than chance number of co-occurrences, and none occurs in the high associability pattern of substituting adjectives in conjoined and otherwise identical phrases, so no other adjective competes strongly with bad as an associate of good.",
        "Among nouns, however, a few (man, people, time, day) co-occur with good more often than bad does, and do so with greater than chance numbers of co-occurrences.",
        "While they cannot substitute phrasally for good in these sentences, as adjectives can, all of them often occur immediately following the adjective; we suppose that this close association facilitates association formation, though probably not as dramatically as direct substitution in context.",
        "This leaves bad as the single strongest associate for good, but with more competition from other candidates than good had from other associates of bad.",
        "In Deese's word-association tests, bad was indeed a much weaker response (13/100) to good than good was to bad (43/100), though each was the other's most common response.",
        "This pattern is typical of Deese's antonyms: it is usual, though not exceptionless, for the more frequent adjective in an antonym pair to exhibit the lower response frequency to its antonym; a substantially higher frequency normally entails a larger number of significant textual associates.-We presume that this competition among a set of unequal lexical associates, and of these associates with semantically but not lexically associated words, can account not only for the high proportion of antonymic responses to high-frequency adjectives,",
        " but also for the low proportion of antonymic responses to low-frequency adjectives.",
        "In particular, we have already suggested that nonmorphological antonymic association must be quite weak in the case of very infrequent adjectives, due to insufficient training opportunities; and morphologically negative antonyms of low-frequency adjectives are almost always much lower in frequency than the base form.",
        "Assuming that such infrequent adjectives typically have quite limited semantic domains of relevance, they are apt to show repeated co-occurrence with nouns in noun phrases, especially in a particular type of corpus or a particular person's sphere of activity and experience.",
        "Accordingly, it will usually happen that a few nouns premodified by a given rare adjective have the highest co-occurrence rate and improbability factor of any open-class word, and in corpora whose size reflects the language learner's early experience with language, the antonym (which can hardly be other than a morphological antonym) will rarely or never have appeared.",
        "In contrast, the highest-frequency adjectives have extensive training opportunities, resulting in a great deal of experience with antonym co-occurrence, whose associative strength has the support of phrasal substitution; and competition from nouns and verbs is much more diffuse than in lower-frequency adjectives due to a usually broad range of applicability.",
        "Accordingly, the three factors governing associative strength, together with competition among associates of varying strengths, induce a correlation between the frequency of a stimulus adjective and the proportions of adjective vs. noun responses on word-association tests.",
        "Deese interpreted this correlation as reflecting a greater effectiveness of paradigmatic (same part of speech) associations at higher frequencies, and of syntagmatic (typical or prototypical accompaniments) at lower frequencies.",
        "It now appears that the opposition between paradigmatic and syntagmatic is not directly relevant to the process of association formation.",
        "Rather, these are descriptively different effects of competition among all associated words; apart from possible differences in the efficacy of substitution vs. adjacency in raising the associability of co-occurring words, and in the relative strengths of semantic vs. lexical associations in the paradigmatic and syntagmatic cases, the outcome of the competition is based on the same kinds of textual co-occurrence preferences for both paradigmatic and syntagmatic associates."
