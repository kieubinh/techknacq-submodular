        "In the context of NLs, little has been said regarding the generative inadequacy of formalisms such as single or multiple-component T(ree) A(djoining) G(rammar)s (Joshi 1985, 1987), H(ead) G(rammar)s (Pollard 1984; Roach 1987), Linear) I(ndexed) G(rammar)s (Gazdar 1988), or Combinatory Categorial Grammars (Steed-man 1985, 1987).",
        "These formalisms are among the so-called Mildly C(ontext)-S(ensitive) G(rammar)s since they are non-CF; i.e., strictly CS, but only to a limited extent.",
        "More will be said about these grammars and their object languages below.",
        "Notable exceptions to the trend of demonstrating only non–context-freeness are Kac (1987) for English and Manaster-Ramer (1987a) for Dutch and German.",
        "In addition to demonstrating non–context-freeness, both these studies argue that the constructions used for their respective argumentations can serve as a basis for demonstrating that the NLs in question are generated neither by TAGs nor by HGs.",
        "However, these constructions rely crucially on coordination, and our current understanding of the properties of coordination is far from satisfactory.",

        "Zwicky (1963) discusses some constructions of names for cardinal numbers that are not generated by a CFG.",
        "The one he labels (1) resembles the structure of very large number-names in English (and other NLs):",
        "In this construction, N indicates a number between 1 and 999, T is an abbreviation for thousand, commas indicate an intonational pause, and everything within parentheses is optional.",
        "This construction could be characterized as follows:",
        "(i) Given a system in English, for example, where thousand is used as the largest single word for a number, million would be represented as thousand thousand, (Amer.)",
        "billion as thousand thousand thousand, (Amer.)",
        "trillion as thousand thousand thousand thousand, etc., ad infinitum.",
        "(ii) In a system like (i), larger clusters of thousand must precede smaller clusters of thousand in the same manner that decillion must precede trillion, which must precede million, which must precede thousand in the standard English number-name system using single-words for numbers of higher values.",
        "He proceeds, inter alia, to prove that P is non – context-free.",
        "A conclusion from his study is that the sublanguage of English encompassing the names for cardinal numbers is strictly context-sensitive.",
        "Although Zwicky's mathematical argumentation is sound, room is left for some investigators to cast doubts on whether his claims bear in any significant way on NL.",
        "The empirical basis for Zwicky's argument rests largely on whether characteristics (i) and (ii) are indeed linguistically real.",
        "There has been much controversy over the status of these characteristics.",
        "For example, Merrifield (1968, p. 91) states the following: In working with a language isolate such as a system for naming numbers, several things should be kept in mind.",
        "In the first place, such a system differs from the larger grammar of which it is but a segment in not being indefinitely recursive.",
        "A grammar of a natural",
        "language accounts for an infinite number of utterances; a grammar of number names apparently does not.",
        "The latter is limited by the number of linguistic primitives of the sort 'billions,\"trillions,\"quadrillions,' etc., which it includes.",
        "And though a mathematician is presumably able to write down in mathematical notation an infinitely large set of numbers, when he attempts to give names to the members of the set in a natural language, he is limited by the number of primitives at his disposal.",
        "Greenberg (1978, p. 253) expresses Merrifield's assertion as the generalization that, \"every language has a numeral system of finite scope.\"",
        "Greenberg then proceeds to claim that the largest expressible natural number in American English is 1036-1 \"as-suming that, as in most dictionaries of AMERICAN ENGLISH, the lexical item with the highest numerical value is 'decillion'.",
        "\"2 Thus, Merrifield and Greenberg take the view that there is an upper limit on linguistically expressible number-names.",
        "Hence, by this view, characteristic (i) appears not to be linguistically warranted.",
        "Hurford (1975, p. 4) suggests otherwise: Now it can be argued that the class of number expressions in any given language is infinite.",
        "Intuitions of language users differ on the matter of whether the set of number expressions in their language is infinite.",
        "The crux of the matter is the question whether the names for very high numbers are in fact wellformed.",
        "In English, for example, the expression two billion billion, five hundred and five may be felt by some speakers to be quite wellformed, though of course unlikely to be observed, whereas other speakers may object that it is not wellformed.",
        "Accordingly, characteristic (i) is linguistically warranted for at least some speakers.",
        "Hurford (ibid.)",
        "takes in fact this position: It will become obvious as we proceed that the particular systematic characteristics which are evident in natural language number-name systems tend to project the existence of infinite sets of number-names and a higher limit to the value of wellformed number-names can only be stated in a fairly ad hoc arbitrary manner.",
        "Epstein (1978, p. 123) contests this claim by arguing: Contrary to what Hurford claims, there are a finite number of these [numerical expressions in English].",
        "Ten to the trillionth power, for example, has no corresponding counting expression.",
        "Hurford (1979, p. 42) responds: This is a misconception.",
        "It would be similarly wrong to assert that there is no single English sentence giving the full names, addresses, heights, weights, and IQ's of all UK citizens at midnight on March 1st, 1978.",
        "Such a sentence would be impossibly long to utter, but that is not a restriction which need be stated as part of English grammar, or indeed of general linguistic theory.",
        "If the highest-valued number word in your vocabulary is trillion, and you want to express higher numbers, you just string together enough trillions to get you there.",
        "Nobody, as a",
        "matter of performance could possibly utter enough trillions in sequence to make a counting expression expressing ten to the trillionth power, but no grammatical theory need concern itself with this fact.",
        "While we fully agree with Hurford on this matter, the contrived nature of \"strungtogether\" trillions or thousands or any other single-word number-name seems to lead some investigators into rejecting its empirical validity in English.",
        "For example, Brain-erd (1971, p. 208) mentions the following: The collection of numerical expressions in most languages, as in English, are basically finite.",
        "Thus in English we must ultimately coin new 'illions' if we are to transcend our [finite] system of number names.",
        "And where are these to come from when we have run out of Latin prototypes?' In some languages there are, however, purely linguistic devices which allow for an infinitude of numerical expressions.",
        "For example, in Chinese, wan is used for 104 and wan wan for 108.",
        "Presumably we can continue ad infinitum, wan wan wan 1012, wan wan wan wan 1016, etc.",
        "Thus, while the linguistic status of strung-together number-names in English might be questionable, Brainerd suggests on the basis of empirical evidence that this is not so in Chinese.",
        "Characteristic (i) appears then to be linguistically warranted in at least one NL, currently the most widely natively spoken one.' In the next section, we take a look at some more data on number-names in Chinese.",
        "This will help us to support our conclusion regarding the linguistic reality of characteristic (i) as well as to determine the empirical status of characteristic (ii).",
        "Furthermore, the data will serve as a basis for the formal arguments to be presented in Sections 4 and 5.",

        "This is the same tool used for expressing 108 as wan wan, which is, as previously mentioned, a frequently used synonym for yi.",

        "The consequences of Ziff's Law are avoided, however, by invoking considerations of classificatory capacity.",
        "This notion was introduced in Manaster-Ramer (1987a, p. 238) and preliminarily defined there as \"the measure of a formalism's ability [to] classify a set of strings (and substrings) and specify which ones are like which other ones.\"",
        "In Radzinski (1990a, p. 122 and 1990b, pp.",
        "85-86), we have further refined this definition to apply to CFGs: Let some nonterminal in the grammar ultimately be rewritten only as a string belonging to some particular construction.",
        "For example, if passive sentences are to be considered a construction in some NL r, then let the CFG G(C) include a member PASS in its set of nonterminal symbols which yields in one or more steps all and only passive sentences of E. We say then that G(E) classifies passives.",
        "According to the definitions of Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems given in Weir (1988), (including CFGs, Tree Adjoining Grammars, Head Grammars, Linear Indexed Grammars, Combinatory Categorial Grammars, and Multiple Component TAGs) any LCFRS contains a set of nonterminals.",
        "We can thus extend our definition to apply to all LCFRSs, in addition to CFGs.17 What we would wish to test then is whether any",
        " LCFRS for Chinese can classify NC, whose strings clearly constitute a construction in Chinese separate from other noun-phrases.",
        "Such a test would fail, since, given our formal results, an arbitrary MCTAG, or other LCFRS, G(Chinese) could not include a nonterminal yielding all Chinese number-names in one or more steps.",
        "Hence, if the linear order constraint is purely syntactic in nature, then Chinese is a non-MCTAL on grounds of classificatory capacity.",
        "No matter which position one takes with respect to where the linear order constraint applies, interesting conclusions follow: either Chinese is not a Multiple Component Tree Adjoining Language by classificatory capacity considerations or the interface-language between Chinese and cognitive math, something we know little of, is not an MCTAL when viewed as a formal language.",
        "In his \"Topic ...",
        "Comment\" column, Pullum (1986, p. 410) once wondered: ... neither the mathematics nor the facts [discussed in Zwicky (1963)] are in dispute, yet the issue still seems hard to resolve.",
        "... We have to be taught [the constraint] in math classes at school, and we do not acquire it with our language per se.",
        "On odd dates I still think this is right, but on even dates I think the argument has been unjustly overlooked.",
        "Zwicky thinks we [i.e. Pullum and Gazdar] were correct to dismiss it, but maybe he is wrong and it was the first valid argument that English is non-CF.",
        "The problem here is that we are not entirely sure what is a fact about a language and what is a fact about the culture associated with it.",
        "Yet it is hard to believe that the constraint is explicitly taught in math classes at school, since children rarely deal with numbers with such values.",
        "Also, there is no reason to assume that wan wan is taught in school, given its natural and common use by Chinese native speakers, regardless of their educational level.18 Moreover, the phenomenon is completely irrelevant to the culture associated with Chinese or with any other natural language exhibiting a similar behavior.",
        "It is a constraint related either to the \"pure\" syntax of Chinese or to the component interfacing between this syntax and the cognitive faculty for arithmetic reasoning.",
        "Both of these are hardly culture-based.19 We end this section by presenting, for purposes of contrast, two mathematics-based formal arguments that are quite irrelevant to the study of natural language, although their proponents may have laid claims, or at least hinted, otherwise.",
        "The first of these is an argument against the context-freeness of English presented in Elster (1978, pp.",
        "42-44) and refuted by Pullum and Gazdar (1982, pp.",
        "479-481).",
        "Elster bases single nonterminal as a basis, classification can be achieved via a set of nonterminals or via some production rule that applies in all and only the derivations of a particular construction.",
        "These definitions, however, would be merely similar alternative formalizations of the same intuitive notion.",
        "18 An anonymous referee has indicated that while this may be true for wan wan, forms such as zhao are surely taught (originally) in school.",
        "Yet, we believe that even if the single-word number-name zhao is learned explicitly only via formal education, its use within a strung-together number-name and the linear order pattern exhibited by such a long number-name is not.",
        "Rather, the constraints for forming strung-together number-names using zhao are the same as those for forming long number-names using wan.",
        "As mentioned in Section 3, the use of zhao instead of wan in long number-names results in better acceptability, as the former appears to be the highest valued number denoted by a single-word in modern Chinese.",

        "• • a2000000.",
        "B2: The first two million million numbers in the decimal expansion of 7r are a1a2•a2000000000000.2° Bk: The first two (million)\" numbers in the decimal expansion of 7r are a1a2 ...a2.106k.",
        "According to the pumping lemma for CFLs, any sufficiently long sentence of a CFL can be extended by indefinite repetition of, at most, two subparts without violation of grammaticality.",
        "The only possible pumpable substrings in sentences like Bk are within the cluster of millions and al .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "an.",
        "If we pump the substrings 'millionq' and '1ar... at' up once, then we end up with a sentence like C: C: The [first] two millionk±q... numbers in the decimal expansion of p are al ... atar at .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "a2.106k Elster claims (p. 44) that C is not a grammatical sentence in English because: ... the number 'two millionk±v must be the same as the number 2.106k t – r + 1', i.e. the same as the number of numbers in the decimal expansion.",
        "Note that this is a requirement not of mathematics, but of linguistics, just as the lack of grammaticality of the sentence, D: the two largest animals in the zoo are a mouse, is a matter of linguistics, and not of mathematics ...",
        "But, according to Elster, in order for C to be \"grammatical,\" the length of its decimal expansion must be longer: 2.",
        "1 06(k+q).",
        "Thus, since there is a sufficiently long sentence in English that lacks, at most, two pumpable substrings, English is not CF. As Pullum and Gazdar (1982, pp.",
        "480-481) claim, Elster is wrong since he is assuming that English grammar requires, as seen from the ungrammaticality of D versus the grammaticality of the B sentences above, that the number of entities listed in a predicate correspond to the number named in the subject.",
        "Yet if D is ungrammatical, it is not because of such a requirement, but rather because of the number (i.e., singular/plural) disagreement it exhibits.",
        "If Elster were right, then the sentence \"The two largest animals in the zoo are Mickey, Minnie, and Donald\" would be ungrammatical.",
        "Yet this sentence is clearly grammatical, albeit infelicitous.",
        "Elster is confusing 20 The reproduction of this sentence in Pullum and Gazdar (1982, p. 479) lacks one instance of million.",
        "Thus, Elster's argument becomes largely incomprehensible if read only there.",
        "The version reproduced in Savitch et al.",
        "(1987, p. 149) contains the same typographical error.",
        "Also, notice that Elster's acceptance of sentences of this sort with strung-together millions, indicates that he too is of the opinion that strung-together number-names are empirically attested in English.",
        " grammaticality with arithmetical felicity.",
        "His argument, thus, bears little on natural language.",
        "The second argument, this time not discussed by Pullum and Gazdar (1982), is one presented in Brainerd (1966b, pp.",
        "119-124).",
        "Brainerd discusses \"verbal expressions,\" i.e. number-names, for rational numbers of the following type: zero point three six five four six five three six five three etc.",
        "three point two seven seven two seven seven two seven seven etc.",
        "These number-names for repeated decimals contain subparts of indefinite length that are repeated ad infinitum.",
        "However, given the periodicity of the repetition, the number, and hence its name, may be expressed by a convention requiring only a fixed amount of repetitions.",
        "A convention using merely one repetition suffices to argue that the set comprising the names for repeated decimals constitutes a non-CFL (two repetitions: a non-TAL).",
        "As Brainerd claims on p. 122: ... it is easy to show that the language L(R) [comprising the numeral names for non-negative rational numbers in English] possesses no context-free grammar.",
        "Indeed, such a language can be shown to be a non-CFL, via the strong pumping lemma for Context-Free Languages.",
        "Brainerd later writes on p. 124: It is perhaps not out of place to observe that if repeated decimals (in their English verbal form) are a part of the natural language, then repeated decimals constitute an example of a duplication-structure of arbitrary length in English.",
        "Thus, Brainerd suggests, albeit equivocally, that English, a natural language, is affected by the non–context-freeness of its sub-language consisting of the names for rational numbers.",
        "Yet, this could hardly have any basis whatsoever.",
        "On grounds of weak generative capacity, claiming that English is non-CF because it has \"a duplication-structure of arbitrary length,\" is as absurd as claiming that the regular language {a*b*c*} is a non-CFL because it is a proper superset of the non-CFL {anbnc\"}.",
        "Although pumping a string in L(R), longer than some constant, in accordance with the conditions set forth by the strong pumping lemma for CFLs, yields a string outside of L(R), it nevertheless yields one that is a well-formed number-name, albeit corresponding perhaps to an irrational number.",
        "However, considerations of classificatory capacity will not help here, since there is absolutely no linguistically based reason to assume that the set of names for rational numbers constitutes a construction distinct from names for other types of numbers.",
        "Thus, as with Elster's argument, Brainerd's has little bearing on natural language.",
        "Contrary to these two arguments, our claims, as we have already seen and discussed, definitely do bear either on the syntax of a natural language or on the interface between that natural language and the cognitive mathematical faculty."
