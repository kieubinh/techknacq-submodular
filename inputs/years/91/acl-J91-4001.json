        "The present system also includes several efficient approaches such as a direction-selective chart to simplify the control of the head-driven operation; a heuristic scheduling policy and a bidirectional lookahead approach to eliminate many unnecessary searching actions, and an improved raise-bind mechanism combined with check rules to treat the difficult problems of movement transformations and empty categories and to simplify the design of grammar rules.",

        "Just like a conventional chart (Kay 1980; Winograd 1983), the direction-selective chart is an efficient data structure to record what has been done so far in the course of parsing to avoid duplicate computation.",
        "The special feature of the direction-selective chart is that the active edges (the incomplete constituents that need other complete constituents to their left or right to compose larger ones) are further partitioned into two disjoint groups: forward-active (F-active) and backward-active (B-active) edges to indicate different search directions as described below.",
        "In the head-driven parser, the parsing process will begin on the heads in the input word sequence.",
        "As described in Section 2, the heads in the Chinese language are at either the initial or final position of a phrase; therefore, in a head-driven parser, the searching actions triggered by an initial head (being a complete constituent) are always looking forward (from left to right); while the actions triggered by a final head are always looking backward (from right to left).",
        "However, no bidirectional searching actions can be triggered by a single head in the course of parsing.",
        "Therefore, in this head-driven chart parser, the F-active edges are used to denote forward searching actions, and the B-active edges are used to denote the backward.",
        "The information specified on each active edge then consists of the search direction (forward or backward), in addition to normal information, such as the vertices where the edge starts, and ends, the grammar rule referred to, etc.",

        "Also, Pareschi and Steedman (1987) had proposed another similar bidirectional chart parsing algorithm to handle operations such as functional composition for categorial grammars applications (Steedman 1985).",

        "It records the category of the constituent it is looking for, where the constituent should be, and the structure obtained so far in order to form a complete one.",
        "During the course of parsing because the parser usually cannot correctly predict the category and position of the constituents to be built next, many unnecessary and redundant active edges will inevitably be built and substantial searching efforts thus have to be wasted, as very often happened in many chart-based parsers.",
        "This is very inefficient and can, in fact, be significantly improved in the present system based on the following concept.",
        "Because no phrasal category is null in the grammar rules, whenever an active edge is built into the direction-selective chart, the parser can first examine the constituent, exactly located at the position the active edge is looking for, to check whether the desired category can begin with (if the active edge is F-active for an initial head) or end with (if the active edge is B-active for a final head) the category of the examined constituent, according to the description of the grammar.",
        "In this way it is possible for the parser of the present system to avoid building many unnecessary active edges by such a \"bidirectional lookahead approach\" combining the special head-driven strategy developed in the present study with the concept of FIRST and LAST parsing tables (Aho and Ullman 1972) to be discussed in detail below.",

        "Each step in the parsing process can very often produce more than one subsequent steps.",
        "For example, a new edge built into a chart may cause an arbitrary number of edges (candidate constituents) to be built.",
        "Usually, in such situations some of them",
        "should be processed prior to the others instead of simply performing exhaustive processing.",
        "In other words, a well defined scheduling policy is, in fact, helpful.",
        "This is why most of the chart parsers have an agenda to schedule these steps (Kay 1980).",
        "In the present system, a heuristic scheduling policy is also developed, as described in this section.",
        "In the present system the scheduling policy is primarily based on some heuristic estimation obtained from empirical experiences, in which each candidate constituent is assigned a priority to indicate processing order.",
        "Most of the time, the assignment is described by its category.",
        "For example, a constituent with an S category will be constructed prior to a constituent with a VP category (some unnecessary VP constituents may be therefore eliminated, for example), a constituent with a VP category will be constructed prior to one with a V-bar category... etc.",
        "On the other hand, if more than one candidate constituents have the same priority, the constituent at the rightmost position (located at the farthest end vertex) is then the first to be built.",
        "To see how the above heuristic scheduling policy is integrated with the head-driven chart parser discussed here to efficiently parse an input sentence, a simple example is used in the following to show the parsing process.",
        "Suppose the input sentence is: ti IA you of brother again hit children (your brother hits children again) and the grammar rules, the FIRST and LAST tables used are those shown in Figures 7-9, respectively.",
        "The resulting chart is shown in Figure 11a, where the numbers attached on the edges indicate their order in the course of parsing.",
        "In fact, it is easy to see that many constructions have been successfully avoided in the chart.",
        "To make the illustration simple and clear, here we shall follow the parser to analyze only the sentence fragment \" X. ti \" (hit children again) as shown in Figure 11b.",
        "Before the parsing process starts, three inactive edges are constructed in the chart to represent the sentence fragment.",
        "Then, based on the head-driven principle and the sample grammar, the word \" 4T (hit),\" according to rule (4) in the sample grammar, is an initial head (a transitive verb) that needs a right neighboring NP to form a V-bar (that is represented by an F-active edge; i.e., edge(1) in Figure 11b); the word \" (children),\" based on rule (1), is a final head (a noun) that either can be an NP by itself (this is represented by an inactive edge; i.e., edge(2) in Figure 11b) or needs a left neighboring XPDE to form an NP (this is represented by a B-active edge(*) in Figure 11b).",
        "Examining each of these three edges with either the FIRST or LAST tables, as illustrated in Figure 10b previously, edge(*) should not be built (it is a redundant edge) but edges (1) and (2) both can be potential candidates and, thus, should be built.",
        "Now, according to the heuristic scheduling policy, a V-bar edge will be built prior to an NP edge; therefore, edge (1) is the first edge to be built.",
        "However, since there is no such NP currently in the chart, no new edges can be produced after edge (1) is added, and thus edge (2), the only candidate, is then added to the chart.",
        "This edge now satisfies the request of edge (1) and, therefore, creates a V-bar inactive edge (edge (3)) as a new candidate.",
        "Meanwhile, since edge (2) isn't a head, no active edges can be triggered, so that edge (3) is the third edge to be built.",
        "Similarly, a VP (edge (4)) can then be triggered by edge (3), and, finally, a complete VP constituent (edge(5)) can be built.",

        "The Raise-Bind Mechanism and Check Rules The raise-bind mechanism presented here is specially developed in the present system to treat the difficult problems of movement transformations and empty categories so that the design of the grammar can be simplified.",
        "It is used to cope with the empty categories; in other words, to find the antecedent for each empty category except for those that are free (such as in sentence (8) in Section 3).",
        "During the parsing process when an NP is desired, the parser, with the aid of the raise-bind mechanism, will perform the following operations.",
        "First, a corresponding active edge indicating the request for an NP may be built in the chart after looking up the FIRST or LAST tables.",
        "This request can be satisfied when a desired NP is actually encountered.",
        "Second, if the desired NP is not encountered and the NP position can, instead, be filled by an empty category (according to the check rules with details explained below), then an empty NP will be generated to fill the vacant position and a new edge (active or inactive) denoting this satisfaction will be built in the chart.",
        "This empty NP will then be raised up in some way along the parsing tree (implicitly represented in the chart) when the tree is growing up (recall that the parser works bottom up), until Its antecedent is parsed.",
        "At this point, the parser binds the empty NP by setting it to refer to its antecedent (this is also guided by check rules as described below).",
        "Once bound, the empty NP will not be raised up any further, because an empty NP has exactly one antecedent and cannot be bound more than once.",
        "Not every NP position can be filled by an empty category.",
        "In the Chinese language,",
        "empty categories only appear in the subject position and direct object position, never in the indirect object position, or the prepositional object position.",
        "In our implementation, an empty NP contains three fields: (1) a field to keep the pointer to indicate its antecendent, (2) a field to keep where it came from, and (3) a field to keep the syntactic or semantic constraints on the empty NP for later checking.",
        "Rules for this kind of checking are called check rules in the present system.",
        "Most of the time, these check rules are invoked when a constituent containing unbound empty categories is built in the chart.",
        "Usually, distinct rules are used to treat different problems.",
        "For example, we can informally state the rules to treat the relativization phenomena as follows: for a noun and a relative clause to be combined into an NP, the relative clause must contain an empty NP that is unbound and marked to be coming from either the subject position or the object position of the relative clause, and then this empty NP will be bound to the (head) noun (just as in sentence (5) in Section 3; a further example will be given below).",
        "We can also state the check rules for passivization as follows: once a clause is constructed, the parser checks whether the prepositional phrase, \" ik + NP\" (similar to \"by + NP\" in English) is involved in the clause.",
        "If so, there must be an empty NP that is unbound and marked to be coming from some object position, and this empty NP will be bound to the subject of the clause (just as in sentence (3) in Section 3; a further example will be given below).",
        "The check rules for pivot construction can also be formulated as follows: in a pivot construction, the direct object will bind the empty NP coming from the subject position of the embedded clauses (just as in sentence (7) in Section 3; a further example will be given below).",
        "Apparently, check rules for other linguistic phenomena such as topicalization, ba-transformation, and so on can all be similarly developed.",
        "In fact, the binding process in the raise-bind mechanism here is rule-based rather than principle-based; that is, the whole binding process in the raise-bind mechanism is determined by the check rules and the phrase structure rules, while instead in some other principle-based parsers, for example, a parser completely based on GB theory (Wehrli 1988), it is influenced by some linguistic principles; e.g. the government binding principle in GB theory.",
        "However, the rule-based approaches may take some more cost in computation than the principle-based approaches, but in dealing with some specific problems the former approaches seem more flexible than the latter approaches.",
        "This is why in sentence (7) (pivot construction) the empty category in the subject position of the embedded clause can be bound to the NP \" /IN ig (children)\" in the higher clause, even if it is not governed by the NP.",
        "To illustrate the operation of the above check rules, let's consider phrase (9) in the following and its parsing tree in Figure 12, in which several of such phenomena interact with one another.",

        "(2) Node V-bar is constructed and the dummy object e2 is inserted.",

        "According to the check rules for relativization, e3 is bound to \"children.\" Notice that only e3 was raised up across the node S2, because eland e2 had been bound before S2 was constructed.",
        "Once the parsing tree in Figure 12 is completed, it is easy to answer questions such as who were asked and who went to dinner.",
        "Since el is the dummy subject of \"go to dinner\" and the binder of el is e2, whose binder is e3, whose binder is \"children,\" we can conclude it is \"children\" who went to dinner.",
        "In the same way, we can also conclude it is \"children\" who were asked.",
        "The raise-bind mechanism also serves as a filter to rule out incorrect sentences or incorrect parsing trees.",
        "For example, if no empty NP is raised up or no NP is bound within a construction involving passivization or relativization, such a construction will be rejected by the check rules.",
        "On the other hand, some unbound NP could have no antecedent.",
        "This can be determined from the check rules by looking up the attributes of its corresponding verb.",
        "If the corresponding argument of the verb can actually be omitted, then the parsing tree can be accepted; otherwise, the parsing tree will be ruled out.",
        "Of course, if this mechanism is adopted for English sentence analysis, a test must be performed to rule out sentences with other empty categories that have no binder.",

        "Relativization in Chinese is a long-distance movement; that is, it can sometimes move an object across several S (sentence) nodes.",
        "The noun phrase in (10) below shows an example.",
        "On the other hand, the noun phrase in (11) is ambiguous.",
        "If the head noun (\"the man\") binds e1, this NP means \"the man whom someone likes.\" If the head noun binds e2, on the other hand, it means \"the man who likes someone or something.\" To remove the ambiguity, semantic interactions are needed.",
        "Considering the above situations, we can further improve the check rules as follows: for a noun and a relative clause to be combined into an NP, the parser checks the \"empty-NP list\" raised up from the relative clause, and",
        "• if no empty NP is raised up, rule out the NP constituent; • if an empty NP is raised up and marked to be coming from the subject position or object position or embedded object position (as in example (10)), set the empty NP to be bound to the head noun; • if two empty NPs are raised up from both the subject and object positions (as in example (11)), employ semantic analysis to determine the proper binding (the present system is syntactically-based therefore such semantic analysis will be considered in the next phase research).",
        "Like relativization, topicalization is also a long-distance movement and can be further improved in a similar way.",
        "Another syntactic phenomena crucial to the parser is known as the complex NP Constraint (CNPC) (Radford 1981); i.e., no transformation rule can move any element out of a complex NP, where a complex NP (CNP) is an NP containing a relative clause.",
        "This CNPC can be easily encoded in the grammar in the present approach by a simple rule; i.e., no empty NPs can be raised up across a CNP node.",
        "Hence, it is impossible for the empty NP within a CNP to be bound to any element out of that CNP.",
        "In most cases, ba-transformation and passivization move the direct objects of verbs.",
        "But the phenomenon known as \"subject-to-object raising\" (Radford 1981) has some differences.",
        "In such a case, the subject of an embedded clause can be moved into the subject (or ba-object) position of the higher clause by passivization (or ba-transformation).",

        "To cope with such subject-to-object raising, the rules described in the previous section for passivization can be modified as follows.",
        "The subject of a passive clause will bind the empty NP in either the object position or the subject position of an embedded clause.",
        "The raise-bind mechanism is a computational approach to deal with the binding of empty categories.",
        "Its most attractive feature is, in fact, that it is specially designed",
        " to be used for head-driven strategy as in the present system.",
        "In ATN (Bates 1978), the hold-list mechanism is used for a similar purpose.",
        "However, it is not very helpful in parsing Chinese because: (a) it does not really fit the head-driven operation; (b) it cannot deal with really unbound empty categories (e.g. example (8)); (c) it handles left extraposition (e.g. (2)–(4)), but not right extraposition (e.g. sentence (5)).",
        "A movement is called left (or right) extraposition, if it moves an NP to the position left (or right) of its trace.",
        "To deal with right extraposition, ATN uses another mechanisim.",
        "In GB theory, both left extraposition and right extraposition move an NP to a position governing its trace; a null pronominal, if bound, is always bound to an NP governing the null pronominal (Chomsky 1981).",
        "So, the raise-bind mechanism combined with the check rules discussed here is sufficient to cope with all empty categories, left or right extrapositions, and traces or null pronominals, since its function is simply to raise up an empty category to be bound by an NP that governs this empty category.",
        "We believe that by means of the raise-bind mechanism it will not be difficult to implement some similar linguistic operators such as the slash concept of GPSG (Sells 1985).",
        "However, this present approach still has some constraints; for example, the check rules may take some computation cost, and multiple binding may occur if some of the check rules are not consistent in some situations."

        "In order to see how the present approaches work as compared to conventional approaches in parsing Chinese sentences, an experimental system was implemented and extensive experiments have been performed.",
        "The system is written in C language and performed on an IBM PC/AT.",
        "A total of 47 phrase structure rules were used, in which 19 rules are backward with a final head (indicated by a backward flag) and 28 rules are forward with an initial head (indicated by a forward flag).",
        "All these rules, together with the corresponding FIRST and LAST tables are listed in APPENDIX A and APPENDIX B, respectively.",
        "A total of four tests were performed for each test sentence.",
        "In test I, a conventional left-to-right parsing strategy without any lookahead capability was used, while in Test II the left-to-right parsing strategy was equipped with a forward lookahead approach (with the FIRST table only).",
        "In Test III, the present head-driven parsing strategy based on the direction-selective chart was used without any lookahead capability, and finally in Test IV, the present head-driven parsing strategy based on the direction-selective chart equipped with the bidirectional lookahead approach (with both the FIRST and LAST tables) was used.",
        "Because of the flexibility of the present direction-selective chart, all the above four tests can be easily implemented in the present system.",
        "For example, to perform Test I all one has to do is simply switch all the flags in the phrase structure rules into the forward mode, etc.",
        "After every test sentence was parsed in each test and an output syntax tree was obtained, the total number of constituents constructed in the process of parsing was recorded.",
        "In Figure 13, the total number of constituents constructed in each of the four tests, together with the number of resulting output parsing trees for 25 typical sentence examples picked up from a total of 200 test sentences, are listed.",
        "These 25 typical sentence examples are also listed in APPENDIX C .",
        "In Figure 14, the reduction ratios of edge construction for the four tests as compared to Test I (i.e., the ratio of the number of edge constructions to that of Test I for the 25 sentence examples), together with the average reduction ratios for all the 200 test sentences, are shown.",
        "Also listed in the last row of Figure 14 is the average time necessary to process a sentence on the IBM PC/AT for each test.",
        "It can be found that, as compared to the",
        "conventional approach in Test I, on average the total number of necessary constituents constructed for a sentence is reduced by a factor of 0.635 (or less than 2/3), or the required processing time is reduced from 8.2 sec to 3.1 sec for a sentence, through the use of the present direction-selective chart, the head-driven parsing strategy, and the bidirectional lookahead approaches (Test IV).",
        "Also, if the direction-selective and the head-driven parsing strategy are used alone without lookahead capability (Test III), an edge reduction ratio of 0.762 can be achieved and it takes about 6.4 sec on average to parse a sentence, which is close to the edge reduction ratio and processing speed (0.758 and 6.2 sec/sentence) for the use of the FIRST table only with conventional left-to-right parsing (Test II).",
        "Moreover, another important observation is that the edge reduction ratios are more prominent or the present approaches become more efficient when the test sentence has a higher degree of ambiguity (a larger number of parsing trees were obtained).",
        "Test sentences 20 and 22 in Figures 13 and 14 are good examples.",
        "In any case, these results have shown that the present approaches of direction-selective chart, head-driven parsing, and bidirectional lookahead can, in fact, eliminate many unnecessary searching actions (or active edges) and can make the parsing process much more efficient than conventional left-to-right parsing strategies in parsing Chinese sentences.",
        "On the other hand, in order to show the capabilities of the present parser especially with the raise-bind mechanism to handle the difficult problem of empty categories, parsing results of several typical sentence examples having empty categories are included in APPENDIX D in bracketed text form.",
        "These results show that the raise-bind mechanism, combined with the check rules proposed here, can certainly treat sophisticated syntactic problems of empty categories and movement transformations and simplify the design of grammar rules.",
        "Although the lexicon implemented on the present system is relatively small (including 1,120 words) compared with dictionaries for practical applications (it is estimated that at least 80,000 words are necessary), the capabilities of this system are clearly demonstrated.",
        "It was estimated in the tests that, as a general-purpose system without any special problem domain, about 80% to 85% of the sentences in the high-school textbooks of Taiwan, can be successfully analyzed by this system, provided that all the necessary words are either already in or can be keyed into the lexicon before analysis or parsing is performed.",
        "This estimate was obtained simply because in the tests in fact a total of 241 sentences randomly selected from these textbooks were tested and correct parsing trees were obtained for 200 of them.",

        "Although much more work is still in progress to further improve the present system, this is definitely a very good initial attempt to efficiently process natural sentences of the Chinese language, the structure of which is significantly different from most western languages, such as English.",
        "Although the present system has shown satisfactory initial results, some natural difficulties for the Chinese language still remain, such that significant improvement over the present system is highly desired.",
        "One of the primary difficulties is due to the lack of inflections in Chinese words.",
        "This gives multiple solutions in word category identification and causes exponential growth in the number of structures.",
        "It is, therefore, believed that an integrated syntactic and semantic analysis will eventually become an inevitable solution in the future.",
        "Because verbs are, ultimately, heads of sentences, appropriate classification of verbs may help in determining syntactic structure and, thus in grasping the semantic meaning of sentences.",
        "Although in most linguistic theories verbs are classified according to syntactic properties, and some linguistic theories, such as Lexical Functional Grammar (Sells 1985) and Case Grammar (Fillmore 1968), also provide mechanisms to explicitly represent functional or semantic role assignment of constituents, such work for the Chinese language is still relatively preliminary.",

        "Recently, a new classification scheme for Chinese verbs has been developed (K.-J.",
        "Chen et al.",
        "1988), in which current theories of feature-based categorization are adopted.",
        "This scheme is based on the results of analyzing 16,824 Chinese verbs, with careful consideration given to difficulties in parsing Chinese sentences.",
        "In the next stage of the present study, this verb classification will be employed, and much more syntactic and semantic information will be provided by the lexicon, especially for verbs, and represented as complex feature structures (Gazdar 1988).",
        "Furthermore, several other approaches will also be included in the next stage of the present study, such as the unification concept (Sheiber 1986), and the slot and filler principle (Hell-wing 1988).",
        "In other words, although there is still a very long way to go before a really convenient and efficient natural language processing system for Chinese becomes available in the future, the present system apparently serves as a successful initial step on the way."
