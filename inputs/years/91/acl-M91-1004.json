        "Although not all of the methods of data extraction used by the participants in MUC-3 directly process linguistic phenomena, the methods are dealing with those phenomena in some manner because they are present in the input.",
        "Phenomena testing in MUC-3 is testing according to the characteristics of the messages rather than characteristics of the systems processing those messages.",
        "In order to determine the validity of phenomena testing at the current level of system performance, an experiment was run.",
        "The results of the experiment indicate that linguistic phenomena are isolatable and that performance for linguistic phenomena can be measured using the MUC-3 scoring system."

      "text": [
        "The problem is to devise a test to measure the performance of a data extraction system with respect to a single linguistic phenomenon.",
        "The experiment took several approaches to devising such a test to determine whether the phenomenon had been isolated.",
        "The design of the experiment required the choice of a linguistic phenomenon frequently appearing in the messages and critical to the template fill task.",
        "The slots from phrases exhibiting the phenomenon would be scored and compared to the overall scores.",
        "If there was no correlation with the overall scores, then the possibility that overall scores were fully determining the phenomenon's scores would be eliminated and isolating the phenomenon would be possible.",
        "The slots filled from the sentences were scored and compared to the overall scores as well as the scores obtained for the slots filled from the phrases.",
        "If the scores for the sentences correlated more closely with the scores for the phrases than they did with the overall scores, then it would be more likely that the scoring was isolating the phenomenon.",
        "Processing of the phrase can have an effect on the processing of the entire sentence.",
        "If the results for the phrases and the sentences coincide, then it would be feasible to use scores for slots from entire sentences for future phenomena testing.",
        "Slots from phrases exhibiting well-defined subsets of the phenomenon would be scored and compared to each other.",
        "The results of the comparisons that can be predicted or explained would give us more confidence that we have isolated the phenomenon.",
        "Altered messages would be produced without the phenomenon for purposes of a \"minimal pair\" type test.",
        "The responses would be scored for slots filled from the phrases that formerly constituted the phenomenon.",
        "The scores would be compared to the scores for responses to the original messages containing the phenomenon.",
        "The comparison would provide more information concerning the success of isolating the phenomenon."

        "Apposition was chosen as the linguistic phenomenon because of its frequency of occurrence in messages and its criticalness for slot fills.",
        "An example of an appositive from the test corpus is \"David Lecky, Director of the Columbus School.\" There were approximately 60 sentences in the test corpus containing one or more appositives which were critical to slot fills.",
        "Preliminary phenomena testing for three other phenomena occurring with varying frequencies suggested that a frequency of 20 was adequate for testing purposes.",
        "With more than 60 instances of apposition, subdividing the set for testing well-defined subsets would still leave adequate numbers in the subdivisions.",
        "Also, there many more cases of appositives which affected slot fills, but could not be included in the testing because there were other sources for the slot fills elsewhere in the message.",
        "This high frequency of occurrence of apposition in the messages suggests that it is a phenomenon which systems must handle in some way."

        "The fact that this prediction was correct provides strong support for the claim that apposition is being isolated.",
        "The systems scored lower on their responses to the messages where simple sentences were substituted for appositives.",
        "The effect on the scores, although unexpected, still supports the isolatability of apposition.",
        "In some of the more well-defined trends, the anomalies noticed are often for the lower scoring systems.",
        "However, the systems are scoring highly enough overall at this stage of development for the phenomena scores to be meaningful.",
