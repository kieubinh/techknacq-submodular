        "We report on the GE results from the MUC-3 conference and provide an analysis of system performance.",
        "In general, MUC-3 was a very successful effort for GE.",
        "The NLTooLsET, a suite of natural language text processing tools designed for easy application in new domains, proved its mettle, as we were quickly able to show good results on the MUC-3 task.",
        "Even on TST2, where we experienced some system-level problems, all of our results were in the top group, and the program was especially accurate at filling out templates.",
        "There were, however, some surprises that resulted from MUC-3, including the major differences in system capabilities that are largely hidden in the scores, as well as the relative ease of sentence-level interpretation.",
        "On the positive side, MUC-3 provided a thorough, fair test of system capabilities.",
        "The methodology of testing on a real task, along with the benefit of a common corpus, has produced advances in the field as well as highlighting certain new aspects of text interpretation.",
        "Certain parts of our system, including a lexically-driven preprocessor and knowledge-based language analysis mechanism, worked extremely well, while other issues, such as our lack of an explicit discourse representation, prevented us from doing better.",
        "This recognition of strengths and weaknesses comes directly from the results of the MUC-3 experiment.",
        "On the negative side, too much of each system's score, as well as the work involved in the task, is from applying \"rules of the game\", and future M UCs must try to minimize this component.",
        "Some of these rules are not tied either to text processing capabilities or to the practical requirements of the task.",
        "Another problem is how to determine from the results what a system is actually doing, as some major differences between systems proved largely hidden in the MUC-3 scoring.",
        "In this report, we will attempt to relate the evaluation results to system capabilities as well as to suggest some methods for attributing different aspects of the scores to particular types of processing."

      "text": [
        "Our overall results on TST2 were very good in relation to other systems, but we devoted much of our analysis to explaining why they were much lower than our expectations.",
        "The GE results on TST2 are unusual in that we experienced a considerable drop in performance between TST1 and TST2, in spite of enhancements to our system that showed substantial improvement on our testing prior to TST2.",
        "Part of the drop is attributable to system-level problems introduced directly before the test.",
        "To determine the effect of these problems, we produced a revised run with two one-line changes in the system code.",
        "However, even this revised run shows a significant difference between runs on TST1 and the development corpus and the TST2.",
        "The following table summarizes our results on the second test, TST2, both officially and with the system problems corrected.",
        "In addition to these core results, we ran a number of other tests to put the TST2 runs in the context of our other results.",
        "Figure 2 illustrates how our two runs TST2 (official) and TST2* (revised) compare with the historical system performance on training data.",
        "Data points that share an X coordinate represent runs using the same system configuration on distinct 100-message samples taken from the development corpus.",
        "Although the TST2* (revised) point is clearly more representative of system performance than TST2, we were still surprised by the drop and did some analysis to try to determine its cause.",
        "While we cannot definitively explain why the TST2 points are lower, the lower performance on TST2 does not seem to indicate that our system was overly tuned to the development examples.",
        "To test this, we restored the system from tape to a configuration as close as possible to the TST1 run.",
        "This point, marked on the Figure 2 graph as TST2 in March, is still about 10 points lower in recall than the TST1 run.",
        "In addition, note that the range of recall scores on different sets of 100 texts from the development corpus, shown by unlabeled dots at any fixed time on the graph, is about 20 points, a substantial variation.",
        "Although the much lower performance on TST2 could fall within the normal variation of performance among different message sets, we are still left to explain this variation, which did not seem to hit other systems as hard.",
        "The most likely hypothesis is that our program performed substantially lower on TST2 than on other runs, because the strategy we chose in the final configuration was overly cautious in producing templates, while the answer key had an unusually large number of templates.",
        "This hypothesis is supported by the higher performance of our system in the MATCHED-ONLY row (see Figure 3 below).",
        "The fact that our program produced less than half as many templates as the system with the highest MATCHED/MISSING recall, combined with the fact that the answer key contained more templates than other sets, adds to the evidence that our program paid a \"recall penalty\" for generating fewer templates.",
        "To test this theory, we conducted a number of experiments, two of which involved using different strategies that we had viewed as being suboptimal.",
        "In one test, we eliminated all portions of code that cut out spurious templates, causing the program to generate about twice as many templates per message set, where most of the additional templates were incorrect (because the code had been specifically designed to eliminate incorrect templates, not correct ones).",
        "This change, certainly not one that improved the program, resulted in a 6-point gain in recall on the TST1 set (shown by TST1 ovg in Figure 2) with a 3-point loss in precision.",
        "Then, we tried an experiment by blindly copying every template in our answer key (without changing the program or the answers otherwise).",
        "This resulted in a 6-point gain in recall with a 6-point loss in precision.",
        "Since these extra templates could not possibly be matching correctly (because no two events should be alike), this experiment also shows that generating incorrect templates tends to result in higher recall than not generating enough templates, and suggests that overgenerating more intelligently tends to improve recall more than it hurts precision.",
        "The TST2 set contained far more templates, as well as far more optional templates, than TST1 or the average for 100 messages in the development set.",
        "The development answer key contained, on average, 8 optional templates per 100 messages, while TST1 had 7 and TST2 had 32.",
        "The development answers averaged 83 filled templates per 100 messages, and TST1 and TST2 had 95 and 130, respectively.",
        "Systems that overgenerate at the template level tend to be more impervious to changes in the percentage of OPTIONAL templates because extra templates are more likely to match, perhaps felicitously.",
        "In addition, overgenerating at the template level helps to prevent missing non-optional templates, which have the greatest effect on MATCHED/IVIISSING recall.",
        "Figure 3 gives a concise summary of the number of templates each system generated with respect to their recall in MATCHED/MISSING (M/M REC) and MATCHED-ONLY (M-0 REC).",
        "Our system kept its template overgeneration very low.",
        "In fact, only 3 sites had lower template overgeneration, none of them within 20 recall points.",
        "One system with slightly higher recall produced 148 additional spurious templates.",
        "Note that the systems with lower template overgeneration also tend to get a bigger gain in recall in MATCHED-ONLY.",
        "The results seem to show a surprising variation from one test set to another, as well as an important tradeoff between template overgeneration and recall, especially in the important MATCHED/MISSING column.",
        "In retrospect, we believe that our overall TST2 results would have been closer to the expected performance of our system had we been less cautious about avoiding spurious templates.",
        "On the other hand, it might have been a good idea to measure template overgeneration (as well as the \"accidental\" matching of templates) as part of the results, since these incorrect templates are not a good thing.",
        "In most systems, overgeneration probably came from trying to maximize MATCHED/MISSING recall, so the MUC-3 score reporting didn't suggest that template overgeneration was a real issue.",
        "Probably the test design for MUC-4 should show the relationship between template performance and overall scores more clearly."

        "These many discourse and event-based issues overwhelm the relatively minor problems of parsing and semantic interpretation.",
        "Robustness of linguistic processing for MUC-3 was surprisingly easy to achieve, while the intricacies of template generation were surprisingly difficult to master.",
        "Training Our method of training was to run our system over the messages in the development and TST1 corpus.",
        "We used the results of these runs to detect problems and determine what new capabilities we needed to make these test stories work.",
        "We did not perform any automated training, although we did make heavy use of a keyword-in-context browser and some use of data from a tagged corpus.",
        "As explained above, lexical coverage and parsing did not seem to stand in the way of major performance gains for MUC-3, so we did not focus our efforts in these areas.",
        "Our system improved fairly steadily over time, as the graph shown in Figure 2 illustrates.",

        "This ultimately proved a bit discouraging, as progress from that point on was quite slow, but it is evidence that the NLTooLsET system, designed for easy adaptation to new tasks and domains, does what it is supposed to do.",
        "The most successful portion of our system that was designed for this task was the text reduction mechanism [1].",
        "The NLTooLsET now uses a lexico-semantic pattern matcher as a text pre-preprocessor to reduce the complexity of the sentences passed to the parser.",
        "This allowed us to keep the system running in real time, prevented the parser from dealing with overly complex sentences, and achieved more accurate results.",
        "In addition, the preprocessor allowed a discourse processing module to divide the input text roughly into events prior to parsing, which seemed to have a considerable positive effect on later processing (see the paper on discourse in this volume) The speed of our system, over 1000/words per minute on this task on conventional hardware without any major optimizations, is already way ahead of human performance and suggests that this technology will be able to process large volumes of text.",
        "We were similarly pleased that the sentence-level performance of the NLTooLsET was as good as it was.",
        "While we fixed minor problems with the lexicon, grammar, parser, and semantic interpreter, robustness of linguistic processing did not seem to be a major problem.",
        "In part, this seems to be because the MUC-3 domain is still quite narrow.",
        "It is much broader than MUCK-II, and the linguistic complexity is a challenge, but knowledge base and control issues are relatively minor because there are simply not that many different ways that bombings, murders, and kidnappings occur.",
        "The fact that sentence-level interpretation wasn't a major barrier in MUC-3 has both good and bad implications.",

        "of task ahead of human performance, and make this research pay off in real applications.",
        "Unfortunately, it is unclear whether this new progress will spill over into other domains and applications, or whether it will lead to narrowly-focused development for future MUCs.",
        "The combination of a narrow domain with broad linguistic issues could make non-linguistic solutions more attractive for this sort of task.",
        "The only way to test the degree to which these solutions are reusable is to keep testing system transportability and evaluating performance on new and broader tasks."

        "• When to create a template • What type of template to create • When to merge multiple templates • When to eliminate a template",

        "The stable task also allows MUC to be used as a benchmark for measuring the progress of the field.",
        "On the other hand, keeping the task and domain stable could put new groups (i.e. those not involved in MUC-3) at a disadvantage, and runs the risk of having effort unknowingly devoted to MUC-specific problems.",
        "The alternative, to select new tasks and broader domains for future MUCs, has the benefit of allowing new projects to enter on a roughly equal basis, to check the validity of the MUC-3 task, and to measure transportability across domains.",
        "However, this choice would require additional work of all participants, and would probably require holding the evaluations less frequently.",

        "The GE system performed very well on MUC-3, but our official run on TST2 produced scores substantially lower than our TST1 results, in spite of other tests that showed system improvement over time.",
        "Even in a revised run that fixed system-level problems, our TST2 score was about the same as on TST1.",
        "In trying to explain why the performance was lower than our expectations, we made some interesting observations about the test, including the apparent relationship between template overgeneration and recall.",
        "The result of this analysis is that while the highest scoring systems all produced comparable results in the MATCHED/MISSING row, there are major differences in the way the systems produced the results.",
        "We propose several ways of finding these differences in the score reports, as well as one correction to the test design to reduce some problems with template-level decisions.",
        "Finally, we strongly support the methodology of MUC while warning against repeated, prolonged testing in any single domain."
