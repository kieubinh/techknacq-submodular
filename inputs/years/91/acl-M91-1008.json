        "GTE has actively participated in the Third Annual Message Understanding Conference (MUC-3) sponsored by the Naval Ocean System Center (NOSC) for the past 7 months using its natural language processing system, TIA (Text Interpretation Aid)[5].",
        "During this period, TIA system development consisted of two tasks: (1) lexicon tool development, and (2) tailoring TIA to meet the specific needs of the MUC-3 domain, i.e., terrorism in Latin American countries.",
        "Lexicon tool development facilitates system (lexicon) adaptation to new domains (terrorism, drug interdiction, third world launchings, etc.)",
        "by semi-automating the manual task of entering words/phrases into TIA's lexicons.",
        "Tailoring the existing TIA system to parse and extract MUC-3 domain messages, has allowed GTE to participate in the MUC-3 conference tasks.",
        "The purpose of this paper is to report our techniques and findings during these 7 months of MUC-TIA system development.",
        "Additionally, GTE's official scores for Phase I and Phase II of MUC-3 will be disclosed and discussed.",
        "The remainder of this paper is divided into seven sections describing scoring results, justification and analysis of scores, system development effort, limiting factors, training, reusability of the resultant MUC-TIA system, and final conclusions."

        "However, these results at first glance seemed inconsistent with our Phase I results from NOSC's test set \"tstl-muc3\", shown in Table 2.0, where TIA achieved a recall of 21%2, suggesting that recall decreased after Phase II development.",

        "The problem originally became apparent when several non-terminal syntactic constituents, e.g., regions, organizations, became extremely large and unwieldy.",
        "Since the parser expands non-terminals in a uniform, non-heuristic manner, all applicable grammar rules are fired - even rules which are not viable.",
        "For example, if two rules present in the syntactic grammar are of the form:",
        "Since the string's parse fails at the non-terminal <Region> in the rust <Name-Position> rule (because president cannot be a <Region>), the parse should not be permitted to try parsing using the second option of <NamePosition>.",

        "However, as the number of expansions becomes \"large\", the inefficiency degrades the parser dramatically.",
        "The problem was solved by establishing/marking the set of non-terminals which may contain a large number of expansions, and maintaining failed parse states within the current phrases parse.",
        "If the current phrase being parsed is in a state which has failed at some prior time and the current nonterminal being expanded is \"large\", the system does not try to expand the current nonterminal using the current rule.",
        "This pruning of the search space does not alter the language recognized, i.e., all previously pazsable constructs are still viable and are parsed appropriately.",
        "This solution caused dramatic results during several parses.",
