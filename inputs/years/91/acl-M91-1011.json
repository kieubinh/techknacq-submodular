        "Table 1 summarizes LSI's scores for Phase II of MUC-3.",
        "In evaluating these scores, which place LSI about two/thirds of the way down in a results-ranked list of MUC-3 participants, it should be noted that our MUC-3 system reflects a major redevelopment of the key components of the DBG message understanding system, which is currently in process.",
        "Specifically, innovative development of a parser based on government-binding principles is under way, 2 with associated revisions of the lexicon, functional parse (recovery of the predicate/argument functions representing the underlying semantic structure of the sentence), and DBG template3 generation and frame hierarchy components (the areas indicated by the heavy lines in the system flow chart shown in Figure 1).",
        "This innovative development is described more fully in the system summary paper.",
        "For the purposes of this site report, it is obvious that the \"under construction\" status of the DBG system had considerable impact upon our ability to achieve a respectable score.",
        "Had we chosen instead to go with the fairly robust previous version of the DBG system (described in [2] and [3], recently evaluated for Rome Laboratory by KSC, Inc.), our MUC-3 scores would certainly have been substantially better, because all components of the DBG system would have been fully functional (see the discussion on functionality of the DBG version currently under development below).",
        "However, we felt strongly that the time had come to replace our chart parser with weighted rules by a more powerful and generic model that would provide a better foundation for current work, including automated translation and the integration of speech processing with the DBG system, as well as for the complex MUC-3 messages.",
        "Once the decision was made to embark upon this major redevelopment of the key DBG system components, it would have been unproductive to carry out the MUC-3 development in parallel on the older version of the DBG system (as well as infeasible given LSI's available resources for MUC-3)."

      "text": [
        "For the reasons described above, the bulk of our development effort was concentrated on the parser (approximately 60% of the total MUC-3 development effort) and the lexicon (approximately 30% of the total effort),",
        "since our earlier system of categories and features had to be substantially revised and enhanced to provide all the subcategorization and selection information required by the GB parser.",
        "The remaining 10% of the effort was devoted to the higher level components for semantic and pragmatic interpretation at the sentence and message level (i.e., the functional parse, (DBG) template generation and frames component, and back-end application component for extracting data for filling MUC-3 templates.",
        "Since December, approximately 10,000 new lines of commented Prolog code have been written, and are in the process of being debugged.",
        "The lexicon developed for MUC-3 comprised almost 10,000 entries including inflected forms.",
        "In comparison, the unclassified lexicon for the air activities messages recently completed for Rome Laboratory [3] included only about 1500 entries, and the most recent lexicon for the Army maneuver dialogs is estimated at about 3,000 entries.",
        "The MUC-3 frames component includes 3485 frames and 257 classes of items.",
        "However, much of this information was not exploited properly since, as mentioned above, very little of the MUC-3 development effort could be devoted to the higher level DBG components which utilize frame and slot information."

        "In LSI's case, these included all of the items on the NOSC list of possible limiting factors, i.e., time, people, cpu cycles, and knowledge (interpreted as limitations on system use of available knowledge), as discussed below.",
        "Time/People There were not enough person hours available to LSI under the given resource limitations to carry out the full effort required for MUC-3 in the time allotted, as well as to perform on other in-house contracts.",
        "Although particular sentence types represented in the MUC-3 texts were no more complex than in previous projects such as the air activities work carried out for Rome Laboratory, there was a great deal more variety in the sentence types in the MUC-3 texts, and the time and resources available were substantially less than the 18 months and $225K dedicated to the Rome effort."

      "heading": "Cpu Cycles",
      "text": [
        "The main problem here is that we were essentially developing and debugging a substantial number of lines of new code, requiring detailed tracing facilities to identify and fix bugs.",
        "In addition, a key component for MUC-3 texts is LUX (Lexical Unexpected Inputs) and its associated module WAM (Word Acquisition Module) which deal with items not present in the DBG lexicon, either because they are misspellings of existing entries, or because they are new words.",
        "LUX in particular consumes a lot of cpu cycles, but is absolutely critical for processing of texts containing many words which are unknown to the DBG lexicon.",
        "In order to complete Test 2 in some finite time frame, it was therefore necessary to limit the input to the DBG message understanding system by utilizing some fairly draconian measures.",
        "Discourse analysis of the development corpus revealed that detecting the transitions from descriptions of one event to another in the texts was too complicated to attempt within the limited resources, so all messages labeled as relevant were arbitrarily truncated to 10 sentences.",
        "Since the intent was to exclude all but event reports, which typically describe the event(s) of interest within the 10 sentence segment, it did not appear that much information loss would result from this measure.",
        "No attempt was made to determine the number of MUC-3 templates represented in the truncated text that began at the 11th sentence of all messages in the critical event directory.",
        "(For further discussion, see LSI's section in the paper on discourse processing within the MUC-3 context included in this proceedings.)",
        "The selection of relevant messages, which was performed using Logicon's Message Dissemination System (LMDS), 4 was thus executed to exclude all potentially windy messages such as reports of political speeches, interviews, and clandestine radio broadcasts of political propaganda, as well as military attack events and drug traffic related events not involving terrorist acts.",
        "Critical event and irrelevant message criteria were defined in terms of LMDS profiles and used to filter the test message set into the groups shown in Table 2.",
        "The LMDS",
        "filtering was performed as a preprocessing run which took less than a minute for the total test set of 100 messages.",
        "In Table 2, false positives (in terms of the MUC-3 test key) in the critical event directory and false negatives in the \"nohit\" directory are indicated by Xs.",
        "Table 3 contains numbers of the messages which were partially processed, but produced no template output because processing hung up in the parser.",
        "Per the instructions for running the test procedure, processing was restarted with the next relevant message following these parser failures."

      "text": [
        "The DBG system was fairly well primed with knowledge, as can be seen from the size of the lexicon and the frames data bases cited previously.",
        "However, because the the GB parser was not completely functional (in fact, was still undergoing extensive debugging, as mentioned above), many attachments were not being made, resulting in a large number of partial trees which could not labeled with their thematic roles (i.e., agent, patient, etc.).",
        "The consequences of these attachment failures propagated throughout the remainder of the processing components, resulting in predicate/argument functions unlabeled, unindexed, or missing in the functional parse, so that the DBG templates were extremely sparse, as were the MUC-3 application templates.",
        "Figures 2 and 3 show partial output for Test 2 Message 100, which illustrates this point.",
        "Essentially because of the limited functionality of the GB parser at this stage of development, a great deal of the knowledge represented in the frame hierarchy and associated rules, as well as knowledge represented in the rules for filling the MUC-3 templates, was never exploited by the system."

        "It goes without saying that the development corpus was extremely useful in lexical, syntactic, semantic, and discourse analysis for system development.",
        "We also found the tre-ebank analysis of MUC-3 messages very useful for identifying the multitude of possible variations on a single syntactic theme.",
        "Due to the partially functional status of the evolving GB parser, we were unable to fully exploit the 1300 messages in testing for this phase of MUC-3, but were limited to a few messages that we used for regression testing.",
        "The MUC-3 corpus is a very valuable archive that we intend to utilize more fully in the next few months, as our parser stabilizes and we can take advantage of the variety of texts represented in the MUC-3 collection."

        "Most of the components of the DBG system have been at least revised and extended, and in most cases, completely replaced, as part of our evolutionary design philosophy (see the system summary paper for a discussion).",
        "As noted previously, however, one of the oldest modules in the system is the Lexical Unexpected Inputs (LUX) module, and its associated Word Acquisition Module (WAM).",
        "These modules attempt to determine whether an unexpected lexical input (i.e., one which is not present in the lexicon) is erroneous (e.g., a misspelling of an entry actually present in the lexicon), or entirely new.",
        "In the first case, LUX goes through an elaborate procedure to determine whether a spelling error exists, which is corrected if a reasonable hypothesis for an association with a word in the lexicon can be found (e.g., in test 1, the form \"kidapped\" was corrected to \"kidnapped\").",
        "If no correction can be made, the form is determined to be new, which requires WAM to provide a temporary grammatical category assignment so that the sentence containing the new word can be parsed.",
        "As noted previously, our lexicon included approximately 10,000 words; however, the vocabulary in the MUC-3 development corpus is estimated at 20,000 words (see Hirschman paper in this proceedings).",
        "Clearly, the LUX/WAM components were of inestimable value to us in processing the test sets; it would have been impossible to run without them.",
        "On the other hand, because of the many new words encountered in the MUC-3 texts, LUX and WAM had to be used many times on every message, and because these procedures are non-optimized at present, the amount of time devoted to autonomous LUX/WAM processing was substantial.",
        "Another module that should be rewritten for higher efficiency is LXI, which handles lexical lookup and morphological processing; however, LUX/WAM are first on the list.",
