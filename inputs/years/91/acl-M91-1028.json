        "The PROTEUS system which we have used for MUC-3 has three main components: a syntactic analyzer, a semantic analyzer, and a template generator.",
        "The PROTEUS Syntactic Analyzer was developed starting in the fall of 1984 as a common base for all the applications of the PROTEUS Project.",
        "Many aspects of its design reflect its heritage in the Linguistic String Parser, previously developed and still in use at New York University.",
        "The current system, including the Restriction Language compiler, the lexical analyzer, and the parser proper, comprise approximately 4500 lines of Common Lisp.",
        "The Semantic Analyzer was initially developed in 1987 for the MUCK-I (RAINFORMs) application, extended for the MUCK-II (OPREPs) application, and further revised for the current evaluation.",
        "It currently consists of about 3000 lines of Common Lisp (excluding the domain-specific information).",
        "The Template Generator was written from scratch for the MUC-3 task; it is about 1200 lines of Common Lisp.."

        "In addition, some restructuring of the logical form is performed both after semantic analysis and after reference resolution (only the restructuring after reference resolution is shown in Figure 1).",
        "Processing is basically sequential: each sentence goes through lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis and reference resolution; the logical form for the entire message is then fed to template generation.",
        "However, semantic (selectional) checking is performed during syntactic analysis, employing essentially the same code later used for semantic analysis.",
        "Each of these stages is described in a section which follows."

        "We have written programs which take the SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) version of the dictionary, extract information on inflections, parts of speech, and verb subcategorization (including information on adverbial particles and prepositions gleaned from the examples), and generate the LISP-ified form shown above.",
        "This is supplemented by a manually-coded dictionary (about 500 lines) for closed-class words and a few very common words.",
        "For MUC-3 we used several additional dictionaries.",
        "There was a dictionary (about 800 lines) for English words not defined in the OALD, or not adequately defined or too richly defined there.",
        "In addition, we extracted from the text and templates lists of organizations, locations, and proper names, and prepared small dictionaries for each (about 2000 lines total)."

        "The text reader splits the input text into tokens and then attempts to assign to each token (or sequence of tokens, in the case of an idiom) a definition (part of speech and syntactic attributes).",
        "The matching process proceeds in four steps: dictionary lookup, lexical pattern matching, spelling correction, and prefix stripping.",
        "Dictionary lookup immediately retrieves definitions assigned by any of the dictionaries (including inflected forms), while lexical pattern matching is used to identify a variety of specialized patterns, such as numbers, dates, times, and possessive forms.",
        "If neither dictionary lookup nor lexical pattern matching is successful, spelling correction and prefix stripping are attempted.",
        "Based on an analysis of the errors we found, we have used for MUC-3 a rather conservative spelling corrector, which identifies an input token as a misspelled form of a dictionary entry only if one of the two has a single instance of a letter while the other has a doubled instance of the letter (e.g., \"mispelled\" and \"misspelled\").1 The prefix stripper attempts to identify the token as a combination of a prefix and a word defined in the dictionary.",
        "We currently use a list of 17 prefixes, including standard English ones like \"un\" and MUC-3 specials like \"narco-\".",
        "If all of these procedures fail, the word is tagged as a proper noun (name), since we found that most of our remaining undefined words were names."

        "This filtering is done after lexical analysis because the lexical analysis has identified the root form of all inflected words; these root forms provide links into the semantic hierarchy.",
        "The filtering can therefore be specified in terms of a small number of word classes, one of which must be present for the sentence to be worth processing."

        "If a restriction fails, that edge is not added to the chart.",
        "When certain levels of the tree are complete (those producing noun phrase and clause structures), the regularization rules are invoked to compute a regularized structure for the partial parse, and selection is invoked to verify the semantic well-formedness of the structure (as noted earlier, selection uses the same \"semantic analysis\" code subsequently employed to translate the tree into logical form).",
