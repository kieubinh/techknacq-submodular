        "The data extraction systems studied in the MUC-3 evaluation perform a variety of subtasks in filling out templates.",
        "Some of these tasks are quite complex, and seem to require a system to represent the structure of a text in some detail to perform the task successfully.",
        "Capturing reference relations between slot fillers, distinguishing between historic and recent events, and many other subtasks appear to have this character.",
        "Other of the MUC-3 subtasks, however, appear amenable to simpler techniques.",
        "In particular, whenever a slot filling task involves making choices among a relatively small set of prespecified alternatives, the potential exists for modeling this task as text categorization [10].",
        "Text categorization systems treat a document as a single unit, and make a decision to assign each document to zero, one or more of a fixed set of categories.",
        "Text categorization techniques have played a role in previous text extraction systems, both for screening out documents which it is not desirable to process, and for directing documents to category-specific extraction routines [2, 9, 15].",
        "The role of categorization in these systems was relatively limited, however.",
        "Analyses of the behavior of these systems have given relatively little attention to how categorization operated or to what factors influenced categorization performance.",
        "Nor had performing data extraction solely by categorization techniques seen much attention before MUC-3.",
        "The study reported here is an initial exploration of the issues involved in using categorization as part of the extraction process.",
        "As such it has two main goals.",
        "One goal is provide a measure of the difficulty of the extraction task being performed by the MUC-3 systems.",
        "By evaluating the degree to which various text to template mappings can be captured statistically as word to filler mappings, we gain a sense of where the linguistic and domain knowledge embedded in the NLP systems is having the most effect.",
        "A second goal is to identify aspects of the extraction task that categorization might plausibly aid, or even take primary responsibility for.",
        "With respect to this second goal, this paper provides an additional data point to be considered along with the results of several official MUC-3 sites which made greater or lesser use of categorization techniques.",
        "In order to most clearly discover what characteristics of the extraction task impact categorization, we ran an experiment using an \"off-the-shelf\" categorization system, with access to no additional language processing capability or knowledge base.",
        "The technique investigated was a well-understood, domain independent statistical procedure.",
        "It should be pointed out that the method used is only one of a variety of methods, some quite knowledge intensive, that have been used in previous work on text categorization [12].",
        "The results presented here are not official MUC-3 results, and should be considered tentative.",
        "This paper is only a small step toward an understanding of the role of categorization methods in data extraction.",
        "For a data extraction task to be viewed as text categorization, it must involve choosing among a finite, preferably small, set of categories that a document might be assigned to.",
        "We therefore need to consider which MUC-3 subtasks might fit this description.",
        "The MUC-3 task can be broken into two main parts: deciding how many templates should be generated for a document, and filling the slots within the generated templates.",
        "Deciding the number of templates could conceivably be modeled as categorization, given some upper bound on the number of allowed templates.",
        "(A more profitable view, if one wanted to use machine learning techniques for this subtask, might be to use multiple regression or some similar technique.)",
        "We chose not to address this task directly, though indirectly it is dealt with by the rules we use to generate templates from a binary categorization.",
        "Many of the slot filling tasks also could not be modeled as classifying a document with respect to a fixed set of categories.",
        "For instance, all slot filling tasks that involve extracting strings from the text allow a range of answers that cannot be defined in advance.",
        "One might force string filling into a categorization mode by viewing the task as one of deciding, for each substring in a document, whether that substring falls into the class of fillers of a particular slot.",
        "In this paper, however, we chose to consider only the classification of entire document texts into categories.",
        "The slots that appeared most amenable to categorization techniques were the set fill slots.",
        "The following slots were considered to be set fill slots in the MUC-3 documentation:"

        "An information theoretic method of choosing words to predict slot/filler pairs was shown to achieve reasonable results, and studying the output of this method raised some interesting questions about the composition of the MUC-3 corpus.",
        "The Maxcat categorization software used was the result of about 6 months of programming effort.",
        "However, applying Maxcat to the MUC-3 task required only about a week's effort on the author's part, plus an additional two weeks' effort by a staff programmer to write the software for mapping MUC-3 texts and templates into and out of the format used by Maxcat.",
        "This suggests that categorization techniques may be of practical use in situations where an extraction system for set fill slots must be brought into operation in a short period of time.",
