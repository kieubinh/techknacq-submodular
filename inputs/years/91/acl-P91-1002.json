        "Our focus in this paper is a stripped-down monotonic inheritance-based knowledge representation system which can be applied directly to provide a clean declarative semantics for Halliday's systemic choice systems (see Winograd 1983, Mel-lish 1988, Kress 1976) and the inheritance module of head-driven phrase-structure grammar (HPSG) (Pollard and Sag 1987, Pollard in press).",
        "Our inheritance networks are constructed from only the most rudimentary primitives: basic concepts and ISA and ISNOTA links.",
        "By applying general algebraic techniques, we show how to generate a meet semilattice whose nodes correspond to consistent conjunctions of basic concepts and where meet corresponds to conjunction.",
        "We also show how to embed this result in a distributive lattice where the elements correspond to arbitrary conjunctions and disjunctions of basic concepts and where meet and join correspond to conjunction and disjunction, respectively.",
        "While we do not consider either role or attribute-based reasoning in this paper, our constructions are directly applicable as a front-end for the combined attribute-and concept-based formalisms of Ait-Kaci (1986), Nebel and Smolka (1989), Carpenter (1990), Carpenter, Pollard and Franz (1991) and Pollard (in press).",
        "The fact that terms in distributive lattices have disjunctive normal forms allows us to factor our construction into two stages: we begin with the consistent conjunctive concepts generated from our primitive concepts and then form arbitrary disjunctions of these conjunctions.",
        "The conjunctive construction is useful on its own as its result is a semilattice where meet corresponds to conjunction.",
        "In particular, the conjunctive semilattice is ideally suited to conjunctive logics such as those employed for unification, as in HPSG.",
        "We will consider the distinction between primitive and defined concepts, a well-known distinction expressible in terminological reasoning systems such as KL-ONE (Brachman 1979, Brachman and Schmolze 1985), and its descendants (such as LOOM (MacGregor 1988) or CLASSIC (Borgida et al.",
        "1989)).",
        "We also tackle the variety of closed-world reasoning that is necessary for modeling constraint-based grammars such as HPSG.",
        "A similar form of closed-world reasoning is supported by LOOM with the disjoint-covering construction.",
        "One of the benefits of our notion of inheritance is that it allows us to express the natural semantics of both systemic choice systems and HPSG inheritance hierarchies using basic concepts and ISA and ISNOTA links.",
        "In particular, we will see how choice systems correspond to ISNOTA reasoning, multiple choices can be captured in our conjunctive construction and how dependent choices can",
        "be represented by inheritance.",
        "One result of our construction will be a demonstration that the systemic classification and HPSG systems are variant graphical representations of the same kind of underlying information regarding inclusion, disjointness and choice."
