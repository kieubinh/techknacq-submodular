        "The computational linguistics literature includes a wide variety of ideas about how to represent events in as much detail as is required for reasoning about their implications.",
        "Less has been written about how to use information in text to incrementally build those event representations as discourse progresses, especially when the identification of event participants and other details is dispersed across a number of structures.",
        "We will be concerned here with providing a representational framework for this incremental event-building, and with using that representation to examine the ways in which reference to the internal structure of events contributes to discourse cohesion.",
        "That is, we will be interested both in the process of gleaning fully-specified event descriptions from continuous text, and in showing how individual elements of an event's internal structure can behave anaphorically.",
        "Examples of the kinds of linkages that must be dealt with in building representations of events from text follow:",
        "b) Mary thought that an argument with herself would be entertaining.",
        "c) Mary thought that a conference with himself would make John look silly.",
        "The examples in (1) are familiar cases of syntactically obligatory control; we will consider their behavior to be straightforwardly and locally resolved.",
        "The sentences of (2) show infinitival relatives, purpose, and 'in-order-to' clauses in which control of the infinitive (and hence of its implicit subject) is sometimes clear, sometimes ambiguous.",
        "In (3), a subject infinitival phrase receives an unavoidably generic reading in one case and a non-generic but ambiguous reading in the other.",
        "Finally, the examples of (4) indicate that nominalizations of events also have roles whose reference must be determined, and whose existence and identity has consequences for subsequent discourse.",
        "Aside from the sentences in (1), in which control is unambiguously sorted out within the sentence on the basis of verb type, all the examples above can",
        "be paraphrased with equivalent multi-sentence constructions in which the facts of referent-assignment are identical.",
        "Even more extended discourses, including dialogues such as that in (5), show the influence of an instantiated situation or event over the assignment of referents to entities introduced later in the discourse.",
        "5) A: John has been hobbling around for two weeks with a sprained ankle.",
        "B: So what did the nurse say yesterday?",
        "A: She said that it would not be smart to run so soon after injuring himself.",
        "(adapted from Nishigauchi's 48, cited as a modification of Chao's 28) The distribution of event participants across multi-sentence discourses is sufficient to lay to rest any idea that the linkage is syntactically governed, even though the entities which provide cohesion in these examples are arguments which are typically bound syntactically.",
        "That is, it seems that initially unfilled thematic roles play a part in tying one sentence to the next.",
        "Event roles left unfilled after the operation of local syntactic processing are apparently still 'active', in some sense, and they appear to be able to attract participants from external structures to fill them.",
        "Carlson and Tanenhaus (1988) provide psycholinguistic evidence that this is indeed the case; open thematic roles do appear to be effective as cohesion devices.'",
        "Previous theories about how open roles become filled (mostly intra-sententially) have been based on notions ranging from strictly syntactic to more pragmatic, knowledge-based approaches.",
        "Obviously wherever we do have what appears to be invariant and obligatory control, we want to exploit a syntactic explanation.",
        "However, these cases 'Whether it is just thematic roles, or those plus certain types of highly predictable adjuncts, or a wide variety of other types of slots which can provide the type of linking we are talking about is still an open question.",
        "We do assume that for each event we will encode not only THAT it expects certain arguments to be filled, but HOW it expects them to be filled; for instance it should be perceived that the noun 'salesman' is a highly suitable Agent for a sale event.",
        "We may need to know about more than that.",
        "In particular, we may require metonymical devices that make discourses like the following possible.",
        "I had a hard time shopping.",
        "First, the parking lot was all full....",
        "Coherence in this example clearly depends on being able to associate 'the parking lot' with 'store' and 'store' with the Location of the 'shopping' event.",
        "This extension is no different in kind, however, from the core of what we are proposing here.",
        "do not account for much of the ground that we need to cover.",
        "As the examples above show, even the syntactic position PRO often defies straightforward control assignment, and in the case of nominal references to events, Williams' (1985) arguments against a strictly syntactic account of referent-assignment are convincing.",
        "Of course, there are no syntactic means for linking arguments with event descriptions intersententially.",
        "Appeals to underlying thematic role notions and/or more pragmatically governed operators then seem to hold more promise for the kinds of situations we are describing.",
        "Given their currency above and below the sentence level, and the fact that they seem to be sensitive to both syntactic and pragmatic constraints, the behavior of unfilled event roles will best be explained at the discourse level.",
        "Like other discourse anaphoric elements, open roles can not only receive their reference from distant structures, but they also seem to be used productively to create links between linguistic structures and to extend focus in both forward and backward directions.",
        "To machine-build representations of events whose essential components are dispersed across multiple structures, two key ingredients are necessary.",
        "First, the system must have knowledge about events and their expected participants and other characteristics.",
        "Given this, one can make predictions about the expectancy of arguments and the underlying properties they should hold.",
        "The second ingredient required is a means for assessing the mutual accessibility of discourse entities.",
        "As has been pointed out by various researchers, sentential structure, thematic relationships, and discourse configurations all may play a part in determining which entities must, might, and cannot be associated with others, and a discourse framework must make it possible to take all these factors into account in assigning reference and building representations of events.",
        "Our intent in this paper is to provide a prototype model of event building which is effective across clauses, both intra and inter-sententially.",
        "We will incorporate into this representation of events a means for assessing accessibility of events and event participants for anaphoric reference, and we will use the representation to examine the anaphoric behavior of open roles.",
        "Event-Building Representation: We have",
        "chosen DRT as an overall representation scheme, though we will be modifying it to some extent.",
        "DRT has been designed to perform a variety of",
        "tasks, including proper placement of individual events in an overall discourse representation and making it possible to indicate which event entities are available for future anaphoric referencing and what constraints hold over those entities.",
        "A typical DR for a simple sentence is given in (6).",
        "The sentence, 'John gave Bill a dollar' is designated by the variable El and has associated with it a predicate calculus statement that contains the predicate, give, and argument variables VI, V2, and V3.",
        "The give event specification and other constraints, again in predicate calculus form, are contained in the lower portion of the DR.",
        "In the top half of the DR, any entities, including events, which are available for subsequent anaphoric referencing are listed by their variable names.",
        "Our representation departs in some ways from the way in which the binding of anaphors is usually shown in DRT.",
        "In versions of DRT with re-altime processing, whenever an NP is being processed, two things can happen: i) either the NP can be linked with a previously occurring NP and become anaphorically bound to it, or ii) a new referent can be generated for the NP and posted when no antecedent can be found.",
        "For our purposes, it is convenient to include in the DR an extra tier which contains items which have not yet found a referent.2 To designate the three parts of our DRs, we will use the following tier labels:",
        "For processing purposes, we will not attempt to immediately bind anaphors as they are encountered in sentences, beyond what we can get for free from syntactic analysis.",
        "Rather, we will initiate a two-stage process, with the first DR having unbound anaphors and the second attempting representation of binding.",
        "In the first representation, we will 2 A buffer of this sort may be implicit in other treatments of anaphora resolution; our extension is just to add it explicitly to the DR representation.",
        "Without some such buffer it is not clear how one would handle sentences like 'When he was a kid, John was pretty goofy.'",
        "post unbound anaphors in UR.",
        "We will also post constraints for unbound items within CR to reflect their type, e.g. (PRO XI), (DEFINITE X2), and (HE X3).",
        "When items in UR become bound (or when their referents are found), their bindings will be represented in AR, they will be crossed off from within UR, and a new DR will be created to reflect the change in status.",
        "We will also revise the representation of event descriptions in CR, by including in them implicit arguments for each event as well as ones which are explicitly realized in the sentence.",
        "Every event will have its underlying thematic and highly expected adjunctive roles posted in CR, whether the roles have been filled or not.",
        "These unfilled or implicit roles are posted as entities requiring binding, in UR.",
        "The constraint (IMPLICIT X) will be included for any open role, and for each event variable we will note in CR whether it was a verbal or other-than-verbal description.",
        "Example (7) contains an instance of what we intend.",
        "The nominalized form of an investigate event, marked with El, has two open slots: Agent and Theme, VI and V2, respectively.",
        "El is posted as a possible referent in AR; its two implicit arguments VI and V2 are posted in UR.",
        "Similarly, E2, the launch event is posted in AR, while its open agent role, designated by V3, is shown in UR; its explicit Theme is already posted in AR as El.",

        "7.",
        "A DR of the sentence An investigation was launched.",
        "We will show that because of the inclusion of open roles in the representation of events and on the UR tier, this framework for discourse representation makes it possible to link arguments that appear in a variety of structures to their respective events, and thus provides more predictive power for anaphoric resolution processes."

        "We treat the binding of the PRO subject of embedded infinitive as a case of open role filling, and for our purposes, such binding is fundamentally the same in both obligatory and non-obligatory environments, since in every case the result is that open event roles are filled by arguments from external sources.",
        "That is, even where control is generated entirely within syntax, the links are construed as being the result of a cross-clause event-building process.",
        "The operational difference is just that wherever control CAN be reliably determined syntactically, as in the case of obligatory control verbs, indices between controllers and PROs will be in place when initial DRs are generated.3 A typical DR with a controller-controllee relationship would appear as in (8).",
        "In the event-building examples that we show in the remainder of the paper, the aim is the construction of DRs that ultimately link events and arguments in this same way.",

        "In Nishigauchi's account, control of infinitival purpose clauses and infinitival relative clauses is primarily dependent on the presence of one of three thematic roles from his so-called Primary Location hierarchy; the idea is that a controller can be assigned if a Goal, Location, or Source is present in the sentence.",
        "Where a Goal is present, its refer3 Dowty and Ladusaw (1988) believe that control is generally established via pragmatic means.",
        "They claim that it is pragmatic knowledge of events that enables one to generate links between participants and events.",

        "The examples in (9) are indicative of the kinds of links that can be made via this hierarchy.",

        "To handle examples like (9a-c), we begin with initial DRs that include the kind of information that can be expected from a syntactic/semantic parser that produces initial logical forms.",
