        "This paper presents a tripartite model of dialogue in which intentions are modeled on three levels: the domain level (with domain goals such as traveling by train), the problem-solving level (with plan-construction goals such as instantiating a parameter in a plan), and the discourse level (with communicative goals such as expressing surprise).",
        "Our process model has three major advantages over previous approaches: 1) it provides a better representation of user intentions than previous models and allows the nuances of different kinds of goals and processing to be captured at each level; 2) it enables the incremental recognition of communicative goals that cannot be recognized from a single utterance alone; and 3) it differentiates between il-locutionary effects and desired perlocutionary effects, and thus can account for the failure of an inform act to change a hearer's beliefs[Per9OP."

        "A number of researchers have contended that a coherent discourse consists of segments that are related to one another through some type of structuring relation[Gri75, MT831 or have used rhetorical relations to generate coherent text[11ov88, MP90).",
        "hi addition, some researchers",
        "have modeled discourse based on the semantic relationship of individual dauses[Polna] or groups of clauses[Rei78].",
        "But all of the above fail to capture the goal-oriented nature of discourse.",
        "Grosz and Sidner[GS86] argue that recognizing the structural relationships among the intentions underlying a discourse is necessary to identify discourse structure, but they do not provide the details of a computational mechanism for recognizing these relationships.",
        "To account for the goal-oriented nature of discourse, many researchers have adopted the planning/plan-recognition paradigm[AP80, PASO] in which utterances are viewed as part of a plan for accomplishing a goal and understanding consists of recognizing this plan.",
        "The most well-developed plan-based model of discourse is that of Litman and Allen[LA87j.",
        "However, their discourse plans conflate problem-solving actions and communicative actions.",
        "For example, their Correct-Plan has the flavor of a problem-solving plan that one would pursue in attempting to construct another plan, whereas their Identify-Parameter takes on some of the characteristics of a communicative plan that one would pursue when conveying information.",
        "More significantly, their model cannot capture the relationship among several utterances that are all part of the same higher-level discourse plan if that plan cannot be recognized and added to their plan stack based on analysis of the first utterance alone.",
        "Thus, if more than one utterance is necessary to recognize a discourse goal (as is often the case, for example, with warnings), Litman and Allen's model will not be able to identify the discourse goal pursued by the two utterances together or what role the first utterance plays with respect to the second.",
        "Consider, for example, the following pair of utterances:",
        "(1) The city of xxx is considering filing for bankruptcy.",
        "(2) One of your mutual funds owns xxx bonds.",
        "Although neither of the two utterances alone constitutes a warning, a natural language system must be able to recognize the warning from the set of two utterances together.",
        "Our tripartite model of dialogue overcomes these limitations.",
        "It differentiates among domain, problem-solving, and communicative actions yet models the relationships among them, and enables",
        "the recognition of communicative actions that take more than one utterance to achieve but which cannot be recognized from the first utterance alone.",
        "In the remainder of this paper, we will present our tripartite model, motivating why our model recognizes three different kinds of goals, describing our dialogue model and how it is built incrementally as a discourse proceeds, and illustrating this plan inference process with a sample dialogue.",
        "Finally, we will outline our current research on modeling negotiation dialogues and recognizing discourse acts such as expressing surprise."

        "For example, if an agent has a goal of earning an undergraduate degree, the agent might have the problem-solving goal of selecting the instantiation of the degree parameter as BA or BS and then the problem-solving goal of building a sub-plan for satisfying the requirements for that degree.",
        "A number of researchers have demonstrated the importance of modeling domain and problem-solving goals[PA80, Wil81, LA87, vBC86, Car87, Ram89].",
        "Intuitively, a discourse goal is the communicative goal that a speaker has in making an utterance[Car89], such as obtaining information or expressing surprise.",
        "Recognition of discourse goals provides expectations for subsequent utterances and suggests how these utterances should be interpreted.",
        "For example, the first two utterances in the following exchange establish the expectation that Si will either accept S2's response, or that Si will pursue utterances directed toward understanding and accepting it[Car89].",
        "Consequently, Sl's second utterance should be recognized as expressing surprise at S2's statement.",
        "A robust natural language system must recognize discourse goals and the beliefs underlying them in order to respond appropriately.",
        "The plan library for our process model contains the system's knowledge of goals, actions, and plans.",
        "Although domain plans are not mutually known by the participants[Po18613], how to communicate and how to solve problems are common skills that people use in a wide variety of contexts, so the system can assume that knowledge about discourse and problem-solving plans is shared knowledge.",
        "Our representation of a plan includes a header giving the name of the plan and the action it accomplishes, preconditions, applicability conditions, constraints, a body, effects, and goals.",
        "Applicability conditions represent conditions that must be satisfied for the plan to be reasonable to pursue in the given situation whereas constraints limit the allowable instantiation of variables in each of the components of a plan[LA87, Car87].",
        "Especially in the case of discourse plans, the goals and effects are likely to be different.",
        "This allows us to differentiate between illocutionary and perlocutionary effects and capture the notion that one can, for example, perform an inform act without the hearer adopting the communicated proposition.3 Figure 1 presents three discourse plans and one problem-solving and domain plan."

        "Thus, actions at the discourse level form a tree structure in which each node represents a communicative action that a participant is performing and the children of a node represent communicative actions pursued in order to perform the parent action.",

        "This is because the agents are most expected to continue with the problem-solving and domain plans on which their attention is currently centered.",
        "In addition, since actions at the discourse and problem-solving levels are currently being executed, they cannot be returned to (although a similar action can be initiated anew and entered into the model).",

        "In addition, it provides a more finely differentiated representation of user intentions than previous models, allows the nuances of different kinds of processing (such as different focusing expectations and information retention) to be captured at each level, and accounts for implicit acceptance of a communicated proposition.",
        "Our current work involves using this model to handle negotiation dialogues in which a hearer does not automatically accept as valid the proposition communicated by an inform action."
