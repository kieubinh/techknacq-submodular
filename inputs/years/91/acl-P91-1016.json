        "The combination of even an efficient parser with such intricate grammars may greatly increase the computational complexity of the system [Tomita 1985].",
        "It is extremely difficult to write such grammars and they must frequently be revised to maintain internal consistency when applied to new texts.",

        "We interpret this to mean that we need only enough context patterns to distinguish the different operations associated with binary combinations of the top two stack elements; since there are fewer than an average of two, it appears reasonable to expect that the context-sensitive portion of the grammar will not be excessively large.",
