        "The Lo language learning project at the International Computer Science Institute [Feldman et al., 1990; Weber and Stolcke, 1990] seeks to provide an account of language acquisition in the semantic domain of spatial relations between geometrical objects.",
        "Within this domain, the work reported here addresses the subtask of learning to associate scenes, containing several simple objects, with terms to describe the spatial relations among the objects in the scenes.",
        "This is illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "For each scene, the learning system is supplied with an indication of which object is the reference object (we call this object the landmark, or LM), and which object is the one being located relative to the reference object (this is the trajector, or TR).",
        "The system is also supplied with a single spatial term that describes the spatial relation *Supported through the International Computer Science Institute.",
        "portrayed in the scene.",
        "It is to learn to associate all applicable terms to novel scenes.",
        "The TR is restricted to be a single point for the time being; current work is directed at addressing the more general case of an arbitrarily shaped TR.",
        "Another aspect of the task is that learning must take place in the absence of explicit negative instances.",
        "This condition is imposed so that the conditions under which learning takes place will be similar in this respect to those under which children learn.",
        "Given this, there are two central problems in the subtask as stated:",
        "• Ensuring that the learning will generalize to scenes which were not a part of the training set.",
        "This means that the region in which a TR will be considered \"above\" a LM may have to change size, shape, and position when a novel LM is presented.",
        "• Learning without explicit negative evidence.",
        "This paper presents solutions to both of these problems.",
        "It begins with a general discussion of each of the two problems and their solutions.",
        "Results of training are then presented.",
        "Then, implementation details are discussed.",

        "The task at hand is very similar to this problem, since learning when \"above\" is an appropriate description of the spatial relation between a LM and a point TR really amounts to learning what the extent of the region \"above\" a LM is.",

        "The complete LM specification includes a bitmap of the interior of the LM, the \"LM interior map\".",

        "This bitmap representation helps in the case mentioned above, since although the triangle and square will have identical key points, their LM interior maps will differ.",
        "In particular, since part of the learned \"definition\" of a point being above a LM should be that it may not be in the interior of the LM, that would account for the difference in shape of the regions located above the square and above the triangle.",

        "Given the landmark (labeled \"LM\"), the task is to learn the concept \"above\".",
        "We have been given four positive instances, marked as small dotted circles in the figure, and no negative instances.",

        "One solution to the \"no negative evidence\" problem which suggests itself is to take every positive instance for one concept to be an implicit negative instance for all other spatial concepts being learned.",

        "The method being suggested really amounts to a principle of mutual exclusivity for spatial relation terms: since each spatial relation can only have one name, we take a positive instance of one to be an implicit negative instance for all others.",
        "In a related vein, [Johnston and Slobin, 1979] note that in a study of children learning locative terms in English, Italian, Serbo-Croatian, and Turkish, terms were learned more quickly when there was little or no synonymy among terms.",
        "They point out that children seem to prefer a one-to-one meaning-to-morpheme mapping; this is similar to, although not quite the same as, the mutual exclusivity notion put forth here.'",
        "In linguistics, the notion that the meaning of a given word is partly defined by the meanings of other words in the language is a central idea of structuralism.",
        "This has been recently reiterated by [MacWhinney, 1989]: \"the semantic range of words is determined by the particular contrasts in which they are involved\".",
        "This is consonant with the view taken here, in that contrasting words will serve as implicit negative instances to help define the boundaries of applicability of a given spatial term.",
        "There is a problem with mutual exclusivity, however.",
        "Using it as a method for generating implicit negative instances can yield many false negatives in the training set, i.e. implicit negatives which really should be positives.",
