        "Word associations have been studied for some time in the fields of psycholinguistics (by testing human subjects on words), linguistics (where meaning is often based on how words co-occur with each other), and more recently, by researchers in natural language processing (Church and Hanks, 1990; Hindle and Rooth, 1990; Dagan, 1990; McDonald et al., 1990; Wilks et al., 1990) using statistical measures to identify sets of associated words for use in various natural language processing tasks.",
        "One of the tasks where the statistical data on associated words has been used with some success is lexical disambiguation.",
        "However, associated word sets gathered",
        "from a general cotpus may contain words that are associated with many different senses.",
        "For example, vocabulary associated with the word \"bank\" includes \"money\", \"rob\", \"river\" and \"sand\".",

        "Assume that we know of only two of the classic senses of the word bank:",
        "We can expect the \"money\" sense of bank to co-occur frequently with such words",

        "There are certain drawbacks in using LDOCE to construct the subject-dependent neighborhoods, however the amount of text in LDOCE about any one subject area is rather limited, is comprised of a control vocabulary for dictionary definitions only, and uses sample sentences which were concocted with non-native English speakers in mind.",
