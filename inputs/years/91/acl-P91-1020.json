        "This paper presents an analysis of the differences in the uses of locative prepositions in two languages, and then describes an automatic system of translation that is based on this analysis.",
        "Our research originated from the observation that even between two closely related languages such as English and French, locative prepositions of even simple sentences do not seem to be translated from one language to the other in a clearly systematic and coherent way.",
        "However, the translation becomes more coherent if we introduce Herskovits' idea of the ideal meaning of a preposition (Herskovits 1986) and Lakoff's idea of Idealized Cognitive Models (ICM's) (Lakoff 1987).",
        "A central part of our research was to design entities based The research described in this paper was conducted at the University of Toronto.",
        "on Lakoff's IOM's. We call these entities conceptual representations of objects.",
        "The main thesis of this paper is that, even though the ideal meanings of the locative prepositions we studied are the same in English and in French, these two languages do not always conceptualize the objects involved in a scene in the same way and that this leads to differences in the translation of locative prepositions.",
        "This theory seems suitable to pairs of languages other than English and French, as well.",
        "In addition, we will also describe how the system detects abnormalities and ambiguities using knowledge required for the translation task.",
        "This paper is organized as follows: section 2 presents an analysis of and a solution to the problem of translating locative prepositions from English into French, section 3 presents the conceptual representations of objects, section 4 presents the algorithm we designed and implemented for translating locative prepositions, section 5 discusses the detection of abnormalities and ambiguities, and section 6 is the conclusion."

        "His theory is based on Lakoff tz Johnson (1980) and Lakoff (1987) and uses the notion of conceptualizations of objects.",
        "A conceptualization is a mental representation of an object or an idea which takes into consideration not only the \"objective truth\" about that object or idea, but also human biological perception and experience.",
        "In his theory, Grimaud suggests that the cases in which the correspondences described in section 2.1 do not hold are not simply exceptional but rather are due to differences in the ways that English and French conceptualize the objects involved in the relation.",
        "The reason why the same object can be conceptualized as different geometrical objects in different languages, given a particular situation, is that objects have several properties (or aspects) and different languages might not choose to highlight and hide the same properties (or aspects) of a given object in a given situation.",
        "This happens in (6), for example (under the interpretation in which the professor is riding the bus rather than being located on the roof of the bus) – English conceptualizes the bus as a surface that can support entities, by highlighting only its bottom platform, while French conceptualizes the bus as a",

      "text": [
        "The difference between simple and complex conceptual ambiguity is the following: in the former, the French sentence carries the same ambiguity as the English sentence, but in the latter, the ambiguity is not carried through the translation (so the English sentence has two different French translations).",
        "Complex conceptual ambiguity is present in (6), which is repeated here as sentence (15):",
        "(15) Our professor is on the bus.",
        "As discussed earlier, this sentence is ambiguous in that the professor could be riding the bus, or he could be located on the roof of the bus.",
        "This sentence is translated into two French sentences, one for each case: 6",
        "(16) Notre professeur eat dans le bus.",
        "(17) Notre professeur eat stir le bus.",
        "In (16), the professor is riding the bus, while in (17), he is located on the roof of the bus.",
        "This type of ambiguity is detected in the same way as simple conceptual ambiguity, the only difference being that in the complex case, all the French conceptual representations do not have the same descriptive parts."

      "text": [
        "In this paper, we have described a system of translation for locative prepositions that uses Herskovits' idea of the ideal meaning of prepositions and Lakoff's idea of ICM's. While our work does not prove the linguistic and psychological theories on which it is based, it suggests that they can be useful in machine translation.",
        "We chose to use conceptual knowledge to deal with the translation of locative prepositions, first, because it provides an elegant solution to the problem, and second, because we believe that conceptual knowledge of the sort that we use could be useful in other cognitive tasks such as story understanding, vision, and robot planning"
