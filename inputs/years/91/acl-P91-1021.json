        "In this paper we describe a translation project whose aim is to build an experimental Bilingual Conversation Interpreter (BCI) which will allow communication through typed text between two monolingual humans using different languages (cf Miike et al., 1988).",
        "The choice of languages for the prototype system is English and Swedish.",
        "Input sentences are analysed by the Core Language Engine (CLE1) as far as the level of Quasi Logical Form (QLF; Alshawi, 1990), and then, instead of further ambiguity resolution, undergo transfer into another QLF having constants and predicates corresponding to word senses in the other language.",
        "The transfer rules used in this process correspond to a certain kind of meaning postulate.",
        "The CLE then generates an output sentence from the target",
        "language QLF, using the same linguistic data as is used for analysis of that language.",
        "QLFs were selected as the appropriate level for transfer because they are far enough removed from surface linguistic form to provide the flexibility required by cross-linguistic differences.",
        "On the other hand, the linguistic, unification-based processing involved in creating them can be carried out efficiently and without the need to reason about the domain or context; the QLF language has constructs for explicit representation of contextually sensitive aspects of interpretation.",
        "When it is necessary, for correct translation, to resolve an ambiguity present at QLF level, the BCI system interacts with the source language user to make the necessary decision, asking for a choice between word sense paraphrases or between alternative partial bracketings of the sentence.",
        "There is thus a strong connection between our choice of a representation sensitive to context and the use of interaction to resolve context dependent ambiguities, but in this paper we concentrate on representational and transfer issues."

        "A coarse view of the CLE architecture is that it consists of a linguistic analysis phase followed by a contextual interpretation phase.",
        "The output of the first phase is a set of alternative QLF analyses of a sentence, while the output of the second is an RQLF (resolved QLF) representation of the interpretation of an utterance: Sentence – linguistic analysis – ).",
        "QLFs QLFs – contextual interpretation-4 RQLF.",
        "Deriving a fairly conventional Logical Form (LF) from the RQLF is then a simple formal mapping which removes the information in the RQLF that is not concerned with truth conditions.",
        "Linguistic analysis and contextual interpretation each consist of several subphases.",
        "For analysis these are: orthography, morphological analysis, syntactic analysis (parsing), and (compositional) semantic analysis.",
        "Apart from the first, these analysis subphases are based on the unification grammar paradigm, and they all use declarative bidirectional rules.",
        "When the CLE is being used as an interface to a computerized information system (e.g. a database system), its purpose is to derive an LF representation giving the truth conditions of an utterance input by a user.",
        "The LF language is based on first order predicate logic extended with generalized quantifiers and some other higher order constructs (Alshawi and van Eijck, 1989).",
        "For example, in a context where she can refer to Mary Smith, and one to \"a car\", a possible LF for She hired one is: quant (exists ,C , [car 1 , quant (exists ,E, [event ,E3 , [past, [hirel E ,mary_smith , ) ) .",
        "This can be paraphrased as \"There is a car C, and an event E such that, in the past, E is a hiring event by Mary Smith of C.\" In this notation, quantified formulae consist of a generalized quantifier, a variable, a restriction and a scope; square brackets are used for the application of predicates and operators to their arguments.",
        "To arrive at such LF representations, a number of intermediate levels of representation are produced by successive modular components.",
        "Generation of linguistic expressions in the CLE takes place from QLFs (or from RQLFs by mapping them to suitable QLFs).",
        "Since the rules used during the analysis phase are declarative and bidirectional, these are also used for generation.",
        "To achieve computationally efficient analysis and generation, the rules are pre-compiled in different ways for application in the two directions.",
        "Generation uses the semantic-head driven algorithm (Shieber et al., 1990)."

        "The QLF is thus the level of representation encoding the results of compositional linguistic analysis independently of contextually sensitive aspects of understanding.",
        "These aspects are addressed by the contextual interpretation phase which has the following subphases: quantifier scoping (Moran 1988), reference resolution (Alshawi 1990), and plausibility judgement.",
        "The QLF language is a superset of the LF language containing additional expressions corresponding, for example, to unresolved anaphors.",

        "q_term( Category ,EntityVar , Restriction) .",
        "a_f orm( Category, ,PredVar , Restriction) .",

        "Syntactic phrase structure transfer, or deep-syntax transfer (e.g. Thurmair 1990, Nagao and Tsujii 1986) results in complex transfer rules, and the predicate-argument structure which is required for the application of sortal restrictions is not represented.",
        "McCord's (1988, 1989) organizing level appears to be fhat of surface syntax, with additional deep syntactic and semantic content attached to nodes.",
        "As we have argued, this level is not optimal, which may be related to the fact that McCord's system is explicitly not symmetrical: different grammars are used for the analysis and synthesis of the same language, which are viewed as quite different tasks.",
        "Isabelle and Macklovitch (1986) argue against such asymmetry between analysis and synthesis on the grounds that, although it is tempting as a short-cut to building a structure sufficiently well-specified for synthesis to take place, asymmetry means that the transfer component must contain a lot of knowledge about the target language, with dire consequences for the modularity of the system and the reusability of different parts of it.",
        "In the BCI, however, the transfer rules contain only cross-linguistic knowledge, allowing the analysis and generation to make use of exactly the same data.",
        "Kaplan et al. (1989) allow multiple levels of representation to take part in the transfer relation.",
        "However, Sadler et al. (1990) point out that the particular approach to realizing this taken by Kaplan et al. has problems of its own and does not cleanly separate monolingual from contrastive knowledge.",
        "The CLE processing subphases offer three semantic representations of different depth as candidates for an appropriate transfer level, namely QLF, RQLF and LF.",
        "At the LF level, sortal restrictions can be applied, but the form of noun phrase descriptions used and also information on topicalization is no longer present; the LF representation is too abstract for transfer.",
        "On the other hand, not all the information appearing in the RQLF about how QLF constructs have been resolved is necessary for translation.",
        "Resolved referents are not an adequate generator input for definite descriptions in the target language, since the view of the referent in the source is lost during translation.",
        "Another case is that translation from resolved ellipsis can result in unwieldy target sentences.",
        "In arguing for QLF-level transfer, we are asserting that predicate-argument relations of the type used in QLF are the appropriate organizing level for compositional transfer, while not denying the need for syntactic information to ensure that, for example, topichood or the given/new distinction is preserved.",
        "Finally, in contrast to systems such as Rosetta (Landsbergen, 1986) which depend on stating rule by rule correspondences between source and target grammars, we wish to make the monolingual descriptions as independent as possible from the task of translating between two languages.",
