        "Various models for word frequency distributions have been developed since Zipf (1935) applied the zeta distribution to describe a wide range of lexical data.",
        "Mandelbrot (1953, 1962) extended Zipf's distribution 'law'",
        "where A is the sample frequency of the ith type in a ranking according to decreasing frequency, with the parameter B,",
        "by means of which fits are obtained that are more accurate with respect to the higher frequency words.",
        "Simon (1955, 1960) developed a stochastic process which has the Yule distribution = AB(i, p 1), (3) with the parameter A and B(i, p 1) the Beta function in (i, p 1), as its stationary solutions.",
        "For i 4 oo, (3) can be written as r(p 1)i-(P+1) , in other words, (3) approximates Zipf's law with respect to the lower frequency words, the tail of",
        "the distribution.",
        "Other models, such as Good (1953), Waring-Herdan (Herdan 1960, Muller 1979) and Sichel (1975), have been put forward, all of which have Zipf's law as some special or limiting form.",
        "Unrelated to Zipf's law is the lognormal hypothesis, advanced for word frequency distributions by Carroll (1967, 1969), which gives rise to reasonable fits and is widely used in psycholinguistic research on word frequency effects in mental processing.",
        "A problem that immediately arises in the context of the study of word frequency distributions concerns the fact that these distributions have two important characteristics which they share with other so-called large number of rare events (LNRE) distributions (Orlov and Chi-tashvili 1983, Chitashvili and Khmaladze 1989), namely that on the one hand a huge number of different word types appears, and that on the other hand it is observed that while some events have reasonably stable frequencies, others occur only once, twice, etc.",
        "Crucially, these rare events occupy a significant portion of the list of all types observed.",
        "The presence of such large numbers of very low frequency types effects a significant bias between the rank-probability distribution and the rank-frequency distribution, leading to the contradiction of the common mean of the law of large numbers, so that expressions concerning frequencies cannot be taken to approximate expressions concerning probabilities.",
        "The fact that for LNRE distributions the rank-probability distributions cannot be reliably estimated on the basis of rank-frequency distributions is one source of the lack of goodness-of-fit often observed when various distribution 'laws' are applied to empirical data.",
        "Better results are obtained with Zipfian models when Orlov and Chitashvili's (1983) extended generalized Zipf's law is used.",
        "A second problem which arises when the appropriateness of the various lexical models is",
        "considered, the central issue of the present discussion, concerns the similarity relations among words in lexical distributions.",
        "These empirical similarity relations, as observed for large corpora of words, impose additional criteria on the adequacy of models for word frequency distributions."

        "There is a growing consensus in psycholinguistic research that word recognition depends not only on properties of the target word (e.g. its length and frequency), but also upon the number and nature of its lexical competitors or neighbors.",
        "The first to study similarity relations among lexical competitors in the lexicon in relation to lexical frequency were Landauer and Streeter (1973).",
        "Let a neighbor be a word that differs in exactly one phoneme (or letter) from a given target string, and let the neighborhood be the set of all neighbors, i.e. the set of all words at Hamming distance 1 from the target.",
        "Landauer and Streeter observed that (1) high-frequency words have more neighbors than low-frequency words (the neighborhood density effect), and that (2) high-frequency words have higher-frequency neighbors than low-frequency words (the neighborhood frequency effect).",
        "In order to facilitate statistical analysis, it is convenient to restate the neighborhood frequency effect as a correlation between the target's number of neighbors and the frequencies of these neighbors, rather than as a relation between the target's frequency and the frequencies of its neighbors – targets with many neighbors having higher frequency neighbors, and hence a higher mean neighborhood frequency than targets with few neighbors.",
        "In fact, both the neighborhood density and the neighborhood frequency effect are descriptions of a single property of lexical space, namely that its dense similarity regions are populated by the higher frequency types.",
        "A crucial property of word frequency distributions is that the lexical similarity effects occur not only across but also within word lengths.",
        "Figure 1A displays the rank-frequency distribution of Dutch monomorpheznic phonologically represented stems, function words excluded, and charts the lexical similarity effects of the subset of words with length 4 by means of boxplots.",
        "These show the mean (dotted line), the median, the upper and lower quartiles, the most extreme data points within 1.5 times the interquartile range, and remaining outliers for the number of neighbors (#n) against target frequency (neighborhood density), and for the mean frequency of the neighbors of a target (A) against the number",
        "the neighborhood density and frequency effects for empirical and theoretical words of length 4.",
        "of neighbors of the target (neighborhood frequency), for targets grouped into frequency and density classes respectively.",
        "Observe that the rank-frequency distribution of monomorphemic Dutch words does not show up as a straight line in a double logarithmic plot, that there is a small neighborhood density effect and a somewhat more pronounced neighborhood frequency effect.",
        "A Spearman rank correlation analysis reveals that the lexical similarity effects of figure 1A are statistically highly significant trends (p < 0.001), even though the correlations themselves are quite weak (see table 1, column 1): in the case of lexical density only 6% of the variance is explained.1"

        "By themselves, models of the kind proposed by Zipf, Herdan and Muller or Sichel, even though they may yield reasonable fits to particular word frequency distributions, have no bearing on the similarity relations in the lexicon.",
        "The only model that is promising in this respect is that of Mandelbrot (1953, 1962).",
        "Mandelbrot derived his modification of Zipf's law (2) on the basis of a Markovian model for generating words as strings of letters, in combination with some assumptions concerning the cost of transmitting the words generated in some optimal code, giving a precise interpretation to Zipf's 'law of abbreviation'.",
        "Miller (1957), wishing to avoid a teleological explanation, showed that the Zipf-Mandelbrot law can also be derived under slightly different assumptions.",

        "We first discuss the Markovian model figuring in Mandelbrot's derivation of (2).",
        "Consider a first-order Markov process.",
        "Let A = {0, 1, , ic} be the set of phonemes of the language, with 0 representing the terminating character space, and let P = (pi3)i,,EA with Poo = 0.",

        "With E[N] = Npv, we find that the neighborhood density effect does occur across word lengths, even though the transition probabilities are uniformly distributed.",
        "In order to obtain a realistic, non-trivial theoretical word distribution comparable with the empirical data of figure IA, the transition matrix P was constructed such that it generated a subset of phonotactically legal (possible) monomorphematic strings of Dutch by conditioning consonant Ck in the string X,X3Ck on X, and the segmental nature (C or V) of Xi, while vowels were conditioned on the preceding segment only.",
        "This procedure allowed us to differentiate between e.g. phonotactically legal word initial kn and illegal word final kn sequences, at the same time avoiding full conditioning on two preceding segments, which, for four-letter words, would come uncomfortably close to building the probabilities of the individual words in the database into the model.",
        "The rank-frequency distribution of 58300 types and 224567 tokens (disregarding strings of length 1) obtained by means of this (second order) Markov process shows up in a double logarithmic plot as roughly linear (figure 1B).",
        "Although the curve has the general Zipfian shape, the deviations at head and tail are present by necessity in the light of Rouault (1978).",
        "A comparison with figure 1A reveals that the large surplus of very low frequency types is highly unsatisfactory.",
        "The model (given the present transition matrix) fails to replicate the high rate of use of the relatively limited set of words of natural language.",
        "The lexical similarity effects as they emerge for the simulated strings of length 4 are displayed in the boxplots of figure 1B.",
        "A very pronounced neighborhood density effect is found, in combination with a subdued neighborhood frequency effect (see table 1, column 2).",
        "The appearance of the neighborhood density effect within a fixed string length in the Markovian scheme with non-uniformly distributed Ai can be readily understood in the simple case of the first order Markov model outlined above.",
        "Since neighbors are obtained by substitution of a single element of the phoneme inventory A, two consecutive transitional probabilities of (4) have to be replaced.",
        "For increasing target probability he, the constituting transition probabilities pia must increase, so that, especially for non-trivial m, the neighbors y E Ct will generally be protected against low probabilities ply Consequently, by (5), for fixed length m, higher frequency words will have more neighbors than lower frequency words for non-uniformly distributed transition probabilities.",
        "The fact that the lexical similarity effects emerge for target strings of the same length is a strong point in favour of a Markovian source",
        "for word frequency distributions.",
        "Unfortunately, comparing the results of figure 1B with those of figure 1A, it appears that the effects are of the wrong order of magnitude: the neighborhood density effect is far too strong, the neighborhood frequency effect somewhat too weak.",
        "The source of this distortion can be traced to the extremely large number of types generated (6425) for a number of tokens (74618) for which the empirical data (64854 tokens) allow only 1342 types.",
        "This large surplus of types gives rise to an inflated neighborhood density effect, with the concomitant effect that neighborhood frequency is scaled down.",
        "Rather than attempting to address this issue by changing the transition matrix by using a more constrained but less realistic data set, another option is explored here, namely the idea to supplement the Markovian stochastic process with a second stochastic process developed by Simon (1955), by means of which the intensive use can be modelled to which the word types of natural language are put.",

        "Let te) be the number of word types that have occurred exactly r times in these first N words.",
        "If we allow for the possibilities that both new types can be sampled, and old types can be re-used, Simon's model in its simplest form is obtained under the three assumptions that (1) the probability that the (N +1)-st word is a type that has appeared exactly r times is proportional to rn41), the summed token frequencies of all types with token frequency r at stage N, that (2) there is a constant probability a that the (N+1)-st word represents a new type, and that (3) all frequencies grow proportionaly with N, so that",
        "Simon (1955) shows that the Yule-distribution (3) follows from these assumptions.",
        "When the third assumption is replaced by the assumptions that word types are dropped with a probability proportional to their token frequency, and that old words are dropped at the same rate at which new word types are introduced so that the total number of tokens in the distribution is a constant, the Yule-distribution is again found to follow (Simon 1960).",
        "By itself, this stochastic process has no explanatory value with respect to the similarity relations between words.",
        "It specifies use and reuse of word types, without any reference to segmental constituency or length.",
        "However, when a Markovian process is fitted as a front end to Simon's stochastic process, a hybrid model results that has the desired properties, since the latter process can be used to force the required high intensity of use on the types of its input distribution.",
        "The Markovian front end of the model can be thought of as defining a probability distribution that reflects the ease with which words can be pronounced by the human vocal tract, an implementation of phonotaxis.",
        "The second component of the model can be viewed as simulating interfering factors pertaining to language use.",
        "Extralinguistic factors codetermine the extent to which words are put to use, independently of the slot occupied by these words in the network of similarity relations,2 and may effect a substantial reduction of the lexical similarity effects.",
        "Qualitatively satisfying results were obtained with this `Mandelbrot-Simon' stochastic model, using the transition matrix of figure 1B for the Markovian front end and fixing Simon's birth rate a at 0.01.3 An additional parameter, Vc, the critical number of types for which the switch from the front end to what we will refer to as the component of use is made, was fixed at 2000.",
        "Figure 1C shows that both the general shape of the rank-frequency curve in a double logarithmic grid, as well as the lexical similarity effects (table 1, column 3) are highly similar to the empirical observations (figure 1A).",
        "Moreover, the overall number of types (4848) and the number of types of length 4 (1350) closely approximate the empirical numbers of types (4455 and 1342 respectively), and the same holds for the overall numbers of tokens (291944 and 224567) respectively.",
        "Only the number of tokens of length 4 is overestimated by a factor 2.",
        "Nevertheless, the type-token ratio is far more balanced than in the original Markovian scheme.",
        "Given that the transition matrix models only part of the phonotaxis of Dutch, a perfect match between the theoretical and empirical distributions is not to be expected.",
        "The present results were obtained by implementing Simon's stochastic model in a slightly modified form, however.",
        "Simon's derivation of the Yule-distribution builds on the assumption that each r grows proportionaly with N, an as-2For instance, the Dutch word kuip, 'barrel', is a low-frequency type in the present-day language, due to the fact that its denotatum has almost completely dropped out of use.",
        "Nevertheless, it was a high-frequency word in earlier centuries, to which the high frequency of the surname kuiper bears witness.",
        "sumption that does not lend itself to implementation in a stochastic process.",
        "Without this assumption, rank-frequency distributions are generated that depart significantly from the empirical rank-frequency curve, the highest frequency words attracting a very large proportion of all tokens.",
        "By replacing Simon's assumptions 1 and 3 by the 'rule of usage' that the probability that the (N+1)-st word is a type that has appeared exactly r times is proportional to",
        "theoretical rank-frequency distributions of the desired form can be obtained.",
        "Writing",
        "for the probability of reusing any type that has been used r times before, H,.",
        "can be interpreted as the contribution of all types with frequency r to the total entropy H of the distribution of ranks r, i.e. to the average amount of information",
        "Selection of ranks according to (6) rather than proportional to rn,.",
        "(Simon's assumption 1) ensures that the highest ranks r have lowered probabilities of being sampled, at the same time slightly raising the probabilities of the intermediate ranks r. For instance, the 58 highest ranks of the distribution of figure 1C have somewhat raised, the complementary 212 ranks somewhat lowered probability of being sampled.",
        "The advantage of using (6) is that unnatural rank-frequency distributions in which a small number of types assume exceedingly high token frequencies are avoided.",
        "The proposed rule of usage can be viewed as a means to obtain a better trade-off in the distribution between maximalization of information transmission and optimalization of the cost of coding the information.",
        "To see this, consider an individual word type y.",
        "In order to mini-malize the cost of coding C(y) = – log(Pr(y)), high-frequency words should be reused.",
        "Unfortunately, these high-frequency words have the lowest information content.",
        "However, it can be shown that maximalization of information transmission requires the reuse of the lowest frequency types (H,.",
        "is maximal for uniformly distributed p(r)).",
        "Thus we have two opposing requirements, which balance out in favor of a more intensive use of the lower and intermediate frequency ranges when selection of ranks is proportional to (6).",
        "The 'rule of usage' (6) implies that higher frequency words contribute less to the average amount of information than might be expected on the basis of their relative sample frequencies.",
        "Interestingly, there is independent evidence for this prediction.",
        "It is well known that the higher-frequency types have more (shades of) meaning(s) than lower-frequency words (see e.g. Reder, Anderson and Bjork 1974, Paivio, Yuille and Madigan 1968).",
        "A larger number of meanings is correlated with increased contextual dependency for interpretation.",
        "Hence the amount of information contributed by such types out of context (under conditions of statistical independence) is less than what their relative sample frequencies suggest, exactly as modelled by our rule of usage.",
        "Note that this semantic motivation for selection proportional to H,.",
        "makes it possible to avoid invoking external principles such as 'least effort' or 'optimal coding' in the mathematical definition of the model, principles that have been criticized as straining one's credulity (Miller 1957).4"
