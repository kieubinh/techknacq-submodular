        "In many speech recognition applications, a word lattice is a partially ordered set of possible word hypotheses obtained from an acoustic signal processor.",
        "The purpose of a language processor is then, for an input word lattice, to find the most promising word sequence or sentence hypothesis as the output (Hayes, 1986; Tomita, 1986; O'Shaughnessy, 1989).",
        "Conventionally either grammatical or statistical approaches were used in such language processors.",
        "However, the high degree of ambiguity and large number of noisy word hypotheses in the word lattices usually make the search space huge and correct identification of the output sentence hypothesis difficult, and the capabilities of a language processor based on either grammatical or statistical approaches alone were very often limited.",
        "Because the features of these two approaches are basically complementary, Derouault and Merialdo (Derouault, 1986) first proposed a unified model to combine them.",
        "But in this model these two approaches were applied primarily separately, selecting the output sentence hypothesis based on the product of two probabilities independently obtained from these two approaches.",
        "In this paper a new language processor based on a recently proposed augmented chart parsing algorithm (Chien, 1990a) is presented, in which the grammatical approach of unification grammar (Sheiber, 1986) and the statistical approach of Markov language model (Jelinek, 1976) are properly integrated in a preference-first word lattice parsing algorithm.",
        "The augmented chart (Chien, 1990b) was extended from the conventional chart.",
        "It can represent a very complicated word lattice, so that the difficult word lattice parsing problem can be reduced to essentially a well-known chart parsing problem.",
        "Unification grammars, compared with other grammatical approaches, are more declarative and can better integrate syntactic and semantic information to eliminate illegal combinations; while Markov language models are in general both effective and simple.",
        "The new language processor proposed in this paper actually integrates the unification grammar and the Markov language model by a new preference-first parsing algorithm with various preference-first parsing strategies defined by different constituent construction principles and decision rules, such that the constituent selection and search directions in the parsing process can be more appropriately determined by Markovian probabilities, thus rejecting most noisy word hypotheses and significantly reducing the search space.",
        "Therefore the global structural synthesis capabilities of the unification grammar and the local relation estimation capabilities of the Markov language model are properly integrated.",
        "This makes the present language processor not sensitive at all to the increased number of noisy word hypotheses in a very large vocabulary environment.",
        "An experimental system for Mandarin speech recognition has been implemented (Lee, 1990) and tested, in which a very high correct rate of recognition (93.8%) was obtained at a very high processing speed (about 5 sec per sentence on an IBM PC/AT).",
        "This indicates significant improvements as compared to previously proposed models.",

        "The goal of the language model is to participate in the selection of candidate constituents for a sentence to be identified.",
        "The proposed language model is composed of a PATR-II-like unification grammar (Sheiber, 1986; Chien, 1990a) and a first-order Markov language model (Jelinek, 1976) and thus, combines many features of the grammatical and statistical language modeling approaches.",
        "The PATR-II-like unification grammar is used primarily to distinguish between well-formed, acceptable word sequences against ill-formed ones, and then to represent the structural phrases and categories, or to fmd the intended meaning depending on different applications.",
        "The first-order Maxim language model, on the other hand, is used to guide the parser toward correct search directions, such that many noisy word hypotheses can be rejected and many unnecessary constituents can be avoided, and the most promising sentence hypothesis can thus be easily found.",
        "In this way the weakness in either the PATR-II-like unification grammar (Sheiber, 1986), e.g., the heavy reliance on rigid linguistic information, or the first-order Markov language model (Jelinek, 1976), e.g., the need for a large training corpus and the local prediction scope can also be effectively remedied."

        "The preference-first parsing algorithm is developed based on the augmented chart summarized above, so that the difficult word lattice parsing problem is reduced to essentially a well-known chart parsing problem.",

        "In this way, not only can the features of the grammatical and statistical approaches be combined, but the effects of the two different approaches are reflected and integrated in a single algorithm such that overall performance can be appropriately optimized.",

        "In test I, the conventional unification-based grammatical analysis alone is used, in which all the sentence hypotheses obtained from the word lattice were parsed exhaustively and a grammatical sentence constituent was selected randomly as the result; while in test II the first-order Markov modeling approach alone is used, and a sentence hypothesis with the highest probability was selected as the result regardless of the grammatical structure.",
        "The correct rate of recognition is defined as the averaged percentage of the correct words in the output sentences.",
        "The correct rate of recognition and the approximated average time required are found to be 73.8% and 25 sec for Test I , as well as 82.2% and 3 sec for Test II, as indicated in the first two rows of Table 1.",
        "In all the following parsing strategies, both the unification grammar and the Markov language model will be integrated in the language model to obtain better results.",
        "The parsing strategy 1 uses the random selection principle and the highest probability rule ( as listed in Section 3), and the entire word lattice will be parsed exhaustively.",
        "The total number of constituents constructed during the course of parsing for each test sentence are also recorded.",
        "The results show that the correct rate of recognition can be as high as 98.3%.",
        "This indicates that the language processor based on the integration of the unification grammar and the Markov language model can in fact be very reliable.",
        "That is, most of the interferences due to the noisy word hypotheses are actually rejected by such an integration.",
        "However, the computation load required for such an exhaustive parsing strategy turns out to be very high (similar to that in Test I), i.e., for each test sentence in average 305.9 constituents have to be constructed and it takes about 25 sec to process a sentence on the IBM PC/AT.",
        "Such computation requirements will make this strategy practically difficult for many applications.",
        "All these test data together with the results for the other three parsing strategies 2-4 are listed in Table 1 for comparison.",
        "The basic concept of parsing strategy 2 (using the probability selection principle and the first-1 rule, as listed in Section 3 ) is to use the probabilities of the constituents to select the search direction such that significant reduction in computation requirements can be achieved.",
        "The test results (in the fourth row of Table 1) show that with this strategy for each test sentence in average only 152.4 constituents are constructed and it takes only about 12 sec to process a sentence on the PC/AT, and the high correct rate of recognition of parsing strategy 1 is almost preserved, i.e., 96.0%.",
        "Therefore this strategy represents a very good tradeoff, i.e., the computation requirements are reduced by a factor of 0.50 ( the constituent reduction ratio in the last second column of Table 1 is the ration of the average number of built constituents to that of Strategy 1), while the correct rate is only degraded by 2.3%.",

        "Some observations can be made as in the following.",
        "First, it can be seen that the two curves in Fig. 2 apparently diverge, especially for longer constituents, which implies that the Markovian probabilities can effectively discriminate the noisy constituents against the correct constituents (note that all of these constituents are grammatical), especially for longer constituents.",
        "This is exactly why parsing strategr and 2 can provide very high correct rams.",
        "Furthermore, Fig. 2 also shows that in genervl the probabilities for shorter constituents wod usually be much higher than those for longer constituents.",
        "This means with parsing strategy 2 almost all short constituents, no matter noisy or",
        "correct, would be constructed first, and only those long noisy constituents with lower probability values can be rejected by the parsing strategy 2.",
        "This thus leads to the parsing strategies 3 and 4 discussed below.",
        "In parsing strategy 3 (using the length/probability selection principle and First-1 rule, as listed in Section 3), the length of a constituent is considered first, because it is found that the correct constituents have much better chance to be obtained very quickly by means of the Markovian probabilities for longer constituents than shorter correct constituents, as discussed in the above.",
        "In this way, the construction of the desired constituents would be much more faster and very significant reduction in computation requirements can be achieved.",
        "The test results in the fifth row of Table 1 show that with this strategy in average only 70.2 constituents were constructed for a sentence, a constituent reduction ratio of 0.27 is found, and it takes only about 4 sec to process a sentence on PC/AT, which is now very close to real-time.",
        "However, the correct rate of recognition is seriously degraded to as low as 85.8%, apparently because some correct constituents have been missed due to the high speed construction principle.",
        "Fortunately, after a series of experiments, it was found that in this case the correct sentences very often appeared as the second or the third constructed sentences, if not the first.",
        "Therefore, the parsing strategy 4 is proposed below, in which everything is the same as parsing strategy 3 except that the first-1 decision rule is replaced by the first-3 decision rule.",
        "In other words, those missed correct constituents can very possibly be picked up in the next few steps, if the final decision can be slightly delayed.",
        "The test results for parsing strategy 4 listed in the sixth row of Table 1 show that with this strategy the correct rate of recognition has been improved to 93.8% and the computation complexity is still close to that of parsing strategy 3, i.e., the average number of constructed constituents for a sentence is 91.0, it takes about 5 sec to process a sentence, and a constituent reduction ratio of 0.29 is achieved.",
        "This is apparently a very attractive approach considering both the accuracy and the computation complexity.",
        "In fact, with the parsing strategy 4, only those noisy word hypotheses which both have relatively high probabilities and can be unified with their neighboring word hypotheses can cause interferences.",
        "This is why the noisy word hypothesis interferences can be reduced, and the present approach is therefore not sensitive at all to the increased number of noisy word hypotheses in a very large vocabulary environment.",
        "Note that although intuitively the integration of grammatical and statistical approaches would imply more computation requirements, but here in fact the preference-first algorithm provides correct directions of search such that many noisy constituents are simply rejected and the reduction of the computation complexity makes such an integration also very attractive in terms of computation requirements."
