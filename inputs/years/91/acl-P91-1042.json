        "Many modern linguistic theories are using feature structures (FS) to describe linguistic objects representing phonological, syntactic, and semantic properties.",

        "It seems to be useful to maintain the distinction between the constraint language in which feature structure constraints are expressed, and the structures that satisfy these constraints.",
        "Unification is the primary operation for determining the satisfiability of conjunctions of equality constraints.",
        "The efficiency of this operation is thus crucial for the overall efficiency of any system that uses feature structures."

        "In unification-based grammar formalisms, unification is the meet operation on the meet semi-lattice formed by partially ordering the set of feature structures by a subsumption relation [Shieber 86].",
        "Following ideas presented by [Kit-Kaci 84] and introduced, for example, in the unification-based formalism underlying HPSG [Pollard and Sag 87], first-order unification is extended to the sorted case using an order-sorted signature instead of a flat one.",
        "In most existing implementations, descriptions of feature structure constraints are not directly used as models that satisfy these constraints; instead, they are represented by directed graphs (DG) serving as satisfying models.",
        "In particular, in the case where we are dealing only with conjunctions of equality constraints, efficient graph unification algorithms exist.",
        "The graph unification algorithm presented by Ait-Kaci is a node merging process using the UNION/FIND method (originally used for testing the equivalence of finite automata [Hoperoft/Karp 71]).",
        "It has its analogue in the unification algorithm for rational terms based on a fast procedure for congruence closure [Huet 76].",
        "Node merging is a destructive operation Since actual merging of nodes to build new node equivalence classes modifies the argument DGs, they must be copied before unification is invoked if the argument DGs need to be preserved.",
        "For example, during parsing there are two kinds of representations that must be preserved: first, lexical entries and rules must be preserved.",
        "They need to be copied first before a destructive unification operation can be applied to combine categories to form new ones; and second, nondeterminism in parsing requires the preservation of intermediate representations that might be used later when the parser comes back to a choice point to try some yet unexplored options.",
        "DG copying as a source of inefficiency Previous research on unification, in particular on graph unification [Karttunen/K ay 85, Pereira 85], and others, identified DG copying as the main source of inefficiency.",
        "The high cost in terms of time spent for copying and in terms of space required for the copies themselves accounts for a significant amount of the total processing time.",
        "Actually, more time is spent for copying than for unification itself.",
        "Hence, it is crucial to reduce the amount of copying, both in terms of the number and of the size of copies, in order to improve the efficiency of unification.",
        "A naive implementation of unification would copy the arguments even before unification starts.",
        "That is what [Wroblewski 87] calls early copying.",
        "Early copying is wasted effort in cases of failure.",
        "He also introduced the notion of over copying, which results from copying both arguments in their entirety.",

        "The concept of structure sharing has been introduced to minimize the amount of copying by allowing DGs to share common parts of their structure.",
        "The Boyer and Moore approach uses a skeleton/environment representation for structure sharing.",
        "The basic idea of structure sharing presented by [Pereira 85], namely that an initial object together with a list of updates contains the same information as the object that results from applying the updates destructively to the initial object, uses a variant of Boyer and Moore's approach for structure sharing of term structures [Boyer/Moore 72].",
        "The method uses a skeleton for representing the initial DG that will never change and an environment for representing updates to the skeleton.",
        "There are two kinds of updates: reroutings that forward one DG node to another; arc bindings that add to a node a new arc.",
        "Lazy Copying as another method to achieve structure sharing is based on the idea of lazy evaluation.",
        "Copying is delayed until a destructive change is about to happen.",
        "Lazy copying to achieve structure sharing has been suggested by [Karttunen/Kay 85], and lately again by [Godden 90] and [Kogure 90].",
        "Neither of these methods fully avoids redundant copying in cases when we have to copy a node that is not the root.",
        "In general, all nodes along the path leading from the root to the site of an update need to be copied as well, even if they are not affected by this particular unification step, and hence could be shared with the resultant DG.",
        "Such cases seem to be ubiquitous in unification-based parsing since the equality constraints of phrase structure rules lead to the unification of substructures associated with the immediate daughter and mother categories.",
        "With respect to the overall structure that serves as the result of a parse, these unifications of substructures are even further embedded, yielding a considerable amount of copying that should be avoided.",

        "Copies are associated with nodes of the argument DGs by means",
        "of an additional copy field for the data structures representing nodes.",

        "Instead of using a global branch environment as in Pereira's approach, each node records it's own updates by means of the copy field and a generation counter.",
        "The advantages are a uniform unification procedure which makes complex merging of environments obsolete and which can be furthermore easily extended to handle disjunctive constraints.",
        "Dereferencing The main difference between standard unification algorithms and LIC is the treatment of dereference pointers for representing node equivalence classes.",
        "The usual dereferencing operation follows a possible pointer chain until the class representative is found, whereas in LIC dereferencing is performed according to the current environment.",
        "Each copy-node carries a generation counter that indicates to which generation it belongs.",
        "This means that every node is connected with its derivational context.",
        "A branch environment is represented as a sequence of valid generation counters (which could be extended to trees of generations for representing local disjunctions).",

        "Whenever we encounter a choice point, the environment will be extended.",
        "The length of the environment corresponds to the number of stacked choice points.",
        "For every choice point with n possible continuations, n – 1 new generation counters are created.",
        "The last alternative pops the last element from the environment, continues with the old environment and produces n DG representations, one for each alternative.",
        "By going back to previous generations, already existing nodes become active nodes, and are thus modified destructively.",
        "This technique resembles the last call optimization technique of some Prolog implementations, e.g. for the WAM [Warren83].",
        "The history of making choices is reflected by the dereferencing chain for each node which participated in different unifications.",
        "Figure 1 is an example which illustrates how dereferencing works with respect to the environment: node b is the class representative for environment <0>, node c is the result of dereferencing for environments <0 1> and <0 1 2>, and finally node f corresponds to the representative for the environment <0 1 2 3> and all further extensions that did not add a new forwarding pointer to newly created copynodes.",
        "Advantages of of this new dereferencing scheme are: • It is very easy to undo the effects of unification upon backtracking.",
        "Instead of using trail information which records the nodes that must be restored in case of returning to a previous choice point, the state of computation at that choice point is recovered in constant time by activating the environment which is associated with that choice point.",
        "Dereferencing with respect to the environment will assure that the valid class representative will always be found.",
        "Pointers to nodes that do not belong to the current environment are ignored.",
        "• It is no longer necessary to distinguish between the forward and copy slot for representing permanent and temporary relationships as it was needed in Wroblewski's algorithm.",
        "One copy field for storing the copy pointer is sufficient, thus reducing the size of node structures.",
        "Whether a unification leads to a destructive change by performing a rerouting that can not be undone, or to a nondestructive update by rerouting to a copynode that belongs to a higher generation, is reexpressed by means of the environment."
