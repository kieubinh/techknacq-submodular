        "The resolution of lexical ambiguities in unrestricted text is one of the most difficult tasks of natural language processing.",
        "In machine translation we are confronted with the related task of target word selection â€“ the task of deciding which target language word is the most appropriate equivalent of a source language word in context.",
        "In contrast to computational systems, humans seem to select the correct sense of an ambiguous word without much effort and usually without even being aware to the existence of an ambiguous situation.",
        "This fact naturally led researches to point out various sources of information which may provide the necessary cues for disambiguation, either for humans or machines.",
        "The following paragraphs classify these sources into two major types, based on either understanding of the text or frequency characteristics of it.",
        "One kind of information relates to the understanding of the meaning of the text, using semantic and pragmatic knowledge and applying reasoning mechanisms.",
        "The following sentences, taken from foreign news sections in the Israeli Hebrew press, demonstrate how different levels of understanding can provide the disambiguating information.",
        "(1) haver ha-bayit ha-'elyon shel ha-parlament ha",
        "'This research was partially supported by grant number 120-741 of the Israel Council for Research and Development sovieti zaka be-monitin ke-hoker shel ha-shhitut be-kazahst an.",
        "This sentence translates into English as: (2) The member of the upper house of the soviet parliament acquired a reputation as an investigator of the corruption in Kazakhstan.",
        "The two most frequent senses of the ambiguous noun 'haver' correspond to the English words 'friend' and 'member'.",
        "In the above example, the information for selecting the correct sense is provided by the semantic knowledge that 'a house of parliament' typically has members but not friends.",
        "Computationally this kind of information is usually captured by a shallow semantic model of selectional restrictions.",
        "In other cases, such as example (3), it is necessary to use deeper understanding of the text, which involves some level of reasoning: (3) be-het'em le-hoq ha-hagira ha-hadash tihye le-kol ezrah sovieti ha-zkut ha-otomatit lekabel darkon bar tokef le-hamesh shanim.",
        "This sentence translates into English as: (4) According to the new emigration bill every soviet citizen will have the automatic right to receive a passport valid for five years.",
        "The Hebrew word `hagira' is used for the two sub-senses 'emigration' and 'immigration'.",
        "In order to make the correct selection it is necessary to reason that since the soviet bill relates to soviet citizens then it concerns with leaving the country rather than entering it.",
        "Another kind of information source, which was originally raised in the psycholinguistic literature, relates to the relative frequencies of word senses and associations between word senses.",
        "These factors were shown to play an important role in lexical retrieval, and were suggested as relevant for lexical disambiguation [4, 3].",
        "Hanks [1], for example, lists different words associated with the two senses of the word 'bank', such as money, notes, account, investment etc.",
