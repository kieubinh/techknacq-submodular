        "A considerable amount of study has recently been concentrated on the use of linguistically motivated unification based grammars for sentence generation (see for example Appelt 1987, Calder 1989, Shieber 1988, Shieber et al.",
        "1989).",
        "The grammars state correspondences between semantic structures and syntactic ones.",
        "In most grammars, several syntactic structures will correspond to each semantic one.",
        "It was suggested at a fairly early stage that control over which sentence is generated could be applied by adding \"functional\" features to the grammar.",
        "This idea has been extended in the work presented here.",
        "The use of feature threading techniques allows control over a wide range of syntactic structures, in a fairly sophisticated grammar, while avoiding the need for rule duplication even when generating unbounded dependencies.",
        "However, we will see that the feature system required quickly becomes complex, and may be difficult to extend to more comprehensive grammars."

        "\"A thematic system is one where corresponding members of the contrasting terms normally have the same propositional meaning, and the same illocutionary potential.\"",
        "(Huddleston 1984:p437).",
        "Most phrase structure or categorial unification based grammars encode some form of thematic system.",
        "The simplest would involve the inclusion of both active and passive voice.",
        "Typically, the grammar defines the syntactic structure of each form, but does not include the pragmatic information that distinguishes one from another.",
        "When using such a grammar for parsing, this is not important, so long as the information is not required by the system using the parser's output.",
        "However, there has recently been an upsurge in the use of these grammars for generation.",
        "The lack of pragmatic data now becomes important: the generator is under-constrained, being capable of producing any of the available thematic forms.",
        "One way of applying the necessary constraints, is to introduce a system of \"functional\" features into the feature structure of the grammar itself.",
        "These features are so called because they refer to the function of the various parts of the sentence in a discourse.",
        "McKeown suggested the use of functional features for the TEXT system (McKeown 1985) in which the grammar was based on the FUG formalism (Kay 1979).",
        "The functional features were defined as part of the initial specification of the sentence, which was then filled out by traversing the grammar in a \"Top Down\" fashion.",
        "For example, the following was given by McKeown as an initial sentence specification.",
        "The functional feature is \"TOPIC\", and is specified as being the agent (or PROTago-fist) of the semantic structure.",
        "The feature value controls wether an active or passive sentence will be produced.",
        "The work reported in this paper extends this technique to a grammar which encodes a richer thematic system than just active and passive.",
        "We use a unification based grammar with a phrase structure backbone, which was originally developed to provide a simple computational description of current linguistic theories (mainly GPSG, Gazdar 1985).",
        "As in the example above, a system of functional features is introduced.",
        "A bottom-up generation algorithm allows the production of sentences given an initial semantic form.",
        "The assignment of some initial values to the functional features constrains the structures generated, and typically just one sentence will be generated for each semantic input.",
        "This work was done in the context of a database enquiery system with single sentence output.",
        "We assume there is a discourse manager which initiates generation by passing the generator a \"message\".",
        "This message consists of the propositional content of the output required, and some pragmatic information.",
        "The rest of this paper is in three main parts.",
        "The first is the definition of a coherent set of discourse parameters that describe the behaviour in discourse of the various elements of a sentence.",
        "The second section describes the thematic system used, and how each member relates to the discourse parameters.",
