        "But it seems unreasonable to rule this out, and indeed in our approach to translation to enforce the extension definition as above would be more than an inconvenience, but would rather make translation virtually unachievable.",

        "Alternatively one could attempt to constrain not only the relationship between Xs and x, but also the nature of x itself.",
        "In the example at hand, this would mean for instance requiring some form of LFG's coherence restriction for subcategorisation frames.",

        "If 1 is defined such that it extends everything, or alternatively that the generalisation of anything with 1 is the thing itself, then 1) 1 is infinite so 2) no finite structure can satisfy the maximal overlap requirement; but in any case 1 fails to satisfy the first clause of 3, namely the unification of Xs and x must not be 1, since if x is 1 then xs and x unify to 1 for any xs.",
        "Finally note that in cases where substantial material has to be supplied, as it were, by the target grammar (e.g. if a transitive verb is supplied but no object), then Definition 3 would allow arbitrary lexicalisations, giving rise to a very large number of permissible outputs.",
        "If this is felt to be problem, then l'estricting (in the sense of (Shieber 1985)) the subsumption test in the second half of Definition 3 to ignore the values of certain features, i.e. pred, would be 'straight-forward.",

        "11.4 A Problem with the Mini-maximal Approach",
        "One potential problem clearly arises with this approach.",
        "It stems from its dependence on subsumption and its friends.",
        "Since subsumption, in at least some standard formulations (e.g. Definite Clause Grammars) fails to distinguish between contingently and necessarily equivalent sub-structures, we will overgenerate in cases where this is the only difference between two analyses, e.g. for Kim expects to go and Kim expects Kim to go on a straightforward account of Equi.",
        "One can respond to this either by saying that this is actually correct, that Equi is optional anyway (wishful thinking, I guess), or by adding side conditions to Definition 3 which amount to strengthening substunption etc.",
