        "Machine translation is an obvious application for reversible natural language systems, since both understanding and generation are important parts of the process.",
        "There are several arguments for this view (for example, [Isabelle, 89]), including reducing the total cost of adding a new language and making it easier to maintain and validate the resulting system: Reversible MT systems, just like the broader class of MT systems as a whole, fall into two roughly defined families: transfer systems and interlingua (or pivot systems).",
        "Reversible transfer systems (e.g., [van Noord, 90], [Zajac, 90], [Dymetman, 88], and [Strzalkowski, 90]) exploit three reversible subsystems: one to analyze the source text, one to perform the transfer, and a third to generate the target text.",
        "Interlingua-based systems (e.g., Ultra [Farwell, 90]), on the other hand, require only two reversible components: one to analyze the source text into the interlingua representation, and one to generate the target text from that representation.",
        "In this paper, we will focus on issues that arise in the design of interlingua-based MT systems.",
        "The simplest model of a reversible, interlingua-based system contains two components: one analyzes the source text to create the interlingua representation and the other maps from that to the target text.",
        "Unfortunately, the real situation is not that simple, for several reasons, including two that we will focus on here: • This model assumes that the same information is present in the target text as in the source.",
        "But in some cases, which have been called translation mismatches [Kameyama, 91], information is either added to or deleted from the source in creating the target.",
        "We will show some examples of this below in Section 2.",
        "In these cases, the simple reversible system we outlined above would produce unacceptable translations.",
        "• Although the notion of a reversible system that describes the set of legal translations is reasonably clearcut, the notion of preferred translation is more difficult to define [van Noord, 90], [Barnett, 91d].",
        "In some cases, which have been called translation divergences [Dorr, 90], the most natural translation differs from the source in some significant way (e.g., its focus).",
        "Of course, in many cases, both of these issues occur together and interact.",
        "In this paper, we present some techniques for dealing with these problems.",
        "These techniques have three important properties: They require purely declarative, reversible descriptions of the languages that are involved.",
        "They require only monolingual facts.",
        "Thus new languages can be added to the system without any changes to the descriptions of any other languages.",
        "And they are stated in a way that enables their performance to increase gradually along with the power of the underlying knowledge base."

        "Acquiring these distinctions will be a substantial amount of work, but the work is necessary even in non-reversible monolingual systems.",

      "text": [
        "In this paper, we have described an approach to machine translation that has three important properties: • It treats many problems of translation mismatch and divergence as primarily problems of generation from a flexible semantic representation language rather than as translation problems per se.",
        "• It relies exclusively on reversible, monolingual descriptions of all of the languages it treats.",
        "Although some comparisons of the source and target lexicons are required, they can be done,automatically (and cached if desired).",
        "No language-pair information must be explicitly provided.",
        "• It is stated in a way that enables its performance to increase steadily with the performance of the underlying knowledge base and reasoning system.",
        "This approach does, however, require some additional information that is not normally present either in monolingual NL systems or MT systems.",
        "Some of this information must be provided as part of the definition of each language.",
        "This includes: • The labeling of syntactic assertions as forced or unforced.",
        "This information is only useful for MT, but it is very easy to provide.",
        "• The labeling of marked/unmarked distinctions along various dimensions.",
        "This requires more work, but it is also useful even in purely monolingual generation systems, since they may be given sets of assertions for which there is no exact match.",
        "Some additional information must also be passed along during the understanding process.",
        "In particular, the grouping together of assertions that came from the same lexical item must be preserved."
