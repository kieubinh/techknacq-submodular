        "This paper addresses the problem of how to provide support for the acquisition, formalization, refinement, retrieval - in other words, for the management - of the knowledge required for producing high-quality terminology.",
        "This problem will become increasingly significant as term banks evolve into knowledge bases.",
        "Knowledge management for terminology-intensive activities is complicated by two factors: 1) the importance of encyclopedic as well as lexical-semantic knowledge, and 2) the wide spectrum of working environments in which terminological activities can be carried out, from terminology as a distinct specialization at one end of the spectrum, to terminology as practised in document-production at the other.",
        "In the first two sections of the paper, we briefly analyze each of the two complicating factors.",
        "In the third section, we describe the terminological support that is currently available and under development in a knowledge management tool called CODE, which is being used to build a prototype, knowledge-based term bank called COGNITERM, designed to be useful across a spectrum of terminology-intensive environments."

      "text": [
        "Terminology is the practical discipline concerned with describing and naming concepts in specialized domains.",
        "The data produced by this process is, increasingly, stored in data bases known as term banks.",
        "Since concepts are the starting point for all practical terminology work, and since concepts are the building-blocks of knowledge, it follows that terminology is a very knowledge-intensive activity: describing concepts involves acquiring knowledge about their characteristics, and naming concepts involves matching conceptual characteristics with linguistic forms (i.e. terms).",
        "In fact, terminology is somewhat of a misnomer: most fundamentally, it is not the study of \"terms\", but rather of the knowledge conveyed by the terms.",
        "Given the crucial role of knowledge in terminology, one needs to address the question of what kind of knowledge to include in term banks.",
        "In the related discipline of lexicography, the same question, formulated in relation to dictionaries and lexicons, has resulted in the long-standing debate about differences between lexical-semantic (i.e. linguistic) and encyclopedic (i.e. world, extra-linguistic) knowledge (1).",
        "One viewpoint has been that dictionaries and encyclopedias should be conceived as distinct entities - hence the apothegm \"dictionaries are about words, encyclopedias are about things\".",
        "Meaning-Text (MT) Lexicography (Mel'cuk 1988a/b), for example, makes a strict distinction between lexical-semantic and encyclopedic knowledge on the basis of semantic features: those which are necessary and sufficient (in the mathematical sense) to a definition are lexical-semantic, while those that are superfluous are encylopedic, and banned from",
        "definitions.",
        "A contrasting point of view, expressed for example by McArthur (1986:pp.",
        "102-109) is that for certain purposes, it may be useful to produce a hybrid of dictionary and encyclopedia - in other words, an encyclopedic dictionary.",
        "McArthur proposes that the dictionary-encyclopedia relationship be seen as a continuum rather than a dichotomy, and proposes the term micro-lexicography to designate the activity dealing with \"the world of words...\", and the term macro-lexicography to designate the activity which \"shades out into the world of things and subjects, and centres on compendia of knowledge...\".",
        "Depending on the lexicographic framework and the intended user of the dictionary, a strict differentiation between lexical-semantic and encyclopedic knowledge can be not only theoretically interesting, but also practically relevant: in the MT framework, for example, it underlies virtually all aspects of lexicographic methodology.",
        "Learners' dictionaries, on the other hand, whether they are aimed at learners of the mother tongue (i.e. children's dictionaries) or learners of a foreign language, typically feature encyclopedic characteristics, such as pictures and a rich supply of examples, that are intended to supplement definitions.",
        "Furthermore, the definitions themselves may include information that exceeds the bounds of \"necessary and sufficient\".",
        "The lexical-semantic vs. encyclopedic debate is pertinent to terminology since this discipline is closely linked to lexicography in purpose and method.",
        "In our view, terminology is clearly macro-lexicographic (to use McArthur's term) in orientation: term banks must include not only necessary and sufficient information about concepts, but also a certain amount of encyclopedic information as well.",
        "The following are just some of the reasons for our view: Relationship to specialized domains.",
        "Terminology is closely related to the specialized domains of activity whose lexica it describes.",
        "This is reflected in the basic organization of term banks according to specialized domains (i.e. subject fields).",
        "Until recently, most terminology work was done by domain experts, and the increasing numbers of terminologists who are not domain experts still consider consultation with experts to be crucial to their work.",
        "One of the goals of terminology is to provide assistance in the ordering and use of terms within specialized domains.",
        "Because of its relationship to languages for special purposes (LSPs), terminology has a need for subject classification and thesaural structure.",
        "In other words, it is closely linked to information science, with which it shares tools such as keywords, indexes and thesauri.",
        "The role of term banks as learning tools.",
        "Although term banks can be consulted by users with a wide range of domain expertise, by far the bulk of users are not domain experts.",
        "The largest user group has always been translators, who consult term banks not only for strictly linguistic information (e.g. part-of-speech, morphology, target-language equivalent), but also for conceptual information (e.g. conceptual characteristics, relations to other concepts), since it is well known that a certain depth of understanding of the domain is necessary to use its terminology correctly.",
        "Term banks can be seen as learning tools for the terminologists themselves, for example, when they are assigned a new field in which they have little knowledge, or when they are working in a field that is highly influenced by neighbouring fields with which they are not very familiar.",
        "Because of the teaching role of term banks, definitions are often complemented by examples of terms in context, much in the same way that learners' dictionaries are.",
        "Like encyclopedias, terminological publications often include pictures and diagrams.",
        "The multilingual aspect of terminology.",
        "All the large term banks that currently exist are multilingual, and this tendency will most likely remain in the face of the increasing importance of international communication for trade and knowledge communication.",
        "It is well known that establishing lexical equivalence between different languages is often impossible on the basis of lexical-semantic information alone.",
        "To take a well-known example from general language, the word river is defined in Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary as \"a natural stream of water of considerable volume\".",
        "French, however, distinguishes between flowing bodies of water that empty into the ocean (fleuve)",
        "and those that empty into a lake or another flowing body of water (riviere) - information that would be considered encyclopedic if one applied the necessary-and-sufficient rule.",
        "The need for multifunctional term banks.",
        "In keeping with the increasing emphasis on the shareability of lexical resources in general, term banks will have to aim at meeting the needs of more and more user types, including machines (Freibott and Heid 1990, McNaught 1990, Meyer 1991).",
        "Machine uses (e.g. machine translation, expert systems, NL interfaces to databases) will require very large quantities of explicitly represented conceptual information, since they do not possess much of the world knowledge that humans know implicitly.",
        "Because of the important encyclopedic dimension of terminology, we feel that a term bank can be conceived as a kind of knowledge base, and we are currently in the process of designing a prototype knowledge-based term bank, called COGNITERM, in the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the University of Ottawa, Canada.",
        "COGNITERM will be constructed using a knowledge engineering tool called CODE (Conceptually Oriented Design Environment, Skuce et al.",
        "1989), that has already been tested in two terminology-intensive environments, where a number of small knowledge bases (several hundred concepts) were constructed.",
        "Before discussing the research in progress for the COGNITERM project (Section 3), we will briefly describe some of the knowledge management needs that our research is aiming to fill."

      "text": [
        "As explained above, the knowledge management problem in terminology is heightened by the fact that persons doing terminology need to manage both lexical-semantic and encyclopedic knowledge.",
        "This problem is further complicated by the fact that terminology is a very heterogeneous discipline, since the naming and description of specialized concepts can be carried out in a wide spectrum of working environments, dictating various types of knowledge management support.",
        "At one end of this spectrum is what we might call the most \"pure\" form of terminology, namely terminology practised as a distinct specialization.",
        "In this type of environment, we find persons officially designated as terminologists, often with professional training and/or certification in terminology (2), following a controlled methodology (3).",
        "At the other end of the spectrum we find a much more \"casual\" form of terminology as it is practised as a component of document-production.",
        "Here, the naming and description of concepts is carried out at various \"links\" in a \"chain\" of activities, which can include product design specification, technical writing (e.g. user manuals), revision, proofreading, translation, management information, etc.",
        "Normally, many of the persons involved in these activities have no specialized training in terminology, their methodology can be highly informal, and there may be no centralized repository for the terminological data.",
        "The technology and methodology we are developing for terminology-oriented knowledge management support are intended to be generic enough to be useful across the spectrum of terminology environments.",

        "The terminological data that is collected can be conceptual or linguistic (5): conceptual data includes information such as subject-field labels, synonyms and antonyms, definitions, and equivalents in the second language; linguistic data includes information such as part-of-speech, morphological anomalies, usage labels, and idiomatic expressions.",
        "Terminologists in environments such as this one most often work thematically (6): in other words, they collect and describe (as exhaustively as practical constraints allow) the specialized terms used in a given field.",
        "The major challenge of terminology is conceptual, not linguistic: terminologists are trained in linguistics and thus are properly prepared for the linguistic dimension of their task; in contrast, they are not normally domain experts, yet they require a substantial amount of expert knowledge in order to do their work.",
        "In other words, the major difficulty is pinning down the meanings of terms.",

        "They begin to familiarize themselves with the general knowledge structures of the field, trying to determine its boundaries, subdivisions, and areas of overlap with other fields (for multidisciplinary fields).",
        "Often, at this stage, terminologists will sketch out these \"skeletal\" knowledge structures in the form of a concept network.",

        "Having a general idea of the hierarchical structure of the field also helps orient the process of documentation selection since terminologists tend to proceed from general to more specific literature.",
        "Once a preliminary corpus is obtained, their general knowledge of the domain provides terminologists with a yardstick for judging its quality.",
        "It also helps them classify documentation according to subfield.",
        "In multilingual terminology, classification according to subfield is particularly important: to \"manage\" the large amounts of documentation to be scanned (see 2.1.2 below), terminologists very often work on one subfield at a time, in one language and then in the other, before proceeding to another subfield.",
        "Finally, these preliminary conceptual activities provide terminologists with the conceptual framework and basic terminology needed for communicating with librarians and other documentation resource persons, as well as with experts.",

        "For example, a domain expert or a terminologist who is highly experienced in a domain will have a different set of options than a learner.",
        "In the current version of CODE, we have also placed a strong emphasis on graphical representation.",
        "The system can easily produce various types of semantic net diagrams, for both hierarchical and non-hierarchical relations.",
        "The graphical display updates automatically when changes are made to the knowledge base, and offers mechanisms for focussing on certain parts of the knowledge base, highlighting special concepts (e.g. concepts that are uncertain, unconfirmed, etc.",
        "), and comparing and contrasting knowledge substructures.",
        "In CODE Version 4, Hypercard-like bit map images will be available, so that one can ask of a term \"show me one\", or of an image \"what is this called?\" Access to, and navigation through, the knowledge base.",
        "Since a knowledge base incorporates large amounts of encyclopedic information, and since different users will",
        "require different information, it is important that the knowledge be easily accessible and navigable.",
        "A CODE knowledge base is essentially a hierarchically organized hypertext-like system, incorporating the notion of property inheritance.",
        "One may navigate in whatever manner is appropriate, with typical retracing abilities of hypertext systems.",
        "Unlike traditional term banks, in which access is strictly terminological (i.e. one must know a term in order to get conceptual information about it), CODE allows conceptual characteristics to be entry-points into the knowledge, so that one can ask questions like \"what is the term for the machine with function X\", \"what is the term for the material with physical properties X, Y, Z?\" Access to, and navigation through, the knowledge is facilitated by the graphical component described above, and also through a browsing capability.",
        "In Version 4, the browser will use a basic window whose behaviour is modelled after an outline processor, with the ability to dynamically expand and contract tree-structures.",
        "The user can easily tailor-make the browser to suit a given need.",
        "To facilitate the use of terms as entry-points into the knowledge, the current version of CODE has a search/rename browser that permits scanning of the entire knowledge base for every occurrence of a term, and can be restricted to certain contexts (e.g. concept names, names of conceptual characteristics, descriptions of conceptual characteristics) to speed up the search.",
        "Version 4 will include a clearly defined set of terminological \"status levels\", by which we mean attributes of a term such as how it is used (e.g. as a concept name or the name of a conceptual characteristic), whether it is defined or not, whether it is used in definitions but is not a knowledge base concept or property, etc.",
        "Informal, trial-and-error knowledge experimentation.",
        "The system contains features, which we are still developing, for managing knowledge that is in different states of \"clarity\" (for want of a better term).",
        "Lack of clarity may be due to several causes: for example, a terminologist may be unclear about a concept because he/she does not have the domain expertise to understand it properly; a technical writer, translator, etc.",
        "in the document-production chain may be unclear about a concept because people at various preceding links in the chain have used a term inconsistently; a concept may be very new (e.g. in the case of neologisms) and thus intrinsically unclear; and so on.",
        "In all these situations, we find problems such as what to call a concept, what the superconcept is, what subconcepts it has, what characteristics it has, what the similar concepts are.",
        "CODE permits rapid entry of hunches, guesses, trials, etc., followed by experimentation with the consequences of entering new knowledge.",
        "For example, superconcept links may be changed on the graph just by dragging, and the consequences can be seen immediately in textual or graphical form.",
        "One may ask for \"similar\" concepts, or potential terminological conflicts.",
        "Previously made changes (up to three) can be discarded in one click.",
        "Multidimensionality.",
        "It is well known that concepts and entire knowledge structures can be \"seen\" from various \"viewpoints\" (18), which correspond roughly to the needs or interests of the knowledge base user.",
        "CODE offers a \"masking\" facility that allows one to restrict what is visible in the knowledge base by Boolean conditions on concepts and characteristics.",
        "For example, different users might require different types of knowledge about a certain laboratory procedure.",
        "CODE allows one user to say \"show me only things about this laboratory procedure related to the tools that are required\", and another to say \"show me only things related to the types of organisms that the procedure can identify\".",
        "The masking facility also allows the notion of viewpoint to be extended to include a notion of depth of domain expertise.",
        "For example, the user may request information about the laboratory procedure that would be of interest (and understandable) to a beginning biology student, or to a seasoned researcher.",
        "Ranking of conceptual characteristics.",
        "We are currently investigating the usefulness of ranking characteristics according to where they fall in the lexical-semantic/encyclopedic continuum.",
        "For certain purposes (e.g. users with different levels of domain expertise), it may be useful to at least distinguish between characteristics that are necessary and sufficient, those that are encyclopedic but useful to establishing interlingual",
        "equivalence, and finally, all other encyclopedic characteristics.",
        "We are also investigating an algorithm proposed by Maybury (1990) for ranking characteristics according to concept similarity on the one hand (e.g. similarity of characteristics of coordinate concepts), and prototypicality on the other (e.g. the degree to which a concept's characteristics are reflected in its subordinate concepts), which offers the possibility of generating definitions of the genus-differentia type automatically.",
        "Multiple knowledge bases.",
        "Facilities for managing multiple knowledge bases (under development for Version 4) are required in order to work in multidisciplinary fields, and in order to work multilingually (since knowledge structures rarely correspond perfectly from one language to another).",
        "Both situations require support for isolating areas of correspondence and non-correspondence, and for comparing and contrasting.",
        "Multilingual work will require support for automatically generating some knowledge substructures (i.e. those that do correspond for the most part); eventually, this would involve a machine translation component.",
        "CODE already includes a general high-level ontology, which is being regularly refined; it will eventually serve as a basis for integrating knowledge bases.",
        "Quality control.",
        "The envisaged use of the system by various persons in a terminology environment necessitates a sophisticated capacity for quality control.",
        "CODE offers a capacity for detecting conceptual inconsistencies of various types, carrying out type checking, flagging entries as to source, entry person, date, state of correctness, etc.",
        "Database-like retrieval facilities permit queries such as \"show me all entries about laser printers made by X since last month and not yet approved\".",
        "In order to ensure terminological consistency, CODE offers a number of features for assisting users in naming a conceptual characteristic (a common terminological problem in knowledge base building).",
        "The system can display all currently used names of similar properties (e.g. all properties belonging to the same category of property), and will prompt if this property name has already been used elsewhere."
