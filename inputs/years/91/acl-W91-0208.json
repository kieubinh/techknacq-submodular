        "Drawing on a growing database of systematic relationships between word-senses, the authors argue that a significant class of these represent Lexical Implication Rules, a set of formal rules within the domain of lexical semantics; these they distinguish from other types of semantic relation more closely dependent on metaphor and world-knowledge.",
        "Some formal properties of Lexical Implication Rules are proposed, as evidence of their linguistic, rather than real-world, nature.",
        "1.",
        "Introduction: Lexical Implication Rules",
        "It is a truism that people, in interpreting and producing language, make use of both linguistic and real-world knowledge.",
        "We contend that part of that linguistic knowledge is a knowledge of lexical semantics.",
        "Lexical semantics is discernible from real world knowledge, because the inferences used are in certain cases formally distinct from commonsense inferences and from metaphors based on analogies.",
        "That is the position we attempt to substantiate in this paper.",
        "The focus of this paper is a series of arguments justifying the existence of Lexical Implication Rules (henceforth \"LIRs\").",
        "Such rules in principle generate derived lexical entries from base lexical entries.",
        "We contend that they are bona fide rules in the formal grammar of languages involved; it is wrong to see them as mere reflections, quasi-systematic effects of applying the formal structures of a language in a real-world context.",
        "As evidence of this we adduce formal properties of the incidence of some of the rules.",
        "We postulate:",
        "• that application of the rules is sometimes blocked by the preexisting topography of the lexicon (pre-emption); • that formal features of the words involved, apparently unrelated to the semantic effect of the rules, may inhibit LIR application; • that semantic features of the words input, apparently unrelated to the semantic effect of the rules themselves , may similarly inhibit LIR application; • that some rules are specific to particular languages, and indeed to specific dialects of a given language.",
        "All these facts seem incompatible with the hypothesis that LIRs are side-effects of the the interaction of language use with speakers' knowledge of the real world.",
        "They call for a structured theory of lexical semantics, and this paper is intended as a contribution to building such a theory.'",
        "The position outlined here arises from current work on the analysis and categorization of a database of well over 100 instances of predictable lexical and semantic alternations.",
        "These instances of systematic word-sense relationship are hard to categorize fully, but the majority appear to have properties which show them not to be mere corollaries of speakers' free play with analogy and terse assumption of real-world situations.",
        "They have something in common with the set of Lexical Rules used in Lexical Functional Grammar (cf Bresnan (1982)), but are primarily conceptual rather than syntactic.",
        "While it is already clear that there is great variety in the theoretical status of the rules in this set, we shall argue that there is clear evidence that at least some of these rules, the LIRs, must be defined as applying to word-meanings; they are not derivable as generalizations over world-knowledge, or facts about the world or the society described, but must be stated in a full grammar of the language in which they occur.",
        "The significance of this is more than a theoretical nicety.",
        "It is important to computational linguistics to include these facts in its lexicon, rather than as a special kind of world knowledge, since the former will be in general more restricted and hence more manageable."

        "English also has such a set of adjectives but they are few, and confined to a learned register (e.g. matutinal, nocturnal ); the major translation equivalents in English are attributive uses of nouns (e.g. morning papers, noonday sun, afternoon tea etc.).",
        "Ancient Greek goes on to use its temporal adjectives predicatively, with the sense of adverbial qualifiers of the action predicated: e.g. orthrios he:ko:n - coming in the morning (Plato, Protagoras 313B) egre:i mese:mbrinos - you wake at noon (Aristophanes, Wasps 774) eudon pannukhioi - they slept all night long (Homer, Iliad 2.2) Evidently, there is no such predicative use of English temporal adjectives or nouns: prepositional phrases (as used above in the glosses) are the closest that can be offered.",
        "15 Hence there is an adverbial sense of Greek temporal adjectives, used predicatively, which has no parallel in English.",
        "A neat formulation of the case would thus be to formulate an Ancient Greek LIR, absent in English, which goes: LW Time Predication (16) ADJ : temporal, 4)(head-NP) -> ADJ predicative: tempora1,4:0(head-S)16 To avoid positing an LIR here would take some special pleading.",
        "In this case one would need to argue that the distinction of senses made in English is simply absent in Greek, so that temporal adjectives are available to do more promiscuous service.",
        "This would amount to saying that Ancient Greek simply made no linguistic distinction between assigning a time-reference to an action and assigning a time-reference to the agent of that action.",
        "However, our point here is not to argue for a specific analysis of the Greek facts.",
        "It is simply to point out that sense-shifts of the type that LIRs represent are sometimes language-specific.",
        "Either we can encapsulate the differences in a single LW, present in language A, absent in B.",
        "Or else we can posit a different assignment of semantic primitives, with B being systematically stricter in the senses allowed for a given class of words (-- in this case, English will not allow its temporal adjectives to assign a time-reference to a whole action).",
        "Either way, we shall have gained some concrete evidence on linguistic semantics.",
        "What we are not free to claim is that pragmatic considerations alone can resolve such systematic differences between languages.",
        "A similar cross-linguistic argument for the linguistic reality of LIRs can be made from dialectal differences within the same language.",
        "Consider for example the treatment of \"day-nouns\" in Standard British English as against their treatment in various other dialects, including Cockney and General American.",
        "Whereas the indexical nouns today, tonight, yesterday, tomorrow occur as adverbs in all dialects, the days of the week Sunday through Saturday cannot",
        "occur adverbially in Standard British English: he came *(on) Tuesday.",
        "To account for this, one could posit an LIR Day Noun - Adverb , with a more restricted domain in Standard British English than in the other dialects.",
        "But to posit this is already to accept that the LIR is a feature of the grammar of English.",
        "Contrastive analysis, whether applying within a language or between languages, will, we expect, continue to raise a host of problems for any approach which tries to account for the fine detail of semantics as side-effects of pragmatics.",
        "The real world, and the human condition, is not so different from one language-community to another (let alone between dialect-areas).",
        "But as languages and their grammars differ, so does their lexical semantics."
