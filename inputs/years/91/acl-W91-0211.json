        "Lexical knowledge is knowledge that can be expressed in words.",
        "Circular though this may seem, we think it provides a perfectly reasonable point of departure, for, in line with a long-standing philosophical tradition it posits communicability as the most characteristic aspect of lexical knowledge.",
        "Knowledge representation systems should be designed so as to fit lexical data rather than the other way round.",
        "A broad view of the possible scope of lexical semantics would thus be one which tries to chart out the systematic, generalizable aspects of word meanings, and of the relations between words, drawing on readily accessible sources of lexical knowledge, such as machine readable dictionaries, encyclopedias, and representative corpora, coupled with the kind of analytic apparatus that is needed to fruitfully explore such sources, for instance custom-built parsers to cope with dictionary definitions (Vossen 1990), statistical programs to deal with the distributional properties of lexical items in large corpora (Church & Hanks 1990) etc.",
        "At the same time this kind of massive data-acquisition should be made sensitive to the borders between perceptual experience, lexical knowledge and expert knowledge."

        "Many psychologists are quite content to declare that intelligence is what you measure by means of an intelligence test.",
        "In a somewhat similar way one could say that lexical knowledge is the kind of knowledge that can be expressed in words.",
        "An advantage of this position is that you can turn it round: knowledge that cannot be expressed in words is not lexical knowledge.",
        "A further advantage is that it automatically relates lexical knowledge to something that lends itself to intersubjective inspection: linguistic utterances.",
        "And yet another advantage is that it tells us how and where to look for typical expressions of lexical knowledge within the welter of linguistic utterances.",
        "In ever widening concentric circles, we can inspect: general dictionaries as sources of the lexical knowledge that is associated with the 'common core' vocabulary; encyclopedias for additional knowledge associated with many of the items contained in the dictionaries and for lexically expressed information about all kinds of facts and events; specialized dictionaries for more expert knowledge in specific domains; manuals, treatises, newspaper articles, speeches, broadcasts and so forth for yet more details on anything and everything that humans find worthwhile communicating about.",
        "In this paper we want to defend this point of view by making clear that all knowledge is necessarily dependent on representation.",
        "According to Dik (1986, 1989) this representation takes the form of either perceptual images or verbal structures (section 2).",
        "In section 3, we want to demonstrate that knowledge encoded in verbal structures is reducible to grammatical elements and lexical items (grammatical knowledge and lexical knowledge respectively).",
        "The insights gained from our work with machine readable dictionaries (MRDs) the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English, henceforth LDOCE, and the Van Dale dictionary of contemporary Dutch \"Groot Woordenboek van het Hedendaags Nederlands\", henceforth Van Dale, lead to the conclusion that lexical knowledge in the end is perceptual (in the form of primitive perceptual images) and grammatical (in the form of grammatical primitives).",
        "This makes all linguistically expressed knowledge ultimatily reducible to these primitives.",
        "Since only linguistic knowledge is communicable, part of all knowledge is thus private (at least the knowledge corresponding to perceptual images).",
        "The structure of lexical knowledge as it emerges from our work, suggests a view on lexical meaning as not defining the object a word stands for but as representing a typical (not necessarily unique) conceptualization of that object (section 4).",
        "This hypothesis about lexical knowledge leads to the conclusion (section 5) that there are differences between lexical knowledge and expert-domain knowledge, in that the objective of the former is the use of a word as a symbol for a conceptualization of an object, and the objective of the latter is to have knowledge on (all and any imaginable) properties of the object itself."

        "What is memorizable can be distinguished in perceptual information and conceptual knowledge.",
        "What we perceive is of course influenced by the concepts we have and, the other way round, concepts are partially based on our perception.",
        "Still there is a clear difference between perceptual information and conceptual representation in that the former is tied to the capacities of the sensory-apparatus and the latter to cognitive limitations to process information.",
        "In order to reduce the cognitive load of continuously processing and storing an enormous amount of data, the incoming information from the sensory apparatus is categorized in terms of more general concepts which as much as possible abstract from irrelevant details.",
        "By storing clusters of perceived features in terms of their conceptual categories all redundant information can be 'forgotten'.",
        "This process of categorization has been described by Rosch (1977) in terms of two contrastive principles: i. a concept aims at capturing as many features as possible shared by its instantiations; in other words to be as specific as possible.",
        "a concept aims at capturing as many instances as possible in order to reduce the number of needed categories; in other words to be as general as possible.",
        "Ideal categories are in balance with regard to both principles, and hence provide the most efficient unit to store information.",
        "The cognitive system will therefore probably represent incoming information as much as possible in terms of these ideal categories.",
        "These conceptual categories thus constitute the building blocks of accumulating knowledge shaping, and being shaped, by the ungoing processing of information.",
        "Any abstraction from actual experience, however, implies that there is some kind of representation system in which the concept is expressed.",
        "Without representation knowledge cannot exist because there is no way to generalize over the individual experiences.",
        "The category that represents all prototypical instances has to be 'named' somehow to be able to attach information to it that applies to all these instances.",
        "This dependence of knowledge or 'symbolization' has important consequences.",
        "As far as the above perceptual features are concerned there is evidence",
        "that they are at least stored in terms of so-called prototype images (this also is intended to hold for perceptions as \"smell\", \"emotions\", \"touch\", \"taste\", \"hearing\"; \"movement\").",
        "These are a kind of mental pictures which can 'be seen or experienced' through 'the mind's eye' and from which even inferences can be drawn (e.g. mental rotation tasks of three-dimensional objects having a two-dimensional representation, Shepard and Metzler 1977).",
        "Not all knowledge, however, deals with perceptual features and this non-perceptual knowledge is therefore not bound to the perceptual apparatus of people.",
        "Whatever perceptual features are stored by some prototypical image or mental picture of a 'bird', many of the corresponding concepts, for instance the fact that it is an 'animal' and therefore shares the feature 'living' with all other 'animals', cannot be captured by a purely perceptual image.",
        "Having a prototypical image of an 'animal' probably does not even make sense (although there may be a stereotypical best example of it, probably some kind of mammal), because instances of perceived 'animals' are more likely categorized in terms of more specific (and therefore more informative) categories.",
        "Non-perceptual facts, generalizing over individual cases, have to be represented by some other conceptual language than perceptual images (other examples of non-perceptual knowledge are e.g. \"social status\", \"kinship relations\", \"skills\", \"capacities\").",
        "Dik (1986, 1989, see also Weigand 1989, Meijs 1989) argues that any representation language for non-perceptual knowledge, in additi n to perceptual images, must be verbal for the following reasons: i.",

        "A word as such is no more than a vehicle of information within a particular context This does not necessarily imply that the 'meaning of a word' (the information it carries over) equals all the knowledge people have on the object or class of objects that is designated by that word, as is obvious (at least since Galileo) from the following examples:"

        "As a consequence of these different objectives of lexical and expert-domain knowledge, the connection between the different layers of knowledge, as represented in figure 1, is not allways that smooth.",
        "For some domains in which the process of lexicalization has clearly been triggered by the straightforward acquisition of knowledge through science and education, such as animal and plant names, there may be a rather regular connection between lexical, layman and expert knowledge in which more and more detailed information is added.",
        "As such part of the expert knowledge has become general lexical knowledge as well over time (perhaps a process in parallel to that of \"Gesunkenes Kulturgut\").",
        "However in many domains, and even in animal and plant names (e.g. compare the functional \"watchdog\", \"sheepdog\", \"pet\" with the different species of animal in terms of their constitution), other conceptualizations of objects cross-classify with e.g. expert knowledge.",

        "Although the expert's knowledge of \"water\" is more specific, the linguistic equipment to refer to \"water\" illustrates a greater variation in possible perspectives.",
        "In this sense, expert knowledge can be seen as more detailed and systematic subtype of lexical knowledge from a more restricted perspective.",
        "Where we expect that expert knowledge is exhaustive and defining, lexical knowledge thus is typical and associative but hardly ever exhaustive.",
