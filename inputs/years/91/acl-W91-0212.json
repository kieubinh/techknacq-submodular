        "In a recent paper Boguraev and Levin (1990) point out inadequacies in common conceptions of what a Lexical Knowledge Base (LKB) should be, inadequacies which stem from the assumption that a machine-readable dictionary (MRD) is not only the right source for acquisition of a lexicon but also the right model for its form.",
        "Their points about the kinds of generalizations that the standardly conceived LKB does not incorporate, especially if it is built from a dictionary source, are well-taken.",
        "They cite a need for the representation of various kinds of dynamic potential – specifically, the capacity to participate in predictable syntactic alternations and regular meaning extensions – which words of particular semantic classes possess in common, and which constitute the basis for lexical productivity.",
        "Representation of this kind of dynamic potential is missing from standard dictionaries, they suggest, because it is seen as being more predictable to a native speaker than are specific -nym relations.",
        "The same representation is missing from most LKBs both because it was not in the source dictionary and because it cannot be encoded in the usual LKB format.",
        "Boguraev and Levin conclude that the conception of the LKB must be extended to include both representation of the semantic classes whose members typically participate in these productive alternations and extensions, and sets of inference rules which capture the productive potential of members of those classes.",
        "They see this as a partial answer to the open-endedness problem; when a system of the sort they envision is given a new word, we need only specify its semantic class, and we will then have many aspects of both its syntactic and its meaning behavior in hand.",
        "However perhaps a more serious difficulty arising from the adoption of the dictionary as model for the lexicon, and one which Boguraev and Levin do not discuss, is the implicit assumption that the level of the word, as structurally defined, is a semantically well-defined level also.'",
        "In the sections that follow, I will examine this assumption from several angles.",
        "Section 2 reviews the semantic behavior of what are structurally words, 1Boguraev and Levin do mention the possibility that generalizations of the sort they require may hold only over partial nodes in a lexical network; this would seem to indicate that semantic classes may be defined in terms of bundles of features, only some of which might be relevant in determining the applicability of a given extension or alternation.",
        "illustrating cases where it seems to take more than one \"word\" to make a single meaning, and where a single \"word\" is semantically decomposable into several meaning components.",
        "Section 3 discusses the problem of extricating a functor's argument requirements from other aspects of its meaning.",
        "In Section 4 the discussion turns to difficulties inherent in distinguishing individual word senses.",
        "Sections 5 explores some possibilities for escaping from the dictionary model and solving some of these problems."

        "We are led as readers of English, and as dictionary users, to see white space between words as indicating a tangible boundary between units of some sort.",
        "We base much of our linguistic analysis on the assumption that there is such a thing as the \"word level\".",
        "If you go \"below\" this level of structure you are dealing with morphology or with lists of idiosyncratic information; \"above\" it is the level of syntax.",
        "Under this assumption semantics is also of two sorts: the largely classificatory operations of lexical semantics, and the compositional functions of syntactic structure-building.",
        "As a working assumption, this division of linguistic knowledge has some merit, and has allowed much useful work to proceed.",
        "But in fact, even on the most superficial examination of real language, it is common to find gross disruptions of this convenient pattern.",
        "Unfortunately, lexicalization is an arbitrary process even within a single language, and it is probably only the merest accident when it happens that an atomic chunk of meaning is linked bi-uniquely to an invariant chunk of phonology.",
        "The more common run of structure-meaning correspondences are much more complicated.",
        "For one thing, combinations of two or more surface words often function synchronically as more or less absolute semantic units.",
        "These collocations may be able to be taken apart for syntactic purposes, but semantically they are not decomposable; they link to meanings which are more than, less than, or different from, the sum of the meanings of their individual parts.",
        "The commonly cited examples are phrasal verbs ('hold up', 'kid oneself' 'brim over with') and idiomatic expressions of various sorts ('house of cards', 'lie low', 'eat [someone] out of house and home').",
        "The difficulties here, including locating the boundaries of true idiomaticity, are much discussed, and I will not dwell on them here.",
        "Second, even what are structurally single words can exhibit the kind of composition-ality ordinarily expected in syntactic constructions.",
        "The most interesting category here is that of lexicalized deverbal compounds, such as clambake, carwash, ill-advised, and time-saving.",
        "Roeper and Siegel (1978), and Selkirk (1982), among others, have explored the compositional regularities found in this highly productive component of the lexicon, and found that the construction and interpretation of novel verbal compounds is constrained according to criteria whose canonical field of application is syntax.",
        "Both these crossover phenomena can be accommodated structurally by means of analytical tricks of one sort or another.",
        "We have ways of representing verb-particle combinations, for example, so that they are looked up in the same fashion as structurally single words, even while their parts can be separated by theoretically indefinite stretches of the sentence.",
        "It is also possible to install vestiges of verbal structure into the representation of",
        "derivationally deverbal items, so that the regularities which they exhibit in compounding are predicted.",
        "A more severe problem than either of these for locating the \"level\" of the \"word\" is exemplified by these examples of perfectly legitimate paraphrase (from Talmy, 1985): be of interest to somebody = interest somebody carry out an investigation into something = investigate something Certainly we would want a natural language understanding system to arrive at the same conclusions from either variant in each pair.",
        "It is not at all clear, however, whether we should cause the single-word versions to be represented as decomposable into the phrasal expressions, or analyze the phrasal expressions as stylistically or pragmatically inspired expansions of the more succinct variants, or take some other other tack, such as just finding a way to list both variants as meaning the same thing.3 Even when they are not so naturally expanded to phrasal versions, many – maybe most, depending on the granularity of the analysis – of what we consider to be monomorphemic words have flagrantly compositional meanings; the most timeworn examples are kill (=-'cause-to-die') and other verbs in which a change-of-state (one meaning component) is brought about by a cause (the other meaning component).",
        "Accurate analysis of event descriptions containing such words would seem to require such sub-word semantic analysis, whether it is done as such or as an external listing of presuppositions and entailments of the description as a whole.",
        "The trouble, however, is sorting out some set of possible meaning components which is adequate to the compositional task and yet smaller (preferably both in cardinality and in size required for storage) than the set of English words.",
        "Compare, for example, the pairs kill / murder and send_away / banish.",
        "Both pairs incorporate an additional meaning element in the second word of each pair which is at least somewhat similar in both cases; it would mean something like 'with malice aforethought and with the intention of instituting a permanent solution to a perceived problem and probably done with heightened actional intensity'.",
        "It is possible that we could find other pairs of lexical expressions whose only difference in meaning is the presence of this additional element in one of them; this would be a good indication that a productive meaning component was at work.",
        "But if this component itself can only be expressed in English by means of a very long phrase, we have a considerable difficulty of representation.",
        "It is not that the notions of \"word\" and \"morpheme\" make no sense, where the latter is defined as \"the minimal meaningful unit of language\" (Pei and Gaynor, 1980:140); rather, both are invaluable from the vantagepoint of surface structure.",
        "But when we use semantics instead as the starting point, and we define something called a \"semanteme\",4 say, as \"the minimal unit of meaning that has a sound\", then it is not at all clear that the two constructs would meet in the middle and we would arrive at the same set of words again.",
        "Nor is this to say that the expanse of meaning encompassed by a structural word cannot be a unit.",
        "It must be true, as Jackendoff (1983, 1990) claims, that linguistic categories correspond fairly directly to conceptual categories.",
        "However his formulation of the mapping leaves the status of the structural word itself somewhat indeterminate: 30ne of the pervasive fallacies inherent in the notion of the \"level\" of the \"word\" is that below this everything must be listed, while above this level everything must be representable as sets of rules.",
        "4 My apologies to anyone who has used this made-up term previously for a different purpose.",
        "Every content-bearing major phrasal constituent of a sentence (S, NP, AP, PP, etc.)",
        "corresponds to a conceptual constituent of some major conceptual category.",
        "(1990:44) [emphasis added] We are still left with the question of the proper representation of lexical semantics in a lexicon when the borders of what is \"lexical\" are so fuzzy."

        "The problem of the imperfect mapping between structural words and atomic or even bounded meanings extends into what might have been expected to be one of the simpler aspects of representing lexical semantics, that of the exposition of argument structure.",
        "Attempts to assign thematic role structure to a wide range of verbs run immediately into two major problems.",
        "One is that, as Jackendoff (1990) points out, it may be only part of the meaning of a verb which is responsible for assigning a particular thematic role to a given argument.",
        "For instance, the verb pass (in the construction pass the house) is analyzed as incorporating a Path functor, similar in its function to a surface preposition by, which is part of the meaning of the verb.",
        "What appears in surface structure therefore as the object of pass is better analyzed semantically as the object of the underlying by; this is why there is no very satisfactory thematic role label for the object of pass.",
        "It is also possible for a verb to assign a role to only part of the referent of an argument.",
        "For example, the verb climb, in climb the mountain, has as its Goal not the mountain but only the top of the mountain.",
        "In general, Jackendoff's arguments that the standard conception of thematic roles requires an accompanying commitment to lexical decomposition are difficult to refute.",
        "At the same time, thematic role labels, or something like them, are necessary for the description of events whether we are willing to commit to lexical decomposition or not.",
        "The fact that the set of labels does not seem to be able to be cleanly inventoried at the level of the structural word does not change the fact that some such set of labels is necessary to let us individuate event types, that is, to distinguish events in which 'X verbs Y' from ones in which 'Y verbs X' (Carlson 1984).",
        "While we may not be able to arrive at a satisfactorily comprehensive set of labels without complete semantic decomposition, we must have a sufficient set to be able to extract the basic 'who did what to whom' structure from a sentence.",
        "However, finding a boundary between the semantic contribution of the verb itself and that of its expected arguments is often practically impossible.",
        "Boguraev and Levin's contention that semantic class determines syntactic behavior, while arguable on other grounds, surely stems from the accurate observation that verbs which describe similar situations naturally tend to govern similar numbers of arguments in similar ways.5 Par-5Unfortunately, the arbitrariness of lexicalization rears its ugly head here also, and the notion of \"semantic class\" necessary to make this linkage between syntactic behavior and meaning may be somewhat circular; that is, in doubtful cases will we decide whether an item is a change-of-state verb on the basis of whether it undergoes the causative/inchoative alternation?",
        "Carlson and Tanenhaus (1988) would not have been able to construct their experiments comparing the effects of thematic structure ambiguity with those of semantic ambiguity, if there did not exist verbs of the same semantic class which do not share the same possibilities for thematic structure alternation.",
        "An example pair from their study is load / fill: load / fill the truck (with bricks) load / *fill the bricks",
        "ticularly where it is true that a whole semantic class of verbs exhibits similar syntactic behavior, it becomes extremely difficult to separate argument structure as an independent phenomenon from the core meaning,df there is such a thing, of the assigning verb.",
        "What would it mean to 'eat' without 'eating something'? – it seems pointless even to consider such a question.",
        "Even the definition of individual thematic roles is susceptible to influence from the meanings of expected fillers for those roles; this fact, along with the the difficulty of discovering how these roles are assigned to arguments by word-level functors, may help to explain the persistent lack of consensus on the proper set of thematic roles, as exemplified in Wilkins (1988) and elsewhere.",
        "Jackendoff faces one aspect of this problem by removing Agent from the set of primary thematic roles; rather, Agent and Patient are derived role types, designated on a separate Action Tier and superimposed on basic thematic structure through an interaction of the semantics of the verb and the nature of the entities filling potential Agent and Patient role slots.",
        "That is, a sentence with kill always implies a killer, but it has an Agent just if the killer is an entity capable of Agent-like activity, for instance a person.",
        "Syntax too has an effect on the definition of thematic roles, and that in turn has a pervasive effect on verbal semantics.",
        "Talmy (1985) discusses the fact that subjecthood, because of its frequent association with Agenthood, \"may tend to confer upon any semantic category expressed in it some initiatory or instigative characteristics.\"",
        "Consequently a Stimulus expressed as Subject may be seen to be acting purposefully or at least actively upon the Experiencer, while where the Experiencer is Subject, \"the mental event may be felt to arise autonomously and to direct itself outward toward a selected object.\"",
        "Verbs of experience whose canonical syntactic pattern includes either Stimulus or Experiencer as Subject (for example, please and admire, respectively) are thus under the influence of this effect in one direction or the other; this may be one source of the ambiguity in the sentence 'He pleases me' and hence in the verb please."

        "Moreover, where the introduce-ee is also a person as in (4), (or where the single Object of introduce refers to more than one person) the introduction becomes reciprocal; the \"actional content\" of the verb, in Talmy's words, has been doubled.",
        "In (5), the meaning extension present in (2), (3), and (4) is further specialized so that the implicit Goal location is not only a \"recognition space\", but is understood to be the recognition space belonging collectively to the individuals making up a market.",
        "We make this additional extension, however, not because we are now using a different sense of the verb introduce, but simply because of what we know about products.",
        "That is, our understanding of the type of space in which the introduction is effected is governed by both the core meaning of the verb – we know introduce means putting something into some space just as we know that eating means eating something – and the semantic content of its first argument.",

        "If we try to decide then what the senses of introduce are, as the dictionary model would suggest that we should do, we can take several tacks.",
        "We could just take a dictionary's word for the number and definitions of separate senses (leaving aside for the moment the problems of mapping between the different sense divisions of different dictionaries), but then we have clearly missed a generalization about the extensions of meaning possible for the verb introduce and others like it.",
        "We could distinguish separate senses on the basis of the use in some of the examples of into and in others of to, but that distinction cross-cuts what are clearly more important semantic distinctions.",
        "On the basis of the thematic structure that the verb introduce instantiates, which is more or less the same for all six examples, we might say that it has only one sense.8 7 This is a legitimate and extremely common meaning extension, from physical space to abstract space; in fact it is exactly the sort of regularity that a LKB should include among its lexical rules.",
        "8 The one problematical construction here would be the one with a plural Theme and no explicit Goal, as in 'I introduced Joe and Pete.'",
        "In this case, as noted above, the introduction is reciprocal and therefore the thematic structure would apparently have to be copied over into another, simultaneous action.",
        "Likewise it would decompose in every case to something like CAUSE (GO (X (FROM (outside-some-space))(TO (inside-some-space)))) Under this analysis it is the characteristics of 'X', the locatum, and of the respective entities which serve as Goal that differentiate senses; sentence (1) makes reference to a real thing and a physical space, (2), (3), and (4) refer to recognizable entities and individual cognitive space, and (5) and (6) refer to something which can be sold and a particular kind of collective cognitive space.",

        "The next set of lookup levels described, in which the structural word is no longer the primary entity but just a handle for indexing graphs, can be built on the basis of knowledge assembled from large volumes of text; the methodology employed by Smadja and McKeown (1990) would be one of many techniques possible for obtaining and organizing the various levels of model graphs.",

        "The notion that the level of \"the word\", as structurally defined, is the appropriate starting place for semantic representation, has been implicit in the design of most lexical knowledge bases.",
        "The use of machine-readable dictionaries as a source of lexical knowledge reinforces this notion, at the cost of considerable descriptive loss.",
        "This discussion has also revealed a further detrimental assumption fostered by the use of the dictionary as the model for the lexicon: the idea that a single store of lexical knowledge, with a single lookup function and a unified structure, is the necessary mechanism for bringing word meanings into sentence analysis.",
        "On the contrary, the multifaceted semantic behavior of the structural units we call \"words\" requires a base of knowledge consisting of multiple knowledge stores, each organized in a way that is appropriate to the knowledge it contains and the stage of processing to which it must contribute.",
        "The structural word can be used as the indexing key which relates the separate, differently structured stores, but it need not be the basic currency of all of \"lexical\" semantics.",
        "9 One or more of these levels of distillation would presumably be equivalent to the single set of canonical graphs envisioned by Sowa (1984)."
