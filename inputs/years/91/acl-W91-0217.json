      "text": [
        "In order to cope with the task of building large computational lexicons where, to be able to process real texts, hundreds of thousands of words are necessary and, moreover, where also semantic information is made explicit for very large portions of the lexicon, the notion of \"reusability\" has become a central notion in the field of computational lexicography.",
        "This concept came out at the Grosseto Workshop (1986) on \"Automating the Lexicon\", sponsored by the EC (see Walker, Zampolli, Calzolari, forthcoming), where, among the set of recommendations, there was that of designing \"large reusable, multifunctional, precompetitive, multilingual linguistic resources\".",
        "Reusable must be interpreted in two main senses: reusablei.",
        ": to exploit and reuse lexical information implicitly or explicitly present in preexisting lexical resources (MRDs, terminological DBs, textual corpora, etc.)",
        "as an aid to construct large computational lexicons of the type reusable_2; reusable_2: to construct Computational Lexicons in such a way that various users (different NLP systems - in different theoretical frameworks and for different applications - , but also human users such as lexicographers, linguists, common users) can extract - with appropriate interfaces - relevant lexical information.",
        "Current work on Computational Lexicons can be divided into two major types, each corresponding to the two meanings above: reusable_l and reusable_2.",
        "ACQUILEX, an ESPRIT BRA project, can be seen as the prototype of the first of these main streams of research, linked with the notion 'reusable-1', while other projects as e.g. Eurotra-7 insert themselves in the second sense of the 'reusability' concept.",
        "2 MRDs as implicit Knowledge Bases ACQUILEX (see Boguraev et al.",
        "1988) focuses its research effort in developing techniques and methodologies for utilising and interpreting existing machine-readable dictionaries (MRD) to construct components for NLP systems.",
        "The main focus of the project is in the extraction of lexical – syntactic and semantic – information from multiple machine-readable dictionaries in a multilingual context with the overall goal of constructing a single multilingual lexical knowledge base (LKB).",
        "The dictionaries we are actually using in the project are: two monolingual English, two Italian, one Dutch, one Spanish, one bilingual Italian - English, one Dutch - English.",
        "The information extracted is not only the information which is already explicit in MRDs (word-lists, part-of-speech, etc.",
        "), but mainly the information which in MRDs is only implicitly present and not directly and immediately accessible (mostly semantic information, such as semantic taxonomies, other semantic relations, argument structures, etc.).",
        "In the final LKB prototype it will be possible to \"navigate\" within the lexicon with access also through concepts and semantic relations.",
        "In this approach it is considered possible a procedural exploitation of the full range of semantic information implicitly contained in MRDs.",
        "The dictionary is therefore considered in this framework as a primary source of \"basic general knowledge\", and main objectives are word-sense acquisition and knowledge organization.",
        "The main sources of this information are natural language definitions.",
        "The reasons of their use can be found in the following aspects: i) the lexicographic tradition has exerted a (usually unconscious) control over the defining vocabulary (statement made really explicit only in LDOCE) and the schemata of defining formulas; ii) the texts of definitions do not describe singular objects or events but \"typical\" ones; iii) lexicographers have translated the concepts in their mind into definitions, and we can try to move back along this path from definitions to concept acquisition; iv) the definitions incorporate a naif view of the semantic and world-knowledge information attached to lexical entries.",
        "The goal of ACQUILEX is the formalization of this basic general knowledge (which can also be considered as a prerequisite to domain-specific knowledge) in the form of concepts and semantic relations.",
        "The method is heuristic and mainly inductive, through progressive generalization from the common elements.",
        "The main themes of research connected to this goal of knowledge acquisition are the following:",
        "• the design of procedures for the extraction of superordinates from natural language definitions, for their disambiguation, and for the construction of taxonomies all over the lexicon; • the design of procedures for the (linguistic and computational) analysis of natural language definitions with the aim of extracting all the implicit semantic information; • the study of ways of formally representing the semantic information which is extracted – concepts, attributes, and relations between concepts – e.g. in the form of 'typed feature structures'; • the study of how to link and unify taxonomies and conceptual or relational information coming from different sources, either monolingual or multilingual; • the design and implementation of basic software for the creation, access and processing of lexical databases and a lexical knowledge base.",
        "These research themes tackled within ACQUILEX are aimed at meeting one of the major bottlenecks of natural language processing, i.e. the availability of \"large\" computational lexicons with particular emphasis on making also semantic information explicit and accessible."

        "In this respect, the dictionary is considered as a \"classificatory device\", i.e. an empirical means of instantiating concepts.",
        "The MRD gives in fact one possible way of learning a concept (where the \"learning\" process assumes an inductive form): linking a concept to all its instances.",
        "All the instances of the same category/class are in fact extracted and connected together.",
        "What is of interest with respect to taxonomies are not the leaf nodes, representing rather specific words, but middle and top-level nodes in the IS-A hierarchy.",
        "These represent the core concepts by means of which the other words are defined via taxonomic relationship.",
        "An attempt to normalization is therefore being made in the project at the level of these core-nodes, in order both a) to give a more consistent structure to the hierarchy deriving from definitions, and b) to make possible the linking and merging of taxonomies extracted from different dictionaries and from different languages.",
        "Analyses have already been performed which lead to the grouping of subsets of nodes under a same \"conceptual label\" representing the generalization over specific lexicalization of a similar lexical meaning.",
        "These conceptual labels are obtained through a comparative analysis of the different taxonomies for the different dictionaries, in order to create links and mappings between them, and constitute a first simple attempt of standardization at the semantic level.",
        "They should be analysed and compared with semantic primitives or features stated in other semantic systems."

      "text": [
        "The aim of ACQUILEX in its second year is to extract, in addition to the simple IS–A links, more complex – and so far not really thoroughly analysed – semantic information hidden in the 'differentia' of the lexicographic definitions.",
        "In a project with several partners there is the necessity of working with similar (global) strategies of knowledge acquisition in order to reach the same result, i.e. a common LKB.",
        "We do not rely on a random extraction, but apply a knowledge acquisition strategy which, according to our views, must be guided by:",
        "a) empirical observations, b) theoretical hypotheses.",
        "What is meant by a) is rather simple, being the so often observed systematic regularities and similarities of lexical items and definitional patterns.",
        "By b) we intend the use of the theoretical approach to lexical semantics put forward by Pustejovsky (see Pustejovsky 1989, Pustejovsky and Boguraev forthcoming) in his 'guano, structures'.",
        "This approach makes use of a knowledge representation framework to express different aspects of knowledge structures concerning words.",
        "The qualia structure for a noun defines its essential attributes and \"is in essence an argument structure for nouns\".",
        "In ACQUILEX we use a similar approach and similar types of structures, but in a broader sense than the qualia structures used by Pustejovsky which are made up of four main Roles (Constitutive, Formal, Telic, Agentive).",
        "These four main roles on the one side do not cover the whole range of lexical notions which characterize nominals, and on the other side do not include other pertinent world–knowledge information which can be useful in many NLP tasks or applications and can be found in MRDs.",
        "We therefore take the underlying hypothesis of having \"meaning types\" and use the notion of \"template\" as main structuring device for semantic information, but enlarge this notion of template to include and represent: i) other semantic information not covered by the four main roles, and moreover ii) also more general or encyclopedic information concerning the concepts.",
        "An example of the template derived from the analysis of the definitions of three monolingual dictionaries (two Italian, one English) is given in Figure 1 for the concept of SUBSTANCE.",
        "Dictionary definitions are suitable for an explicit representation in terms of feature structures as data types, which reproduce (at least partially) in an explicit way the original linear textual data (obviously not all of the definitions of a dictionary, and often not the entire definition).",
        "This feature structure can be seen as a \"meaning type\", representing a maximal frame for a class of words (e.g. all the words defined by the word 'substance' or by its hyponyms).",
        "This frame, with all the potential attributes which in the definitions are found as most relevant for this subset, is inherited (as a \"potential meaning type\") by all the hyponyms of a \"Top Node\" (SUBSTANCE) and will be filled in some of its slots for each individual hyponym.",
        "If we consider the \"meaning structure\" of LIQUID (see Figure 2) it is constituted by a subset of the attributes of SUBSTANCE, the same holds for GAS, and so on.",
        "There will obviously be different \"meaning types\" for different categories of words.",
        "Attributes for verbs usually represent thematic roles which are relevant for a given \"Action Type\" and, where possible, also aspectual information is now being semi – automatically extracted from the definitions (see Alonge 1991).",
        "An example of the structures which result from dictionary definitions for the verbs of \"hitting\" and \"dividing\" is given in Figure 3.",
        "When an argument slot is filled for a hyponym of \"to hit\", this is an inherently specified argument (e.g. in \"to hammer\" the instrument role is lexically specified).",
        "However, as seen above, the view of assigning to nouns descriptions in terms of \"frames\" is also taken, with attributes or slots (and fillers), which are, at least partly, acquired from a procedural analysis of the definitions.",
        "Different types of templates with different attributes are typical of \"derivatives\", which constitute a very large portion of a lexicon.",
        "They exhibit very special patterns and relationships with respect to their bases, with very interesting properties from a linguistic point of view.",
        "Their conceptual templates contain, among many others, attributes such as: AGENT, ACT_OF, PROPERTY_NAME, LOCATION, SET_OF, etc., but also attributes of a more encyclopedic nature such as: INHABITANT_OF, FOLLOWER_OF, etc.",
        "We can associate to each of these relational patterns, which contribute to defining a very large amount of lexical items, conceptual templates (sets of properties) which are then inherited by default by all their defined words.",
        "As an example, we can associate to the AGENT attribute, among the others, the following set of attributes:",
        "where 'verb' is a variable which takes as value the base – verb for each derivative.",
        "E.g.: lavoratore: [AGENT: lavorare] by default also inherits: [IS_A: human, TELIC: lavorare].",
        "It is with data of these types that we are beginning to feed the common LKB, a network consisting not only of IS_A relations, but of all the different types of semantic relations and semantic features implicitly present in the \"differentia\" part of all the definitions from all the available sources."
