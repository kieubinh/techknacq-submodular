        "When considering the question of whether or not lexical information can be separated from real-world knowledge, it must first be recognized that most lexical information in a natural language processing system is expressed in terms of properties defined in a knowledge base representing the domain model - i.e., the \"world,\" whether real or otherwise.",
        "For example, semantic class constraints consist of properties such as animate or machine-part which are associated with generic entities.",
        "Semantics is often described as the link between syntax and the knowledge base, so by definition it must have one foot in the knowledge base camp.",
        "In the absence of concrete examples of lexical facts or rules that are provably more difficult to represent than real-world knowledge, it also seems reasonable to assume that the knowledge representation formalism used for the domain model could serve to model the associated lexical information.",
        "This is not intended to imply that it will be possible to fully represent all of both types of information.. Formalisms for knowledge representation have been acknowledged to be inadequate for representing real-world knowledge, let alone lexical information [1].",
        "It does make it especially burdensome to prove that a formalism that is inadequate for real world knowledge is even more inadequate for lexical information.",
        "The question remains, is there lexical information which is uniquely \"lexical\" in that it can be distinguished from real-world knowledge albeit it may be expressed identically?",
        "This paper argues for the affirmative response.",
        "Given the approach to semantic representation implemented in PUNDIT and KERNEL [2], [3], [10] which is closely aligned to Jackendoff's lexical conceptual structures [4], [5], it is argued that the definitions of thematic relations such as cause and effect correspond to \"uniquely lexical\" items of information."

        "In the second and third phrases, A string connects two particles and A particle is connected by a string to another particle, the two particles are being indirectly linked with each other by the use of an Intermediary, the string.",
        "There is still a fixed contact involved, in fact there are two fixed contacts, but they are between the particles and the ends of the strings, not between the particles themselves.",
        "This use of a string as a Intermediary to effect a connection between two objects is captured by the following general definition of connect which can produce distinct representations for the different usages of connect given in the examples here.",
        "Instantiating this definition by the referents to the noun phrases from A string connects two particles results in: I The use of standard thematic role names in the verb definitions is not intended to mislead the reader into thinking that the arguments to the predicates correspond directly to traditional thematic roles.",
        "They are simply arguments to predicates, and could just have easily been labelled Arg1 and Arg2, and have been labelled as such in various incarnations.",
        "However, the author finds it difficult to keep Arg1 and Arg2 straight, and has resorted to the thematic role names in the hopes of preserving some clarity around which argument is which.",
        "effect(string1, contact(particlel,particle2)) At this stage, the representation does not capture the contacts between the particles and the string.",

        "), can capture the essence of the meaning of the effect thematic relation in that the Intermediary effects an indirect contact between two objects by being in direct contact with each of them.",
        "The principle difference between connect and attach is the possible inclusion of the Intermediary.",
        "When the Intermediary in connect is not present, it is not assumed, and the desired representation is exactly the same as the representation for attach.",

        "The string is the Intermediary, the particle is the Patient and the pulley is the Source, giving us: hang -: effect(stringl, support(particlel, pulley 1)) The same linguistic definition for effect is applied, this time to support predicates instead of contact predicates, and the next stage of the representation is as follows: effect(string 1 , support(particlel, pulleyl)) support(particlel, stringl)), support(string 1,pulley 1)) In other words, the support of the particle is the string and the support of the string is the pulley.",
        "The important point here is that the same verb independent linguistic definition of the effect thematic relation as a logical transitive relation that applies to connect also applies to hang.",
        "In this case an Intermediary effects a support relationship between two objects by being supported by one of the objects and in turn supporting the other.",

        "31n the pulley domain, the basic predicate for hang and suspend is actually location, and the presence of gravity allows the support relationship with the corresponding upwards and downwards forces to be inferred.",
