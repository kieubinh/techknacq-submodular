        "A comprehensive natural language processing system (NLP) must be able to analyze natural language texts, and, having understood their content, generate other natural language texts, depending on the nature of the underlying reasoning system.",
        "Thus, in a machine translation system this \"other\" NL text will be a text in a different language but with the same meaning; in a NL front end to a database, it will be the response to a query.",
        "In order to produce an appropriate NL output, the NLP system must \"understand\" the input text.",
        "In some systems this understanding is modeled as an acceptable match for a preexisting structural or literal pattern.",
        "In knowledge-based systems it is customary to model understanding through representing the results of input text analysis as a set of well-formed structures in a specially-designed formal artificial language.",
        "Such languages come in a number of varieties and we are not arguing here about which ones are more appropriate or promising.",
        "The crucial point is that in order to have any explanatory power, the atoms of this meaning representation language must be interpreted in terms of an independently motivated model of the world.",
        "Moreover, if any realistic experiments have to be performed with such an NLP system, this world model (sometimes called ontology) must be actually built, not only defined algebraically.",
        "The process of NL analysis is then interpreted as putting lexical, syntactic, and prosodic units of the source text in correspondence with elements of the text meaning representation language.",
        "During generation, the representation language units serve as input and the target language units, as output.",
        "(This view of language processing is, of course, highly schematic – as will be seen from the more detailed discussion which follows; but this is exactly the level of detail needed at this point.)",
        "In our understanding, the purpose of the lexicon is to facilitate the above linking.",
        "Of course, the lexicon contains not only mappings into the ontology.",
        "It also contains information about morphological, syntactic, pragmatic, and collocational properties of the lexical unit – since all and any of these components serve as clues at various stages of the process of mapping text into representation or vice versa.",
        "But the semantics of most of the open-class lexical items is described in terms of their mappings into instances of ontological concepts.",
        "A generic view of the data flow in a system of the above class is given in Figure 1.",
        "The experiences described in this paper relate to our work on DIONYSUS, a machine translation system.",
        "The interaction between the ontology, the text meaning representation, and the lexicon in this system was the central point of our study.",
        "This interaction takes place in two spheres – both during actual processing of text and during knowledge acquisition phase.",
        "In what follows, we first briefly describe these three knowledge sources and their interactions, as they are implemented in DIONYSUS.",
        "Next, we discuss some issues of distinguishing lexical and non-lexical knowledge and their coexistence in a comprehensive NLP application.",
        "Justifying particular representation choices, details of coverage of specific phenomena and comparisons with other semantic and pragmatic NLP processors are beyond the scope of this paper.",
        "See Nirenburg and Defrise, forthcoming, a and b; Carlson and Nirenburg, 1990; Meyer et al., 1990; Nirenburg, 1989; and Nirenburg and Goodman, 1990 for additional details.",
        "Each of the three knowledge sources have both content and form – that is, a special knowledge representation language has been developed for each of the knowledge sources (TAMERLAN for text meaning representation, a constraint language for representing ontology, and the structure of the lexicon entry for the lexicon).",
        "These languages are necessarily connected in many ways (and in the implementation of DIONYSUS all are based on the single underlying knowledge representation system FRAMEKIT (Nyberg, 1988).",
        "Our comments will touch upon features from both the content and the form facets of the knowledge sources."

        "Meaning proper is represented through instantiating, combining, and constraining concepts available in the ontology.",
        "These processes crucially rely on lexical-semantic information in the appropriate lexicon entries.",
        "This information relates not only to ambiguity resolution in \"regular\" compositional semantics (i.e., straightforward monotonic dependency structure building), but also the identification of idioms, treatment of metonymy and metaphor, and resolution of reference ambiguities.",
        "It is well known, however, that the intent of a text is typically not capturable by just instantiating ontological concepts; what is additionally needed is the representation of pragmatic and discourse-related aspects of language – speech acts, deictic references, speaker attitudes and intentions, relations among text units, the prior context, the physical context, etc.",
        "As most of the knowledge underlying realizations of these phenomena is not society-general but is rather dependent on a particular cognitive agent (a particular speaker/hearer in a particular speech situation), the pragmatic and discourse knowledge units were not included in the ontology (which is supposed to reflect, with some variability, a societal view of the world – indeed, if every speaker/hearer had a totally idiosyncratic world view, communication would not be possible).",
        "The representation of this \"meta-ontological\" information is thus added to the representation of meaning proper to yield a representation of text meaning; a resulting representation thus reflects both lexically-triggered ontologically-based semantic information and non-ontological information reflecting pragmatic and discourse factors.",
        "The propositional part of text meaning is obtained by instantiating relevant ontological concepts, accessed through corresponding lexicon entries, which list mappings between word senses and ontological concepts.",
        "In order to carry out the mappings of complex structures with dependencies, information about argument structure of lexical units (also stored in the lexicon) is used.",
        "However, many lexical units in the source text contribute to the nonpropositional meaning of the text.",
        "The structures for the nonpropositional components of text meaning are also derived from the lexicon, where appropriate patterns are stored (see example lexicon entries below).",
        "The nonpropositional information is not stored in the ontology for reasons explained above.",
        "In what follows we motivate the most important non-ontological components of our text meaning representation formalism (for more detailed discussion",
        "see Nirenburg and Defrise, forthcoming, a) – speaker attitudes, stylistic features and rhetorical relations.",
        "A critical facet of capturing the intent of a speaker in a meaning representation is rendering of the attitudes that the speaker holds toward objects or situations represented in the propositional (compositional-semantic) component of text meaning representation.",
        "Indeed, the speaker may convey attitudes about producing the text in the first place (the speech act), elements of the speech context, or even other attitudes.",
        "An attitude is represented by a structure which includes the type of attitude (from the list below), a value (a decimal value taken from the interval [0, 1] indicating the polarity or strength of the attitude), an indication of to whom the attitude can be attributed (typically the speaker), a scope (identifying the entity towards which the attitude is expressed), and a time (representing the absolute time at which the attitude was held).",
        "Types of attitudes recognized in TAMERLAN are: epistemic, evaluative, deontic, expectation, volition and saliency.",
        "The stylistic overtones of a lexical entry, even if not contributing directly to the compositional semantics of a text, serve a crucial role in conveying the speaker attitudes and in achieving his intent in producing the text.",
        "Thus we identify that the stylistics of a lexeme needs to be encoded in the lexicon entry in addition to the lexical semantic information.",
        "In encoding lexicons for languages with rich social deictics, such as Japanese, the issue of stylistics becomes even more acute.",
        "We are utilizing a set of style indicators which is a modification of the set of pragmatic goals from Hovy 1988.",
        "This set consists of six stylistic indicators: formality, simplicity, color, force, directness, and respect.",
        "In our implementation, we need to label lexical entries (including idioms, collocations, conventional utterances, etc.)",
        "with appropriate representations of values for these stylistic indicators; values for these factors are represented as points on the interval [0,1], where 0.0 is low, 1.0 is high, and 0.5 represents a default, neutral value.",
        "In NL generation, these factors are used in lexical selection; in NL analysis, the values are available for assisting in disambiguation (relying on expected values for the factors and utilizing the heuristic that typically the stylistics will be consistent across words in an utterance).",
        "Some examples of English lexical entries that would need to include style features are:",
        "Relations in TAMERLAN are a mixed bag - some of them refer to real-world connections and are, therefore, defined in the ontology while some others (such as rhetorical relations, e.g., conjunction and contrast) refer to properties of text itself and are, therefore, not a part of the world model.",
        "At present, the major classes of relations in TAMERLAN include causal, conjunction, alternation, coreference, temporal, spatial, textual, reformulation and domain-text relations."

        "Another well-known approach prefers a small restricted set of primitives which are combined or constrained in an attempt to render the meaning of any lexical unit.",
