        "Among those who have studied the problem of tense and/or aspect, many have taken the work of [Reichenbach, 1947] as a starting point (see, for example, [Brent, 1988], [Moens and Steedman, 1988], [Hornstein, 1990], and [Passonneau, 1988]), while others have built on the work of [Allen, 1983, 1984] (see, for example, [Vilain et al., 1990], and [Williams, 1990]), and still others have based their investigation on a combination of Allen and Reichenbach's work (see, for example, [Yip, 1985]).",

        "This is the view that is adopted here: it is assumed that lexical semantic knowledge consists of such notions as predicate-argument structure, well-formedness conditions on predicate-argument structures, and procedures for lexical selection of surface-sentence tokens; all other types of knowledge must be represented at some other level.",
        "The lexical-semantic representation that is adopted as the interlingua for the UNITRAN machine translation system [Dorr, 1989, 1990a, 1990b, 1990c] is an extended version of lexical conceptual structure (henceforth, LCS) (see [Jackendoff, 1983, 1990]).",

        "In particular, it has been persuasively argued by [Hornstein, 1990] that all sentences containing a matrix and adjunct clause are subject to a linguistic (syntactic) constraint on tense structure regardless of the lexical tokens included in the sentence.",

        "The claim that there is a separation of temporal/aspectual knowledge from lexical-semantic knowledge is further strengthened if one considers that a given lexical-semantic representation may correspond to more than one tense and aspect structure, depending",
        "on the context of the linguistic utterance.",
        "For example, suppose we are given the fact that John went to the store before Mary arrived; this fact can be represented as a single lexical-semantic structure, but it may be associated with a number of tense and aspect structures, each of which corresponds to a different surface-sentence utterance:",

        "All of these surface realizations are perfectly valid given that they are consistent with our temporal knowledge, i.e., that the \"going to the store\" event occurs before the \"arriving\" event.",
        "Thus, the lexical-semantic structure for these two events does not constrain the choice of potential tense and aspect structures with which it may be associated.",
        "This provides further evidence that temporal/aspectual knowledge exists at a level that is independent from lexical-semantic knowledge.",
        "Note that Hornstein's neo-Reichenbachian theory crucially relies on an asymmetry between the matrix and adjunct clauses.",
        "Thus, there is an important distinction between [Hornstein, 1990], in which the asymmetrical property is fundamental to the theory, and [Yip, 1985,] in which the asymmetrical property is entirely abandoned.",
        "I suggest that Hornstein's intuition is the correct one given that we cannot arbitrarily interchange the matrix and adjunct clauses.",

        "John will go to the store after Mary arrives.",

        "What is needed is the temporal relation between the two events and the constraints on their combination before it is possible to derive the surface structure of the sentence.",
        "In addition, the aspectual information must be determined before the two events can be combined since this information will be necessary for retrieving the tense structure (e.g., simple vs. progressive) and selecting the lexical connective (e.g., when vs. while).",

        "9 An example of a tense implication that is not captured in Allen's approach is that a progressive form of a process entails the negation of the perfect form (e.g., John is building a house implies John has not built the house).",
        "See [Yip, 1985] for a description of other tense implications that are not captured in Allen's approach.",
        "'°This is a modified version of the enumerated constructions in [Yip, 1985].",
        "Certain changes have been made to accommodate differences in interpretative judgments (by native English speakers) for the data given in Yip's presentation.",
        "As it turns out, the temporal relations enumerated in figure 4 for the when connective cover the cases shown here, plus many others that are not addressed by Yip.",
        "There are two important advantages to using the featural scheme of figure 4 over the less specific scheme of [Yip, 1985]: (1) it provides a more precise specification of states and events; and (2) it includes temporal/aspectual information that is important for the realization of other types of surface-structure constituents (besides temporal connectives) such as the number of a verbal object.",
        "We will return to this second point shortly.",
        "Although the when construction has been studied extensively, it has not been examined in the context of machine translation.",
        "In particular, the question of whether the tense/aspect theories of Allen, Bennett, et al., Dowty, Reichenbach, Vendler, and others can be combined to provide a cross-linguistic account for the selection of tense/aspect and temporal connectives such as when (e.g., in an interlingual translation model) has not been addressed.",
        "Machine translation provides an appropriate testbed for trying out such theories.",
        "The problem of lexical selection during generation of the target language is the most crucial issue in this regard.",
        "For example, one must choose between the lexical tokens cuando and a/ when generating an equivalent Spanish temporal connective for the following two English sentences:",
        "(23) (i) John went to the store when Mary arrived.",
        "(ii) John had gone to the store when Mary arrived.",
        "In the case of (23)(i), there are two possible translations, one that uses the connective cuando, and one that uses the connective a/: (24) (i) Juan fue a la tienda cuando Maria Hegel.",
        "(ii) Juan fue a la tienda al llegar Maria.",
        "Either one of these sentences is an acceptable translation for (23)(i).",
        "However, the same is not true of (23)(0:11 (25) (i) Juan habia ido a la tienda cuando Maria llegO.",
        "(ii) Juan habia ido a la tienda al llegar Maria.",
        "Sentence (25)(i) is an acceptable translation of (23)(ii), but (25)(ii) does not mean the same thing as (23)(ii).",
        "This second sentence implies that John has already gone to the store and come back, which is not the preferred reading.",
        "Currently research is under way to enumerate all of the English temporal connectives (taken from Webster's on-line dictionary) in order to establish an association between these connectives and the aspectual interpretation for the matrix and adjunct events (in the manner shown in figure 4).",
        "These tables vary from language to language, but the procedure for choosing temporal connectives applies cross-linguistically once the tables for each language are compiled.",
        "For example, the table for the Spanish connective a/ would be similar to the table for the English connective when in figure 4 except that the specification for the \"<\" relation would require the matrix event to have the +telic feature (i.e., the matrix action must reach a culmination).",
        "Thus, the full type entry under the matrix clause for the word a/ would be [±d,-Ft,±a].",
        "This would account for the distinction between cuando and at in sentences (25)(i) and (25)(ii) above.",
        "Space limitations do not permit the enumeration of the other temporal connective tables.",
        "Some examples of connectives that are currently being compiled into tables are: after, as soon as, at the moment that, before, between, during, since, so long as, until, 11I am indebted to Jorge Lobo for pointing this out to me.",
        "while, etc.",
        "It is intended that these tables are to be used both for the selection of temporal connectives during the generation process (for which the relevant index into the tables would be the temporal relation and the lexical-semantic types encoded in the interlingua) and for temporal interpretation during the analysis process (for which the relevant index into the tables would be the lexical-semantic types and aspectual perspectives associated with the source-language sentence).",
        "The selection of a temporal connective, then, is simply a table lookup procedure based on the type of the events and the temporal interpretation that holds between the events.",
        "For example, if we had a [+d,-t,-a] event El (e.g., run) and a [+d,+t,+a] event E2 (e.g., arrive), and if we knew that the temporal relation between EI and E2 was m, then searching the when table would fail, but searching the until table would succeed, thus allowing a sentence such as John ran until Mary arrived to be generated.",
        "As mentioned earlier, the featural system outlined above provides a framework that is appropriate not only for the realization of temporal connectives, but also for the realization of other types of temporal/aspectual information.",
        "For example, the sentence I stabbed Mary could be realized in at least two ways in Spanish: (26) (i) Juan le dio puiialadas a Marla (ii) Juan le dio una purialada a Maria Both of these sentences translate literally to \"John gave stab wound(s) to Mary.\"",
        "However, the first sentence is the repetitive version of the action (i.e., there were multiple stab wounds), whereas the second sentence is the non-repetitive version of the action (i.e., there was only one stab wound).",
        "This distinction is characterized by means of the atomicity feature.",
        "In (26)(i), the event is associated with the features H-d,+t,-a], whereas, in (26)(ii) the event is associated with the features [-I-d,+t,-Fa].",
        "According to [Bennett et al., 1990] (in the spirit of [Moens and Steedman, 1980, predicates are allowed to undergo an atomicity \"coercion\" in which an inherently non-atomic predicate (such as dio) may become atomic under certain conditions.",
        "These conditions are language-specific in nature, i.e., they depend on the lexical-semantic structure of the predicate in question.",
        "Given the featural scheme that is imposed on top of the lexical-semantic framework, it is easy to specify coercion functions for each language.",
        "For example, the atomicity function for the stab example would specify that a singular NP verbal object maps a [-i-d,-a] predicate into a [+d,+a] predicate i.e., a non-atomic event becomes atomic if it is associated with a singular NP object.",
        "Thus, the notion of feature-based coercion is cross-linguistically applicable, providing a useful foundation for a model of interlingual machine translation."
