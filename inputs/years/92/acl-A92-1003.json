        "Multilevel semantics has been proposed \\[Scha, 1983\\] as a powerful architecture for semantic analysis.",
        "In this approach, interpreting a natural language sentence is a multi-stage process, which starts out with a high-level meaning representation that reflects the semantic structure of the sentence rather directly.",
        "Then translation rules, which specify how the language-oriented semantic primitives relate to those used at deeper levels of analysis, are applied.",
        "One of the advantages of the multilevel approach is that it allows a natural decomposition of complex tasks and the functional modularization of semantic analysis.",
        "However, when multilevel architecture is used in concrete applications, a simple functional approach does not solve the problem of a clear definition of the semantics for each level.",
        "This fact is evident for applied systems whose semantic component must deal with many linguistic phenomena (e.g. lexical and structural ambiguities, quantifier scoping, anaphorical references, discourse topic and focus, referent retrieval, etc.).",
        "In such systems the definition of the semantics for a level has at least two advantages: (i) modules for specific phenomena could be easily introduced within the appropriate level, provided that the module functions contribute to the definition of the semantics for that level; (ii) a better understanding of the semantic analysis would be allowed: particularly, when a sentence is rejected at a certain level, it would mean that the semantic constraints for that level have been violated.",
        "In this paper we suggest a methodology that, while maintaining the generality of the multilevel approach, is able to establish formal constraints over the possible ways to organize the level hierarchy.",
        "More precisely, we propose a \"strong\" version of the multilevel approach in which a level can be defined if and only if it is possible to characterize a \"meaningfulness\" notion peculiar to that level.",
        "Within such an architecture each level reached during the analysis computes its meaningfulness value; this result is then handled according to modalities that are peculiar to that level.",
        "We shall show how our approach to multilevel semantics is concretely applied to organize the semantic component developed by the NLP group at IRST; this component is currently responsible for semantic analysis in two dialog systems, ALFresco and MAIA.",
        "At present two levels are included in the semantic component and they will be described in detail: the lexical level and the logical-interpretative level.",
        "At the lexical level the meaningfulness is defined by the consistency notion, which is computed by means of the lexical discrimination module; this module tries to select only the sentence readings meaningful in a given Domain Model (DM).",
        "When the propositional content of the sentence is proven to be consistent, the semantic representation produced by this level is passed to the next one; otherwise, if consistency cannot be proved, the whole sentence is rejected.",
        "At the logical-interpretative level the meaningfulness is defined by means of the validity notion, which is satisfied when referents for the sentence are identified.",
        "Three modules interact at this level: the quantification module, which finds the correct interpretation of the quantifiers, resolving possible scoping ambiguities; the topic module, which organizes the mentioned referents; the interpretation module, which identifies the part of the sentence to extensionalize and is responsible for referent retrieval.",
        "At this level, when validity cannot be proved, a special pragmatic procedure is activated.",
        "Section 2 surveys a few relevant approaches to multilevel semantic analysis.",
        "In Section 3 the formal requirements for the \"strong\" multilevel semantics version are introduced.",
        "The architecture and the functional modules of the two levels of the semantic component we have developed are described in Sections 4 and 5.",
        "Finally, Section component has been used and Section 7 outlines some future developments."

        "One of the first and most direct multilevel-based systems is the BBN spoken language system \\[Boisen et al., 1989\\].",
        "At every level of analysis, the meaning of an input utterance is represented as an expression of a logical language; the languages used at the various levels of analysis differ in that at every level the descriptive constants are chosen so as to correspond to the semantic primitives assumed at that level.",
        "At the highest semantic level, the meaning of an input utterance is represented as an expression of the English-oriented Formal Language (EFL).",
        "The constants of EFL correspond to the descriptive terms of English.",
        "An important feature of EFL is that descriptive constants are allowed to be ambiguous.",
        "The logical language used at the domain-dependent level of representation is called the World Model Language (WML).",
        "This is an unambiguous language, with an ordinary model-theoretic interpretation.",
        "Its constants are chosen to correspond to the concepts that constitute the domain of discourse.",
        "During the crossing of the EFL and the WML level (when domain dependent rewriting rules are called), the discrimination process is carried out.",
        "A type checking mechanism provides acceptance only for interpretations for which a domain knowledge compatible type has been computed.",
        "A further step of translation occurs when the WML is translated into DBL (DataBase Language) used to access the database to retrieve appropriate answers.",
        "While having sound theoretical foundations, the main drawback of this approach is that it postpones semantic discrimination until domain knowledge is available; in the meantime, a complete sentence representation is built for each analysis the parser produces.",
        "However, IRUS-II \\[Ayuso et al., 1989\\], an applicative system also developed at BBN, confirms that in a real system it is useful to connect the discrimination process to the parser.",
        "It implements a rule system that translates each syntactic constituent directly into a WML form, skipping the domain independent level of representation.",
        "While this solution improves system efficiency, lexical discrimination is carried out by domain dependent rules in a way that limits system modularity.",
        "Another system with a clear distinction between the domain independent and the domain dependent level is XTRA \\[Allgayer et al., 19891.",
        "However, in this case at each level .the same language (i.e. the knowledge representation language SB-ONE) is used.",
        "The domain independent level, called Functional-Semantic Structure (FSS), is intended as an intermediate structure that incorporates linguistic knowledge, substantially invariant in respect to the particular application domain.",
        "On the contrary, the domain dependent level, called Conceptual Knowledge Base (CKB), is necessary to adequately model the relations of the underlying expert system.",
        "In XTRA it is necessary that each analysis produced by the parser is consistent with the FSS level: this is achieved by means of a classification of the sentence instance with the SB-ONE mechanisms (the realizer and the matcher).",
        "If the classification succeeds, the analysis goes on to the CKB level, otherwise the syntactic analysis is rejected.",
        "In this approach the discriminatiol process is profitably anticipated, and a powerful (eve1 though computationally expensive) consistency checkinl mechanism is provided.",
        "Both systems exploit the difference between knowledg about the application domain and knowledge that i independent of the particular domain (e.g., linguisti knowledge).",
        "Although this distinction is relevant fc allowing portability to different application domains, th semantic component described here focuses on the effecl that domain dependent knowledge has on the type checkin mechanism.",
        "To make the problem clearer, let us consider ho~ domain knowledge is exploited in the systems ju~, described.",
        "In the BBN spoken language system the typ checking is carried on by means of domain knowledge; o the other hand, within the XTRA system the discriminatio process is based only on domain independent knowledge.",
        "W think that an effective discrimination process should also b based on the application domain, it being unclear how t assign a proper meaning to a sentence without having fixe a particular context.",
        "Moreover, it seems useful to considc lexical discrimination as an incremental process: i discrimination works in parallel with the parser, it i possible to discriminate over single syntactic phraset checking the semantic content of each phrase.",
        "From the previous remarks, it can be noted that system that employ the multilevel semantics approach can assig the same functionalities to different levels.",
        "Hence, it coul be useful trying to define the relations among each level in \"stronger\" way, facing the problem of coherenc maintenance."

        "Let T be a theory of types that models our domain, l our multilevel semantics the notion of consistency is meal to demonstrate that an expression, representing tl~ propositional content of a sentence, has type; i.e. given expression w, it means to assign a type, if possible, to according to our type system.",
        "An expression has n meaning at the lexical level, if the type checking fails.",

        "An expression has r meaning at the logical-interpretative level if such description cannot be found.",
        "As the meaning of a sentence is always relative to a level in the multilevel architecture, every level manages the acceptance or the rejection of a sentence in a different manner.",
        "As examples: (1) A mule paints a fresco The components of the sentence have the following types: a mule : Mule, a fresco : Fresco, to paint : Painter 9 Painting.",
        "Given the fact that \"mules cannot paint\" (only painters can), the type checking mechanism fails to assign an appropriate type and this causes the meaningfulness for the lexical level not to be satisfied.",
        "(2) Show me a work painted by all the painters born in Florence Sentence 2 satisfies the lexical level, but not the logical-interpretative one, because no description of the referents of the sentence can be proposed, i.e. there is no painting painted by all the painters born in Florence.",
        "Once the functionalities of the levels are theoretically stated, the implementative choices can be very different and subject to criteria of portability.",
        "Type checking can be made using logical formalisms such as typed ~,-calculi or intensional logics (possibly exploiting Curry-Howard's isomorphism between typed ~.-terms and intuitionistic logic \\[Hindley and Seldin, 1986\\]).",
        "The interpretation level can retrieve the referred elements using functional applications or some algebraic formalisms.",
        "However, these approaches, although well founded, may not be the right ones from an implementative point of view, especially for large integrated systems.",
        "For example one has to define 'a priori' a theory of admissible types but when the domain changes, the theory does too.",
        "Another way is to use a hybrid knowledge representation system.",
        "As will be clear in the next section, we refer to a terminological component (Tbox) in order to obtain the type checking and to an assertional component (Abox) in order to retrieve the relations that verify the analyzed expression.",
        "This choice allows us to parameterize the type checking according to the knowledge representation.",
        "Indeed the portability of the modules encourages this alternative.",
