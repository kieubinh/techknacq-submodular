        "We call continuous speech, as opposed to isolated-word speech, any utterance emitted without interposing pauses between words.",
        "This is the way humans naturally speak, but to enable a machine to deal with this form of communication constitutes a difficult task because, in addition to the usual speech processing and natural language issues, there is no hint on where the single words of the utterance begin and end.",
        "Given the current state-of-the-art, speech understanding prototypes concern the comprehension of utterances referring to a well defined semantic domain on a dictionary of almost one thousand words.",
        "Our research group is interested in developing automated voice-based information retrieval services over the telephone network.",
        "This has some precise implications.",
        "First, we are committed to accept continuous-speech sentences expressed in relatively free syntax, otherwise the interaction with the service would be too unnatural.",

        "derstanding system has to be speaker independent and able to process noisy and distorted speech.",
        "Third, the response time must be confined within a few seconds; that is, the system has to work in real time.",
        "The evolution of the research is gradual.",
        "In the present status of work the developed system is speaker independent and it is based on a telephone-line quality speech (a telephone connected through a PABX).",
        "It has a vocabulary of 787 words and the processing time is less than 5 seconds (about twice real time).",
        "The sentence correct understanding rate is nearly 72%.",
        "The application task refers to voice access to an electronic mailbox.",
        "In its first version the system has been applied to access a geographical data base, and is now adapted (with a slightly bigger vocabulary) to information retrieval from a train timetable data base.",
        "In the following we present a thorough description of the approach that led to these results.",
        "Also, the latest developments of the system are discussed.",
        "We will focus here on the understanding subsystem.",

        "Consequently, it is not obvious a priori what type of architecture will give the best results.",

        "However, unified approaches contain a weakness: they have difficulty in coping with problems of different nature through specific, focused techniques.",
        "A division may be traced between lower-level processing of speech, mostly based on acoustical knowledge, and upper-level processing, mostly based on natural language knowledge.",
        "Therefore, a two-level architecture has been developed based on this idea \\[Fissore et ai.",
        "1988\\].",
        "The former stage, called recognition stage (Fig.",
        "la), hypothesizes a set of words all over the utterance and feeds the lat- null ter stage, or understanding stage, which completes the recognition activity by finding the most plausible word sequence and by understanding its meaning.",
        "In this way each level can focus on its own basic problems and develop specific techniques, still maintaining the advantage of the integration.",
        "Most of the approaches based on this idea (e.g. \\[Hayes et al.",
        "1986\\]) are characterized by the use of knowledge engineering techniques at both levels, while our recognition stage is based on a probabilistic technique, the hidden Markov models (HMM).",
        "The most recent research indicates that, as far as word recognition is concerned, the HMM give the best results \\[Lee 1990, Fissore et al.",

        "The set of word hypotheses produced by the recognition stage is called lattice (Fig.",
        "lb).",
        "Every word hypothesis is characterized by the starting and ending points of the utterance portion in which it has been spotted, and its score, expressing its acoustic likelihood, i.e. a measure of the probability for the word of having been uttered in that position.",
        "Many more hypotheses than the actually uttered words are present in the lattice (there are about 30 times as many word hypotheses as there are words), and they are overlapping on one another.",
        "The aim of the understanding stage is then twofold: on one side it has to complete the recognition task by extracting the correct word sequence out of the lattice; on the other it has to understand the sequence meaning.",
        "In practice these two activities are performed simultaneously.",
        "The correct word sequence extracted by the understanding stage may be fed back to the recognizer (Fig.",
        "la) for a post-processing phase called feedback verification, described below, aimed at increasing the understanding accuracy.",
        "The problem of analyzing lattices is considered from the natural language perspective: the goal is to develop techniques to process typed input and to extend them in order to process a \"corrupted\" form of input such as a lattice is.",
        "The understanding stage result called solution is a sequence of word hypotheses spanning the whole utterance time so that 1) the sentence is syntactically correct and meaningful according to the linguistic knowledge of the understanding stage, and 2) it ha~ the best acoustical score among all of the possible sequences that satisfy point 1).",
        "The great problem is thai the search for a solution cannot be made exhaustively: since the lattice contains many incorrect word hypotheses, there would be far too many admissible word combinations to examine.",
        "In addition there is the risk oJ incorrect understanding due to the possible selection o ~ even only one incorrect word hypothesis.",

        "1989\\].",
        "Here the idea is to select only fillers that are temporally adjacent to the header, so that we can limit the number of word hypotheses that can be extracted from the lattice (i.e. that satisfy language and time adjacency constraints) and consequently the parse trees that have to be generated.",

        "The control strategy that has been adopted, described in detail in \\[Giachin and Rullent 1990\\], accepts a limited risk of getting the wrong solution in the first place (about 1.5%) but is balanced by a great speed-up in the parsing of a lattice.",
        "5 Coping with special speech problems The adjacency between consecutive word hypotheses is seldom perfect, being them affected by a certain amount of gap or overlap.",
        "This is due to the fact that the end of a word is slightly confused with the beginning of the consecutive word.",
        "The understanding level is tolerant towards these phenomena and defines thresholds on maximum allowed gap or overlap between supposedly consecutive words.",
        "While coarticulation affects all words, it severely compromises the recognition of what are currently called, with an admittedly imprecise term, function words.",
        "Function words, such as articles, prepositions, etc., are generally short and they tend to be uttered very imprecisely, so that often they are not included in the lattice.",
        "Moreover, function words are often acoustically ineluded in longer words.",
        "The parsing strategy then does not rely on function words \\[Giaehin and Rullent 1988\\].",
        "The idea is that KS slots corresponding to function words are divided into three categories, namely short, long, and unknown.",
        "Short words are never searched in the lattice, and a plaeeholder is put in the Phrase Hypothesis (PH) that includes it.",
        "Long words are always searched, and failure is declared if no one is found.",
        "Unknown words are searched, but a plaeeholder may be put in the PH if some conditions are met.",
        "In a first phase, the categorization of a KS slot was made on the basis of the morphological features of the corresponding function words and on their length (e.g., words with one or two phonemes were declared \"short\" and never searched).",
        "Subsequent experiments showed that, unexpectedly, some very short words may be recognized with virtually no errors, while others, though longer, are much more difficult to recognize.",
        "Hence, better results have been obtained when the categorization has been made on the basis of the phonetic features of the words rather than of the morphological ones.",
        "Though skipping function words permits to successfully analyze sentences for which these words were not detected, it also implies that the acoustic information of small portions of the waveform is not exploited, and this may lead the parser to find a wrong solution.",
        "Also, function words may be sometimes essential to correctly understand the meaning of a sentence.",
        "In order to cope with these problems, a two-way interaction between the recognition module and the parser has been investigated, called feedback verification procedure \\[Baggia et aL 1991b\\].",
        "According to this procedure, the parser, instead of stopping at the first solution, continues to run until a predefined amount of resources is consumed.",
        "During this period many different solutions are found, possibly containing multiple possibilities in place of missing words.",
        "These solutions are then fed back to the recognizer which analyzes them sequentially.",
        "The recognizer task realigns the solutions against the acoustic data and attributes them a new likelihood score.",
        "Tile best-scored solution is then selected as the correct one.",
        "As a side effect, the best-matching candidate for function words that were missing in the lattice is also found.",
        "The verification procedure creates the best conditions to find these words with good reliability: for each place-holder a very small number of candidates are proposed, and the previous and following words are usually norreal reliable words.",
        "Hence the recognizer can detect the word with good accuracy.",
        "An example of a solution generated by the parser for the utterance \"Ci sono messaggi da Rossi il venti?\" (literally: \"There are mails from Rossi on twenty?\") is shown in Fig. 4.",
        "The \"?",
        "?\" symbol in the solution represents a possibly missing function word ignored during parsing, that is expanded into a set of candidates, according to the grammar, to be fed back to the recognizer.",
        "In addition to accurately finding function words, the verification procedure has the advantage that the final scores assigned to solutions by the recognizer are more accurate than those assigned to them by the parser, because these scores have been computed on the same time interval after a global realignment of the sentences.",
        "Hence comparing the solutions on the basis of their score is a more reliable procedure.",
        "The drawback of the verification procedure is that total analysis times are slightly increased by the overload imposed to the recognizer and by the fact that the parser must continue the analysis after the first solution is found."
