        "Early work involves using occurrence characteristics of contents words \\[Borko, 1970\\].",
        "Later people came to realize that indexes are often multi-word terms and their generation might involve more elaborated syntactic analysis on phrasal or sentential level \\[Salton, 1988; Dillon and McDonald, 1983\\].",
        "However, a full syntactical approach \\[Salton, 1988\\] to this task has real problem with efficiency and coverage for unrestricted text.",
        "No viable automatic solution is currently in use.",
        "Indexing Chinese books involves another severe obstacle, namely the word segmentation problem.",

        "However, there are no spaces to mark the beginning and end of a word as in English.",
        "Until recently, this problem has been considered difficult to solve without elaborated syntactical and semantic analyses \\[Chen, 1988\\].",
        "Recent research advances may lead to the development of viable book indexing methods for Chinese books.",
        "These include the availability of efficient and high precision word segmentation methods for Chinese text \\[Chang et al., 1991; Sproat and Shih, 1990; Wang et al., 1990\\], the availability of statistical analysis of a Chinese corpus \\[Liu et al., 1975\\] and large-scale electronic Chinese dictionaries with part-of-speech information \\[Chang et al., 1988; BDC, 1992\\], the corpus-based statistical part-of-speech tagger \\[Church, 1988; DeRose, 1988; Beale, 1988\\], as well as phrasal and clausal analyzers \\[Church 1988; Ejerhed 1990\\]"

        "Before phrasal analysis can be performed, the text must go through the more fundamental morphological and part-of-speech analysis.",
