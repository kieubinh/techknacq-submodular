        "A meaningful evaluation methodology can advance the state-of-the-art by encouraging mature, practical applications rather than \"toy\" implementations.",
        "Evaluation is also crucial to assessing competing claims and identifying promising technical approaches.",
        "While work in speech recognition (SR) has a history of evaluation methodologies that permit comparison among various systems, until recently no methodology existed for either developers of natural language (NL) interfaces or researchers in speech understanding (SU) to evaluate and compare the systems they developed.",
        "Recently considerable progress has been made by a number of groups involved in the DARPA Spoken Language Systems (SLS) program to agree on a methodology for comparative evaluation of SLS systems, and that methodology has been put into practice several times in comparative tests of several SLS systems.",
        "These evaluations are probably the only NL evaluations other than the series of Message Understanding Conferences (Sundheim, 1989; Sundheim, 1991) to have been developed and used by a group of researchers at different sites, although several excellent workshops have been held to study some of these problems (Palmer et al., 1989; Neal et al., 1991).",
        "This paper describes a practical \"black-box\" methodology for automatic evaluation of question-answering NL systems.",
        "While each new application domain will require some development of special resources, the heart of the methodology is domain-independent, and it can be used with either speech or text input.",
        "The particular characteristics of the approach are described in the following section: subsequent sections present its implementation in the DARPA SLS community, and some problems and directions for future development."

        "(1991) addresses some o these other factors).",
        "Examples below will be taken from the current DARPt SLS application, the Airline Travel Information Systen (ATIS).",
        "This is a database of flights with information o the aircraft, stops and connections, meals, etc.",
        "We assume an evaluation architecture like that in Figure 1.",
        "The shaded components are common resources of the evaluation, and are not part of the system(s) being evaluated.",
        "Specifically, it is assumed there is a common database which all systems use in producing answers, which defines both the data tuples (rows in tables) and the data types for elements of these tuples (string, integer, etc.).",
        "Queries relevant to the database are collected under conditions as realistic as possible (see 2.4).",
        "Answers to the corpus of queries must be provided, expressed in a common standard format (Common Answer Specification, or CAS): one such format is exemplified in Appendix A.",
        "Some portion of these pairs of queries and answers is then set aside as a test corpus, and the remainder is provided as training material.",
        "In practice, it has also proved useful to include in the training data the database query expression (for example, an SQL expression) which was used to produce the reference answer: this often makes it possible for system developers to understand what was expected for a query, even if the answer is empty or otherwise limited in content.",
        "While the pairing of queries with answers provides the training and test corpora, these must be augmented by common agreement as to how queries should be answered.",
        "In practice, agreeing on the meaning of queries has been one of the hardest tasks.",
        "The issues are often extremely subtle, and interact with the structure and content of the database in sometimes unexpected ways.",
        "As an example of the problem, consider the following request to an airline information system: List the direct flights from Boston to Dallas that serve meals.",
        "It seems straightforward, but should this include flights that might stop in Chicago without making a connection there?",
        "Should it include flights that serve a snack, since a snack is not considered by some people to be a full meal?",
        "Without some common agreement, many systems would produce very different answers for the same questions, all of them equally right according to each system's own definitions of the terms, but not amenable to automatic intersystem comparison.",
        "To implement this methodology for such a domain, therefore, it is necessary to stipulate the meaning of potentiMly ambiguous terms such as \"mid-day\", \"meals\" , \"the fare of a flight\".",
        "The current list of such \"principles of interpretation\" for the ATIS domain contains about 60 specifications, including things like: * which tables and fields in the database identify the major entities in the domain (flights, aircraft, fares, etc.)",
        "* how to interpret fare expressions like \"one-way fare\", \"the cheapest fare\", \"excursion fare\", etc.",
        "* which cities are to be considered \"near\" an airport.",
        "Some other examples from the current principles of interpretation are given in Appendix B.",
        "It is not enough to agree on meaning of queries in the chosen domain.",
        "It is also necessary to develop a common understanding of precisely what is to be produced as the answer, or part of the answer, to a question.",
        "For example, if a user asks \"What is the departure time of the earliest flight from San Francisco to Atlanta?\", one system might reply with a single time and another might reply with that time plus additional columns containing the carrier and flight number, a third system might also include the arrival time and the origin and destination airports.",
        "None of these answers could be said to be wrong, although one might argue about the advantages and disadvantages of terseness and verbosity.",
        "While it is technically possible to mandate exactly which columns from the database should be returned for expressions, this is not practical: it requires agreement on a much larger set of issues, and conflicts with the principle that evaluation should be as non-intrusive as possible.",
        "Furthermore, it is not strictly necessary: what matters most is not whether a system provided exactly the same data as some reference answer, but whether the correct answer is clearly among the data provided (as long as no incorrect data was returned).",
        "For the sake of automatic evaluation, then, a canonical reference answer (the minimum \"right answer\") is developed for each evaluable query in the training set.",
        "The content of this reference answer is determined both by domain-independent linguistic principles (Boisen et al., 1989) and domain-specific stipulation.",
        "The language used to express the answers for the ATIS domain is presented in Appendix A.",
        "Evaluation using the minimal answer alone makes it possible to exploit the fact that extra fields in an answer axe not penalized.",
        "For example, the answer ((\"AA\" 152 0920 1015 \"BOS .... CHI\" \"SNACK\" ) ) could be produced for any of the following queries: * \"When does American Airlines flight 152 leave?\" * \"What's the earliest flight from Boston to Chicago?\" * \"Does the 9:20 flight to Chicago serve meals?\" and would be counted correct.",
        "For the ATIS evaluations, it was necessary to rectify this problem without overly constraining what systems can produce as an answer.",
        "The solution arrived at was to have two kinds of reference answers for each query: a minimum answer, which contains the absolute minimum amount of data that must be included in an answer for it to be correct, and a maximum answer (that can be automatically derived from the minimum) containing all the \"reasonable\" fields that might be included, but no completely irrelevant ones.",
        "For example, for a question asking about the arrival time of a flight, the minimum answer would contain the flight 1D and the arrival time.",
        "The maximum answer would contain the airline name and flight number, but not the meal service or any fare information.",
        "In order to be counted correct, the answer produced by a system must contain at least the data in the minimum answer, and no more than the data in the maximum answer; if additional fields are produced, the answer is counted as wrong.",
        "This successfully reduced the incentive for systems to overgenerate answers in hope of getting credit for answering queries that they did not really understand.",
        "Another common resource is software to compare the reference answers to those produced by various systems.",
        "1 This task is complicated substantially by the fact that the reference answer is intentionally minimal, but the answer supplied by a system may contain extra information, and cannot be assumed to have the columns or rows in the same order as the reference answer.",
        "Some intelligence is therefore needed to determine when two answers match: simple identity tests won't work.",
        "In the general case, comparing the atomic values in an answer expression just means an identity test.",
        "The only exception is real numbers, for which an epsilon test is performed, to deal with round-off discrepancies arising from different hardware precision.",
        "2 The number of significant digits that are required to be the same is a parameter of the comparator.",
        "Answer comparison at the level of tables require more sophistication, since column order is ignored, and the answer may include additional columns that are not in the specification.",
        "Furthermore, those additional columns can mean that the answer will include extra whole tuples not present in the specification.",
        "For example, in the ATIS domain, if the Concorde and Airbus are both aircraft whose type is \"JET\", they would together contribute only one tuple (row) to the simple list of aircraft types below.",
        "On the other hand, if aircraft names were included in the table, they would each appear, producing a larger number of tuples overall.",
        "With answers in the form of tables, the algorithm explores each possible mapping from the required columns found in the reference answer (henceforth REF) to the actual columns found in the answer being evaluated (HYP).",
        "(Naturally, there must be at least as many columns in HYP as in REF, or the answer is clearly wrong.)",
        "For each such mapping, it reduces HYP according to the mapping, eliminating any duplicate tuples in the reduced table, and then compares REF against that reduced table, testing set-equivalence between the two.",
        "Special provision is made for single element answers, sc that a scalar REF and a HYP which is a table containing a single element are judged to be equivalent That is, a scalar REF will match either a scalar or a single elemenl somewhat so that, e.g., strings need not have quotes around their if they do not contain \"white space\" characters.",
        "See Appendix t for further details.",
        "table for HYP, and a REF which is a single element table specification will also match either kind of answer.",
        "For the ATIS evaluations, two extensions were made to this approach.",
        "A REF may be ambiguous, containing several sub expressions each of which is itself a REF: in this case, if HYP matches any of the answers in REF, the comparison succeeds.",
        "A special answer token (NO_ANSWER) was also agreed to, so that when a system can detect that it doesn't have enough information, it can report that fact rather than guessing.",
        "This is based on the assumption that failing to answer is less serious than answering incorrectly.",
        "Expressing results can be almost as complicated as obtaining them.",
        "Originally it was thought that a simple \"X percent correct\" measure would be sufficient, however it became clear that there was a significant difference between giving a wrong answer and giving no answer at all, so the results are now presented as: Number right, Number wrong, Number not answered, Weighted Error Percentage (weighted so that wrong answers are twice as bad as no answer at all), and Score (100 - weighted error).",
        "Whenever numeric measures of understanding are presented, they should in principle be accompanied by some measure of the significance and reliability of the metric.",
        "Although precise significance tests for this methodology are not yet known, it is clear that \"'black box\" testing is not a perfect measure.",
        "In particular, it is impossible to tell whether a system got a correct answer for the \"right\" reason, rather than through chance: this is especially true when the space of possible answers is small (yes-no questions are an extreme answer).",
        "Since more precise measures are much more costly, however, the present methodology has been considered adequate for the current state of the art in NL evaluation.",
        "Given that current weighted error rates for the DARPA ATIS evaluations range from 55%--18%, we can roughly estimate the confidence interval to be approximately 8%.",
        "3 Another source of variation in the scoring metric is the fact that queries taken from different speakers can vary widely in terms of how easy it is for systems to understand and answer them correctly.",
        "For example, in the February 1991 ATIS evaluations, the performance of BBN's Delphi SLS on text input from individual speakers ranged from 75% to 10% correcL The word error from speech recognition was also the highest for those speakers with the highest NL error rates, suggesting that individual speaker differences can strongly impact the results.",
        "3Assuming there is some probability of error in each trial (query), the variance in this error rate can be estimated using the formula where e is the error rate expressed as a decimal (so 55% error = 0.55), and n is the size of the test set.",
        "Taking e = 0.45 (one of the better scores from the February 91 ATIS evaluation), and n -- 145, differences in scores greater than 0.08 (8%) have a 95% likelihood of being significant.",
        "The methodology presented above places no a priori restrictions on how the data itself should be collected.",
        "For the ATIS evaluations, several different methods of data collection, including a method called \"Wizard scenarios\", were used to collect raw data, both speech and transcribed text (Hemphill, 1990).",
        "This resulted in the collection of a number of human-machine dialogues.",
        "One advantage of this approach is that it produced both the queries and draft answers at the same time.",
        "It also became clear that the language obtained is very strongly influenced by the particular task, the domain and database being used, the amount and form of data returned to the user, and the type of data collection methodology used.",
        "This is still an area of active research in the DARPA SLS community.",
        "Typically, some of the data which is collected is not suitable as test data, because: * the queries fall outside the domain or the database query application * the queries require capabilities beyond strict NL understanding (for example, very complex inferencing or the use of large amounts of knowledge outside the domain) * the queries are overly vague (\"Tell me about ...\") It is also possible that phenomena may arise in test data which falls outside the agreement on meanings derived from the training data (the \"principles of interpretation\").",
        "Such queries should be excluded from the test corpus, since it is not possible to make a meaningful comparison on answers unless there is prior agreement on precisely what the answer should be.",
        "The methodology of comparing paired queries and answers assumes the query itself contains all the information necessary for producing an answer.",
        "This is, of course, often not true in spontaneous goal-directed utterances, since one query may create a context for another, and the full context is required to answer (e.g., \"Show me the flights ... \", 'Which of THEM ...\").",
        "Various means of extending this methodology for evaluating context-dependent queries have been proposed, and some of them have been implemented in the ATIS evaluations (Boisen et al.",
        "(1989), Hirschman et al.",

        "Typically, some of the data which is collected is not suitable as test data, because: * the queries fall outside the domain or the database query application * the queries require capabilities beyond strict NL understanding (for example, very complex inferencing or the use of large amounts of knowledge outside the domain) * the queries are overly vague (\"Tell me about ...\") It is also possible that phenomena may arise in test data which falls outside the agreement on meanings derived from the training data (the \"principles of interpretation\").",
        "Such queries should be excluded from the test corpus, since it is not possible to make a meaningful comparison on answers unless there is prior agreement on precisely what the answer should be.",
        "The methodology of comparing paired queries and answers assumes the query itself contains all the information necessary for producing an answer.",
        "This is, of course, often not true in spontaneous goal-directed utterances, since one query may create a context for another, and the full context is required to answer (e.g., \"Show me the flights ... \", 'Which of THEM ...\").",
