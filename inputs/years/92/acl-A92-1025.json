        "Statistical methods for categorization, on the other hand, are easy to implement and require little or no human customization.",
        "But they don't offer any of the benefits of natural language processing, such as the ability to identify relationships and enforce linguistic constraints.",

        "Text categorization is an excellent application domain for natural language processing systems.",
        "First, it is a task in which NLP techniques have born fruit, producing high accuracy along with other benefits \\[Hayes and Weinstein, 1990; Kuhns, 1990; Tong et al., 1986\\].",
        "Second, it provides an easy way of measuring success, by comparing system responses with \"expert\" category assignments.",
        "Third, it is a ripe domain for exploring statistical methods for automated knowledge acquisition.",
        "Published work on text categorization has focused on the first item above, arguing convincingly for knowledge-based techniques and their accuracy, but has not yet opened the way for the investigation of category assignment as a way of testing NLP methods or on the prospects for acquisition.",
        "This work focuses on combining statistics and NLP in a knowledge-based categorization system, using statistics as way of augmenting hand-coded knowledge.",
        "The context of this research is a commerciallydeveloped system \\[Rau and Jacobs, 1991\\] that automatically assigns categories to news stories for \"custom clipping\" and other markets.",
        "Like Construe/TIS \\[Hayes and Weinstein, 1990\\], the work derives from, and coordinates with, NLP efforts, but the system primarily uses a lexico-semantic pattern matcher for categorization \\[Jacobs et al., 1991\\].",
        "Categorization tasks vary greatly in difficulty, but the recall and precision results produced in our tests are similar to those reported by other systems, with coverage of over 90% on topic assignment and performance better than human indexers on most aspects of the task.",
        "Figure 1 shows a typical example of a news story, with associated human-assigned categories.",
        "Retrieval is performed by matching a desired set of categories (termed a query or profile) against those assigned in the text database.",
        "Our system, known as NLDB, mimics these category assignments, extracting company names \\[Rau, 1991\\], topics or subject indicators, industries, and others (including, for example, stock exchanges and geographic regions).",
        "The program also incorporates portions of the SCISOR system \\[Jacobs and Rau, 1990\\], which can fill certain other fields, such as the target and suitor of a takeover.",
        "This sort of system has a simple appeal: the \"answers\" (the set of category assignments) are usually clear-cut, yet they clearly require some detailed content analysis.",
        "On the other hand, the technologies that could contribute to this analysis are bafflingly complex, from discourse methods that distinguish topics from background events to word sense techniques that help to distinguish, for example, COMMUNICATIONS from BROADCASTING and HEALTH CARE from PHARMACEUTICALS.",
        "Figure 2 shows the complete list of industry and topic assignments currently in use to categorize texts in the NLDB system.",
        "The development of this system has advanced the state of the art in practical NLP by proving the utility of statistical training methods on a knowledge-based NLP task.",
        "Feeding in large volumes of texts with human answers has found new ways around old problem~, in knowledge acquisition.",

        "Recall here has essentially the same meaning as in information retrieval; i.e. the percentage of human-assigned categories that the system also produced.",

        "In Figure 1, for example, NLDB included AEROSPACE on the industry list--This hurts precision because it is not included on the human list.",
        "The major achievement here is that the combination of statistical analysis and natural language based categorization is considerably better than either alone.",
        "The system uses statistical methods where they do better (i.e. industries) and NLP where it does better (i.e. topics), and shows that combined NLP and statistics can be better than either technique alone within a particular task.",
        "The results tend to understate the real impact of this combination, in part because of the large differences in difficulty among sets of categories, and in part because of the portion of the human-assigned categories that are incorrect.",
        "In analyzing sample texts where the human categories differ from the automatically-assigned categories, we have found that the system tends to be correct about as often as the human indexer, with many cases so difficult to judge that multiple independent assessments differ.",
        "Since this means that the system recall against the human is higher than human recall against the system, the results indicate that the system's overall performance is better than human performance.",

        "While it is easy to attain a certain level of accuracy in text categorization using a single layer of techniques and to combine all texts and all categories in evaluating the results, this aggregation of results obscures many of the real problems where NLP and categorization come together.",
        "Each type of category can highlight a different set of NLP issues, and different texts reveal different processing problems.",
        "For example, the problem of mistaking a totally irrelevant text for a text of a particular category is very different from the subtle task of distinguishing texts about one category from another.",
        "Similarly, NLP results in processing texts within a category are quite different from results in assigning texts to categories, for reasons that will be explained below.",
        "The best way to evaluate NLP techniques, therefore, is within the context of a more precise task than categorization ill general, and as a complement to statistical methods.",
        "Even in component tasks where pure statistical methods tend to outperform pure NLP methods, NLP can play an important role in improving results, and statistics can play a role in improving NLP.",
        "For example, in the news categorization task described earlier, natural language delivered the weakest performance relative to statistics on the assignment of industry categories.",
        "Performance on topic assignment was generally much higher using natural language, and company name extraction and variation was handled using a separate mechanism \\[Rau, 1991\\].",
        "The two most obvious differences between topic assignment and industry assignment are: 1.",
        "It is generally easy to determine where the topic of a story is expressed, either in the first sentence or by spotting certain words and phrases that are good indicators, while the industries involved can appear almost anywhere in a story, 2.",
        "The breadth of language that expresses topic is much narrower than the breadth required to handle the different industries; for example, it is quite easy to identify texts dealing with bankruptcies, lawsuits, and mergers using a few key words and phrases (vocabularies of no more than 20 or 30 words per topic): but a single industry can be indicated by any number of words or expressions, including names of specific customers, products, or devices.",
        "For these reasons, statistics have the upper hand in the identification of industries, and the first pass at the NLDB system used linguistic methods for topic assignment and statistical methods for industries.",
        "This wa~ unsatisfying, because we quickly came across errors in the results that might have been prevented using simple NLP methods, as well as places where the results could have helped to augment or correct linguistic knowledge The statistical methods, which will be described later involve weighting individual words and phrases according to their value in distinguishing industries.",
        "The most obvious errors resulting from these methods were finding a good indicator in the wrong place (either in irrelevant text or in background text), and finding a good indicator used in a different way.",
        "These errors pervade the results of statistical categorization, with the most obvious problems coming when the results clearly derived from the misinterpretation of individual words and phrases.",
        "For example, the word brewing occurred 14 times in a sample of about 11,000 news stories.",
        "In 9 out of those 14 cases, or 64%, the story was correctly categorized under the industry BEVERAGES, which includes less than 1% of the stories.",
        "By most any statistical metric, brewing is a strong indicator for BEVERAGES (better, in fact, than beer and beverages, although not quite as good as Pepsi).",
        "However, the statistical categorization method failed, for example, on the following text, incorrectly assigning the text to BEVERAGES: The issue first surfaced Monday when Dawes complained there is a \"black hole\" of information about how Richards deposited state money while the S&L crisis was brewing I The word gas is not quite as good an indicator as brewing--in 55% of occurrences it indicates PETROLEU PRODUCTS, and 11% of the time UTILITIES, with scattered other interpretations.",
        "But gas is much more frequent than brewing, occurring 835 times in the same training sample where brewing occurred 14 times.",
        "So, in terms of overall performance, knowing when gas is a good indicator of an industry can make more of a difference.",
        "The problem is with texts such as the following: Of 55 check-ups of the 17 patients, mild diarrhea was reported during 2 percent of checkups, nausea or vomiting in about 3 percent and a moderate increase in intestinal gas in about 10 percent.",
        "While the problem with brewing above can easily be solved by using any simple method of filtering out irrelevant text (the sentence appears in the middle of a story about a political campaign), this is not the case with gas.",
        "The gas example, like many similar errors, appears in relevant text describing the health effects of bran cereal, which could be correctly categorized as HEALTH CARE and FOOD.",
        "Note also that it is difficult to compensate for errors in individual word weights by using combined statistical weights for categorization.",
        "This point will he discussed more in Section 5, but the main problem is that content words like patients, nausea and check-ups simply don't have enough information content to act as good discriminators compared to gas.",
        "While it is easy to spot places where statistics tend to introduce erroneous categories, thus lowering precision in examples such as brewing and gas above, it is harder to understand why statistical methods also fail to produce enough information to assign a category, thus producing low recall.",
        "Since the task of assigning industries aitalics added depends more on what businesses companies are in than what an individual story is about, the information about the industry is often localized, perhaps even in a single mention of a company or product.",
        "For example, the following is a typical, though difficult, story about an executive change: .... James W. Nelson has been named vice president-manufacturing and distribution for the household products group at Lehn & Fink Montvale, is a leading international marketer of household and do-it-yourself products.",

        "It is also quite difficult, because of the high independent frequencies of the words, to identify household products as a collocation or combination that should be considered.",
        "The key to getting good recall and precision on texts such as these is to consider the weights of the individual words and phrases to determine what industries could be involved, but to use the structure of the texts to help determine where the industry information might be.",
        "Phrases like X is a leading marketer of Y or X is the maker of Y appear throughout news stories, and are sure indicators of industry information, even though they do not point to any particular industry.",

        "This suggests that further work could produce better indicators of relevance that get industry information out of the middle parts without introducing more extraneous categories.",
        "Statistical methods looking for sure-fire indicators must, by their nature, consider overwhelming statistical evidence even when these indicators are relatively infrequent.",
        "Unfortunately, even when a word or phrase correlates with an industry 100% of the time in a sample, this does not mean that it will be a sure indicator in a new sample.",
        "This is especially a problem with proper names and names of locations, but is also an issue with words that occur frequently in collocations.",
        "Treating words as individual indicators when they really are part of a name or collocation can hurt precision by increasing the chance that the single word will appear independently.",
