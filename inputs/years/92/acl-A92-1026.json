        "must be demonstrated that the completeness and accuracy of the information extracted is adequate for the application one has in nfind.",
        "While it is clear that certain applications require only a minimal level of competence from a system, it is also true that many applicationsrequire a very high degree of completeness and a.ccuracy in text processing, and an increase in capability in either area is a clear advantage.",
        "Therefore we adopt an extremely lfigh standard against which the performance of a text processing system should be measured: it.",
        "should recover all information that is implicitly or explicitly present in the text, and it should do so without making mistakes.",
        "Tiffs standard is far beyond the state of the art.",

        "However, progress toward adequate text processing is best.",
        "served by setting ambitious goals.",
        "For this reason we believe that, while it may be necessary in the intermediate term to settle for results that are far short of this ultimate goal, any linguistic theory or system architecture that is adopted should not be demonstrably inconsistent with attaining this objective.",
        "However, if one is interested, as we are, in the potentially successful application of these intermediate-term systems to real problems, it is impossible to ignore the question of whether they can be made efficient enough and robust enough for application.",
        "The TACITUS text processing system has been under development at SRI International for the last six years.",
        "This system has been designed as a first step toward the realization of a system with very high completeness and accuracy in its ability to extract information from text.",
        "The general philosophy underlying the design oI this system is that the system, to the maximum extent possible, should not discard any information that might be semantically or pragmatically relevant to a full, correct interpretation.",
        "The effect of this design philosophy on the system architecture is manifested in the following characteristics: * TACITUS relies on a large, comprehensive lexicon containing detailed syntactic subcategorization information for each lexieal item.",

        "The information that is ignored may be irrelevant to a particular application, or relevant in only an insignificant handful of cases, and thus we cannot argue that approaches to text processing based on weak or even nonexistent syntactic and semantic analysis are doomed to failure in all cases and are not worthy of further investigation.",

        "Robust syntactic analysis requires a very large grammar and means for dealing with sentences that do not parse, whether because they fall outside the coverage of the grammar or because they are too long for the parser.",
        "The gral-nnaar used in TACITUS is that of the I)IAI~OCIC system, deweloped in 1980-81 essentially by constructing the union of the Linguistic String Project G'ranmmr (Sager, 1981) and tile DIAGP~AM grammar (Robinson, 1982) which grew out of SRI's Speech Un&:rst.anding System research in the 1970s.",
        "Since that t.imc il.",
        "has been consid~'l'ably enhanced.",
        "It consists of about 160 phrase structure rules.",
        "Associated with each rule is a \"constructor\" expressing the constraints on the applicability of that rule, and a \"translator\" for producing the logical form.",
        "The grannnar is comprehensive and includes subcategorization, sentential complements, adverbials, relative clauses, complex determiners, the most common varieties of conjnnction and comparisou, selectional constraints, some coreference resolution, and the most common sentence fra.gments.",
        "The parses are ordered according to heuristics encoded in the grammar.",
        "The parse tree is translated into a logical representation of the nleaning of the sentence, encoding predicate-argument relations and grammatical subordination relations.",
        "In addition, it regularizes to some extent the role assignments in the predicate-argument structure, and handles argnments inherited from control verbs.",
        "Our lexicon includes about 20,000 entries, including about 2000 personal names and about 2000 location, organization, or other names.",
        "This number does not include morphological variants, which are handled in a separate naorphological analyzer.",
        "(In addition, there are special procedures for handling unknown words, including unknown names, described in Hobbs et al., 1991.)",
        "The syntactic analysis component was remarkably successful in the MUC,-3 evaluation.",
        "This was due primarily to three innovations.",
        "Each of these techniques will be described in turn, with statistics on their i)erformance in the MUC-a evaluation.",
        "Tile fastest parsing algorithms for context-free grammars make use of prediction based on left context to limit the nnmber of nodes and edges the parser must insert into tim chart.",
        "However, if robustness in the face of possibly ungramlnatical input or inadequate grammatical coverage is desired, such algorithms are inappropriate.",
        "Although the heuristic of choosing tile longest possible substring beginning at the left, that can be parsed as a sentence could be tried (e.g. Grishman and Sterling, 1989), solnetimes, the best fraglnentary analysis of a sentence can only be found by parsing an intermediate or terminal substring that excludes the leftmost words.",
        "For this reason, we feel that bottom-up parsing without strong constraints based on left context, are required for robust syntactic analysis.",
        "Bottom-up parsing is favored for its robustness, and this robustness derives from the fact that a bottom-up parser will construct nodes and edges in the chart that a parser with top-down prediction would not.",
        "The obvious problem is that these additional nodes do not come without an associated cost.",
        "Moore and Dowding (1991) observed a ninefold increase ill time required to parse sentences with a straightforward C, KY parser as opposed to a shift-reduce parser.",
        "Prior to November 1990, TACITUS employed a simple, exhaustive, bottom-up parser with the result that sentences of more than 15 to 20 words were impossible to parse in reasonable time.",
        "Since the average length of a sentence in the MUC-3 texts is approximately 25 words, such techniqnes were clearly inappropriate for the application.",
        "We addressed this problem by adding an agenda mechanism to the bottom-up parser, based on Kaplan (1973), as described in Winograd (1983).",
        "The purpose of the agenda is to allow us to order nodes (complete constituents) and edges (incomplete constituents) in the chart for further processing.",
        "As nodes and edges are built, they are rated according to various criteria for how likely they are to figure in a correct parse.",
        "This allows us to schedule which constituents to work with first so that we can pursue only the most likely paths in the search space and find a parse without exhaustively trying all possibilities.",
        "The scheduling algorithm is simple: explore the ramifications of the highest scoring constituents first.",
        "In addition, there is a facility for pruning the search space.",
        "The user can set limits on the number of nodes and edges that are allowed to be stored in the chart.",
        "Nodes are indexed on their atomic grammatical category (i.e., excluding features) and the string position at which they begin.",
        "Edges are indexed on their atomic grammatical category and tim string position where they end.",
        "The algorithm for pruning is simple: Throw away all but the n highest scoring constituents for each category/string-position pair.",
        "It has often been pointed out that various standard parsing strategies correspond to various scheduling strategies in an agenda-based parser.",
        "However, in practical parsing, what is needed is a scheduling strategy that enables us to pursue only the most likely paths in the search space and to find the correct parse without exhaustively trying all possibilities.",
        "The literature has not been as ilhnninating on this issue.",
        "We designed our parser to score each node and edge on the basis of three criteria: * The length of the substring spanned by the constituent.",
        "null * Whether the constituent is a node or an edge, that is, whether the constituent is complete or not.",
        "* The scores derived from the preference heuristics that have been encoded in DIALOGIC over the years, described and systematized in Hobbs and Bear (1990).",
        "However, after considerable experimentation with var- null ious weightings, we concluded that tile length and completeness factors failed to improve the performance a.t all over a broad range of sentences.",
        "Evidence suggested that a score based on preference factor alone produces the best results.",
        "The reason a correct or nearly correct parse is found so often by this method is that these preference heuristics are so effective.",
        "In the frst 20 messages of the test set., 131 sentences were given to the scheduling parser, after statistically based relevance filtering.",
        "A parse was produced for 81 of the 131 sentences, or 62%.",
        "Of these, 4:3 (or 33%) were completely correct, and 30 more had three or fewer errors.",
        "Thus, 56% of the sentences were parsed correctly or nearly correctly.",
        "These results naturally vary depending oil the length of the sentences.",
        "There were 64 sentences of under 30 naorphemes (where by \"morpheme\" we mean words plus inflectional affixes).",
        "Of these, 37 (58%) had completely correct parses and 48 (75%) had three or fewer errors.",
        "By contrast, the scheduling parser attempted only 8 sentences of more than 50 morphemes, and only two of these parsed, neither of them even nearly correctly.",
        "Of the 44 sentences that would not parse, nine were due to problems in lexical entries.",
        "Eighteen were due to shortcomings in the grammar, primarily involving adverbial placement and less than fully general treatment of conjunction and comparatives.",
        "Six were due to garbled text.",
        "The causes of eleven failures to parse have not been determined.",
        "These errors are spread out evenly across sentence lengths.",
        "In addition, seven sentences of over 30 lnorphemes hit the time limit we had set, and terminal substring parsing, as described below, was invoked.",
        "A majority of the errors in parsing can be attributed to five or six causes.",
        "Two prominent causes are the tendency of the scheduling parser to lose favored close attachments of conjuncts and adjuncts near the end of long sentences, and the tendency to misanalyze the string again contrary to the grammar's preference heuristics.",
        "We believe that most of these problems are due to the fact that the work of the scheduling parser is not distributed evenly enough across the different parts of the sentence, and we expect that this difficulty could be solved with relatively little effort.",
        "Our results in syntactic analysis are quite encouraging since they show that a high proportion of a corpus of long and very complex sentences can be parsed nearly correctly.",
        "However, the situation is even better when one considers the results for the best-fragment-sequence heuristic and for terminal substring parsing.",
        "When a sentence does not parse, we attempt to span it with the longest, best sequence of interpretable fragments.",
        "The fragments we look for are main clauses, verh phrases, adverbial phrases, and noun phrases.",
        "They are chosen on the basis of length and their preference scores, favoring length over preference score.",
        "We do not attempt to find fragments for strings of less than five morphemes.",
        "The effect of this heuristic is that even for sentences that do not parse, we are able to extract nearly all of the propositional content.",
        "For example, the sentence The attacks today come afl.er Shining Path attacks during which least 10 buses were burned throughout Lima on 24 Oct. did not parse because of the use of \"least\" instead of \"a.t. least\".",
        "Hence, the best.",
        "Dagment sequence was sought.",
        "This consisted of the two fragments \"The attacks today come after Shining Path attacks\" and \"10 buses were burned thronghout Lima on 24 Oct.\" The parses for both these fragments were completely correct.",
        "Thus, the only information lost was from the three words \"during which least\".",
        "Frequently such information can be recaptured by the pragmatics component.",
        "In this case, the burning would be recognized as a consequence of the attack.",
        "null In tile first 20 messages of the test set, a best sequence of fragments was sought for the 44 sentences that did not parse for reasons other than timing.",
        "A sequence was found for 41 of these; the other three were too short, with problems in the middle.",
        "The average number of fragments in a sequence was two.",
        "This means that an average of only one structural relationship was lost.",
        "Moreover, the fragments covered 88% of the morphemes.",
        "That is, even in the case of failed parses, 88% of the propositional content of the sentences was made available to pragmatics.",
        "Frequently the lost propositional content is from a preposed or postposed, temporal or causal adverbial, and the actual temporal or causal relationship is replaced by simple logical conjunction of the fragments.",
        "In such cases, much useful information is still obtained fl'om the partial results.",
        "For .37% of the 41 sentences, correct syntactic analyses of the fragments were produced.",
        "For 74%, the analyses contained three or fewer errors.",
        "Correctness did not correlate with length of sentence.",
        "These numbers could probably be improved.",
        "We favored the longest fragment regardless of preference scores.",

        "Although the heuristic of choosing tile longest possible substring beginning at the left, that can be parsed as a sentence could be tried (e.g. Grishman and Sterling, 1989), solnetimes, the best fraglnentary analysis of a sentence can only be found by parsing an intermediate or terminal substring that excludes the leftmost words.",
        "For this reason, we feel that bottom-up parsing without strong constraints based on left context, are required for robust syntactic analysis.",
        "Bottom-up parsing is favored for its robustness, and this robustness derives from the fact that a bottom-up parser will construct nodes and edges in the chart that a parser with top-down prediction would not.",
        "The obvious problem is that these additional nodes do not come without an associated cost.",

        "Prior to November 1990, TACITUS employed a simple, exhaustive, bottom-up parser with the result that sentences of more than 15 to 20 words were impossible to parse in reasonable time.",
        "Since the average length of a sentence in the MUC-3 texts is approximately 25 words, such techniqnes were clearly inappropriate for the application.",
        "We addressed this problem by adding an agenda mechanism to the bottom-up parser, based on Kaplan (1973), as described in Winograd (1983).",
        "The purpose of the agenda is to allow us to order nodes (complete constituents) and edges (incomplete constituents) in the chart for further processing.",
        "As nodes and edges are built, they are rated according to various criteria for how likely they are to figure in a correct parse.",
        "This allows us to schedule which constituents to work with first so that we can pursue only the most likely paths in the search space and find a parse without exhaustively trying all possibilities.",
        "The scheduling algorithm is simple: explore the ramifications of the highest scoring constituents first.",
        "In addition, there is a facility for pruning the search space.",
        "The user can set limits on the number of nodes and edges that are allowed to be stored in the chart.",

        "It has often been pointed out that various standard parsing strategies correspond to various scheduling strategies in an agenda-based parser.",

        "Evidence suggested that a score based on preference factor alone produces the best results.",

        "By contrast, the scheduling parser attempted only 8 sentences of more than 50 morphemes, and only two of these parsed, neither of them even nearly correctly.",
        "Of the 44 sentences that would not parse, nine were due to problems in lexical entries.",
        "Eighteen were due to shortcomings in the grammar, primarily involving adverbial placement and less than fully general treatment of conjunction and comparatives.",

        "These errors are spread out evenly across sentence lengths.",
        "In addition, seven sentences of over 30 lnorphemes hit the time limit we had set, and terminal substring parsing, as described below, was invoked.",
        "A majority of the errors in parsing can be attributed to five or six causes.",
        "Two prominent causes are the tendency of the scheduling parser to lose favored close attachments of conjuncts and adjuncts near the end of long sentences, and the tendency to misanalyze the string again contrary to the grammar's preference heuristics.",
        "We believe that most of these problems are due to the fact that the work of the scheduling parser is not distributed evenly enough across the different parts of the sentence, and we expect that this difficulty could be solved with relatively little effort.",
