        "The semantic attributes of verbs are created using 2 different viewpoints: dynamic characteristics of verbs and the relationship of verbs to cases.",
        "By using this method, it is shown that, in the case of translating newspaper articles, the major portion (93%) of anaphoral resolution of zero pronouns necessary for machine translation can be achieved by using only linguistic knowledge.",

        "This study considers four factors that are important when implementing this method in a Japanese to English machine translation system: the difference in conception between Japanese and English expressions, the difference in case frame patterns between Japanese and English, restrictions by voice and restriction by translation structure.",

        "In all natural languages, components that can be easily deduced by the reader are frequently omitted f~om expressions in texts.",
        "In Japanese in particular, the subject and object are often omitted.",
        "These phenomena cause problems in machine translation because components not overtly indicated in the source language (i.e. Japanese) become mandatory elements in the target language (i.e. English).",
        "Thus, in Japanese to English Wanslation systems it becomes necessary to identify corresponding case elements omitted from the Japanese original (these are referred to as \"zero pronouns\") to be translated into English expressions.",
        "Therefore, the technique of zero pronoun resolution is an extremely important function.",
        "Several methods have been proposed with regard to this problem.",
        "Grotz et al.",
        "proposed the method of resolving definite noun phrases by using a centering algorithm.",
        "Kameyama expanded this concept by introducing property sharing constraints and applied it to zero pronoun resolution in Japanese.",
        "This method relies on the types of postpositional particle and whether there are any empathy-loaded verbs to exercise control over priority rankings for the focus of discourse segments.",
        "Yoshimoto suggested a method that uses topics from a dialogue.",
        "This method has focused attention on the characteristic of the Japanese language where the case for the sentence is determined by the type of postpositional particle (e.g. \"ha\" (pronounced \"wa\"), \"ga\", \"wo\" and \"hi\" indicate the theme, subject, direct object and indirect object respectively).",
        "The method uses case elements accompanied by the postpositional particle \"ha\" and case dements become the theme or subject matter through expressions governed by a special sentence structure pattern.",
        "Kuno classified zero pronouns into two categories (pseudo-zero, real-zero) and suggested separate resolution methods for each category.",
        "This method handles pseudo-zero pronouns (omitted by across-the-board discourse deletion) and real-zero pronouns (topicalized noun phrase or a noun phrase existing in a dialogue scene which can become a referent, somewhat resembling personal pronouns in the English language) separately from the point of the referent detection method.",
        "The foregoing methods of anaphoral resolution can be divided into two major groupings.",
        "One uses comparatively superficial information such as the types of postpositional particles or the existence / non-existence of interjections.",
        "The other introduces the concepts of plans and scripts.",
        "When considering application to machine translation, the former leads to problems in the precision of resolutions because it is restricted to using specified information.",
        "The latter needs common knowledge and world models and to develop a translation system handling texts over a broad field, the volume of knowledge to be prepared beforehand is so large that this method can be regarded as impossible to realize.",
        "Thus in this paper, attention has been focused on verbal semantic attributes.",
        "We propose a method of resolving zero pronouns common in Japanese discourse.",
        "The method uses the dynamic characteristics of verbs and the relationship between verbs.",
        "The rules needed by this method are independent of the fields of the source text.",
        "Therefore, anaphora resolution may be conducted with a relatively small volume of knowledge, so the proposed method is very suitable for machine translation."

        "Zero pronouns are very common in Japanese discourse, but the number of zero pronouns that actually require resolution varies according to the purpose for which analysis results are to be used.",
        "For example, the case of a question and answer system involving a task such as replying to questions from a user who has just read a sentence.",
        "The questions, which can come from several points of view, must be anticipated, and practically all of the zero pronouns in the sentence will require resolution.",
        "In contrast, in the case of machine translation of text, depending on the translation languages, zero pronouns requiring resolution tend to limited.",
        "This paper considers the task of extracting zero pronouns in a Japanese to English text machine translation system.",

        "400 units per month produce \"They produce 400 units of it per month.\" The second sentence has a structure that is centered around the verb \"seisan-suru(produce)\" and the subject and object have become zero pronouns.",
        "But to translate the sentence into natural English, there is a need to rewrite it into a predicate noun sentence (\"da\" sentence, so called because of the original Japanese \"Gessan wa 400 dai da\") to lead (2) Gessan ha 400-dai da.",
        "Monthly production TOP/SUBJ 400 units is \"Monthly production is 400 units\".",
        "To translate the expression in this form, referential analysis of the zero pronouns of the subject and object of the verb \"produce\" is no longer necessary.",
        "When translating this type of expression, the syntactic/semantic structure of the sentence to be translated is first converted into an English type structure in the source language (This is makes the Japanese-Japanese conversion) in an analysis phase.",
        "Selection of only zero pronouns whose referent needs to resolved becomes possible.",
        "between Japanese and English There are verbs, the case elements of which are mandatory in Japanese but optional when translated into English.",
        "For example, an expression such as, in which there is no subject in Japanese, it would be possible to translate this by using the expression,\" X raise Y\".",
        "In cases such as this, it would be useful to prepare case patterns to be used for syntactic analysis for each and every translation of English verb form and designate the English case structure when analyzing the Japanese.",
        "Elements which do not become mandatory cases in English will then not be mandatory cases in Japanese either.",
        "Thus deciding which zero pronouns must be analyzed can be done accurately.",
        "Elements which have become zero pronouns in Japanese will, if the voice can be changed to give natural English, not need to be resolved.",
