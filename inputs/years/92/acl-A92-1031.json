        "Access to on-line corpora is a useful tool for studies in lexicography, linguistics, and translation.",
        "Many means of accessing such corpora are available, but few, if any, provide more than a language for matching character strings.",
        "As a result, the user is obliged to spend a great deal of time extracting information herself.",
        "As more and more texts are put in machine readable format, it becomes increasingly obvious that more specialized, intelligent tools are required to fully exploit the available data.",
        "BCP, the Bilingual Concordancy Program under development at ISSCO, is an instance of such a tool.",
        "In previous work done at ISSCO on BCP, a rather oversimplified view of text structure was taken \\[Warwick et.",
        "al., 1989\\].",
        "Attention was focused on the difficulties of alignment and somewhat less so on access questions.",
        "Alignment remains a subject of active research, but experience has proven that text marking and morphology are not to be taken so lightly.",
        "Indeed, many small difficulties have shown themselves to be insurmountable without the aid of heuristic decision modules.",
        "As a result, the initial approach to text tagging and morphology has been thoroughly revised."

        "The alignment module is the subject of much experimentation and currently is running with the Church-Gale alignment algorithm \\[Gale and Church, 1991\\].",
        "The access module has been described in previous work \\[Warwick et al., 1989\\] and will not be discussed further here.",

        "This is not necessarily a problem either, and can be worked around.",

        "Clearly there is room for expansion and improvement.",
        "The modular structure of BCP is a great strength, as it enables independent use of the modules.",
        "Similarly, the access module functions to its full capacity on the output of the other three, but can also be used on output of the alignment unit alone.",
        "This great flexibility clearly lends itself to ease of integration into other systems."
