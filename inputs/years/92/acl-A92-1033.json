        "Recent approaches to intelligent information retrieval have used natural language (NL) understanding methods instead of keywords and statistical methods.",
        "However, the best NL method is still unknown.",
        "This research studies a restricted form of information, the description associated with identifying multimedia data, i.e., natural language captions.",
        "The rationale and motivation for using captions was presented by Lum and Meyer-Wegener (1990).",
        "A prototype parser was developed for demonstrating how natural language queries could be used in conjunction with Structured Query Language (SQL) for specifying retrieval requests from a multimedia database.",
        "Using these results at the Naval Postgraduate School, we have been able to design a more robust natural language processing and retrieval system for potential use at the Naval Weapons Center (NWC).",
        "The Center's Photo Lab maintains a database of over 100,000 photographs of project and historical data from the last 50 years.",
        "Both captions and supercaptions (caption about a set of captions) are used.",
        "The current search and retrieval strategy uses manually created keywords organized into a keyphrase - a head keyword and a string of descriptive nouns.",
        "Our strategy entails parsing the English captions to produce a logical form, then using the logical form as the basis of the retrieval.",
        "We have labeled this system MARIE (Epistemological Information Retrieval Applied to Multimedia)."

        "The information retrieval system we have developed is based on two stages:.a coarse-grain match to reduce the list of possible information for a later fine-grain match (Rau 1987).",
        "Three tasks that we deemed essential for this system included the ability to represent and produce a logical form of the caption, the ability to generate keywords from the logical form, and the ability to load in previously stored caption logical forms for matching against the query logical form.",
        "We have used an existing natural language processing program, the DBG Message Understanding System (Montgomery et al.",
        "1989), as a starting point.",
        "This program was developed for understanding dialog conversations.",
        "To accommodate the existing captions at NWC, we had to make modifications to the grammar, functional parser, and template processor.",
        "The grammar rules were changed to enable parsing of punctuation, descriptive noun phrases, dates, geographic locations, numeric and descriptive vehicle designations.",
        "Additional rules were introduced to handle theme-oriented phrases as opposed to agent-initiated sentences.",
        "The structure of functional parse output was altered to accommodate mapping into the type hierarchy.",
        "Specifically, tokens were introduced to allow linking together words based on syntactic relationships.",
        "The resulting output structure appears similar to slot-assertion notation.",
        "In the original DBG system, the template processor produced frame structures for a semantic analysis of the sentence.",
        "This portion of the system was redone using an object-oriented programming methodology.",
        "We have created a single type hierarchy to hold both nouns and verbs.",
        "Producing the logical form is a matter of mapping the predicate expressions from the functional parse output into the type hierarchy.",
        "Methods are used to set inner cases for both nouns and verbs (e.g., theme, agent, location, etc.",
        "); set modifiers for nouns and verbs (e.g., adjectives and adverbs); set correlations between classes (e.g., part_of, has_part, program_about, etc.",
        "); and generate the logical form from class instances and associated slot values.",
        "Keyword records to be used in the coarse-grain match are obtained from the type hierarchy directly rather than from the logical form output.",
        "An instance of a class uses the class name as the keyword.",
        "The keyword is based on logically proper names, not definite descriptions as described by Frixione et al.",
        "(1989).",
        "Methods are defined for caching keyword records containing the caption identifier and any case information to a keyword file for each class instance.",
        "Each class has a keyword file maintained in sorted order.",
        "Once an English query is instantiated within the type hierarchy to reflect the query logical form, the instances indicate which class and subclass keyword files need to be examined in the coarse-grain match.",
        "The corresponding keyword files are read, and the keyword records are intersected using the caption-id as the unique identifier.",
        "In the future, case information will be used at query time for specifying the role for a word (e.g, initiator of an action as opposed to the recipient) and treated as a filter in selecting the appropriate case records within the keyword file.",
        "Caption-ids whose intersection score exceed a coarse-grain match threshold become eligible for fine-grain matching.",
        "Fine-grain matching entails mapping the logical form for a stored parsed caption back into the type hierarchy and matching it against the query instances within the hierarchy.",
