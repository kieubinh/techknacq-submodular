        "The text corpus we handled as a concrete example was the Encyclopedic Dictionary of Computer Science (hereafter abbreviated as EDCS.",
        "Iwanami Publ.",
        "1990.",
        "English translation will appear soon from Academic Press).",
        "It includes 4500 terms and has the text volume of two million Japanese characters (4 Mega bytes).",
        "The first part of the term description of EDCS is devoted to synonyms, antonyms, abbreviations and broader concept words.",
        "This part has typical sentential styles such as, (i) A is {sometimes, often, also, commonly, ...} {called, written, named, expressed, ...} as B, C, ..., or D. (ii) A is abbreviated as B.",
        "(iii) A is {an abbreviation, a contraction, ...} of B.",
        "(iv) A stands for B.",
        "(v) We call A S {for short}.",
        "(vi) A is B.",
        "A is included in B.",
        "(vii) A is called as B, so C as D. By finding these sentential patterns the relation between the words A and B is established as follows.",
        "(i) p-link is set up from a synonym word to a sentence which defines the synonym relation.",
        "(ii) slink (by synonym) is set up from a defined word to defining words by synonym relation.",
        "Typical sentential styles of intensional definition are: (i) A is defined as B.",
        "A is regarded as B.",
        "(ii) A means B.",
        "A connotes B.",
        "A is B.",
        "(iii) A is a {kind, form, way, branch, method, ...) of B.",
        "(iv) A is regarded as B, so C as D. By identifying these patterns in a term description part, the relation between the defined word (A) and the definition sentences is established as: (i) p-link is set up from the defined word to the definition sentence when the defined word is not the headword of the term description.",
        "This is the case when the defined word is not so important as a headword of the dictionary, and so a rather simple definition description is embedded in the term description.",
        "(ii) slink (by synonym) is set up between the defined words in the above word extraction process if there are plurals of the defined words.",
        "isa-link is established between a narrower concept word (A) and a broader concept word (B) as A isa B.",
        "Here A and B are descriptors which represent other synonym words, isa thesaurus is first established for the words defined by intensional definitions.",
        "By utilizing this thesaurus extensional definitions are analyzed to get words of broader/narrower relation defined by these sentences (refer to the next section).",
        "Then the thesaurus is reformulated by the addition of new words which have isa relation, and which are obtained from extensional definitions.",
        "3 Extraction of other information Sentences of extensional definition introduce examples and narrower concept words of the defined words.",
        "Typical sentential styles of the extensional definition are: (i) A is {divided, classified, ...} into B, C, ..., and D. (ii) A includes B, C, ..., and D. (iii) There exist B, C, ..., and D {in, for} A.",
        "From these sentences we get the information that A is a defined word, and B, C, ..., and D are narrower (or A is synonym of B A is antonym of B A has B as a component A has a property of B A has an intrinsic function of B A has an extrinsic function of B A deals with B A has a purpose of B Aisusedin B A sets B A is done in/by B lower) concept words.",
        "However, there are sometimes the cases where the above sentential styles do not necessarily mean the expected definitions.",
        "Therefore to make sure the relations A and B, C, ..., and D are the expected one, we introduced a simple checking procedure as follows.",
        "(i) the semantic category of the narrower concept words must be the same as that of the defined word.",
        "(ii) isa thesaurus is checked to see no contradiction between the defined word and its narrower concept words.",
        "By identifying the above sentential patterns in a term description just after the intensional definition sentences, the relation between the defined word (A) and its narrower term (B, C, ..., D) is established as: (i) p-link is set up from a narrower term to its defining sentences which include the word by the condition that the narrower term is not the headword of the dictionary.",
        "(ii) The extracted words have broader/narrower relation and are included in the isa thesaurus, and are given slinks (by isa).",
        "We tried to extract functional relations between words from the definitional sentences.",
        "The extraction is mainly performed by checking the sentential structure and particularly the verb property of the defining sentences, and additional checking is done for the consistency between A and B (Table 1).",
        "Links are established from A to B by slinks with meaning attributes shown in Table 1.",
        "EDCS has, besides the term description, the word tree which is similar to a thesaurus, and which shows graphically the structure of the whole area of computer science.",
        "Word tree is stored in computer by s-link, and p-link is established from a word in the word tree to the corresponding term description, p-link is also established from an index word to the text portion in which the index word is included.",
        "The term description has reference words at the end of the term description.",
        "This reference is done by slink."
