        "Usually, comparison is associated with gradable adjectives and adverbs in various syntactic constructions: hal ein hgheres Gehalt (Aux+A/NP); verdient mehr (V+Adv); rail einem hgheren Gehall (A/PP).",
        "The interpretation of those expressions should be the same.",
        "Datenbank-DIALOG uses a compositional semantics and separates the lexical item from the underlying semantic relation, which may be shared by different words.",

        "The comparative and the value may be adjacent or not, and show up a.s PPs, complex determiners or adverbial phrases.",
        "All these constructions map onto the same semantic representation, a relation, a value along with a dimension and a unit--thus allowing to compare values with different units--and a compared object.",

        "If the value has the correct dimension, it may safely be inserted a.s an argulnent into the cornparison relation.",
        "Otherwise, Datenbank-DIALOG constructs a subquery giving the value by using the dominating relation and fitting the comparison object into the \"subject\" slot of the attribute.",
        "The resulting structure is processed analogously to a top-level query.",
        "As a consequence, anal)hora resolution may be apl)lied enabling Datenbank-DIALOG to give a correct interpretation of Weri verdient mehr als seini Vorgeselzler'?",
        "Domain predicates need not uniquely deterrnine the relation and attributes of a corresponding predicate in the database.",
        "Datenbank-DIALOG splits the interpretation of an utterance into two stages: An interpretation in the domain model, i.e. a caseframe, which is then mapped (using a translation table) to an interpretation in the database lnodel, i.e. a DB-caseframe.",
        "This approach allows to interpret superficially similar queries as quite different SQL queries.",
        "Attributes with the same meaning stored in different tables (nursesalary vs. doctor-salary) can be treated as well as derived attributes (salary computed from basic + variable salary)--in short, the user should not need to know about the actual encoding of information.",

        "Whereas in one database rnodel the imrnber of patients is stored explicitly and can be treated analogously to the salary above, other database models contain this \"attribute\" only implicitly: the number of patients haz to be computed (counted) by the SQL query.",
        "To obtain these quite different interpretations, only a different mapping of the (contents of the) argurnent-slot of the predicate Treatment in the translation step between domain and databa.se level is required.",
        "A special case (where irnplicit attributes must be made explicit) are queries involving the comparison of two subqueries.",
        "This cannot be expressed in a single SQL query.",
        "A ternporary table has to be created containing the relevant count-attribute together with information on the object hearing that attribute.",
        "The actual comparison can then be made with the now explicit attribute.",
        "Most problems with comparatives also occur with superlatives and are dealt with in an analogous way.",

        "is the most plausible interpretation and should be preferred.",
        "To produce this reading, a kind of copying has to he performed: not only must the dominating relation be copied but also the restrictions on the subject slot (i.e., on the bearer of the attribute) have to be inherited.",
        "In Datenbank-DIALOG this copying works on the ca.seframe representation, and thus is able to handle restrictions resulting from different syntactic constructions, such as the lexicon (Ambulanzarzl), APs (in der Ambulanz arbeitende Arzl), PPs (Arzt aus der Ambulanz), NPs (Arzt der Ambulanz) and relative clauses ( Arzt, der in der Ambulanz arbeitet).",
        "All these constructions end up as modifications in the case-frame due to the compositional nature of our approach.",
        "Thus a unified solution for inheritance of modifiers in their various forms is achieved.",
        "A correct comparison is only possible if compared values are of the same dimension and share a unit of measure.",
        "Differences and incompatibilities may arise in different places: frorn special formatting conventions (e.g. 20000, 20.000,-, $20), when the user specifies a dimension and unit of measure verbatim (e.g. \"10 Meter\"), from the database, where coinparable columns may be a.ssociated with different units of Inca.sure.",
        "Datenbank-DIALOG solves this problem--by defining a normalized form azsociating values with units and transformation rules between measures of different units--at the scanner level (l)atterns, e.g. (late formats), at the parser level (linguistic information to fill the slots in the normalized value frame), at the interpretation level (procedures to transform constant values from one unit to another), at the database level (transformation fimctions of the query language)."
