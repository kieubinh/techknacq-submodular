        "The Acquilex Project, within which we are working, follows this paradigm.",
        "The basic aim of Acquilex is the development of techniques and methods in order to use Machine Readable Dictionaries (MRD) * for building lexical components for Natural Language Processing Systems.",
        "SEISD (Sistema de Extracci6n de Informaci6n Semfintica de Diccionarios) is an environment for extracting semantic information from MRDs \\[Agent et al.",
        "91b\\].",
        "The system takes as its input a Lexical Database (LDB) where all the information contained in the MRD has been stored in an structured format.",
        "The extraction process is not fully automatic.",
        "To some extent, the choices made by the system must be both validated and confirmed by a human expert.",
        "Thus, an interactive environment must be used for performing such a task.",
        "One of the main contribution of our system lies in the way it guides the interactive process, focusing on the choice points and providing access to the information relevant to decision taking.",
        "System performance is controlled by a set of weighted heuristics that supplies the lack of algorithmic criteria or their vagueness in several crucial decision points.",
        "We will now summarize the most important characteristics of our system: modes of performance.",
        "The final goal of a system like ours \\[Agent et al., 91a\\] is to obtain a large conceptual structure where the nodes would correspond to the lexical senses in the dictionary, the information present in definitions would be encoded within the nodes and the relations would be made explicit.",
        "The kind of relations we can set between senses are the relations that appear, in an explicit or implicit form, in the dictionary entries.",
        "The most important relation is, of course, the ISA one, which allows us to build a taxonomy of concepts related by the hypemym-hyponym links.",
        "Although a brute force approach is used sometimes for limited purposes, we cannot follow this for two main reasons: * The lack of limitations over the words that could appear in the dictionary definitions that would imply the use of a general-purpose morphological analyzer with a very large coverage.",
        "* The need for different grammars to parse entry definitions belonging to distant semantic fields (we use different grammars for parsing entries belonging to \"substance\", \"food\" or \"instrument\" fields).",
        "The conclusion was to build the whole conceptual structure from several \"chunks\" of conceptual nets, so that each one would correspond to a narrow domain and would be built independently.",
        "For each of these domains we have selected one or more starting words or senses (that correspond to the root of the taxonomies we intend to extrac0 and proceeded top-down from them."

        "Our system carries out four differents tasks: taxonomy construction, semantic relations extraction, heuristics validation and knowledge integration into a LKB (Lexical Knowledge Base that will contain the conceptual structures extracted from the LDB) as shown in figure 1.",
        "The first one consists of the extraction of the taxonomy structure which underlies the dictionary definitions, starting from a top entry.",
        "The second, the extraction of the other semantic relations which appear in the definitions of the taxonomy already created.",
        "The validation of the heuristics applied in the taxonomy construction is the third task.",
        "Finally, all the information acquired is integrated into the LKB.",
        "The choosed formalism for defining LKB structures is based on a typed Feature structure (FS) system augmented with default This module is in charge of the extraction of the taxonomies which underlie the definitions of the Vox dictionary.",
        "In our case, the problem of the extraction of the generic term is solved by means of FPar syntactic-semantic analyser \\[Carroll 90\\] with a general simplified grammar for the extraction of the generic term and specific ones for the modifiers.",

        "The input of the analyser is a sense augmented with its morphological features..",
        "The morphological analysis is carded out using an optimized version of Seg-Word analyzer \\[Sanfilippo 90\\].",
        "Once a taxonomy is created, a treelike structure in which all the senses included are connected with their hyperonym (except for the first Top entry ) and their hyponym (except the terminal senses) is available.",
        "The next step (semantic extraction) lies in performing a similar process to the taxonomy building, but with a different grammar and without user intervention.",
        "This batch process is called definition analysis.",
        "The grammar, of course, must be more complete and complex than the one for generic term extraction, because it must allow the extraction of the \"differentia\" from the definitions associated to the nodes of the taxonomy.",
        "The definitions of sets of parametrized heuristics, the use of these sets for guiding the selection process and the existence of a mechanism for evaluating the performance and allowing the updating of such heuristics, constitute relevant features of our system.",
