        "During the last years it has become increasingly apparent that dialog and text understanding systems must account for connectivity relations that extend over sentence boundaries.",
        "This has led to a bulk of work dealing with various forms of cohesion-preserving language mechanisms, mainly in the field of anaphora, which contribute to connectivity among sentences.",
        "From the focus on these linguistic phenomena one might obtain a misleading picture of textual_ connectivity, viz. one that considers it basically as a continuous stream of formally connected utterances lacking additional structure.",
        "Far less research has been devoted to the internal organization of cohesive utterances by mechanisms at a more global level of dialog/text architecture, the level of text coherence.",
        "Major computational approaches related to coherence aspects within a dialog processing framework are due to Reichman's [1978], McKeown's [1985] and Scha & Polanyi's [1988] formalizations of dialog grammars.",
        "Coherence criteria of written texts have been investigated in the context of 'Rhetorical Structure Theo-ry' [Mann & Thompson 1988] and related extensions [e.g., Alterman 1982, Tucker, Nirenburg & Raskin 1986] of the original theory of coherence relations in discourse [Hobbs 1982].",
        "A second major methodology which deals with the global structuring of written texts is the model of text macro propositions and superstmc-tures [Kintsch & van Dijk 1978, van Dijk 1980], the latter sharing all relevant properties one generally attributes to story grammars [Rumelhart 1975].",
        "The problem with this kind of methodology is that, unlike the coherence relation approach, the granunats which have been proposed so far are fairly idiosyncratic for each application domain (narratives, weather reports, etc.).",
        "Common to all these approaches is the requirement of a deep, propositionally guided understanding of the underlying discourse; in particular, a complete theory of its domain and an exhaustive specification of a natural language grammar must be supplied in order to guarantee proper operation of implemented systems.",
        "This might explain why, with only few exceptions, these models of text coherence have resisted further computational treatment as evidenced by operational systems.",
        "We here make an altentative and computationally more tractable proposal On how to deal with global text structures at the text coherence level.",
        "Its roots can be traced back to the seminal work of It, Danes [1974], in which he informally developed the notion of thematic progression patterns, distinguishing between three prototypical patterns, viz. constant theme, continuous the-utilization of themes, and derived theme (see section 3).",
        "The model outlined in this paper starts from a thorough formalization of (one of) these notions and places it into the environment of a fully operational text parsing system whose design is mainly oriented towards the proper recognition of text cohesion and coherence phenomena.",
        "Pertinent reasons for our choice of it Danes-type model of text coherence are: (1) The text parser forms part of the text understanding system TOPIC.",
        "It operates in a road-world domain [Reimer & I taint 1988], i.e. textual input is taken from a permaticut stream of test reports in major German information technology magazines.",
        "As it seems that it will remain infeasible for a long time to come to provide exhaustive domain and grammar specifications for routinely operating text understanders, a particularly robust partial parsing approach capable of handling potential specification gaps has been adopted.",
        "'these conditions obviously preclude the consideration of RST-style coherence relation computing as a text coherence analysis shategy, since relevant knowledge portions to ight be lacking for determining specific instances of coherence relations.",
        "Conversely, the coherence relation approach seems currently infeasible for the routine processing of large-scale text collections ill real domains.",
        "(2) The description of coherence structures in terms of coherence relations or text macro propositions requires the availability of deep arsertional knowledge from their application domain (A-box level specifications in Krypton terminology; cf. Brachman et al.",
        "[19850.",
        "The TOPIC system, however, emphasizes the role of terminological knowledge of its domain, i.e. the description of prototypical properties and inference rules related to basic conceptual units of the domain (Krypton's T-Ixix level knowledge).",
        "As TOPIC is rather weak with respect to full-blown assertional knowledge, coherence relation computing, however valuable it might be, is currently out of reach for this system.",
        "Fortunately, Danes-type coherence patterns primarily refer to the level of terminological knowledge.",
        "(3) Prototypical patterns of thematic progression are fairly general and independent of particular domains that expository texts deal with.",
        "Linguistic studies have collected empirical evidence for this claim through investigations of texts from diverse domains [Giora 1983a, Kurzon 1984].",
        "This coincides with the generality of use of most coherence relations, but is in sharp contrast to the highly constrained and domain-dependent model of superstructures and story grammars.",
        "(4) Major thematic progression patterns are correlated with particular search styles and retrieval modes in full-text information systems.",
        "Hence, providing typed coherence operators inherently supports graphics-based user interactions with the TOPIC system in terms of advanced conceptual orientation and navigation tools for semantically guided text graph tours (see section 5.3).",
        "(5) The investigation of thematic progression pattems is of value in its own methodological right.",
        "They constitute a basic structural model of text macro organization as opposed to model-theoretic and plan/goal-based approaches (a distinction made by Pustejovsky [1987]).",
        "As such they might complement current text understanding methodologies whose emphasis, so far, has been on fairly knowledge-expensive assertional models (such as coherence relations and text macro propositions) or stereotyped text-semantical models (such as superstructures and story grammars)."

Hahn [1990] for a more comprehensive presentation).",

        "In this paper, a structural model of text coherence computation has been proposed that strongly exploits the knowledge chunking inherent to frame representations.",
        "These precompiled knowledge structures are instantiated by the topical evolution of a text as represented in the parser's bulletin.",
        "Thus, various coherence phenomena can be distinguished by particular instantiation patterns: 0 constant theme is defined by multiple instantiations of aggregation (or conceptual association) relations for one particular frame item in KB; Cl continuous thematization of themes is defined by multiple instantiations of aggregation relations for continuously changing, though locally overlapping frame items in KB; derived theme is defined by multiple instantiations of generalization/classification relations holding between subparts of a frame hierarchy in KB.",
        "A more elaborated formal description of this model - including those parts which could only be treated rather sketchily in this contribution - is given in Hahn [1991].",
        "The parser is currently running on SUN SPARCStations under Unix (SUNOS V4.1.1).",
        "The functionality described in this paper is fully operational and part of the TOPIC text understanding system."
