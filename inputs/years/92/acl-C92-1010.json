        "Consequently, agglutinative languages contain words of considerable complexity, and parsing such languages necessitates a thorough morphological analysis.",
        "Morphological parsing has attracted relatively little attention in computational linguistics.",
        "The reason is that nearly all parsing research has been concerned with English, or with languages morphologically similar to English.",
        "Since in such languages words contain only a few number of affixes.",
        "or 110/10 at all.",
        "allmost all of the parsing models for them consider recognizing those affixes as being trivial.",
        "and thus do not require a morphological analysts.",
        "In agglutinative languages, words contain no direct indication of morpheme boundaries which are in general dependent on the morphological and phonological context_ A morphological parser requires a morphophouolog-ical component.",
        "which mediates ha \\Veen the surface form of a morpheme as encountered in the input test and the lexical form in which t he morpheme is stored in the morpheme inventory, i.e., a means of recognizing variant forms of morphemes as the same, and a morphotactic component which specifics which rout-luminous of morphemes are permitted [7].",
        "Morphological parsing algorithms may lie divided into two classes as air, .slrippi»g and rool-d ri itarsal.. ysis methods.",
        "Both approaches have been used front very early on in the history of morphological parsing.",
        "For instance, Packard's parser for ancient.",
        "Greek [15), and Brodda and karlsson's for Finnish [3] used affix stripping.",
        "Sagvall, ou the other hand, devised it root-driven morphological analyzer for Russian [17].",
        "In addition, other root driven morphological parsers for the agglutinative languages Quechua [9, 10], Finnish [11], and Turkish [hi] were developed independently in the early 1980's.",
        "All of these three parsers proceed from left t.o right.",
        "Roots are sought in the lexicon that match initial substrings of the word, and the grammatical category of the root determines what class of suffixes 'Hay follow.",
        "When a suffix in the permitted class is found to match a further substring of the word, grammatical information in the lexical entry for that suffix determines once again what class of suffixes may follow.",
        "If the end of the word can be reached by iteration of this process, and if the last suffix analyzed is one which may end a word, the parse is successful [7].",
        "Another left-to-right parsing algoritlini for automatic analysis of Turkish words was proposed and applied by Kiiksal in his Ph.D. thesis [12].",

        "This part is looked for in the suffix morpheme forms dictionary and the morphemes are identified one by one.",

        "In such cases the previous pseudo-solution is reduced by OW' character and all the search procedure is initiated once more.",
        "These approaches to morphological parsing of Turkish words have the following shortcoming: They do not consider the fact that in Turkish, words contain tremendous amount of semantic information that has to be taken into account.",
        "In these parsers, it is only the grammatical category of the stem that determine the suffixes that may follow.",
        "However, most of the suffixes in Turkish, especially the derivational ones, can be attached only to a limited number of roots or stems mostly due to semantic reasons.",
        "Another shortcoming of the previous parsers for Turkish is that they allow the iterative usage of derivational suffixes.",
        "Although, KOksal [12], prevents the consecutive usage of the Same morpheme twice, he still parses the word GOZLEKC'OLUKCIPLON correctly, so do Hanhamer [7].",

        "One of the most important application areas of parsing words in natural languages is checking their spellings.",
        "Although many spelling checkers for English and some other languages have been developed, so far no such tool was present for 'Turkish.",

        "Wrong ordering of morphemes and errors in vowel or consonant harmonies may cause the wrong spelling of Turkish words.",

        "As a result, the number of parsers developed for agglutinative languages, and particularly for Turkish, is quite limited, and they have certain shortcomings.",
        "We have solved most, of the problems encountered in the previous parsers by making a detailed and careful research on Turkish word formation rules and their exceptions [20].",
        "These results may hopefully be helpful for future researchers on Turkish linguistics.",
        "We should note that even though it is claimed that word formation rules in Turkish are well–defined and Turkish is a very regular language, as used today it shows many irregularities that cause the problem of parsing this language to become a very hard and interesting problem.",
        "Many grammar books have been referred to collect Turkish word formation rules.",
        "In those books, after each rule is defined, usually it is reminded that there may occur some exceptions to that rule in some conditions, but mostly those conditions can not be \"well\" defined.",
        "For example, in all Turkish grammar books, it is said that \"When a Turkish word ending with one of the consonants P, T, K receives a suffix beginning with a consonant, that final consonant is softened, but there are some such words whose final consonant does not change.\" However, none of the books says what the common property of those words which do not obey to that rule is, because most probably it is not known yet.",
