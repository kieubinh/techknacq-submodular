        "HPSG borrows freely from other formalisms.",
        "For example, the treatment of syntactic categories, syntactic features, and some of the principles are from generalized phrase structure grammar (GPSG) [GKPS85].",
        "The main syntactic categories in HPSG are heads (the head constituents of phrases), adjuncts (traditionally called modifiers) and complements (traditionally called arguments).",
        "The principles of HPSG include the Constituent Order Principle, Sub-categorization Principle, Head Feature Principle, and Semantics Principle.",

        "The LP constraints are used by the Constituent Order Principle.",
        "HPSG rules are immediate dominance (ID) rules.",
