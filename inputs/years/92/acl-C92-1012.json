        "These resources could in principle be useful for many applications although they hardly ever are: due to the lack of agreement on the definition of basic notions and of consensus on the analysis of linguistic phenomena they are often linked too closely to specific applications.",
        "Moreover, given the generally limited size and duration of NLP projects both quantity and quality of such project-specific databases are disappointing.",

        "Furthermore, given that humans can use their intelligence and knowledge of the language(s), much information is only present in unformalized definitions and examples.",
        "As discussed in e.g. [McNaught, 1988], it is often feasible to extract (relatively) formalized information, but the cost-effectiveness of automatic extraction of information from less formalized data is highly questionable.",
        "From this discussion it follows that MRDs alone cannot be the source for NLP dictionaries.",
        "In section 2.2 we will discuss in more detail the evaluation of the potential sources of data for our specific purposes.",
        "Corpora Automatic extraction of lexical features by applying various pattern recognition techniques to large bodies of text has received some attention recently (cf. e.g. [Zernik and Jacobs, 1990]).",
