        "We have shown how some non canonical arguments can be naturally handled using the formalism of Synchronous TAGs, provided the syntax-semantic synchronicity is incorporated as a well-formednesss condition in the grammar.",
        "We have applied this treatment to French pronominal clitics and handle thei,- complementary distribution with complements, without increasing the number of elementary trees in the grammar, Thanks to the extended domain of locality of TAGs, their locality constraints are handled (similarly as subjacency) without specific stipulations.",
        "We also handle cases of non local dependencies, provided one adds alternative semantic representation for ambiguous clitic complements.",
        "The same idea can be extended to other cases of mismatches between syntactic attachment and semantic role, such as \"extended\" adverb scoping or extraposition."
