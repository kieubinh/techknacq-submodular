        "Pedagogical grammar books typically organize their descriptions of the inflectional morphology of a language in terms of paradigms, groups of rules which characterize the inflectional behavior of some subset of the language's vocabulary.",
        "A French grammar may divide verbs into the first, second, and third conjugations; German grammars speak of \"weak\" and \"strong\" verbs; Spanish grammars classify verbs by their infinitival endings, etc.",
        "The family of word forms that each vocabulary item may have can thus he described by a combination of a base stein (such as the \"citation form\" used to index words in a dictionary) and the paradigm the word belongs to.",
        "Irregular words, which exhibit behaviors not completely captured by general paradigms, often tend to be partially describable by reference to regular paradigmatic patterns.",
        "The word formation rules that comprise a paradigm are usually expressed in terms of a sequence of stem change and affixation operations.",
        "For example, one French textbook INEBEL741, in describing first conjugation verbs, shows how to form present tense forms using the infinitival stem with its \"er\" suffix removed.",
        "Future tense is formed by appending affixes to the full infinitival stem, while the stem of the imperfect tense is found by taking the first person plural of the present tense and dropping the \"ons\".",
        "In addition to such word formation rules, there are spelling change rules which describe variations in spelling, often conditioned by the phonological Or orthographic context in which a word formation rule is applied.",
        "While the above characterization of morphological behavior is a huniliar one, most description languages that have been developed for computational morphology (e.g., I KO-SKENNIEMI84 I, [GORZ881 ) have tended to focus more on the orthographic and affixation rules, and pay less attention to explicitly capturing the regularities within and between paradigms.",
        "Recently, some researchers have begun exploring the advantages to be derived from a notation in which paradigms play a more central role (e.g., ICALDER89L IRUSSELL9I I).",
        "This paper presents such a notation, called PDF (for Paradigm Description Language), which we are using as the basis of the morphological analyzer for AI-STARS, a nuthi-lingual \"lexiconassisted\" information retrieval system (tANICK90I).",
        "It has been a goal of our high-level language design to preserve, as much as possible, the kinds of descriptive devices traditionally used in grammar books.",
        "Our approach to the representation of paradigms borrows from the Artificial Intelligence community's notion of \"frames\", data structures made up of slots with attached procedures, organized hierarchically to support default slot inheritance and overrides (e.g., EROBROW77 0.",
        "In a paradigm's \"frame\", the slots correspond to surface and stem forms, whose values are either explicitly stored (in the lexicon) or else computed by word formation rules.",
        "The hierarchical organization of paradigms helps to capture the shared linguistic behaviors among classes of words in an explicit and concise manner.",
        "Our application domain introduces several constraints on the design of its morphological component: • The morphological recognizer must work with a dynamic secondary storage lexicon accessed via an index on stem forms.",
        "Tins constraint rules out approaches relying on a left to right scan of the word using special in-memory letter tree encodings of the dictionary (e.g., [GORZ881).",

        "23-28, 1992 in which potential stems are derived by affix removal/addition and/or stem charges and then probed for in the lexicon.",
        "• The morphological information must additionally support surface form generation and \"guessing\".",
        "The guesser, to be employed in computer-assisted lexicon acquisition, must he able to construct potential caa-aon forms (e.g., infinitive forms for verbs), not just stripped stems.",
        "• The high-level language (PDL) must be compliable",
        "into a form suitable for efficient runtime performance.",
        "This implies not only efficient in-memory data structures but also a system which minimizes disk (lexicon) accesses.",
        "Our aim is to develop morphological representations for a number of (primarily European) languages.",
        "We have built fairly complete representations for English, French, and German, and have begun investigating Spanish.",
        "While it is premature to predict how well our approach will apply across the range of European languages, we have found it contains a number of desirable aspects for applications such as Al-STARS.",
        "In the next section, we provide an overview of the PDL language, describing how word formation rules are organized into a hierarchy of paradigms and how the lexicon and morphological rules interact.",
        "Then we provide an illustration of the use of paradigm inheritance to construct a concise encoding of French verb forms.",
        "Next we present algorithms for the compilation of PDL into efficient runtime data structures, and for the recognition and generation of word forms.",
        "We conclude with an evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the approach, and areas for future research."

        "Our experience so far with PDL has supported our hypothesis that organizing morphological behavior in terms of hierarchically related inflectional paradigms helps to explicitly characterize die similarities and differences among classes of words and makes it easier to capture in a concise and transparent manner the kinds of word formation rules described in many grammar books.",
        "The language can be compiled into a form amenable to efficient analysis and generation with a dynamic secondary storage lexicon, Future work includes further \"tuning\" of existing rulesets, extending our coverage of European languages, and interfacing the inflectional system with rules of deri-vational morphology and compounding."
