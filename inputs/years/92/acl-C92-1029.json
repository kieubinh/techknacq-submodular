        "Analysis of a long Japanese sentence is one of many difficult problems which cannot be solved by the continuing efforts of many researchers and remain abandoned.",
        "It is difficult to get a proper analysis of a sentence whose length is more than fifty Japanese characters, and almost all the analyses fail for sentences composed of more than eighty characters.",
        "To clarify why it is is also very difficult because there are varieties of reasons for the failures.",
        "People sometimes say that there are so many possibilities of modifier/modifyee relations between phrases in a long sentence.",
        "But no deeper consideration has ever been given for the reasons of the analysis failure.",
        "Analysis failure here means not only that no correct analysis is included in the multiple analysis results which are caused by the intrinsic ambiguity of a sentence and also by inaccurate grammatical rules, but also that the analysis fails in the middle of the analysis process.",
        "We have been claiming that many (more than two) linguistic components are to be seen at the same time in a sentence for proper parsing, and also that tree to tree transformation is necessary for reliable analysis of a sentence.",
        "Popular grammar rules which merge two linguistic components into one are quite insufficient to describe the delicate relationships among components in a long sentence.",
        "Language is complex.",
        "There often happens that components which are far apart in a long sentence co occur, or have certain relationships.",
        "Such relations may be sometimes purely semantic, but often they are grammatical or structural, although they are not definite but very subtle.",
        "A long sentence, particularly of Japanese, contains parallel structures very often.",
        "They are either conjunctive noun phrases, or conjunctive predicative clauses.",
        "The latter is called \"Renyoh chuushiho\".",
        "They appear in an embedded sentence to modify nouns, and also are used to connect two or more sentences.",
        "This form is very often used in Japanese, and is a main cause for structural ambiguity.",
        "Many major sentential components are omitted in the posterior part of Renyoh chuushi expressions and this makes the analysis more difficult.",
        "For the successful analysis of a long Japanese sentence, these parallel phrases and clauses, including Renyoli chuushi-ho, must be recognized correctly.",
        "This is a key point, and this must be achieved by a completely different method from the ordinary syntactic analysis methods, because they generally fail in the analysis for a long sentence.",
        "We have introduced an assumption that these parallel phrases/clauses have a certain similarity, and have developed an algorithm which finds out a most plausible two series of words which can be considered parallel by calculating a similarity measure of two arbitrary series of words.",
        "This is realized by using the dynamic programming method.",
        "The results was exceedingly good.",
        "We achieved the score of about 80% in the detection of various types of parallel series of words in long Japanese sentences.",
        "2 Types of Conjunctive Structures and Their Ambiguities First, we will explain what kind of conjunctive structures (hereafter abbreviated as 'CS') appear in Japanese[1][2].",

        "60 sentences which are longer and more complex than the average sentences are collected from each of the following three sources; Encyclopedic Dictionary of Computer Science (EDCS) published by lwanami Publishing Co., Abstracts of papers of Japan Information Center of Science and Technology (JICST), and popular science journal, \"Science\", translated into Japanese (Vol.17,No.12 \"Advanced Computing for Science\").",

        "The method of calculating the path score was adjusted during the experiments on 30 sentences out of 60 sentences from EDCS.",
        "Then the other 150 sentences are analyzed by these parameters.",
        "As the analyses were successful as shown in the following, this method can be regarded as properly representing the balanced weights on each factor.",
        "This method defines where the CS ends, that is, which bunsetsu corresponds to the KB.",
        "However, as for conjunctive noun phrases containing clause modifiers or conjunctive predicative clauses, it is almost impossible to find out exactly where the CS starts, because many bunsetsus which modify right-hand bunsetsus exist in each part of the CSs and usually they do not correspond exactly.",
        "Thus it is necessary to revise the starting position of the CS obtained by this method.",
