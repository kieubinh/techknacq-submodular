        "Lexicalized tree-adjoining grammar (LTAG) (Schabes et al., 1988; Schabes, 1990) is a tree-rewriting formalism used for specifying the syntax of natural languages.",
        "It combines elementary lexical trees with two operations, adjoining and substitution.",
        "In a LTAG, lexical items are associated with complex syntactic structures (in the form of trees) that define the various phrase structures they can participate in.",
        "LTAG allows for unique syntactic and semantic properties:",
        "• The domain of locality in LTAG is larger than for other formalisms, and • Most syntactic dependencies (such as filler-gap, verb-subject, verb-objects) and some semantic •The first author is partially supported by NSF Grant IR190.. 16591.",

        "schabesCninagi .",
        "cis .upenu.edu dependencies (such as predicate-argument) have been localized within the elementary trees stated in the lexicon.",
        "These unique properties of LTAGs have been shown to be linguistically very useful (Kroch and Joshi, 1985; Kroch, 1987; Kroch, 1989; AbelIle, 1988; Shieber and Scbabes, 1990).",
        "However these same aspects can cause many practical problems.",
        "This is because there is considerable redundancy of information among the elementary trees that provide the enlarged domain of locality.",
        "So far, the lexicon of a LTAG has been organized in a completely fiat manner, not allowing for any sharing of syntactic or semantic properties of the lexical items.",
        "Also, in the current organization there is no structure sharing among the different trees associated with the different lexical items as they are stated independently of each other.",
        "For example, Figure 1 shows some of the trees associated with the lexical item 'eat'.",
        "In Figure 1, the tree al corresponds to a declarative sentence, 02 to a WII-question on its subject and ce3 to a relative clause in which the subject has been relativized.",
        "This example illustrates the redundancy among the elementary trees found in the lexicon.",
        "For example, the effect of the rule S NP VP is found in all trees associated with a verb.",
        "Similarly, VP V NP is found in all trees associated with a transitive verb.",
        "The current implementation of the LTAG for English (Abeille et al., 1990) comprises over 800 sentential tree frames (trees without lexical items).",
        "Each one of these frames includes a part that correspond to the rule S NP VP.",
        "This problem of replication of information has reached an acute stage and any practical natural language processing system based on LTAG must address this issue.",
        "An equally serious problem is one of maintaining and updating such a grammar.",
        "It arises due to the lack of structure-sharing and of statements of various independent principles that make up the elementary trees.",
        "Any small change to some aspect of the design of the grammar could necessitate making changes to possibly hundreds of trees manually.",
        "For instance, an addition of a constraint equation associated with the rule S NP VP would affect the description of every tree associated with a verb; a change to the way wh-questions are formed must be propagated to every tree for wh-question.",
        "Furthermore, one can only manually verify that such an update does not conflict with",
        "any other principle already instantiated.",
        "Given the size of the grammar, this is not a feasible task.",
        "2 Goals of the Proposed Work The problems mentioned above indicate an urgent need for addressing the issue of organization of a LTAG.",
        "For a LTAG, much of this effort would have to deal with the organization of the lexicon and the elementary trees.",
        "Proposals for a compact representation of the lexicon and grammars have been suggested.",
        "For example, Flickinger (1987) and Pollard and Sag (1987) use a hierarchical lexicon and rules for implementing Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammars.",
        "Shieber (1986) proposed the use of default inheritance combined with templates and of transformation rules in the PATR-II system for organizing a unification based grammar.",
        "Lexical redundancy rules have been used in LFG (Bres-nan and Kaplan, 1983) to capture relations among lexical items, Gazdar et al.",
        "(1985) proposed the use of meta-rules for expressing transformational relationships.",
        "There has been suggestions for compacting the size of a tree-adjoining grammar lexicons (Becker, 1990; Habert, 1991).",
        "However, they only partially solve the problem since they fail to combine in a uniform way a compact representation of the lexicon and, at the same time, of their associated elementary trees.",
        "In this paper, we present a scheme to efficiently represent a LTAG and illustrate this scheme by examples.",
        "We examine the information that needs to be associated with the classes in our hierarchical organization in order that we can represent the elementary trees of a LTAG.",
        "Our main concern in this paper is the proposal for organizing a LTAG.",
        "In order to be concrete, we consider the representation of a particular grammar for English (Abeille et al., 1990).",
        "While the elegance (and the correctness) of the mechanisms used to capture linguistic generalizations is an important issue in such an enterprise, these linguistic concerns are beyond the scope of this work.",
        "We give no linguistic motivations for the grammar that is being represented, nor for some of the methods used to represent it.",
        "The linguistic aspects of the work presented in this paper are meant to be suggestive.",
        "Also, while our scheme borrows heavily from Flickinger (1987), it is differentiated from similar enterprises in that we consider the representation of syntactic structures (in the form of trees) associated with lexical items.",
        "For this reason, we concentrate on the representation of the tree structures.",
        "The representation we propose allows for structures sharing between lexical entries and for syntactic and lexical rules while being lexically sensitive.",
        "Lexical items as well as the elementary trees found in a lex-icalized tree-adjoining grammar are organized in a hierarchical lexicon using inheritance.",
        "Furthermore, the lexical rules relate the information associated with lexical entries together.",
        "In particular, they derive new elementary trees of extended domain of locality from the one found in the hierarchical lexicon.",

        "In general this method for building a tree to be associated with a lexical item can be described as follows.",
        "First the nodes described in each superclass of the lexical entry are collected along with the statements of relationships specified between the nodes.",
        "This may require renaming of nodes in case nodes in different classes are given the same name.",
        "For instance, when we collect the nodes specified in VERB and TRANSITIVE, the VP nodes specified in them must be renamed (say as vpt and vp2) as must the NP nodes (say, the node for the subject that is specified in VERB gets renamed as npi and the object specified in TRANSITIVE gets renamed as np2).",

        "Using this type of reasoning about the structural properties of trees, the structure given above gets created.",
        "To complete the discussion of the inheritance of the tree descriptions, the head-daughter relations are noted in order that they can be used for feature sharing.",
        "Also the set of afy nodes are also collected and called the args of the lexical entry.",
