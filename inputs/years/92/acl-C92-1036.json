        "Separating semantics and pragmatics is important for the design of natural language systems, as well as for linguistic purposes, because the former is inherently dependent on particular lexical items involved or the overall organization of the particular language in question, thus comprising a language-dependent part of the interpretive system, whereas the latter is essentially related to a more general and presumably language-independent reasoning processes of the human or other agents involved in dialogues.",
        "Previous linguistic study on the semantics of Japanese functional words such as date did not pay enough attention to carefully distinguishing the pragmatic factors involved from the (lexical) semantic contents of those words.",
        "In order to build efficient natural language systems, however, we believe that not only do we have to account for the semantics of each and every lexical items under consideration, but we need to have a general account of certain pragmatic aspects of the interpretations we obtain.",
        "One typical case of this kind of pragmatic inferences manifests itself in interpretations of Japanese sentences with date , which roughly corresponds to the English word only.",
        "We believe that the kind of analysis we propose here is a prototypical example of what is necessary for successful natural language interpretation."
