        "Previous work on the semantics of bare plural NPs has largely focussed on the contribution they make in habitual sentences like",
        "(1) Mary eats peaches.",
        "and (2) John likes driving fast cars.",
        "Both (1) and (2) seem to express tendencies, general rules.",
        "If you heard (1) then you would feel confident that you could offer Mary a peach for dessert.",
        "(1) seems to express a general characteristic of Mary, namely that if you offer her a peach in a suitable situation she will eat it.",
        "If you heard (2) then you would hide the keys of your Ferrari when John was visiting.",
        "(2) tells you that if he gets the chance of driving a fast car he is likely to take it.",
        "If we take (1) and (2) as paradigms of the way bare plural NPs get used then it is reasonable to suppose that they express some kind of general property.",
        "The NP peaches in (1), for instance, seems to express some relationship between Mary and peaches in general, or possibly between Mary and the property of being a peach.",
        "This feeling that bare plural NPs express general relationships has led to some rather desperate strategies.",
        "One is to suppose that they should be treated just as though they were universally quantified.",
        "The most cursory examination, however, shows that this cannot be right.",
        "It simply is not true that (1) entails that Mary has any relationship to the set of all peaches.",
        "It is not even true that it entails that she will always eat a peach if you offer her one in the right circumstances.",
        "Whatever bare plural NPs do, they do not act like universally quantified NPs.",
        "A more sophisticated approach treats them as denoting properties.",
        "Chierchia and Turner [1987], for instance, interpret (1) as saying that Mary is in some relationship to the property of being a peach.",
        "There are two problems with this approach.",
        "The first is that they fail to be very explicit about what this relationship is, so that the proposal simply does not get us very far.",
        "The second is that whatever the relationship turns out to be we seem to end up with a systematic ambiguity in the meanings of simple verbs like eat.",
        "In",
        "(3) Mary is eating a peach.",
        "it looks as though the verb eat denotes a relation between two individuals, namely Mary and some peach.",
        "In (1), however, it must denote a relationship between an individual (Mary) and a property (the property of being a peach).",
        "Eat, it seems, is polymorphic.",
        "And so must every other verb which can take either an indefinite NP or a bare plural as complement be.",
        "Furthermore, there must be some systematic relation between the two interpretations of each of these verbs.",
        "It would surely be better to express this systematic relation in the semantics of the bare plural NPs, and to leave verbs like eat as relations between individuals.",
        "Much the same can be said of Carlson's [1989] proposal that bare plurals denote extended individuals and indefinite NPs denote stages of individuals.",
        "If we take this approach then (a) most English verbs must be polymorphic, accepting either extended individuals or stages of individuals as arguments, and (b) there must be some systematic relationship between these pairs of meanings.",
        "It is particularly disappointing that Carlson's discussion of this systematic relationship consists of the use of a type-raising operator Gn which is given no semantics.",
        "A third approach is to try to capture the feeling that bare plurals indicate some sort of \"tendency\" by appealing to non-monotonic logic.",
        "Just as with the analysis in terms of universals, however, this just seems to get the intuitions wrong.",
        "What sort of non-monotonic paraphrase can we give to (1)?",
        "It certainly",
        "This says that there is a singleton set A of \"eating events\"; that for each member of A the agent is E (remember, A is a singleton set so there is in fact only one such member); that there is a singleton set B of peaches which is the object of every member of A; that every member of A is extended and took place at some past instant; and that the existence of a unique singleton set E of items called John is presupposed, It is easy to argue with the details of this analysis of (7), particularly with the temporal element, but the basic outline is familiar.",
        "We now want an analysis of (8) Mary was eating peaches.",
        "which fits our intuition that (8) refers to an eating event whose agent was Mary and all of whose objects were peaches.",
        "The following seems suitable:",
        "This says that B is a singleton set of instantaneous events; that the sole member of this set took place at some past instant A; that its agent is the entity described by the presupposition that there is a single entity called Mary in the context; and that all its objects are peaches.",
        "This formal paraphrase seems to fit our intuitions about (8) perfectly.",
        "How did we obtain it?"

        "We follow the tradition first established by Russell, and made concrete by Montague, of treating NP semantics as generalised quantifiers, i.e. as expressions which provide the quantificational information required for turning some proposition schema into a proposition.",
        "Montague, for instance, regards the meaning of every student as something like",
        "P.X to denote the application of P to X).",
        "Applying this to a property such as A(Y, sleep(Y)) will produce the sentence V X student(X) sleep(X).",
        "In general, the meaning of an NI) is treated in this tradition as something which will lower the type of an expression – something which will turn a property into a proposition, or a function from properties to properties into a property, or ... We make one slight change to this analysis of NP semantics.",
        "The standard treatment of NPs says that they are of type (e t) t. In other words, they take a function which maps individuals (entities of type e) to truth values (entities of type t) and return a truth value.",
        "We propose to generalise a step further, making NP semantics map functions of type (e t) t to truth values (i.e. that they are of type ((e t) t) t)).",
        "Thus we propose that the matrix for every student should be ),(A, A.A(B, VCND member(D,C) student(D)] 13.C)).",
        "The embedded expression A(H, VC[VD member(D, C) t student(D)1 B.C) is similar to the generalised quantifier that standard model theoretic semantics provides for every student.",
        "The only difference is that we are quantifying over sets of students (i.e. over sets C satsifying the requirement that V Drnember(D,C) student(D)) rather than over individuals.",
        "The meaning of the NP is then an expression which is waiting for something which will combine with this standard generalised quantifier.",
        "We will refer to such objects as generalised' quantifiers, to emphasise the extra level of abstraction.",
        "We obtain such representations of NP semantics in the usual way, by taking the meanings of determiners to be even higher level objects which get combined with the meanings of nominal groups.",
        "Thus the meaning of every is AV, A (A, A.A(B, V C [V D member(D, C) E.D] B.C))).",
        "Applying this to A (X, student(X)), the meaning of the nominal group consisting of the word student, produces A(A, A.A(B, V C [V D member(D, C) student(D)] B.C)) as required.",
        "Similarly if the meaning of a is taken to be A(E, A(A, 3 B [V C member(C, 13) E.C] A IBI = 1 A A.A(D, D.B))) then the meaning of a peach becomes A(A, 3 B [V C niember(C, B) peach(C)] A IBS = 1 A A.A(D, D.B)).",
        "This is an abstraction over the proposition that there is some singleton set B all of whose members are peaches which satisfies some complex property involving the abstracted variable, which is again what we require.",
        "Note that the application of A in this formula is inside the scope of the quantification over members of B.",
        "It is this extra control over the relative scope of quantifiers that makes us prefer generalised' quantifiers to ordinary generalised quantifiers.",
        "does not mean that Mary eats most peaches, in the sense that there is some relationship between Mary and more than half the peaches there either are now or ever have been.",
        "It does not mean that it is frequently, or even usually, the case that she can be found eating a peach (it is true, for instance, that I eat quails eggs, but it is certainly not true that it happens very often).",
        "The gut feeling that sentences like (1) and (2) express general tendencies, and that the best machinery we have for dealing with tendencies is non-monotonic logic, is very understandable.",
        "It does not, however, seem easy to give convincing formal paraphrases of sentences like these in these terms.",
        "The problems with these suggestions arise from the fact (1) and (2) seem to express general tendencies, and that this is taken to be due the presence of the bare plurals NPs.",
        "Suppose we consider instead the occurrence of bare plural NPs in non-habitual sentences:",
        "(4) Mary is eating peaches.",
        "(5) John is driving fast cars.",
        "(4) does not express any sort of tendency, any general rule.",

        "There is an individual, Mary, who is doing something.",
        "What is she doing?",
        "She's eating.",
        "What is she eating?",
        "She is eating several things, each of which is a peach.",
        "(5) does not even seem to make much sense.",
        "Why not?",
        "Because it seems to describe a specific driving event with a single agent but with several objects, each of which is a fast car.",
        "(5) seems odd because it seems to say that John is driving several fast cars at the same time, and we know that most people can only drive one car at a time.",
        "We therefore suggest that the feeling that (1) and (2) express tendencies arises entirely from the form of the verb, and that bare plurals should be thought of as delimiting the arguments of the verb.",
        "In other words, we sugest that (4) should be thought of in much the same way as",
        "(6) Mary is house-hunting.",

        "We have argued that the semantics of bare plurals can be captured without any extension to the formal underpinning of our semantic framework.",
        "The essential points were that (i) we separated out the effects of the habitual aspect and of the bare plural; (ii) we assume that the fillers for thematic roles are always sets of items, with singular NPs denoting singleton sets.",
        "This enables us to avoid postulating a systematic polymorphism for verb semantics, with one interpretation in terms of individuals for cases where some argument is supplied by a singular NP and another in terms of sets of individuals for cases where the same argument is supplied by a plural NP; and (iii) we used an event-oriented treatment of verb semantics (see for instance Davidson [1980]).",
        "It is worth noting that Krifka [1990] and Pulman [1991] have also developed treatments of complex quantificational phenomena on the basis of this kind of treatment of verbs.",
        "The realisation that verbs can denote sets of events in the same way that NPs can denote sets of individuals, and that you can quantify over these as well over the individuals and sets of individuals denoted by NPs, seems to provide a great deal of flexibility without increasing your ontological commitments.",
        "The analyses of bare plurals and habituals discussed above have been implemented in a version of the system described in [Ramsay 1990a].",
        "This system includes a left-corner chart parser, lexical entries containing subcategorisation frames, disjunctive unification of the kind described in [Ramsay 199013], Acts DE COLING-92, NANTlis, 23-28 pan' 1992 2 3 0 Peoc.",
        "OF COLING-92, NANrrs, AUG. 23-28, 1992 etc., etc., etc.",
        "All of the example semantic analyses were derived by this system.",
        "I would in fact say that unless you have a working implementation of your grammar and semantics, including automatic /3-reduction of applications of A-abstractions, then the sheer complexity of the semantic formulae that arise will overwhelm you.",
        "Deciding, for instance, that using L(A, 3B VC member(C, B) D.0 A IBI = 1 A A.A(E,E.B)) for the matrix of a led to more satisfactory analyses of indefinite NPs than A(A, A.A(E, DB VC ineinber(C, B) D.0 A IB = 1 A (E.B))) would have been a great deal more tedious than it was if I had not had a system which would show me the consequences of the two choices in a variety of settings."
