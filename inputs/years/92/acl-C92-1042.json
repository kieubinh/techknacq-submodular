        "We then show that when one requires compositional semantics to be \"systematic\" (that is the meaning function cannot be arbitrary, but must belong to some class), one can easily distinguish between compositional and non-compositional semantics.",
        "We also present an example of a simple grammar for which there is no \"systematic\" compositional semantics.",
        "This implies that it is possible to distinguish \"good\" and \"bad\" grammars on the basis of whether they can have compositional semantics.",
        "As a result, we believe that the paper clarifies the concept of compositionality and opens a possibility of making systematic comparisons of different systems of grammars and NLU programs.",
        "1.Introduction.",
        "Compositionality is defined as the property that the meaning of a whole is a function of the meaning of its parts (cf. e.g. Keenan and Faltz (1985),pp.24-25).'",
        "This definition, although intuitively clear, does not work formally.",
        "For instance, Hirst (1987) pp.27-43 claims that the semantics of Woods (1967) and (Woods, 1969), is not compositional, because \"the interpretation of the word depart varies as different prepositional phrases are attached to it\": AA-57 departs from Boston = > depart(aa-57, boston).",
        "AA-57 departs from Boston to Chicago = > connect(aa-57, boston, chicago).",
        "AA-57 departs from Boston on Monday > dday(aa-57, boston, monday).",
        "AA-57 departs from Boston at 8:00 a.m. = > equal(dtime(aa-57, boston), 8:00am).",
        "AA-57 departs from Boston after 8:00 a.m. = > greater(dtime(aa-57,boston),8:00am).",
        "AA-57 departs from Boston before 8:00 a.m. = > greater(8:00am,dtime(aa-57,boston)).",
        "Although this semantics does look like non-compositional, it is easy to create a function that produces the meanings of all these sentences from the meanings of its parts -- we can simply define such a function by cases: the meaning of departs/from/ is connect, the meaning of departs/from/on is dday, and so on.",
        "Hirst therefore changes the definition of compositionality to \"the meaning of a whole is a systematic meaning of the parts\" (op.",
        "cit.",
        "p.27.",
        "; the emphasis is ours), but without defining the meaning of the word \"systematic.\"",
        "In this paper we show that, indeed, Hirst was right in assuming that the standard definition of compositionality has to be amended.",
        "Namely, we prove a theorem stating that any semantics can be encoded as a compositional semantics, which means that, essentially, the standard definition of compositionality is formally vacuous.",
        "We then show that when one requires compositional semantics to be \"systematic\" (i.e. the meaning function must belong to some class), one can easily distinguish between compositional and non-compositional semantics.",
        "We also give an example of a simple grammar for which there is no \"systematic\" compositional semantics\".",
        "This result implies that it is possible to distinguish \"good\" and \"bad\" grammars on the basis of whether they can have a compositional Semantics with a meaning function belonging to a certain class.",

        "That is, we want semantics to encode some basic intuitions, e.g. that nouns denote sets of entities, and verbs denote relations between entities, and so on.",
        "So what about having a compositional semantics that agrees with intuitions?",
        "That is, the questions is whether after deciding what sentences and their parts mean, we can find a function that would compose the meaning of a whole frorn the meanings of its parts.",

        "It turns out that whatever we decide that some language expressions should mean, it is always possible to produce a function that would give CS to it (see below for a more precise formulation of this fact).",
        "The upshot is that compositionality, as commonly defined, is not a strong constraint on a semantic theory.",
        "The intuitions behind this result can be illustrated quite simply: Consider the language of finite strings of digits from 0 to 7.",
        "Let's fix a random function (i.e. an intuitively bizarre function) from this language into (0,1).",

        "The theorem we prove below shows that however complex is the language, and whatever strange meanings we want to assign to its expressions, we can always do it compositionally.",

        "We can do equally well by assigning meanings to phonems or even LETTERS, assuring that, for any sentence, the intuitive meaning we associate with it would be a function of the meaning of the letters from which this sentence is composed."
