        "In Reichenbach (1947) the tenses are analyzed into different orderings of the relevant temporal parameters which are: the time of the event talked about, the speech time (time of utterance) and the reference time.",
        "Simple past, for instance, identifies event and reference-time, which are both before the speech time.",
        "In the case of past perfect the event time precedes the reference time which precedes the speech time.",
        "Kamp and Rohrer (1983,1985) were led by text-phenomena to split up the Reichenbachian reference time into two contextually given coordinates: the reference time (in the narrow sense) and the temporal perspective time.",
        "(1) Harry handed the book about giraffes to Jane (ei)â€¢ Two hours ago he had descovered it in Alfred's bookshop (e2).",
        "He had bought it (e3), had inserted a dedication (e4) and had it wrapped up (e5).",
        "Jane took the book with a smile (e6) In (1), the events e2 - e5 are ordered consecutively,",
        "each taking its predecessor as reference time, with the exception that the context does not provide an event which precedes e2 and which, therefore, could play the role of reference time with respect to e2.",
        "The whole sequence e2 - e5 is seen from a vantage point in the past, et, which, therefore, plays the role of perspective time with regard to the structural integration of e2 - e5.",
        "The perspective from which eland es are seen is the speech time.",
        "el serves as reference time for es.",
        "In the approach of Kamp and Rohrer the role that the reference time plays in Reichenbach's system is taken over by the perspective time with respect to the meaning of the tenses in single sentence discourses: The meaning (one of the meanings) of past perfect is that the event time precedes the perspective time which precedes the speech time.",
        "The meaning of simple past is that the event time precedes the speech time which coincides with the perspective time.",
        "However, in addition to a system like Re-ichenbach's there is another parameter which comes exclusively from the text, the reference time proper, which is part of the impact of the tenses on the temporal reconstruction of a narrative, thus completing the sentential meaning of the tenses by a textual aspect.",
        "Here, the idea, that we take over from Kamp and Rohrer, is that in a sequence of simple past sentences introducing events (not states) normally the event of a new sentence follows the reference time which is provided by the event of the preceding sentence within the sequence.",
        "By transposition the same should hold for sequences of past perfect sentences.",
        "Here, the perspective is shifted from the speech time to a (contextually given) point in the past.",
        "There is an additional feature however with respect to temporal parameters.",
        "Adverbials can provide a location time for events and states.",
        "For instance, in (1), the location time of e2 is the time pointed to by two hours ago.",
        "On the basis of the Reichenbachian approach using three temporal parameters the problem of integrating a new event in the event structure of the preceding text has been attacked by Hinrichs (1986), Partee(1984) and others.",
        "More independant of this approach are suggestions made by Moens and Steed-man (1988) and by Webber(1988).",
        "Since we think that a correct analysis of narratives cannot do without a fine grinned distinction between the roles played by temporal anchors, our approach uses the coordinates suggested by Kamp and Rohrer.",
        "Such coordinates are stored in a structured list, called T-list, which reflects the discourse structure of the preceding text.",
        "The problem of choosing the right anchor for the new event from the preceding text is largely neglected in the literature.",
        "Very often there, the preceding text consists of only one sentence or the problem is restricted to the intra-sentential one presented by temporal conjunctions.",
        "How do we decide in (1) that the reference time for e3 is not the earlier introduced el, but e2 and that the reference time for co is not the most recent reference time C5, but el?",
        "In our system we use the structure of the T-list among other things to get a hieraehy of the topicality of the reference times.",
        "This is very close to the idea of accessibility in Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp (1981)) and to the notion of focus in the work of Grosz and Sidney (1985).",
        "Iu order to tackle the task of event-integration, which we call \"temporal resolu-tion\" - making allusion to the very similar problem of the NP-resolution, where anaphoric links for the case of nominals have to be established - we structure the T-list along the lines of different discourse relations such as continuation, elaboration, flashback etc.",
        "Flashback, for instance, holds in the example above between eland e2 and between eland e3.",
        "The relation between e2 and e3 is continuation.",
        "As we will see in the section after next, often, from the purely linguistic point of view there are alternatives with respect to the decision about the discourse relation which directs the integration of a new event or state.",
        "In our system, the criteria to decide about the relevant discourse relation are provided by the tense forms of the reference event(s) and of the new event respectively, by the existence and the characteristics of temporal adverbials, by the aspect of the events - is it all event proper or a state - and by internal semantic properties of the events which are made explicit by means of rules stored in the background knowledge.",
        "Of course, in addition, the hierarchically structured T-list influences the choice and helps to update the system correctly, where updating means adding a new temporal condition to the representation of the text and adding a new reference time to the T-list at a specific place.",
        "In the next section we will briefly introduce the kind of discourse representation structures that we use.",
        "Then we will say something about the discourse relations dealt with and we present the syntax of the T-list.",
        "After that we sketch the relevant background knowledge, and finally, we give some of the resolution rules of the system.",
        "The structuring of the T-list extents a suggestion of Eberle and Kasper (1989) and comprises elements of a proposal by Reyle (1986).",
