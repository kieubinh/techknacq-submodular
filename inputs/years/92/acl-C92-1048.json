        "The problem of verb phrase ellipsis can be divided into two sub-problems: Problem (1): how is an antecedent selected?",
        "Problem (2): given a particular antecedent, how is it to be reconstructed at the ellipsis site?",
        "Most work on VP ellipsis has dealt with Problem (2), concerning the copying or reconstruction of a particular antecedent.",
        "A wide variety of approaches to this problem have been proposed, including surface structure accounts ([14], [18]), \"syntactic\" LF ([5]), and semantic ([25], [28], [15], [21], [4], [23], [24]).",
        "However, I will argue that there is a natural level of representation that has not been pursued, which I will call the \"properly semantic\" level.",
        "I will show that this alternative has significant empirical advantages over other approaches to Problem (2).",
        "In addition, the approach suggests some possible ways of addressing Problem (1), which concerns selecting among alternative potential antecedents.",
        "This problem has been largely ignored.",
        "There is a variety of evidence that indicates that VP ellipsis is resolved at a semantic rather than syntactic level of representation.",
        "This evidence includes the possibility of deictic VP ellipsis, inferrable antecedents, non-syntactically parallel antecedents, cases where the antecedent is formed by combining two or more salient predicates, and cases where the antecedent is separated from the target by one or more intervening sentences([27],[11]).",
        "However, existing semantic accounts have important empirical problems.",
        "For example, I argue in [11] that they do not permit pronouns to \"switch reference\" from antecedent to target in examples such as1:",
        "(1) a. I told John; that I didn't expect him; to fail his; exam.",
        "b. I told Bill, that I did.",
        "[expect him, to fail his, exam]",
        "Similarly, most existing accounts' do not permit a pronoun to be bound by different binders in antecedent and target, as in:",
        "(2) Every boy; in Bill's class hoped Mary would ask him, out, but a boy, in John's class actually knew that she would.",
        "[ask him, out]",
        "It is interesting to note that none of the existing semantic accounts qualify as \"properly semantic\" according to some fairly standard criteria.",
        "The modifications required to comply with these criteria, I will argue, are exactly the ones needed to solve these empirical problems.",
        "The criteria I have in mind are the following two general requirements for semantic representation, imposed in Montague's[20] \"Universal Grammar\": Condition (1): The logical form language must be \"dispensable\".",
        "ilo examples of VP ellipsis, the antecedent is in bold, and the target, or reconstructed material, is bracketed.",

        "23-28, 1992 Condition (2): Semantic representations must have contextual parameters.",
        "None of the existing semantic accounts satisfies both of these requirements.",
        "As Partee and Bach[21] argue, the Sag/Williams account does not satisfy Condition (1), because it imposes an \"alphabetic variance\" condition, making essential reference to the syntax of logical form expressions.",
        "This condition is also imposed in Partee and Bach's account, and a similar condition arises in a very different setting in the account of Dal-rymple, Shieber and Pereira[4].3 Only Lappin's account [17] explicitly removes the alphabetic variance condition, bringing this account in accord with Condition (1).",
        "However, semantic representations do not have contextual parameters in Lappin's account, or in any of the other accounts.",
        "Thus, although there is a persistent intuition that VP ellipsis requires a semantic treatment, no existing account is \"properly semantic\" in the sense required by conditions (1) and (2).",
        "In this paper I will describe such an account, in which the semantic representation of a VP is a three-tuple < >, consisting of a property P and input and output discourse models.",
        "A key feature of this approach is that the antecedent is reconstructed at the ellipsis site as a semantic object which includes contextual dependencies.",
        "These contextual dependencies can be resolved independently in the antecedent and the target.",
        "This is required for examples such as (1) and (2).",
        "No reference to the syntax of logical form expressions is made in this approach, satisfying Condition (1).",
        "The representation of VP's as relations involving input and output discourse contexts satisfies Condition (2).",
        "So this account is more \"properly semantic\" than alternative semantic accounts, whose theoretical status is somewhat less clear.",
        "One consequence of this theoretical clarity is the ease with which the approach can be computationally implemented.",
        "I will describe an implementation of this approach in terms of some simple extensions to the Incremental Interpretation System[22].",
        "The fact that this system incorporates contextual dependencies, as required by Condition (2), makes it very simple to implement the approach.",
        "Indeed in an important sense there are no additional mechanisms required for VP ellipsis, over and above those independently required for pronominal and other forms of anaphora.",
        "I begin with a brief overview of the Incremental Interpretation System.",
        "I then describe my extensions to 'The account of Klein [15], while couched in the DRT formalism, essentially duplicates the Sag/Williams approach, defining versions of the Derived VP rule and the Pronoun Rule in DRT terms.",
        "Sells 128] also suggests storing properties in a DAT-style discourse model, although he does not apply this to VP ellipsis.",
        "this system which implement the type of approach to VP ellipsis I am advocating, and I describe the derivation of an example that cannot be accommodated by alternative accounts.",
        "Finally, I point out that the current approach suggests some promising avenues for progress on the neglected question concerning the selection of an antecedent VP."
