        "Recognition of some discourse actions such as Give-Background also explains the purpose of an utterance and how it should be interpreted; rather than just a statement of fact, the utterance providing background information should be used by the system to fill in necessary background knowledge in order to fully understand related utterances.",

        "As the system infers these actions, the system also tentatively ascribes certain beliefs that must hold in order for the agent to be pursuing these discourse actions.",

        "So, another part of our system's world knowledge is a model of the speaker's beliefs.",
        "Since our investigation of naturally occurring dialogues indicates that people express shades of belief in propositions and expect others to recognize these beliefs, we maintain a multi-strength model of beliefs to represent an agent's varying degrees of belief in a proposition, ranging from having no idea whether a proposition is true (or false), to being certain that a proposition is true (or false).",
        "We also maintain a model of a stereotypical user whose beliefs may be attributed to the speaker as appropriate during the course of the conversation.",

        "Building a plan to perform some domain action is a precondition to doing that action (assuming agents are acting intentionally), so the system infers that SI wants Take-Course(SI, CS360), and this domain action is entered into the domain level of the DM.",

        "The inference paths which result from utterances (4) and (5) are shown in Figure 3 above the appropriate numbers.",
        "Finally, although the system initially attempts to closely relate utterance (6) to other utterances at the discourse level, there is no evidence for any e-action that might link this utterance to the existing context OD the discourse level.",
        "There are no clue words to suggest a relationship, and there are no e-actions for which there is evidence that the applicability conditions hold.",
        "Therefore, a completely new discourse action of obtaining information is inferred.\" This initiation of a new discourse action indicates implicit acceptance of the previous discourse actions since if SI did not accept S2's answer, SI would be required to indicate non-acceptance [LC921.",
        "The DM for the entire dialogue is shown in Figure 3 (for space reasons, only the action names are shown).",
        "Thus our model recognizes both acceptance and non-acceptance of communicated Although not discussed, there must also be an c-action that relates (2) to the DM.",
        "This action is the Answer-Ref; evidence for the Answer-Ref action is from world knowledge, which indicates that the applicability conditions for this Answer-Ref action hold.",
        "Inferuncing of (2) is then shnilar to that of (3).",
        "'Further discussion may determine that SI is trying to continue the negotiation dialogue; however, that has not been communicated by this utterance.",
        "We are investigating how our system might modify the DM that it has built if it discovers later that the structure built previously is incorrect.",
        "propositions, including acceptance after negotiation of conflicting beliefs.",
        "This example has illustrated: 1) how the structure of a discourse is identified in our three level model, how our model recognizes the relationship of the current utterance to the existing context and to other utterances, and how the tripartite structure produces a richer model of discourse structure than previous models; 2) how beliefs are communicated, recognized, and used in the identification of discourse actions and discourse structure; and 3) how our process model uses linguistic, world, and contextual knowledge together in order to recognize acceptance and non-acceptance of communicated propositions."

        "Our plan-based model of dialogue incorporates world, linguistic, and contextual knowledge sources into the recognition of communicative actions.",
        "Linguistic knowledge suggests certain discourse acts, a speaker's beliefs, and the strength of those beliefs; contextual knowledge suggests the most coherent continuations of the dialogue; and world knowledge provides evidence that the applicability conditions hold for those discourse acts that identify the relationship of the current utterance to the discourse as a whole.",
        "By combining these different knowledge sources, we are able to recognize complex discourse acts such as expressing doubt, to identify the relationship of utterances to one another, and to capture the rich structure of task-oriented dialogue.",
        "Grosz and Sidner [GS86] claim that a robust model of understanding must use constraint satisfaction to interpret utterances; that is, when evidence is available from one source, less evidence is needed from other sources.",
        "We have partially included their suggestion by using world and linguistic knowledge when contextual knowledge is not sufficient to infer actions for which there must be some evidence.",
        "However, we would like to expand our notion of partial evidence to allow evidence from the three knowledge sources to be represented in terms of degree: thus, when world knowledge is overwhelmingly strong, no other knowledge is needed, but when it is very weak, knowledge from other sources will be needed to support the inferences not allowed by the weak world knowledge alone."
