        "Logical translations of English sentences typically translate sentential negation as a unary propositional operator.",
        "In this paper, I develop the processing aspect of a rather different ontological perspective on negation: namely, negation as a two-place relation.",
        "The negation relation takes one argument, its associate, and relates it to the rest of the sentence which forms the second argument, its frame..",
        "The truth conditions of the relation are equivalent to those of the wide-scope unary operator.",
        "However, sentences with the same truth conditions may be logically distinct due to their distinct arguments to the relation.",
        "For example, (1) and (2) have identical truth conditions, but the distinct logical structures shown.",
        "(1) Ann didn't give THE INK to Bea ER V] [A the ink] [t- Ax(Ann gave x to Bea)] (2) Ann didn't give the ink to BEA [zi V] [A Bea] [p Ax(Ann gave the ink x)]",
        "For the purposes here, sentential negation is a negative element in auxiliary verb position, either the negative inflection n't or the free not in that position.",
        "Sentences with other negative forms are not under consideration, even though they may meet other definitions for sentential negation, e.g. those proposed by Klima (1964) and Jackendoff (1969).",
        "The associate to negation may be distinguished from both stress-focus, a constituent which is marked by relative phonetic prominence, and information-focus, a constituent which conveys new information or makes the point of the utterance.",
        "Most commonly, information-focus and associates are marked by the use of stress-focus.",
        "However, all three of these things are often called \"focus,\" suggesting an incorrect identification.",
        "The distinction is necessary because it is not the case that information-focus or associates are always marked by stress-focus.",
        "Briefly, I compare the negation relation with two related proposals, that of Horn (1989) and the Prague school (Ilajkova 1984, Sgall et al.",
        "1986).",
        "Horn argues that the Aristotelian system of predicate term logic, which analyzes negation as a mode of predication, is a more accurate formulation of linguistic negation.",
        "According to this mode analysis, sentential negation expresses that the predicate does not hold of the subject for any reason, including, e.g., reference failures.",
        "As a result, the mode analysis is identical in truth conditions to the unary propositional operator with wide scope.",
        "However, it is distinct in structure.",
        "The mode analysis of negation involves a linking of two elements, subject and predicate, to form a distinct kind of element, a sentence or proposition.",
        "This contrasts with unary negation wind' takes one element, its scope which is a proposition, and forms the same kind of element.",
        "In effect, the mode analysis claims that the scope of negation is structured as subject and predicate and that negation is a way to link these two pieces.",
        "In propositional logic, the unary operator is an external connective, in the same category with and and or.",
        "'huth functionally, it takes a single formula as an argument and inverts its truth value.",
        "In this logic, then, the affirmative is more basic than the negative because the negative takes the affirmative as an argument.",
        "The affirmative may be formulated independently of the negative but not vice versa.",
        "Also, the unary negation may apply to the entire sentence to a subformula.",
        "Under the mode analysis, negation is not derivative on affirmation.",
        "Rather, the two form a category, the possible ways of linking subject and predicate.",
        "Also, the mode negation has a fixed scope.",
        "As support for the mode analysis over the unary analysis, Horn points out that negation does riot iterate freely and that languages never have negation in the external syntactic position which would suggest the unary operator.",
        "The relation analysis I am advocating is a generalization of the mode analysis.",
        "The negation relation links two pieces to form a sentence, but these two pieces are not constrained to be the subject and predicate.",
        "Without a stress-focus, negation relates subject and predicate.",
        "If there is a stress-focus, negation relates the ACrES DE COLING-92, NAtnEs, 23-28 AOI:FT 1992 3 17 PROC.",
        "OF COLING-92, NANTES, Auo.",
        "23-28, 1992 stress-focus to the rest of the sentence.",
        "The same arguments which support the mode analysis over the unary analysis also hold for the relation analysis.",
        "The negation relation may select any constituent as its associate, a selection which also determines the frame.",
        "However, the truth conditions remain equivalent to those of a wide-scope unary operator; they do not vary with the different argument pairs.",
        "The negation relation introduces a logical structure of two arguments.",
        "All the ways of selecting the arguments from a sentence will result in equivalent truth conditions.",
        "If we continue to use the term \"scope\" to mean the argument of the unary operator, the negation relation imposes a logical structure on the scope of the unary negation.",
        "Work in the Prague school on negation Hajkova 1984, Sgall et al.",
        "1986), explores the interaction between negation and the information structure.",
        "The framework developed by these authors centers around the relationship of each utterance to the ongoing discourse.",
        "Communicative dynamism, a concept developed by Firbas, is a gradient property of a linguistic element, its ability to move the communication forward.",
        "For this aspect of interpretation, the representation of the sentence is linearized so that all the elements of the sentence are arranged in a systematic ordering according to their communicative dynamism.",
        "With respect to this ranking of the elements of the sentence, a topic-focus articulation is defined which divides the sentence into a portion which is contextually bound and non-bound.",
        "Thus, while communicative dynamism is gradient, there is a boundary in this ordering.",
        "To the left of the boundary are the contextually bound elements of the topic and to the right of the boundary are the non-bound elements of the focus.",
        "The boundary has the same significance as the distinction between ground (= Praguean topic) and information-focus (= Praguean focus) discussed in This boundary is crucial to determining the scope of negation.",
        "Stated broadly, the central Praguean claim about negation is one which I am defending: \"... it is primarily the relationship between [ground] and [information-]focus that is negated: In the unmarked case, a negative sentence states that its [information-]focus does not hold about its [ground].\" (Sgall et al.",
        "1986:83).",
        "However, this work claims that the boundary between ground and information-focus defines the scope of negation rather than an argument structure.",
        "The content in the ground falls outside the scope of negation and so will be logically entailed.",
        "Wide scope negation is, for these authors, only possible when a sentence lacks a ground.",
        "Contrary to this claim, negation can have wider scope than something in ground.",
        "In (3), every dog is clearly contextually bound, yet it is inside the scope of the negation.",
        "(3) Who walked every dog?",
        "Ricki didn't walk every dog (4) Who didn't Ricki give A BONE to?",
        "Ricki didn't give a bone to IIER Don",
        "One difference between the relation analysis and the others mentioned is that negation can have an associate which is independent of stress-focus or information-focus.",
        "For example, in (4), negation has the direct object as its associate, while the indirect object is the information-focus and a stress-focus.",
        "The negation relation in this example is embedded in another relation-associate-frame structure.",

        "A variation in stress-focus in an only sentence can lead to different truth conditions.",
        "Note the different truth conditions for (5) and (6).",
        "Since there is no discernible difference between a stress-focus in an only sentence and one in another context, this systematic effect of stress-focus on truth-conditions supports the inclusion of stress-focus as part of the formal structure of any sentence, as argued for by Klein (1991) and as will be assumed here, Stress-focus is effectively a structural feature along with the position features, the more traditional structural features relating to placement in a syntax tree.",
        "There is a formal difference between two sentences which have exactly the same sequence of words based on how they are stressed, a difference which is realized by a particular prosodic feature, that of stress.",
        "Thus, (5) and (6) are not the same sentence with different intonation, rather, they are formally different sentences.",
        "In addition to a stress-focus associate, only may occur without a stress-focus as in (7).",

        "That is, the relation-associate-frame structure is a formal object, an instance of the structured meanings discussed by Cresswell (1985) and von Stechow (1988).",
        "The interpretation of these relation-associate-frame structures is a three step process.",
        "First, a set of alternatives to the associate is determined.",
        "'These alternatives are things which are similar to the associate in contextually relevant ways.",
        "To determine the alternatives, the relevant syntactic-semantic type is inferred from the associate.",

        "For (5), the syntactic-semantic type might be art supplies.",
        "Then, the context could be restrictive so that only the ink and paint are in the set of alternatives.",
        "The second step in the interpretation is that the frame is used to select a subset of these alternatives, call it the frame set.",
        "In this case, the frame set will be the subset of the alternative supplies which Ann gave Bea.",
        "Third, the only relation must hold between the associate and the frame set in order for the sentence to be true.",
        "For (5) to be true, the frame set, those art supplies which Ann gave to Bea, will have the ink as their unique element.",
        "The two-place relations expressed by focus particles do not have their arguments rigidly typed.",
        "Rather, the associate may be of any semantic type and the frame will he a set of elements of that type.",
        "Semantically, these particles denote element-to-set relations.",
        "Defining them this way allows for an associate that is either a stress-focus or an adjacent constituent.",
        "The general definition of focus-particles as element-to-set relations raises the question of how the associate, the element argument to the relation, is determined.",
        "The answer I suggest is that the position of the focus particle determines an environment for the associate.",
        "Then, the associate will be the closest stress-focus in that environment or it will be the entire environment.",

        "The major constituents of information structure are the information-focus, the portion of content which the speaker deems will be informative or will make the point of the sentence, and the ground, the remainder of the content which is assumed to be uncontroversial and serves as a vehicle for the information-focus.",

        "(17) They wanted to surrender to THE RUSSIANS _ want to surrender to d4 (18) They didn't want to surrender to THE RUSSIANS want to surrender to d4 (19) They only wanted to surrender to THE RUSSIANS _ want to surrender to d4",
        "want to surrender to d„ British) want to surrender to (.---the Americans) (20) They even wanted to surrender to THE RUSSIANS [R leastlikely,non-unique-E][t d4) [F Ax(d2 want to surrender to x)] In addition to these logical entries, there are two kinds of implicatures based on the relation of information-focus to ground.",
        "Because implicatures do not affect truth conditions, they are special entries on the file cards.",
        "That is, the embedding function which determines whether the discourse is true in a model must ignore the special implicature entries.",
        "First, conventional implicatures are contributed by focus particles such as even or also.",
        "These particles are analyzed as modifiers or comments on the logical relation.",
        "Even, for example, contributes the two modifiers shown in (20).",
        "As a result, one regular and two special entries go on the d2 file card.",
        "Second, scalar implicatures (Hirschberg 1985) may relate the alternatives to the frame.",
        "Contextual factors determine whether scalar implicatures should be generated.",
        "For instance, if the alternatives arc ranked in a relevant way, then it is implicated that stronger values than the associate do not hold.",
        "Or, if the relation of the alternatives to the ground is salient, then it is implicated that the alternatives instantiate the ground with opposite polarity.",
        "For example, (21) has the information structure shown in (22).",
        "The alternatives to the associate will be the set in (23).",
        "The relation of the alternatives to the ground has been explicitly questioned, and so the implication that the alternatives cannot instantiate the ground will arise.",
        "(21) Q: Do you have Lana Moro or Bernat yarns?",
        "A: We have CASSINO (cited in Hirschberg 1985:58) (22) [zi e] [A Cassino] [F Ax(we have x)] (23) {Lana Moro, Bernat, Cassino}",
        "Now consider the pragmatic component of relating the information-focus to the ground.",
        "Pragmatically, the interpretation is as the informative content.",
        "As was noted earlier, the notion of informativeness expressed by the update instructions is too literal for all cases.",
        "It is the same notion which underlies the question test as a diagnostic for information-focus.",
        "Under this analysis, the earlier example has the information structure it does because it could be used to answer the question in (24).",
        "Arguably, however, it is being used to answer the question in (25).",
        "The literal view of information-focus must be extended from supplying an unknown value to making the point of the utterance, which may require inferencing ( Wilson and Sper-ber 1979).",
        "In some cases, the point will be to supply the hearer with a previously unknown value (or non-value) to the ground.",
        "In other cases, the information-focus may be literally uninformative and motivate inferences.",
        "While the general mechanism which generates the inferences that supply the point of the utterance from the relation and information-focus is ill-understood, it is related to the inferences that specify the coherence relations discussed by Hobbs (1985) and Mann and Thompson (1987).",
        "That is, making the point of the utterance overlaps with making the utterance coherent with the immediately previous discourse.",
        "(24) Who did they want to surrender to?",
        "They didn't want to surrender to THE RUSSIANS (25) Why did they swim the river to surrender to us?",
        "One fairly well-understood class of these inferences is the scalar implicatures mentioned above.",
        "Note that the exchange in (21) is entirely felicitous in a setting where the clerk stands in front of a conspicuous, clearly marked display of Cassino yarn.",
        "The alternative brand's filling the open proposition is marked as informative, although in the assumed setting it cannot possibly be literally informative.",
        "The information-focus does not directly provide the information requested.",
        "Therefore, the customer infers that this was marked as the point because it is the most the clerk could say.",
        "The customer, based on the information-focus content Acms DE COLING-92, N.orrns, 23-28 Aoirr 1992 3 2 2 PROC.",
        "OF COLING-92, Mucus, AUG. 23-28, 1992 and the fact that it was marked as information-focus, infers that the direct answer to her question is negative.",
        "In short, the relation-associate-frame structures which underlie sentences receive both a semantic and a pragmatic interpretation in the process of discourse incrementation.",
        "The truth conditions are expressed as a list of predications on file cards.",
        "The pragmatic interpretation has both a literal and an extended version.",
        "The literal interpretation is that the ground is under discussion and the information-focus' relation to it is informative.",
        "When the content of the information structure constituents cannot be construed this way in a particular context, the pragmatic interpretation is extended through inferencing.",
        "From this perspective, the information structure serves the function of differentiating the total content into increments of information for the purpose of inferencing.",
        "Given an utterance of the same basic sentence in the same context, a shift in its information-focus will affect the inferences it supports."
