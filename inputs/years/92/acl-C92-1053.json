        "When the speaker thinks coherently, his or her communication goals will be properly organised to follow linguistic convention.",
        "So, models of human language generation can allow domain goals to directly motivate conversation and add clue words only when the occasional utterance violates convention [5; 8].",
        "However, computer-generated conversation cannot rely on problem solving for its organisation.",
        "Some problem solvers make no attempt to be \"cognitively plausible\" and do not produce goals in sequences that would appear coherent to human users.",
        "The combined goals from a distributed problem solver where several independent reasoners use a single interface to communicate with the user are also likely to be incoherent.",
        "Even if individual problem solvers produce coherent streams of goals, the stream of goals from the aggregate is likely to switch back and forth between sub-problems that are being addressed by the individual systems.",
        "We call",
        "the sequence of goals produced by such systems an incoherent stream of goals because the goals are ordered in a way that would not seem reasonable to a human listener.",
        "Interfaces to such systems, while being responsive to the goals of problem solving, must rely on something else to give dialogue its organisation.",
        "In this paper, we describe a template that can provide computer-generated conversation with a coherent organisation while meeting the needs of the problem solvers.",
        "This template is built from schemata representing expected discourse structure.",
        "These schemata include general linguistic conventions as well as expected organisations for specific situations.",
        "Before conversation begins the template is very abstract, giving only broad descriptions of topics that might be expected in a specific domain.",
        "These expectations provide a framework for organising goals from the problem solvers.",
        "New goals are associated with the existing template, organising them into groups that are related by conventional discourse structure.",
        "Goals are added by finding schemata which connect them to the template.",
        "Since the schemata specify acceptable conversational structure, the template represents a coherent conversation.",

        "Goals have been grouped by the course that they relate to as well as being further organised by attributes such as ingredients of the main-dish of a course (utterances 10a.-10d).",
        "The dialogue also includes a story to connect two utterances (10a and 10b), which adds variety to the structure of the conversation.",

        "JUDIS is an implemented system which embodies our approach for merging goals into an existing conversational structure.",
        "JUDIS relies on its knowledge of conventional discourse structure as a tool for achieving the goals of the system.",
        "JUDIS' selection of discourse structures to guide the conversation and options taken within those structures are motivated by the goals of the system.",
        "This is in contrast to McKeown's TEXT system [10] which relies on heuristics based on features of the language to select options to pursue within a discourse structure.",
        "JUDIS is able to reorganise its goals to fit into the global organization of the conversation because it relies on predictions and commitments for the whole conversation, as represented in the template.",
        "Other methods of generating language from discourse structure [e.g., 10; 12] do not use expectations about the dialogue but rely only on information about the current state of the world and the structure of the discourse to this point.",
        "One of the most important advantages of our approach is that it allows an incoherent stream of goals to be organised to produce a coherent dialogue.",
        "There may be cases where an occasional utterance still must be marked with a clue word, but, by forcing the goals to be moderated by the template, we give them a deep structure that provides coherence just as the underlying processing in humans supports their dialogues' conventional structure.",
        "Our approach also has two important advantages that are side-effects of using the template to guide the generation of conversation: The dialogue addresses the needs of the prob.. lem solvers.",
        "JUDIS' dialogue is motivated by the communication goals that it is sent from the problem solvers.",
        "The requests which achieve these goals dictate the details of the template.",
        "Only requests and the mandatory scenes of the C-MOPs that connect them are included in the dialogue.",
        "This assures that the conversation will be coherent without including optional scenes of a schema that arc chosen by language-based heuristics which may have little to do with the current domain task [cf, 10].",
        "Utterances which follow convention are included in the dialogue without being motivated by an explicit goal.",
        "When mandatory scenes are needed to connect two requests in a coherent dialogue they are included when a new request is merged into the template.",
        "For example, when two requests are connected by a narrative, the setting, conclusion and enabling scenes are added to the template when the narrative is created.",
        "In speech act based approaches [e.g., 1; 5; 8], such conventional utterances would be motivated by a speaker's intention.",
        "By including these utterances as part of the discourse structure which will achieve the problem solving goals, JUDIS avoids the cost of generating discourse goals and trying to achieve them, A vpnizer Acres DE COLING-92, NAN-rps, 23-28 Aoirr 1992 3 4 3 Peoc.",
        "or COLING-92, NAN-res, Auu.",
        "23-28, 1992 and it can easily distinguish between utterances that are motivated by goals and those that are mandated by convention.",
        "The technique for organization described above was used successfully to organize the dialogue shown in the example and several others from similar goals.",
        "JUDIS was also able to interrupt the organisation prescribed by the template to handle urgent goals and was able to add requests to the dialogue that did not correspond to topics that were given by the caterer's-CMOP.",
        "The success of JUDIS depends, in part, on several characteristics of the problem solving domain and the reasoners.",
        "Most importantly, JUDIS is an interface to an advisory system.",
        "Although JUDIS was designed to allow the user to take more initiative than is often expected in natural language interfaces [15; 16], JUDIS' method of organising dialogue is most success.",
        "ful if JUDIS controls the conversation to a large extent.",
        "To allow more user involvement, more C-MOPs would be needed so that JUDIS could build a template for any organization known to the user.",
        "JUDIS would also need to handle failure of the template - to identify failure and recover when the template no longer predicts the conversation.",
        "This is an important area for future research.",
        "Another assumption in our implementation of JUDIS is that the problem solvers will use problem solving strategies and knowledge structures which correspond to those used by humans.",
        "Although the combined stream of goals from the problem solvers may not be organised in a way that would seem coherent to people, JUDIS can rely on information from the problem solvers to help it build the connections that lead to a coherent conversation.",
        "We feel that the method of organisation described here could also benefit individual problem solvers that do not produce a coherent stream of communication goals and problem solvers that do not have such well-organised knowledge.",
        "In these cases, the interface must keep a separate knowledge base or rely on declaratively represented C-MOPs.",
        "This also means that we would loose the advantages of using problem solving information as a basis for organising the dialogue.",
        "JUDIS is also helped because very few of its goals are urgent.",
        "In a system that very often needs to get additional information from the user in order to continue, it may be difficult to make full use of the template.",
        "It would be overridden often or it would delay problem solving.",
        "JUDIS has begun to address the problem of organizing dialogue so that even conversation motivated by an incoherent stream of goals can be easy to understand.",
        "Most important to our method is the ability to form partial predictions about the dialogue that can be expanded as goals arrive from the problem solver.",
        "In this way, JUDIS can group utterances together to form a coherent whole."
