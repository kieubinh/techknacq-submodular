        "The characterization of !Mrs as informationally redundant follows from an axiornatization of action in dialogue that I will call the DETERMINISTIC MODEL.",
        "This model consists of a number of simplifying assumptions such as: (1) Propositions are arc either believed or not believed, (2) Propositions representing beliefs and intentions get added to the context by the unilateral action of one conversant, (3) Agents are logically omniscient.",

        "This representation of mutual belief differs from the common representation in terms of an iterated conjunction[11] in that: (1) it relocates information from mental states to the environment in which utterances occur; (2) it allows one to represent the different kinds of evidence for mutual belief; (3) it controls reasoning when discrepancies in mutual beliefs are discovered since evidence and assumptions can be inspected; (4) it does not consist of an infinite list of statements."

        "It should be apparent from the account that the types of utterances examined here are not really redundant.",
        "The reason that many models of belief transfer in dialogue would characterize them as redundant follows from a combination of facts: (1) The representation of belief in these models has been binary; (2) The effects of utterance actions are either assumed to always hold, or to hold as defaults unless the listener already believed otherwise.",
        "This means that these accounts cannot represent the fact that a belief must be supported by some kind of evidence and that the evidence may be stronger or weaker.",
        "It also follows from (2) that these models assume that agents are not autonomous, or at least do not have control over their own mental states.",
        "But belief revision is surely an autonomous process; agents can choose whether to accept a new belief or revise old beliefs[4, 8].",
        "The occurrence of IRU's in dialogue has many ramifications for a model of dialogue.",
        "Accounting for IRU's has two direct effects on a dialogue model.",
        "First it requires a model of mutual beliefs that specifies how mutual beliefs are inferred and how some mutual beliefs can be as weak as mutual suppositions.",
        "One function of IRU's is to address the assumptions on which mutual beliefs are based.",
        "Second the assumption that propositions representing beliefs and intentions get added to the context by the unilateral action of one conversant must he dropped.",
        "This account replaces that assumption with a model in which the evidence of the hearer must be considered to establish mutual beliefs.",
        "The claim here is that both understanding and acceptance are monitored.",
        "The model outlined here can be used for different types of dialogue, including dialogues in which agents are constructing mutual beliefs to support future action by them jointly or alone.",
        "How and when agents decide to augment the strength of evidence for a belief has not been addressed in this work as yet.",
        "Future work includes analyzing the corpus with respect to whether the IRU plays a role in the final plan that is negotiated between the conversants."
