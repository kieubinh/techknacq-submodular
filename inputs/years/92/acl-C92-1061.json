        "Proof-Nets (Roorda 1990) are a good device for processing with categorial grammars, mainly because they avoid spurious ambiguities.",
        "Nevertheless, they do not provide easily readable structures and they hide the true proximity between Categorial Grammars and Dependency Grammars.",
        "We give here an other kind of Proof-Nets which is much related to Dependency Structures similar to those we meet in, for instance (Hudson 1984).",
        "These new Proof-Nets are celled Connection Nets.",
        "We show that Connection Nets provide not only easily interpretable structures, but also that processing with them is more efficient.",

        "- Categorial Grammars, and - Dependency Grammars.",
        "Numerous studies try to shed light on their similarities and differences.",
        "We may quote for instance works by Hudson (1984, 1990), Barry & Pickering(1990), Hausser (1990), Hepple (1991).",
        "One interesting particularity common to these two formalisms seems to be the capacity of leading to an incremental processing, which, in turn, leads to an on-line processing.",
        "Moreover, these formalisms are now very well known.",
        "Categorial Grammars have been much studied recently, particularly since the article of Ades and Steedman (1982) and the rediscovering of previous works done by Lambek (1958, 1961).",
        "The most comprehensive form taken by Categorial Grammars is the Lambek Calculus, studied by many authors like Moortgat (1988, 1990), Buszkowski (1986, 1988), Desclds (1990) etc.",
        "Since the recent work by J-Y Girard (see for instance Girard 1987), which led to the framework of Linear Logic, it has become apparent that the Lambek Calculus amounts to a non-commutative version of a subsystem of Linear Logic, where a structural rule forbids sequents with an empty antecedent.",
        "Semantic properties of this system have been studied by Buszkowski (1986, 1988) and Wansing (1990).",
        "Two models are often given: one consists of residuation scmigroups spread over free semigroups, and another one is given by the directional typed lambda-calculus.",
        "I 1 am indebted to Dirk Roorda for fruitful discussions during a brief visit I made in Amsterdam in Spring 1991 Dependency Grammars are originating from earlier works by the French linguist Tesniere (1965).",
        "They were theoretically studied by Gaifman, who demonstrated theorems on the Generative Capacity of Dependency Grammars.",
        "We will consider here that the formalism of \"Word Grammar\" (Hudson 1984, 1990) is representative of this trend.",
        "Our purpose in this communication is to show that building dependency structures gives an other kind of semantics for the Lambek Calculus and various subsystems.",
        "This semantics is useful in that it will allow us to conceive extensions of the Lambek Calculus.",
        "Moreover, the correspondance proposed between these two aspects provides us with a method of parsing related to the conception of \"parsing as deduction\", together with a method for avoiding spurious ambiguities.",
        "We will show that it is isomorphic to the method of proof-nets (Girard 1987, Danos and Regnicr 1989, Roorda 1990, 1991), but that it has the advantage over this last method of being more efficient and of providing more clarity on the result of processing.",
        "The devices we obtain are more readable, because they are interpretable in terms of dependency structures.",
        "Otherwise, the parsing method can be an incremental one.",
        "2.",
        "The Method of Proof-Nets in the Lambek Calculus The problem of spurious ambiguities in Categorial Grammar is very often discussed (sec for instance Hendriks and Roorda (1991)).",
        "A proof-net is a device which contains all the equivalent proofs of the same result.",
        "As Roorda (1990) says: \"A proof-net can be viewed as a parallellized sequent proof [...I It is a concrete structure, not merely an abstract equivalence class of derivations, and surely not a special derivation with certain constraints on the order in which the rules must be applied.\"",
        "The principles of construction of proof-nets are related to the inference rules of the Lambek Calculus, when it is viewed as a sequent calculus.",
        "If we here omit the product, we have the following rules, which belong to two different types: Binary rules (or type-2 rules): (where 8 is a non-empty sequence of categories, and r and A arc arbitrary sequences of categories)2",
        "In these rules, contexts (8, r, A) are \"static\".",
        "That means that they can neither be contracted, nor expanded, nor permuted.",
        "They play no role in the application of rules.",
        "So, it is convenient to \"forget\" them and to represent the rules according to schemes similar to: Such a scheme is called a link.",
        "Other types of links are provided by the identity axiom: taxi A – > A, which becomes:",
        "D. Roorda (1990) has shown the following theorem: Theorem: (Soundness and Completeness of Proof-Nets w.r.t.",
        "L.) 2 We use here the notation introduced by J. Lambek, according to which the argument category is always under the slash, in such a way that A/11 means a category which becomes an A if a B is met on the right , and B \\A a category which becomes an A if a B is met on the left.",
        "If the rules [L\\], 1L/1, [12\\], 1R/1 are represented by the following links:",
        "In this last case, we see that the suppression of the edge 2 leads to disconnection.",
        "3.Dependency Structures A dependency structure associated to a sentence is a tree on the words of this sentence.",
        "Edges represent dependency links such that the source of an edge is considered as the head and the target as a dependant.",
        "Hudson (1984) gives criteria to distinguish heads and dependants.",
        "It is an open question whether a head can be viewed as a functor, the dependant being viewed as an argument.",
        "The facts that criteria involve agreement and a figure (2): 8-4A [cut]: which becomes: that according to the Keenan's thesis: \"functors agree with their argument\" seem in favour of identification.",
        "But other scholars disagree, like Moortgat and Morrill, who introduce in their recent works, four notions: head, dependant, functor and argument.",
        "Nevertheless, we will accept the first thesis in the following, adopting the conception of Barry and Pickering (1990) on this subject.",
        "Another problem appears in the necessity of accounting for structures with multiplicity of heads (in the case of the control of infinitives for instance) because this necessity leads to graphs which are no longer trees, but dags.",
        "We assume that a dependency structure is a graph on words.",
        "In a first step, we will consider only trees.",
        "The approach will be that of a semantic interpretation in terms of trees, similar to what we do when we give a semantic interpretation of logic formulae in terms of sets.",
        "The usual operators like / and \\ will be interpreted as connection operations in an algebra of trees.",
        "In a second step, we will have to modify this interpretation in order to obtain not only application and composition but division too."

        "The initial state of a representation of the structure of a sentence consists in an ordered sequence of these initial trees.",
        "Then, at each step, we build a new tree obtained by connection of previous trees.",
        "These operations are: (cf Lecomte 1990) - left-linkage - right-linkage A tree Gi is right (resp.",
        "left) linkable to a tree G2 iff: 1)01 and G2 are adjacent, G2 being adjacent to the right (=I), left) of 01 2) GI has a rightmost (resp leftmost) branch the first edge of which is right (resp left) directed and the maximal sub-tree attached to this first edge entirely covers a continuous subtree of G2.",
        "The by-product of the right-linkage (resp left-linkage) of GI with G2, when GI is right (resp left) linkable to 02 is the tree G3 obtained as the union of Gland G2, modified in the following way: The rightmost right-directed (resp.",
        "leftmost left-directed) first-level edge of GI is connected to the root of G2, and the subtree of G2 covered by the maximal subtree attached to this edge is said to be marked in G2.",

        "right)-directed edges of 02 which are not marked remain free and take precedence in the left-to-right (resp right-to-left) order of first-level edges over those remaining free in Gt.",
        "We can introduce restrictions on these operations: we will call restriction-AB the following constraint: the subtree of G2 covered by the subtree of G1 must be identical to the whole tree G2, restriction-C: at most the rightmost (resp leftmost) branch of G2 may be uncovered.",
        "restriction-Crec: a right (resp left) subtree of G2 may be uncovered restriction-Cm ix: at most the rightmost (resp leftmost) or the leftmost (resp rightmost) branch of G2 may be uncovered Definition: we call connection tree every initial tree and every tree obtained by the application of linkage operations on earlier connection trees (according to eventual restrictions).",
        "We claim that such a system gives an interpretation of very simple categorial grammars, depending on the restrictions we select.",
        "Like similar constructions (Steedman 1991) where general principles such as Adjacency, Directional Consistency and Directional Inheritance arc explained in terms of a more detailed analysis of categories, this system is suited to express such generalities.",
        "Because of the structure of linkage operations, these principles are obvious.",
        "Adjacency and Directional Consistency are contained in the definition.",
        "Directional Inheritance comes from the fact that we never allow to change anything in the labels of edges (the fact that they are left or right directed).",
        "We only allow to change the status of an edge (free to bound or marked).",
        "In so doing, we reach, like Steedman does, the conclusion that so-called Dysharmonic Composition Rules are consistent with these principles (even if they arc not with the Lambek Calculus!).",
