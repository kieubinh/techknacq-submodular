        "Most of the developments in this area of research are based on a paper by Damerau [Damerau 64] where the author offers a classification of erroneous words.",
        "The aim of this paper is to present further results about the frequency and types of unknown words found in real-life corpora.",
        "We hope that the results of our study will be of some use in the development of NLP systems capable of dealing with realistic input.",
        "Our findings confirm Damerau's results in that the great majority of erroneous words contain a single typographical error and belong to one of the four following categories: insertion, deletion, substitution, transposition.",
        "But we have also found that a large proportion of the unknown words is made up of correct words which are not present in the dictionary.",
        "For example, derived words alone represent 30% of all unknown words in our samples.",
        "These results indicate the need for further work before an acceptable level of robustness can be attained.",
        "Although traditional typographical error detection and correction techniques can be used to handle the majority of erroneous words, much remains to be done before such problematic areas as derived words can be dealt with effectively."

        "23-28, 1992 alization that a large percentage of unknown words are part of the G1 group warrants renewed effort in treating this type of problem.",
        "There will always be words that a system cannot recognize, if only because some of them belong to so-called open classes.",
        "But we can still reduce the number of such words.",
        "One obvious solution is to enrich the dictionary, for example with common abbreviations and expressions.",
        "Another similar, but more modular solution consists in supplementing the basic dictionary with auxiliary dictionaries.",
        "One could envision separate dictionaries for regional and scholarly words for example.",
        "The ordinals found in our corpora could easily be recognized by a grammar describing the formation of roman numerals.",
        "Foreign words represent a difficult problem.",
        "They are exceptions to the usual assumption that the whole text to be processed is expressed in the same language throughout.",
        "Although it does not completely solve the problem, the detection of such signs as double quotes, setting the words apart from the text, could be used to suggest that the following unknown words might be foreign.",
        "It might be possible to recognize garbled words and compounds by using methods similar to the ones used to treat G2 words.",
        "For example the deletion of a necessary hyphen could be detected and possibly corrected as is done for the deletion of an ordinary character.",
        "As we have seen, derived words represent an impressive percentage of the total number of unknown words.",
        "Even if we were to enlarge the dictionary we would never be able to include every derived word, for they are much too productive.",
        "Therefore the solution seems to lie in a rule-based description of derivation similar to the description of inflectional morphology.",
        "This will require integrating detailed studies of affixation and of the structure and semantic compositionality of derived words.",
        "Finally, GI words are perhaps more difficult to process than G2 words.",
        "As [Hayes and Mouradian 81] put it: \"Since novel words are by definition not in the known vocabulary, how can we distinguish them from misspelling?\" Most of the time (but not always) they will not be close enough to words in the dictionary for the system to make suggestions.",
        "The best one can hope for in this situation is to deduce from the context the maximum amount of information about the word, such as its role in the sentence.",
        "As for the ability to learn new vocabulary, this is beyond the capabilities of current artificial intelligence."
