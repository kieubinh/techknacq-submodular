        "String matching is a straightforward solution to automatic mapping from texts to canonical terms.",
        "Here we use \"term\" to mean a canonical description of a concept, which is often a noun phrase.",
        "Given a text (a \"query\") and a set of canonical terms, string matching counts the common words or phrases in the text and the terms, and chooses the term containing the largest overlap as most relevant.",
        "Although it is a simple and therefore widely used technique, a poor success rate (typically 15% - 20%) is observed [1].",
        "String-matching-based methods suffer from the problems known as \"too AcrEs DE COLING-92, NArsrrEs, 23-28 Aoirr 1992 little\" and \"too many\".",
        "As an example of the former, high blood pressure and hypertension are synonyms but a straightforward string matching cannot capture the equivalence in meaning because there is no common word in these two expressions.",
        "On the other hand, there are many terms which do share some words with the query high blood pressure, such as high head at term, fetal blood loss, etc.",
        "; these terms would be found by a string matcher although they are conceptually distant from the query.",
        "Human-defined synonyms or terminology thesauri have been tried as a semantic solution for the \"too little\" problem [2] [3].",
        "It may significantly improve the mapping if the right set of synonyms or thesaurus is available.",
        "However, as Salton pointed out [4], there is \"no guarantee that a thesaurus tailored to a particular text collection can be usefully adapted to another collection.",
        "As a result, it has not been possible to obtain reliable improvements in retrieval effectiveness by using thesauruses with a variety of different document collections\".",
        "Salton has addressed the problem from a different angle, using statistics of word frequencies in a corpus to estimate word importance and reduce the \"too many\" irrelevant terms [5].",
        "The idea is that \"meaningful\" words should count more in the mapping while unimportant words should count less.",
