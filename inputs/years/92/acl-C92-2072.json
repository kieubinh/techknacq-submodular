        "The central idea is that publishers' style rules can be maintained as rules in a knowledge base, and a special inference engine that encodes strategies for examining text can be used to apply these rules.",
        "The program then operates by interactively detecting and, where possible, offering corrections for those aspects of a text which do not conform to the rules in the knowledge base.",
        "The expert-system-like architecture makes it easy to modify the system's behaviour by adding new rules or switching rule bases for specific purposes.",
        "Our previous work in this area has been oriented towards the checking of low-level details in text: for example, the format and punctuation of dates, numbers and numerical values; the punctuation and use of abbreviations; and the typefaces and abbreviations to be used for words from foreign languages.",

        "In particular, note that, since categorial information can be specified by means of constraints, we can also consider handling instances of words misspelled as words of other syntactic categories by means of the same mechanism; relaxing category feature constraints might be an appropriate candidate for a further level of relaxation.",
        "There is of course the question of how one decides what relaxations should be available at what levels; determining this requires more detailed statistical analysis of the frequencies of different kinds of errors.",
        "It is also likely to be required that individual error rules, spread across a number of grammar rules, be capable of being treated as a unit, that is, switched on or off together, orthogonal to the idea of relaxation levels.",
        "Different Kinds of Relaxation: In the foregoing, we assumed that relaxing a constraint simply meant removing it.",
        "There are other notions of constraint relaxation that could be used, of course; for example, if a constraint assigns a value to some feature, we could relax this constraint by assigning a less specific value to that feature.",
        "There may be other cases where we would want to generalise the notion of relaxation to include the possibility that a constraint could be replaced by a quite different constraint."

        "We have described a simple extension to the PATR-II formalism which allows us to provide declarative specifications of possible relaxations on rules.",
        "This provides a good starting point for a flexible mechanism for detecting and correcting syntactic errors.",
        "One reason for this is that relaxation provides a precise and systematic way of specifying the relationship between errorful and 'correct' forms, making it easier to generate suggestions for corrections.",
        "A second reason is that the very uniform representation of linguistic information will allow flexible strategies for relaxation to be applied; this is particularly important when dealing with text that may contain unpredictable errors.",
        "As we have shown, the mechanism described here can be applied straightforwarly to Constraint Violation Errors as described at the beginning of the paper.",
        "At the moment we have a rather ad hoc mechanism that deals with cases of Lexical Confusion by providing alternative lexical entries in the case of parse failure, but this needs to be integrated better with the relaxation mechanism.",
        "Cases of Stylistic Awkwardness simply require the addition of a critic that walks over the structures produced by the parser.",
        "The major focus of our current work is the replacement of the shift-reduce parser by a chart parser, to enable us to handle cases of Missing or Extra Elements."
