        "The major goal of the system described here is to provide a natural environrimtl for learning to produce sentences in French.",
        "In order to achieve this goal, we have integrated the student into the process.",
        "He should be active rather than reactive, that is, he should talk not only when being asked.",
        "After all, he knows what he wants to say, what he lacks are the means of translating his thoughts into language.",
        "SWIM2 is an exploratory environment which has been built to simulate natural learning.",
        "The student asks the questions and the system answers them.",
        "Any of the following questions could occur in a natural setting : 3",
        "1) How does one say idea ?",
        "2) Can one say linguistic foam ?",
        "3) How should one say idea ?",
        "4) Why does one say foxin-1 and not form-2 ?",
        "5) What would happen if conceptual modification ?",
        "6) What would happen if syntactic modification ?",
        "7) What would happen if word y instead of word x ?",
        "8) What is the difference between form x and form y 7 1 A computerized learning environment is said to be natural if the transfer of knowledge is achieved essentially in the same way as could be the case between two human agents, where a learner (child, student) asks questions and the teacher (native speaker, parent/teacher) answers them.",
        "2 SWIM is the acronym of See What I Mean ?",
        "It has been conceived by Michael Zock and implemented by A. Laroui on a Macintosh.",
        "3 For the time being only the first and last four types of",
        "questions are implemented for a small subset of French (simple sentences).",
        "The first communication-mode (how does one say <idea>?)",
        "raises an interesting problem : how to tell the computer what one wants to say (message).",
        "The fundamental question here is in what terms to code thought and access it.",
        "Obviously, there are several ways.",
        "One could ask in another natural language (translation), one could use images, or one could use some form of metalanguage.",
        "In this paper we discuss some of the problems that arise by using a metalanguage.",
        "We then show how a special category of thought, tense, can be communicated by using a hybrid form of representation.",
        "But, before doing so let us give a short description of the system.",
        "For more details see I 29, 30, 31 I.",
        "2 Description of the system The dialogue is initiated by specifying the communication mode.",
        "Let us suppose that the user had started with the first question: How does one say <idea> ?",
        "In that case the system presents a menu (type hierarchy) from which the user has to choose: Speech act : statement, question, command Actions - processes: taxonomy of verbs tense : present, past, future, etc.",
        "Discourse objects : taxonomy of nouns number : singular, plural communic.",
        "status : definite, indefinite, Attributes: taxonomy of attributes By choosing specific values from a set of alternatives, the user tells the system what he wants to say.4 As the dialogue develops, the system builds the underlying meaning in the form of a semantic network.",
        "It then invites the user to try to express this meaning, after which it outputs its own form.",
        "As one can see from Figure 1, the screen is divided into five parts.",
        "The large window at the top represents the underlying meaning of the message a student is trying to convey.",
        "The next two windows contain respectively the user's attempt to express this meaning and the system's version.",
        "Possible mismatches between these two versions are highlighted on the screen.",
        "This allows the system to draw the student's attention to errors.",
        "Actually, by looking at Figure 1 you can see that the student made a mistake in the verb agreement \"regarde\".",
        "Finally, the two windows at the bottom represent, from left to right, a snapshot of the system's memory of nearing and the user's memory of form .",
        "The former is a device to display, hence to recall the underlying conceptual representation of a specific sentence chosen from the memory of form window, whereas the latter is an incrementally built database (trace) of all the sentences encountered so far.",
        "The idea behind this separation is to allow the user to make a contrastive analysis of meaning and form between",
        "ActEs DE COLING-92, NAPar.s, 23-28 AGOT 1992 4 7 6 PROC.",
        "op COLINO-92, NAPass, Am 23-28, 1992 two sentences.5 Choosing a sentence in the utniof y of form window gives a representation of the sentence's meaning in the memory of /waning window.",
        "By comparing the surface form and the underlying meaning of two sentences, the user can appreciate the relationship between meaning and form.",
        "The critical feature, the one that is responsible for the difference of form, is highlighted by the system.",
        "In our example it is the value \"singular\".",
        "Past this point, the user has various options : either he continues in the basic communication mode (How does one Bay <idea> ?",
        "), or he changes the kind of question he wants to ask.",
        "Let us suppose that he wants to build a completely different sentence.",
        "In this case he could either go through the whole routine, which is quite cumbersome, or he could perform the conceptual changes directely on the graph.",
        "Obviously, this latter method is much faster.6 Actually, everything you see on the graph, except deep-case relations, is considered by the system as a variable whose value may be changed dircetely by the user.",
        "In order to do so, he clicks on any of the shown attributes (verb, tense, mode, etc.)",
        "and chooses a new value.",
        "For example, if he clicks on the verb \"regarder\" (to watch) the system answers by displaying a list of candidates from which we must choose.",
        "By clicking on the feature \"present\", the system shows different values ( present, past, future, etc.)",
        "of the variable \"tense\", etc.",
        "Everytime the system is given some piece of information it will change the meaning representation accordingly and, if asked, output the corresponding form.",
        "For example, if one started from sentence (a) asking the system to change the number of the direct object from \"singular\" to \"plural\" it would produce (h).",
        "If one asked to change the tense from \"simple past\" to \"present perfect\", it would produce (c), etc.",
        "a) Le garcon regards in fille (the boy watched the Air\") b) Le garcon regardaks filles (the boy watched the girls.)",
        "c) Le garcon a regarde les filles (the boy bas watched the girls)",
        "As one can see, this method allows for local as well as for global changes.",
        "Actually, the dialogue described corresponds to the communication mode 5.",
        "If one changes only one value each time, asking the system to tell right away how this meaning change is reflected in form, one can very quickly build and explore a large search space.",
        "It should be noted, that this kind of dialogue between man and machine is much faster and 5 See communication mode 8 : What is the difference between <form x> and <form y> ?",
        "r, that is one of the major advantages of abstract representations compared to, let us say, icons.",
        "Another advantage is that this kind of representation shows on-line how conceptual or pragmatic choices affect the intermediate structure, hence more or less directly tile final form.",
        "In consequence, by displaying on-line the way how the intermediate structure changes after each choice, we have a means of moving from a black box to a glass box.",
        "The former only shows how changes of the input Iconceptual choices) are reflected in the output, whereas the latter also shows how discourse choices (topicalisation, word choice, etc.)",
        "affect the intermediate levels.",
        "less tedious than it would be between a student and a teacher.",
        "The change of meaning and the system's generation of the corresponding form take about a second, even for art untrained user.",
        "Another communication mode the system allows for is called: What would happen if <syntactic modification>'?",
        "This mode allows the user to perform certain transformations such as passive voice or pronominalization.",
        "In the latter case, the system will ask the user to specify which clement he wants pronominalized (the boy, the girl, or both).",
        "Assume that, starting from the conceptual structure underlying sentence (a), the user wants to pronominalize respectively the agent, the object, and finally both arguments.",
        "In these cases he would get the following outputs : It regarde la Idle.",
        "(he watches the girl) I .e garcon la regarde.",
        "(the boy watches her) II la regarde.",
        "the watches her) By exploring and contrasting the different possibilities, the user is meant to learn how variations of meaning are reflected in form."
