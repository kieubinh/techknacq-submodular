        "Recently many kinds of natural language processing systems like machine translation systems have been developed and put into practical use, but ambiguity resolution in translation and meaning interpretation is still the primary issue in such systems.",
        "These systems have conventionally adopted a rule-based disambiguation method, using linguistic restrictions described logically in dictionary and grammar to select the suitable equivalent translation and meaning.",
        "Generally speaking, it is impossible to provide all the restrictions systematically in advance.",
        "Furthermore, such machine translation systems have suffered from inability to select the most suitable equivalent translation if the input expression meets two or more restrictions, and have difficulty in accepting any input expression that meets no restrictions.",
        "In order to overcome these difficulties, following methods are proposed these years:",

        "Still, each of them has inherent problems and is insufficient for ambiguity resolution.",
        "For example, either an example-based translation method or a statistics-based translation method needs a large-scale database of translation examples, and it is difficult to collect an adequate amount of a bilingual corpus.",
        "In this paper, we propose a new method to select the suitable equivalent translation using the statistical data extracted independently from source and target language texts [Muraki OIL The statistical data used here is linguistic statistics representing the dependency degree on the pairs of expressions in each text, especially statistics for co-occurrence, i.e., how frequently the expressions co-occur in the same sentence, the same paragraph or the same chapter of each text.",
        "The dependency relation in the source language is reflected in the translated text through bilingual dictionary by selecting the equivalent translation which maximizes both statistics for co-occurrence in the source and target language text.",
        "Moreover, the method also provides the means to compute the linguistic statistics on the pairs of meaning expressions.",
        "We call this method for equivalent translation and meaning selection DMAX Criteria (Double Maximize Criteria based on Dual Corpora).",
        "First, we make comments on the characteristics and the limits of the conventional methods of ambiguity resolution in translation and meaning interpretation in the second section.",
        "Next, we describe the details of DMAX Criteria for equivalent translation selection in the third section.",

        "Restrictions on any dependencies cannot be thoroughly described in advance.",
        "For example, a Japanese word \"boors\" has two meanings, one is 'a ball(a round object used in a game or sport)' and the other is 'a bowl(a deep round container open at the top especially used in cooking)'.",

        "However, since these probabilities are extracted from a large amount of text pairs that are translations of each other, this method must be suffered from the same difficulties as examplc-based translation in collecting and analyzing an adequate amount of bilingual corpora, and it's very difficult to apply this method to the languages whose linguistic structures aren't similar each other, such as English and Japanese.",
