        "For some time, researchers in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing (NLP) have eyed machine-readable dictionaries with interest because they might provide a practical resource for overcoming the \"lexical acquisition bottleneck\".",
        "Many researchers, however, view this problem of lexical acquisition as too difficult to solve at present using a machine-readable dictionary, and the result has been that the focus of much research has shifted to identifying the kind of information needed in NLP lexicons [Atkins, 1990; Miike, 1990; McNaught, 1990; Normier & Nossin, 1990; Nirenburg et al., 1990; Hanks, 1991; Pustejovsky & Bergler, 1990; Warwick, 1990; Kay, 1989], the goal being eventually to create a lexical data base that will allow the creation of a lexicon to be used for processing natural language.",
        "While we agree that it is unlikely that the information in machine-readable dictionaries is sufficient for this grand data base of facts that will support NLP as a whole, we are optimistic about making use of the information they do provide to support the creation of lexical entries for specific natural language processing systems.",
        "In this paper, we present initial results which are specifically related to extracting information automatically from entries in the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE), in order to construct lexical entries for the ULTRA multilingual machine translation system.",
        "We give an overview ofthe ULTRA Machine Translation System and its lexicon (focusing on the information requirements of its lexical entries), and then discuss the lexical entry construction process.",

        "Translation, then, can be viewed as the use of the target language to perform the same act as that which was performed using the source language.",
        "The IR serves as the basis for analyzing or for generating expressions as elements of such acts in each of the languages in the translation system.",
        "The representation has been formulated on the basis of an ongoing cross-linguistic comparative analysis of hand-generated translations with respect to the kinds of information necessary for selecting the appropriate forms of equivalent expressions in the different languages in the system.",
        "We have looked at a number of different types of communication including expository texts, business letters, and email messages and dialogues.",
        "This, coupled with the fact that the languages selected for the initial development stage are of different historical and typological background, has led to a solid foundation for developing a flexible and complete descriptive framework.",
        "The Language Components Each individual language system is independent of all other language systems within ULTRA.",
        "Corresponding sentences in different languages must produce the same IR and any specific IR must generate corresponding sentences in the five languages.",
        "However, the particular approach to parsing or generation which is used in each of the languages may differ.",
        "Each language has its own procedures for associating the expressions of the language with the appropriate IRs.",
        "These independent systems communicate by handing each other IRs, and no actual transfer takes place.",
        "Independence of the language-particular systems is of both theoretical and practical interest, Given the required equivalence of the input-output behavior of each of the language systems, this paradigm is excellent for comparing various approaches to parsing or generation for their coverage and efficacy.",
        "A new language may be added to the translation system at any time without unpredictable or negative side effects on the previously developed language systems, or on the system's overall performance.",
        "Furthermore, the addition of any new language system will have the effect of multiplying the number of language pairs in the translation system by the number of languages already in the system (having developed an English-Japanese system, we need only develop the Spanish module to have an English-Spanish system and a Japanese-Spanish system, and so forth).",
        "At present, we have developed five prototype language systems for ULTRA.",
        "Each system has been implemented in PROLOG as a bidirectional parser/generator.",
        "That is to say, in a given language system, the same algorithm is used to do either the analysis or the generation of the expressions of the language.",
        "The system is capable of handling a wide range of phenomena, including compound and complex sentences, relative clauses, complex noun phrases, questions (yes-no and Wh types) and imperatives.",
        "There will always be certain classes of non-standard input (e.g. \"Where sta-tion?\") which fall outside the system's normal capabilities and to deal with such irregular input, we are developing a number of techniques which together we call \"relaxation\".",
