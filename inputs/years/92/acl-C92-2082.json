        "Currently there is much interest in the automatic acquisition of lexical syntax and semantics, with the goal of building tip large lexicons for natural language processing.",
        "Projects that center around extracting lexical information from Machine Readable Dictionaries (MRDs) have shown much success but are inherently limited, since the set of entries within a dictionary is fixed.",
        "In order to find terms and expressions that are not defined in MRDs we must turn to other textual resources.",
        "For this purpose, we view a text corpus not only as a source of information, but also as a source of information about the language it is written in.",
        "When interpreting unrestricted, domain-independent text, it is difficult to determine in advance what kind of information will be encountered and how it will be expressed.",
        "Instead of interpreting everything in the text in great detail, we can search for specific lexical relations that are expressed in well-known ways.",
        "Surprisingly useful information can be found with only a very simple understanding of a text.",
        "Consider the following sentence:1.",
        "(SI) The bow lute, such as the Bambara ndang, is plucked and has an individual curved neck for each string.",
        "Most fluent readers of English who have never before encountered the term \"Bambara ndang\" will nevertheless from this sentence infer that a \"Bambara ndang\" is a kind of \"bow lute\".",
        "This is true even if the reader has only a fuzzy conception of what a bow lute is.",
        "Note that the author of the sentence is not deliberately defining the term, as would a dictionary or a children's book containing a didactic sentence like A Bambara ndany is a kind of bow lute.",
        "However, the semantics of the lexico-syntactic construction indicated by the pattern: (la) N Po such as {NPi, NP2 .•.",
        "(and or)} NP„ are such that they imply (lb) for all NP,, 1 < i byponym(NPi, N Po) Thus from sentence (SI) we conclude hyponym( \"Bambara ndang\", \"bow lute\").",
        "We use the term hyponym similarly to the sense used in (Miller et al.",
        "1990): a concept represented by a lexical item Lo is said to be a hyponym of the concept represented by a lexical item Lt if native speakers of English accept sentences constructed from the frame An Lo is a (kind of) L. Here Li_ is the hypernysn of Lo and the relationship is reflexive and transitive, but not symmetric.",
        "This example shows a way to discover a hyponymic lexical relationship between two or more noun phrases in a naturally-occurring text.",
        "This approach is similar in spirit to the pattern-based interpretation techniques being used in MRD processing.",
        "For example, All examples in this paper are real text, taken from Grolier', American Academic Encyclopedia(Grolier 1090) ACTES Ds COLING-92, NAN-rEs, 23-28 AOUr 1992 5 3 9 PRoc.",
        "COLING-92, NAN-rEs, AuG. 23-28, 1992 (Alshawi 1987), in interpreting LDOCE definitions, uses a hierarchy of patterns which consist mainly of part-of-speech indicators and wildcard characters.",
        "(Markowitz et al.",
        "1986), (Jensen Sr Binot 1987), and (Nakamura Nagao 1988) also use pattern recognition to extract semantic relations such as taxonomy from various dictionaries.",
        "(Ahlswede & Evens 1988) compares an approach based on parsing Webster's 7th definitions with one based on pattern recognition, and finds that for finding simple semantic relations, pattern recognition is far more accurate and efficient than parsing.",
        "The general feeling is that the structure and function of MRDs makes their interpretation amenable to pattern-recognition techniques.",
        "Thus one could say by interpreting sentence (S1) according to ( la-b) we are applying pattern-based relation recognition to general texts.",
        "Since one of the goals of building a lexical hierarchy automatically is to aid in the construction of a natural language processing program, this approach to acquisition is preferable to one that needs a complex parser and knowledge base.",
        "The tradeoff is that the the information acquired is coarse-grained.",
        "There are many ways that the structure of a language can indicate the meanings of lexical items, but the difficulty lies in finding constructions that frequently and reliably indicate the relation of interest.",
        "It might seem that because free text is so varied in form and content (as compared with the somewhat regular structure of the dictionary) that it may not be possible to find such constructions.",
        "However, we have identified a set of lexico-syntactic patterns, including the one shown in (1a) above, that indicate the hyponymy relation and that satisfy the following desiderata:",
        "(i) They occur frequently and in many text genres.",
        "(ii) They (almost) always indicate the relation of interest.",
        "(iii) They can he recognized with little or no pre-encoded knowledge.",
        "Item (i) indicates that the pattern will result in the discovery of many instances of the relation, item (ii) that the information extracted will not be erroneous, and item (iii) that making use of the pattern does not require the tools that it is intended to help build.",
        "Finding instances of the hyponymy relation is useful for several purposes: Lexicon Augmentation.",
        "Hyponymy relations can be used to augment and verify existing lexicons, including ones built from MRDs.",
        "Section 3 of this paper describes an example, comparing results extracted from a text corpus with information stored in the noun hierarchy of WordNet ((Miller et al.",
        "1990)), a hand-built lexical thesaurus.",
        "Noun Phrase Semantics.",
        "Another purpose to which these relations can be applied is the identification of the general meaning of an unfamiliar noun phrases.",
        "For example, discovering the predicate hyponym(\"broken bone\", \"injury\") indicates that the term \"broken bone\" can be understood at some level as an \"injury\" without having to determine the correct senses of the component words and how they combine.",
        "Note also that a term like \"broken bone\" is not likely to appear in a dictionary or lexicon, although it is a common locution.",
        "Semantic Relatedness Information.",
        "There has recently been work in the detection of semantically related nouns via, for example, shared argument structures (Hindle 1990), and shared dictionary definition context (Wilks et al.",
        "1990).",
        "These approaches attempt to infer relationships among lexical terms by looking at very large text samples and determining which ones are related in a statistically significant way.",
        "The technique introduced in this paper can be seen as having a similar goal but an entirely different approach, since only one sample need be found in order to determine a salient relationship (and that sample may be infrequently occurring or nonexistent).",
        "Thinking of the relations discovered as closely related semantically instead of as hyponymic is most felicitous when the noun phrases involved are modified and atypical.",
        "Consider, for example, the predicate hyponym(\"detonating explosive\", \"blasting agent\") This relation may not be a canonical ISA relation but the fact that it was found in a text implies that the terms' meanings are close.",
        "Connecting terms whose expressions are quite disparate but whose meanings are similar should be useful for improved synonym expansion in information retrieval and for finding chains of semantically related phrases, as used in the approach to recognition of topic boundaries of (Morris & Hirst 1991).",
        "We observe that terms that occur in a list are often related semantically, whether they occur in a hyponymy relation or not.",
        "In the next section we outline a way to discover these lexico-syntactic patterns as well as illustrate those we have found.",
        "Section 3 shows the results of searching texts for a restricted version of one of the patterns and compares the results against a hand-built thesaurus.",
        "Section 4 is a discussion of the merits of this work and describes future directions."

        "If this term can be positively classified as having one sense of bank over the others, then this would provide strong evidence as to which sense of the hypernym to link the hyponym to.",
        "This idea is purely speculative; we have not yet tested it.",
        "The second main problem with inserting new relations arises when one or both terms do not occur in the hierarchy at all.",
        "In this case, we have to determine which, if any, existing synset the term belongs in and then do the sense determination mentioned above."

        "We have described a low-cost approach for automatic acquisition of semantic lexical relations from unrestricted text.",
        "This method is meant to provide an incremental step toward the larger goals of natural language processing.",
        "Our approach is complementary to statistically based approaches that find semantic relations between terms, in that ours requires a single specially expressed instance of a relation while the others require a statistically significant number of generally expressed relations.",
        "We've shown that our approach is also useful as a critiquing component for existing knowledge bases and lexicons.",
        "We plan to test the pattern discovery algorithm on more relations and on languages other than English (depending on the corpora available).",
        "We would also like to do some analysis of the noun phrases that are acquired, and to explore the effects of various kinds of modifiers on the appropriateness of the noun phrase.",
        "We plan to do this in the context of analyzing environmental impact reports.",
