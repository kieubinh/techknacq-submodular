        "As the research on extracting semantic information from on-line dictionaries proceeds, most progress has been made in the area of extracting the genus terms.",
        "Two methods are being used -- pattern matching at the string level and at the structural analysis level -- both of which seem to yield equally promising results.",
        "Little theoretical work, however, is being done to determine the set of possible differentiae to be identified, and therefore also the set of possible semantic relations that can be extracted from them.",
        "In fact, Wilks remarks that as far as identifying the differentiae and organizing that information into a list of properties is concerned, \"such demands arc beyond the abilities of the best current extraction techniques\" (Wilks et al.",
        "1989, p.227).",
        "However, the current state of the art in computational linguistics demands that semantic information beyond genus terms be available now, on a large scale, to push forward the current theories, whether that is knowledge-based parsing or parsing first with a syntactic component, followed by a semantic component.",
        "In this paper, we will focus on analyzing the definitions not for the genus terms, but for the semantic relations that can be extracted from the differentiae (Calzolari 1984).",
        "Although many have accepted the use of syntactic analyses for this purpose for sonic time now (for example Jensen and Binot 1987, Klavans 1990, Ravin 1990, and Vanderwende 1990, all of which use the PLNLP English Parser to provide the structural information), many others still do not.",
        "We will demonstrate with examples why only patterns based on syntactic information (henceforth, structural patterns) provide reliable semantic relations for the differentiae.",
        "Patterns that match definition text at the string level (henceforth, string patterns) arc conceivable, but cannot capture the variations in the differentiae as easily as structural patterns.",
        "In addition, although it is possible to parse the definition texts using a grammar designed for one dictionary (e.g. a grammar of \"Longmanese,\" see Alshawi 1989), we have found that a general, broad-coverage grammar of English or of Italian provides a level of analysis that is as good as, and possibly superior to, a dictionary",
        "specific grammar'.",
        "In addition, there is no extra effort required to apply a broad-coverage text parser to the definitions of more than one dictionary, as we found for the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (henceforth, LDOCE) and Webster's 7th New Collegiate Dictionary (henceforth, W7) for English, and for Ii Nuovo Dizionario Garzanti (henceforth, Garzanti) and Italian DMI Database (henceforth, DMI) for Italian.",
        "The result of analyzing the differentiae of the definitions is presented in the form of a semantic frame; there is one semantic frame for each word sense of the entry.",
        "The contents of the frame will be any number of semantic relations (including the genus term) with, as values, the word(s) extracted from the definition text.",
        "Except for a commitment to the theoretical notion that a word has distinguishable senses, the semantic frames are intended to be theory-independent.",
        "The semantic frames presented in this paper correspond to a description of the semantic frames produced by the lexicon-producer (Wilks, op.",
        "cit., p. 217-220) and so can be the input to a knowledge-based parser.",
        "Also, these semantic frames represent the appropriate level of semantic information that is needed by a semantic component that has the task of resolving the ambiguities remaining after a syntactic component has assigned an initial analysis (see Jensen & Binot 1987, Vanderwende 1990).",
        "More generally, the result of this acquisition process is the construction of a Lexical Knowledge Base to be used as a component for any NLP system."

        "food, or sometimes animals.\" As we will show later, it is possible from the structural description of this definition to extract the following values for the semantic relation LOCATION-OF:",
        "According to this semantic frame, the verbs \"meet,\" \"buy,\" and \"sell\" arc related as LOCATION-OF to the noun \"market.\" Although the words extracted from the definitions are not disambiguated themselves according to their senses, as much information as possible is included in the semantic frame as the definition being analyzed provides.",
        "In this example, the word \"meet\" is further specified by a semantic relation HAS-SUBJECT that has \"people\" as its value.",
        "Also, since the verbs \"buy\" and \"sell\" are conjoined, both verbs have a HAS-OBJECT relation with all the syntactic objects identified in the analysis, namely \"goods\", \"food\" and \"animals.\" Semantic information of this type is necessary, for example, in order to automatically interpret noun compounds.",
        "Given the (partial) semantic frame above for \"market\" and given that \"vegetable\" has a purpose relation to \"food\" (information also automatically derived by applying structural patterns to the definition text), the noun coimmund \"vegetable market\" is interpreted automatically as: \"Market is a location for the purpose of buying and/or selling vegetables.\" (see Vanderwende 1992) Examples of other semantic relations that were required to interpret noun compounds are: SUBJECT-OF, OBJECT-OF, FOOD, MATERIAL, TIME, HUMAN, IS-FOR, LOCATION-NOUN, MADE-OF, CAUSED-BY, CAUSES, MEASURE, and MEANS.",

        "Structural Patterns",
        "The acquisition of semantic relations from on-line dictionaries proceeds by applying palterers to the structural descriptions of the definitions and example sentences.",
        "The patterns embody knowledge of which relations certain' recurring elements and constructions convey in the context of the dictionary.",
        "For instance, the relation PURPOSE is conveyed in Italian by the phrases: \"con to/alto scopo di,\" \"al fine di,\" \"per,\" \"usato per,\" \"alto a,\" \"che serve a,\" and \"Mile a\" followed by a noun phrase or an infinitival clause.",
        "In English, this same relationship is conveyed by quite similar phrases, also followed by a noun phrase, present participle, or infinitival clause: \"for (the) purpose(s) of,\" \"for,\" \"used for,\" \"Intended for,\" and past participle followed by \"to.\" Alter locating the pattern within the definition, the true extraction process consists in identifying the values to be associated with the semantic relation detected.",
        "Typically the values of the semantic relations are the treads of the pattern itself or of the complement(s) in terms of structural patterns, or the next content word(s) in terms of string patterns.",
        "However, extracting even more specific information from the differentiae, for example that the veil, \"meet\" has \"people\" as its subject when it is the LOCATION-OF \"market\", also involves the identification of functional arguments of verbs and in the case of nouns, identification of adjectives and \"with\" complements.",
        "A simple example of a structural pattern is the pattern that extracts the semantic relation PURPOSE from the parsed definition text.",
        "'The pattern can be paraphrased (in part) as: if the verb \"used\" is frost-modified by a PP with the preposition \"for,\" then extract the head(s) of that PP and return those as tire value of the PURPOSI relation.",

        "In addition, an OBJECT has also been identified in the structural description, namely NOUN2, and so its head \"goods\" (in this case, the noun itself) is the value of the HAS-OBJECT of \"store\".",

        "Since PP2 and PP4 are coordinated, the structural relation to the rest of the analysis will be tested for the conjoined constituent, PPI.",
        "The nearest noun phrase that PP1 post-modifies is NPI, the head of which, NOUN1, is indeed the genus term (also identified automatically by structural patterns applying to this analysis.)",

        "None of the heads of NP1, \"laws\", \"rules\" or \"decisions\" can be identified as the genus term, and so the pattern does not succeed in extracting a PURPOSE relation from this definition.",
        "In order to write a string pattern that would correctly identify the semantic relations above, the pattern would have to identify conjoined heads and apply some measure of distance from the genus while counting conjoined phrases as single units.",
        "In addition, string patterns would also have to skip parentheses, identify functional arguments, and abstract from the surface realizations of the pattern, e.g. pre and post-modification (similar observations are made in Klavans 1990).",
        "Even if the language of dictionary definitions is characterized by its regularity, variations of the defining formulae exist.",
        "These restrictions seem to be far too complex at the string level, while writing the pattern at the level of syntactic analysis describes the dependency in an intuitive manner, namely in terms of heads and modifiers.",
        "The inadequacy of string patterns is not only evident when extracting the semantic relations directly related with the definiendum, but also when extracting those relations that show further specifications.",
        "In particular, the HAS-SUBJECT and HAS-OBJECT relations cannot possibly be extracted reliably without structural information.",
        "Wider syntactic context is also required to correctly extract the semantic features such as COLOR, SHAPE, TASTE, and SMELL not only as features of the definiendum, but also as further specifications of the words extracted as the values of semantic relations.",
        "The structural pattern that extracts semantic features such as COLOR and TASTE would seem to be trivial: modifying adjectives or nouns that express these properties.",
        "The attachment of these modifiers, however, can be established only on the basis of syntactic information (and sometimes syntax is not enough).",
        "And only those modifiers should be extracted that relate to the definiendum or those that relate to some other word within the definition which stands in some semantic relation (for instance HAS-PART, MADE-OF, and so forth) with the definiendum.",

        "The TASTE and the COLOR features should not be extracted as semantic features of the definiendum.",

        "\"Saporito\", however, is the value of the semantic feature TASTE of \"front)\" (fruit), which is in turn the value of the HAS-PART relation of the definiendum, also extracted by means of a structural pattern from the definition text.",

        "Consider the DMI definition for \"agnolotto\" (a kind of ravioli): agnolotto: \"involucro di pasta all'uovo rotondo 0 rettangolare.\" (ravioli: round or rectangular covering of egg pastry) The attachment of the adjectival phrase \"rotondo 0 rettangolare\" is ambiguous and cannot be determined on the basis of syntactic information, but only based on semantic information; the correct analysis would read a \"round or rectangular covering\" and not \"a round or rectangular egg.\" Despite this syntactic ambiguity, the range in ambiguity for extracting semantic relations and features is quite reduced if we start from syntactic structures instead of from simple strings.",
        "5.",
        "Why a general text parser is sufficient",
        "There are two reasons why a general text parser is essential for providing the syntactic analyses.",
        "First, of the four dictionaries that have been explored in this research, Garamti and DM1 (for Italian) and LDOCE and W7 (for English), only LDOCE attempts to use a restricted vocabulary in the definition texts.",
        "Therefore, the scope of the vocabulary is the same as unrestricted text.",
        "Moreover, the language used in dictionaries cannot appropriately be called a specialized language given that it does not operate in a specialized domain.",
        "Second, at the syntactic level, the variety of constructions can be compared to that of textual corpora.",
        "The regularity of the language used within dictionary definitions, lexically and syntactically constrained, lies in the frequent occurrence of lexical and syntactic patterns to express particular conceptual categories or semantic relations.",
        "This regularity, which is crucial with respect to the extraction of semantic information, can be considered almost irrelevant from the point of view of parsing because of the variety of lexical choices and phrasal constructions used to express the patterns.",
        "A parser, therefore, is faced with the same range of problems in analyzing ordinary texts as in dictionary definitions and so the use of a general purpose grammar is a funchunental choice in the definition of our research framework.",
        "One of the main disadvantages ascribed to using general text parsers is the ambiguity still remaining at the end of the syntactic analysis.",
        "It has often been observed that descriptions associated with syntactically ambiguous constructions in free text can be disarnbiguated in the context of dictionary definitions.",
        "For example, within our system the default strategy in free text is to attach a prepositional phrase to the nearest available head and to keep track of the alternative possible attachment sites.",
        "In the context of dictionary definitions, the choice resulting from such a default strategy can often be overridden on the basis of lexical and/or syntactic conditions which disambiguate the potential ambiguity; for instance, with regard to the PP attachment case, there is a class of genus terms (such as \"atto,\" act; \"effetto,\" effect; \"processo,\" process) that, together with given structural conditions, make the attachment decision possible.",
        "Also, while functional assignment may be ambiguous in Italian in some cases (Chanod et al.",
        "1991), we can assume that constructions used within dictionary definitions and example sentences are always unmarked, and consequently that the ambiguity derived from taking into account also marked orders of sentence constituents (such as Subject-Object-Verb, Object-Verb-Subject and so forth) is very unlikely to occur in the dictionary text.",
        "Rather than taking these observations as justification for building a dictionary specific parser, we use first a broad coverage parser, followed by a post-processor which tailors the output of the parser based on the differences observed between dictionary text and general text.",
        "As it turns out, the size of the post-processor is negligible compared to the size of the grammar.",
        "This supports our claim that the variety of syntactic constructions in dictionary text is comparable to that of textual corpora.",
        "If dictionary text were substantially different from general text, we would have had to write more rules in the post-processor and it would have to be bigger than it in fact is.",
        "The structural patterns for the extraction of semantic information naturally operate on the result of the post-processor (sec Montemagni 1992).",
        "Two kinds of refinements have been devised in order to achieve more appropriate results with respect to the language used within dictionaries:",
        "(1) rule out ambiguity in the attachment of modifiers or in the assignment of functional roles which is not applicable in the context of dictionary definitions; (2) handle parses that arc incomplete due to either",
        "dictionary specific constructions not occurring in free texts, or, more generally, to gaps in the lexical or grammatical knowledge of the system.",
        "While the first refinement operates on a complete analysis but aims to reduce the high degree of ambiguity typical of free text by exploiting peculiarities of dictionary language, the second refinement concerns the robustness of the system in the absence of a complete parse.",
        "For an example of refining the parse in order to reduce the ambiguity, consider the Garzanti definition (n,1) of \"computazione\" (computation) defined as \"alto, effetto del computare\" (the act or result of computing).",
        "The first Acres DE COL1NG-92, NANres, 23-28 noiir 1992 5 5 0 PROC.",

        "This default analysis shows PP1 \"del computare\" to be attached to the closest available head, NOUN2 \"effetto\", while the alternative attachment site is marked with a question mark.",
        "The second parse below shows the resolution of the PP attachment ambiguity; PP1 now modifies the coordinated nouns NOUNI and NOUN2.",
        "This refinement is made when a prepositional phrase or an infinitival clause post-modifies coordinated head nouns that are the top nodes of the syntactic analysis.",
        "This is the typical pattern of the definitions of deverbal nouns; the PP indicates which verb the definiendum is derived from.",
        "The lexical and syntactic conditions which make the disambiguation possible arc defined in the post-processor to the general text analysis.",
        "The solution to a robust phrasal analysis while parsing dictionary text with a general grammar can be seen and faced from two different perspectives.",
        "The first perspective is dictionary specific and deals with incomplete parses due to input which would be considered ungrammatical outside of the context of dictionary definitions.",
        "The second perspective copes with incomplete knowledge of language use by exploiting the general technique of fitted parsing provided by the system for handling ill-formed input (Jensen et al.",
        "1983).",
        "Dictionary definitions are quite often formulated as condensed fragments of real texts, with elided elements which make the definition syntactically ill-formed and interpretable only by reference to a wider context.",
        "This is the case with noun definitions consisting of a noun phrase pre-modified by a prepositional phrase, where the latter specifies the usage domain of the word sense expressed by the former.",
        "The general grammar is unable to produce an NP node covering the whole input string given that the sequence PP-NP does not freely occur within ordinary texts.",
        "It is the refinement stage that should reshape the analysis and restore it as regular input on the basis of specialized dictionai y use.",
        "The analysis below of the Garz.anti definition (n,1,2) \"nettare\" (nectar), defined as \"nella mitologia classics, la bevanda degli der (in classical mythology, the drink of gods) exemplifies this kind of refinement.",

        "The second one has been rebuilt during the refinement stage: the XXXX1 has beau replaced by the proper label NP1.",
        "In this case, knowledge of dictionary peculiarities resolves the initial partial parse and converts it into a complete and successful analysis.",
        "Not all incomplete parses can be so easily restructured.",
        "Some are due to gaps in the system with respect to lexical as well as phrase construction knowledge.",
        "Those cases are handled by facilities in the fitting procedure, provided by the system to cope with unrestricted input.",
        "When the grammar is unable to prorluce a complete analysis, then a reasonable approximate but incomplete structure is assigned to the input.",
        "Such a rough parse can stilt be used as input for further processi,:, stages and for the extraction procedure itself.",
        "fly allowing structural patterns to apply to incomplete parses as well, the automatic extraction of semantic information is not threatened.",
        "There is, however, a difference in the extraction procedure applied to complete (i.e. computed by the general grammar or restored during the post-processing stage) and incomplete analyses.",
        "While structural patterns are used to extract semantic information from definitions and example sentences successfully parsed, partial structural patterns and string patterns are combined when handling incomplete parses.",
        "By differentiating the",
        "extraction procedure for the two kinds of results, the procedure becomes robust and overcomes the variability of parsing performances.",
        "Finally, a brief account of the parsing performance of the Italian grammar for a corpus of 1000 definitions.",
        "The general Italian grammar provided complete parses for about 65-70% of these definitions.",
        "An improvement comprising 10-15% of the total was achieved during the refinement stage.",
        "For the unresolved incomplete parses, approximately 15-20%, a different extraction procedure, based on a combination of partial structural patterns and string patterns as described above, has been hypothesized.",
        "Even if this procedure is at an early development stage, it is possible to evaluate the first results.",
        "Because of the robust strategy, the extraction procedure can be applied to the entire corpus of definitions, without the worry that incomplete parses would affect the extraction of semantic information.",
        "Some information is extracted in any case; in the worst case the information is not very deep or detailed (at least the genus term is extracted).",
