        "The present paper describes a part of a larger project, which should result in the extraction of lexical and structural correspondences between grammatical units in large parallel English and Czech texts.",
        "The correspondences will then be used to build a transfer module for an English-to-Czech (and possibly Czech-to-English) machine translation system.",
        "Final as well as partial results should also be useful as source data for text-oriented linguistic research, both bi and monolinguals.",
        "This task entails the need for tools to analyse unrestricted Czech and English texts.",
        "In the first stage of the project the goal is to produce Czech and English lexicons of adequate coverage and implemented analysis grammars, which will later be augmented with tools for preliminary disambiguation.",
        "The parser will build annotated dependency structures, usable for tagging word forms, clauses and sentences with morphological and syntactic information.",
        "The lexicon and grammars, enriched by feedback from the parsed texts, can later be used within the machine translation system proper.",
        "At present, the primary source of lexical data for the English analysis is a machine readable dictionary, preprocessed to contain only relevant information in a transparent format.",
        "This paper focusses on how valency frames for verbal entries are extracted from subcategorization codes in the machine readable dictionary."

        "Even though the correspondences between parallel text units can be established at an arbitrary level.",
        "starting from word forms up to an elaborate logical representation, the practical solution seems to lie somewhere in between.",
        "The approach we have chosen is based on the representation of linguistic analysis in terms of underlying (tectogram-matical) structures, which are determined by the given language, but void of various irregularities of the surface strings, including the ambiguity of morphemic and surface syntactic units.2 A \"deeper\" analysis would increase the risk of errors and introduce more theoretical bias while a very shallow level would require larger amounts of data to arrive at simple facts when parallel text units are compared.",
        "The (underlying) syntactic description is dependency-based (with coordination and apposition as relations of a different type) and the project described here makes it possible (i) to test the basic assumptions of the theory on a large data collection, and (ii) to formulate an implementable relation between the surface string and the underlying representation.",
        "A constrained-based (unification) formalism was selected due to its de-clarativeness, conciseness and formal rigour, but its other interesting properties were also appreciated: i.a., the important role of the lexicon and the need to treat surface facts within the same rigorous framework as deeper concepts.3"

        "CUMALDwas not primarily intended for use with a syntactic parser, so a few modifications were necessary.",
        "First, the pronunciation field was deleted and homograph entries with different pronunciations merged.",
        "(In CUVOALD, each word, or word form, has only one entry, unless it has two different pronunciations.)",
        "Second, entries headed by regular forms within irregular paradigms as headwords were also deleted.",
        "And finally, reference to hase forms was provided in entries of all the remaining nonhase (irregular) forms.",
        "Base forms of irregular paradigms were marked by a code specifying the paradigm type.",
        "After that, we tried to find a way how to derive the complementation paradigms.",
        "Ideally, templates of the sort described in Section 4 should correspond to OALD verb patterns while lexical rules would account for structures listed in Hornby (1975) as variants of the same verb pattern.",
        "Although this idea works in the case of the most frequent patterns ([VP2A], [VP6A]), there are many patterns where the relation between pattern and paradigm can be 1:n, n:1, or even n:n (n > 1) (see Section 3).",
        "The case of n patterns : 1 paradigm reduces the number of paradigms and as such is a welcome situation.",
        "The case of 1:n can mean (i) ambiguity for all verbs listed under the pattern (and can possibly be accounted for by lexical rules), (ii) the possibility to subdivide the verbs of this class into n subclasses, or (iii) a combination of the two.",
        "For (i), the derivation of complementation paradigm from a verb pattern will yield a disjunction.",
        "For (ii), verbs with different complementation paradigms should be distinArms guished.",
        "Boguraev and Briscoe (1989) used valency codes in LDOCE (Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English) to automatically extract the (explicitly unmarked) distinction between Equi and Raising verbs.",
        "Similar approach can be used to make this and other distinctions in OALD by taking into account co-occurences of verb patterns.",
        "Our situation is simpler in that we, as yet, make no attempt to treat distinct word senses, and more difficult in that the blurred sense distinctions can have negative effect on any derivation procedure.",
        "It remains to be seen whether such a method will lead to results of sufficient reliability.",
        "However, at the same time we have to supply more information to some classes of verbs, for which any possibility of automatic treatment is exluded.",
        "The current efforts include the specification of lexical values of particles and prepositions for compound verbs and assigning verbs marked by verb pattern codes such as VP14 to relevant subclasses.",

        "Where possible, frequently co-occurring verb patterns are collapsed into a single paradigm with local disjuction, e.g. [VP6D] and [VP7A] for like (swimming / to swim) give the following template: f transitive, ( Zing ; 2inf ), equi I, which expands into:",

        "Let us look how the first approach works.",

        "Verbs with patterns which do not correspond to a single complementation paradigm while co-occurring verb patterns de not indicate a preference for one paradigm or the other have to be treated manually.",

        "The lexical value of the preposition should be supplied.",
        "This looks like a principled solution, but step 1 can be a source of unforeseen complexities with the result that too many entries will have to be handled manually.",
        "The second strategy is much safer: if there are not too many different combinations of verb patterns it might not be too difficult to state rewriting rules for all of them, thus eliminating steps 2 and 3 from the above procedure.",
        "However, to make a decision, some statistical analysis is necessary.",
        "cuwa4Lo lists 5695 verbs with 633 different combinations of verb patterns.5 4853 verbs (85.2%) are marked by one of the 56 most frequent combinations (each occurring seven and more times).",
        "The first ten most frequent combinations are given below: verb patterns frequency",
        "At the other end, there are 442 combinations occurring only once, 191 two and more times, 119 three and more times and 77 five and more times.",
        "Another survey was aimed at finding most frequent combinations as proper subsets of the full combinations treated above.",
        "E.g. the combination of three patterns 2A,3A,6A occurs alone in 54 entries, but as a proper subset of a larger combination already in 566 entries.",
        "From the above data it seems that a compromise between the treatment, of individual verb patterns and of entire combinations would be most efficient.",
        "119 combinations can already be treated by individual rules quite comfortably while the rest can be composed from results of rules applied independently, where more alert supervision is required.",
        "It also seems feasible to use the rules for combinations to treat parts of the remaining lists of verb patterns, and perhaps add a few more, selected according to the second statistics."
