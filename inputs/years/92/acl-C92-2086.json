        "Common verbs such as \"take,\" \"have,\" \"make,\" and \"give\" appear frequently in English.",
        "These verbs quite often constitute verb deverbal noun structures such as \"make an ad-dress,\" \"give an answer\" and \"take an approach.\"",
        "The verbs in the structure are almost devoid of lexical meaning but bear syntactic information such as tense, number and person; the deverbal noun carrying the lexical meaning.",
        "The verbs, in this case, are called \"delexical verbs\" [Collins] or \"light verbs,\" [Live] which refers to their lexical emptiness.",
        "In this paper, we call such verbs Delexical Verbs (DV) and a \"DV + deverbal noun struc-ture\" a Delexical Structure (DS) following the examples of [Collins].",
        "The frequency of these verbs in actual text can be seen, for example, in the COLLINS COBUILD ENGLISH DICTIONARY, where the paragraph on the entry \"take\" states: \"The most frequent use of take is in expressions where it does not have a very distinct meaning of its own, hut where most of the meaning is in the noun that follows it...\" We have been developing an English to Japanese machine translation system for news broadcasts since 1989 [Aizawa][Tanaka].",
        "The precise translation of DS's in news texts is of great importance since they are quite frequent here.",
        "We counted the number of \"take\" + \"noun\" collocations (as verb + object) in 21 months' worth of AP texts using the parser of the machine translation system.",
        "\"Take\" collocated with 2,188 different nouns a total of 20,271 times.",
        "Of the collocating nouns, 87 deverbal nouns were found out of the 119 deverbal nouns listed in [Live], comprising about 28% (5,726) of all occurrences.",
        "This figure strongly supports the statement in the Collins Dictionary.",
        "Failures in DS translation typically result from producing the primary sense instead of the delexical sense of the DV, which greatly deteriorates the quality of the translation.",
        "For example, \"make an address\" becomes \"enzetsu wo tsukuru,\" which means \"create an address.\"",
        "There arc two possible ways of translating a DS.",
        "The first is the idiosyncratic approach, listing all the DS's with their Japanese translations in a lexical system.",
        "This approach, however, suffers from several shortcomings:",
        "(1) The DS's are numerous and hard to list exhaustively: some DS's allow passivization and some deverbal nouns can be modified by quantifiers, adjectives and so on.",
        "This doubles and triples the number of possible DS combinations.",
        "(2) This direct method is unable to infer the translation of a DS undefined in a lexicon.",
        "(3) The use of this approach increases the number of lexical entries, making lexical management difficult.",
        "Another approach is to synthesize the translation of a DS using the word sense of each component with syntactic and semantic rules.",
        "The attractive part of this \"synthetic approach\" is that it does not suffer from the problems mentioned above.",
        "The \"monosenly approach\" proposed in [Ruhl] can be viewed as the extreme manifestation of the synthetic approach.",
        "A recent lexical framework [Bograev] proposes to generate the word sense instead of listing them exhaustively in a lexicon, which is similar to the synthetic approach.",
        "However, from a practical viewpoint, not all DS's can be translated by this approach as the necessary rules have not yet been factored out.",
        "We propose the use of a DS translation method based mainly on synthesis, and the employment of an idiosyncratic approach where synthesis is difficult.",
        "To do this, DS's were categorized into three groups, called type-1, type-2, and idiomatic DS.",
        "The first two groups are translated by the synthetic method and the last group is translated by an idiosyncratic approach which can hopefully be integrated into the former part as research reveals the underlying rules.",
        "This method should provide clear distinctions between idiomatic and synthesizable DS's through the use of a set of rules, which would facilitate the management of lexical systems.",
        "The translation rules arc quite simple for the following reasons:",
        "(1) English DS's have Japanese equivalents in many cases, and some parallels can be seen between them.",
        "(2) Many Japanese \"verbal nouns\" take the form of \"sahen-meishi,\" which become verbs by simply adding \"suru\" to the tail.",
        "However, some DS's require translation in a",
        "passive sense.",
        "The conditions were factored out through semantic consideration, and were integrated into the translation rules.",
        "The rules were implemented in the machine translation system and AP news texts were translated appropriately, thus proving the feasibility of this method."
