        "Example E: I hung my coat on the hook.",

        "In this paper, we propose a method for resolving the syntactic ambiguities of translation examples in bilingual corpora and a method for acquiring lexical knowledge, such as case frames of verbs and attribute sets of nouns.",
        "In our framework, first a pair of sentences of both languages are syntactically ana-lyzedland translated into feature descriptions, which represent dependency structures of the phrases in the sentences.",

        "In this bilingual corpus, about 70 distinct Japanese verbs appear in more than 100 examples.",
        "We have obtained unified feature descriptions for several verbs which appeared more than 200 times.",
        "From them we have gotten some case frames.",
        "In this experiment we used the set of semantic markers defined in IPAL [4], listed in Table 1.",
        "Table 2 shows the case slots of 4 < (write)\" extracted from 207 translation examples.",
        "In the process of extraction, bilingual feature label pairs are quite useful to find different case slots that are marked by the same postpositional particle in Japanese.",
        "In order to acquire case frames of the verb \"'It < (write)\" from",
        "the extracted case slots, tre system asks the human instructor about the possibilities of the co-occurrence of the case slots that do not co-occur in the translation examples by composing sample phrases.",
        "The questions and answers are as follows.",
        "The pastpositional particle \"VI\" is used to mark two different cases of the verb \"-a < (write)\" in Japanese sentences.",
        "One of them represents things on which something is written like in \"write something on a sheet of paper\", and the other represents someone to whom a correspondence is written, like in \"write a letter to a lover\".",
        "The difference of these two usages is clear by the bilingual feature label pairs (on, C ) and (to, The human instructor answers that only these two case slots cannot co-occur.",
        "Then two case frames are obtained as in Table 3.",
        "This simple experiment suggests that it is quite possible to acquire case frames of verbs from bilingual corpora if enough translation examples are available.",
        "Actually, on the assumption that 200 translation examples are necessary for acquiring case frames of one verb, 100,000 translation examples are necessary for 70 verbs.",
        "If a bilingual corpus of 1,000,000 translation examples is obtained, it is possible to con-wile a semantic dictionary with the same scale as IPAL through a little interaction with a human instructor for each verb.",
        "We think it possible to construct a bilingual corpus of that scale or more in the near future."

        "We have proposed a method for resolving the syntactic ambiguities of translation examples of bilingual corpora and a method for acquiring case frames of verbs.",

        "We believe that the proposed method is applicable to several other problems as well.",
        "One of them is to acquire features of nominal concepts.",

        "They will help to acquire typical attributes of nominal concepts from bilingual corpora.",
