        "Much of this research involves the creation of lexical databases from original dictionary data, in order to facilitate retrieval and analysis.",

        "As lexical databases have proliferated in multiple formats, there has been growing concern over the reusability of lexical resources.",
        "The interchange and integration of data, as well as the development of common software, is increasingly important to avoid duplication of effort and enable the development of large-scale databases of linguistic information (which is the concern of projects such as ACQUILEX, GENELEX, EDR, etc.).",
        "In this paper, we provide a data model that is suited to lexical databases.",
        "A strong requirement for such a data model is that it must make lexical information compatible despite its variability in structure across the dictionaries from which it is derived.",
        "We show that a model based on feature structures overcomes most of the problems inherent in classical database models, and, in particular, enables accessing, manipulating or merging information structured in multiple ways.",
        "The feature-based model also allows retaining the particular organization of a given dictionary while at the same time making it invisible to certain retrieval operations.",
