        "I.",
        "Introduction The use of controlled or simplified languages for text writing is a controversial matter, mainly because it is felt as an attack of the writer's freedom of expression.",
        "Still, we see more and more attempts to introduce control and simplification in the text writing process, mostly integrated within intelligent text processing environments and complex NLP appications such as machine translation (see 2. for an short overview).",
        "There are at least two types of motivation that have led us and other researchers to pursuing this matter with renewed interest.",
        "First, experience with large-scale NLP applications that should be capable of handling a wide range of inputs (in our case, the METAL MT system, used for the translation of technical and administrative texts) has shown that there are limits to tine-tuning big grammars to handle semi-grammatical or otherwise badly written sentences.",
        "The degree of complexity added to an already complex NLP grammar tends to lead to a deterioration of overall translation quality and (where relevant) speed.",
        "On the other hand, simple pre-editing tools that e.g. help split up overly long sentences into shorter units (a very mild way of simplifying the input) have proved to lead to amazing improvements in output quality for the application of METAL in administrative text translation (Deprez 1991).",
        "In general, the avoidance of lexical, syntactic and stylistic ambiguities is believed to make machine translation or other NLP applications easier.",
        "Second, there is a growing need in international industrial environments for standardization and simplification of written communication; the experience is that the language used in industrial documents such as manuals needs a thorough revision to be used efficiently by both native and (especially) non-native writers and readers.",
        "To ensure that the language of technical documents is unambiguous, well-structured, economical and easily translatable, controlled language has been thought to be the solution, be it that this solution is â–  The research reported in this paper has been funded by Alcatel Bell in the period 1989-1991. often proprietary to a company and hence difficult to access by the NLP research community.",
        "In this paper, we report on ongoing research and development of a Controlled English grammar for technical documentation (course material and systems documentation) in the area of telecommunication.",
        "We started by examining three representative controlled grammars (AECMA, Ericsson, IBM).",
        "finding them incomplete and defective in many ways, we developed our own controlled grammar, COGRAM.",
        "Since such a paper grammar is not the most motivating of texts for technical writers to use in the writing process, we decided to restructure it in an algorithmic way (ALC(X3RAM) with an eye to using it in a computer-aided language learning tool and a more ambitious grammar and style checking program.",
        "The first application is finished and currently being tested at the Alcatel-Bell company.",
        "We are now designing the checker for operation within the.",

        "But let us start by giving a short overview of the histm y and current application of controlled English in the NLP research arid the industrial communities.",

        "The roots of Controlled English 'the foundation for most of the current CE manuals was laid by the Caterpillar Tractor Company (Peoria, Illinois, USA) in the mitt-1960s.",
        "This company (currently still active in the CE field) introduced Caterpillar Fundamental English (CPU), on which two significant derivatives, i.e. Smart's Plain English Program (PEP) and White's International Language for Serving and Maintenance (11 SAM) were based.",

        "Nowadays, a considerable number of variants of Controlled English can be found in many corporations.",
        "In the USA, Boeing successfully uses an elaborate Simplified English Checker (SEC) to control aircraft maintenance reports (Wojcik et al., 1990).",
        "The Xerox Corporation uses Systran and ALPS in conjunction with a Controlled English input (Kingscott, 1990).",
        "In the UK, Perkins Engines introduced Perkins Approved Clear English (PACE) to simplify their publications and to aid translation, whether carried out by conventional or computer-aided methods Wpm 1988).",

        "Policespeak is currently being developed to enable fast and accurate communication with the French counterparts when the Channel Tunnel opens in 1993 (Jackson, 1990).",
        "In the Netherlands, the BSO/DLT machine-based translation project also benefits from the linguistic confines and standardization of terminology (Van der Korst, 1986).",
        "In the French TITUS system, controlled language (\"Langage Docurnentaire Canonique\") is used to improve machine translation of abstracts of technical papers on textile fabrics (Ducrot 1984).",
        "Since the above-mentioned grammars have been adapted to the individual needs of each company, they might - to some extent - differ from one another.",
        "Unfortunately, we were not able to get bold of any grammar of the PEP branch.",
