        "Depending on how much work is done by the analysis and generation components, the tasks carried out by the transfer element may vary, but in general this module is very idiosyncratic and will involve several hundred transfer rules.",
        "Writing these transfer rules is the most time-consuming aspect of the design of a transfer-based system, as it must be consistent with both monolingual grammars.",
        "The process is therefore error-prone, and the result is not very portable, since the consequences of making changes to the monolingual components may be far-reaching as far as the transfer rules are concerned.",
        "One of the main difficulties with interlingual approaches is what Landsbergen [Landsbergen 87] refers to as the subset problem.",
        "If the system is to be robust, it is essential to guarantee that any interlingual formula derived from any Source Language (SL) expression is amenable to generation into the Target Language (TL).",
        "If the interlingua is powerful enough to represent all the meanings in all the languages involved, there will be several (probably infinitely many) formulae in that interlingua which are logically equivalent to the one produced by the analyser.",

        "The notion of unification is then used to combine these.",
        "The main features used in the signs are ORTHOGRAPHY, CAT (the categorial grammar syntax), ORDER (the directionality of the \"slash\", which specifies linear ordering), FEATS (a set of syntactic features), CASES (a case-assignment mechanism built on top of standard UCG), and SEM, a unification-based semantics with a neo-Davidsonian treatment of roles ([Parsons 80, Dowty 89]).",
        "The semantics of an expression is of the form I:P, where I is a variable for the semantic index of the whole expression, and P is a conjunction of propositions in which that index appears.",
        "In addition, features called ARGO, ARG1 and so on provide useful \"handles\" for allowing the bilingual lexicon to access the semantic indices, but they are not strictly necessary for the grammars The signs presented are only shorthand abbreviations of the full ones used, and the interested reader is referred to [Beaven 92] for a more complete view.",
        "The PATR-II notation will be used, with the Prolog convention that names starting with upper case stand for variables.",
        "In addition, for the sake of clarity and brevity, the non-essential features will be omitted, as will be their names when these are are obvious.",
        "The grammar rules used subsume both functional application and composition, but for the examples given here, only functional application will be necessary.",
        "An important feature of this approach is that this will make it possible to have an MT system in which no meaningful elements in the translation relation are introduced syncategorematically (in the form of transfer rules or operations with interlingual representations).",
        "In particular, assuming we have very rich lexical entries (which contain information about various dimensions of the language, such as orthography, syntax and semantics), all that is needed is a correspondence between the lexical entries, supplied by a bilingual lexicon, together with a set of constraints for each correspondence.",
        "The design of such a translation system will therefore involve three components: two monolingual lexicons for the languages concerned, and a bilingual lexicon.",
        "The Spanish and English components were designed using purely monolingual considerations, and as a consequences the treatments of English and Spanish grammars are quite different.",
        "The basics of the grammar will be explained by presenting the monolingual lexical entries required for the Spanish sentence Maria visite; Madrid, which corresponds to the English Mary visited Madrid.",
