        "Several works [McKeown 86, Suthers 88] have emphasized the common aspects of Explanation Production in expert systems and Text Generation.",
        "The work described in this paper deals with text generation applied to a particular type of explanations: causal explanations of physical systems.",
        "They have already motivated influential developments in the field of qualitative reasoning about physical systems.",
        "A central goal of the theories developed in [Dc Kleer 84] and [Forbus 84] was to elaborate conceptual frameworks for providing causal accounts of physical systems, sensitive to our commonsense understanding of the physical world.",
        "Those qualitative causal models constitute an adequate starting point as we are interested in how people present such causal explanations in verbal form.",
        "We will describe our approach for text generation, based on the study of texts collected in encyclopedia and textbooks, and currently developed in a system intended to be associated to the qualitative simulation system SQUALE [kzequel & Zimmer 92].",
        "Our conceptual model, which constitutes the input to the text generation process, is based on Qualitative Process Theory [Forbus 84].",
        "According to the \"traditional\" division of tasks in text generation, the transition from conceptual representation of causal behaviour to causal explanation in natural language is viewed as a three–stage process: content specification, text organization and surface generation.",
        "The content specification task aims at posting communicative goals described by means of communicative acts on conceptual entities.",
        "In particular, the causal explanation to be produced is often restricted to some particular events of the causal behaviour.",
        "We will show how relevant information and appropriate communicative acts are identified.",
        "Text organization is the most elaborate part of our model and is also divided into three tasks.",
        "The first is concerned with the construction of a textual structure from a set of communicative acts established during content specification.",
        "This structure, which takes an intermediary place between communicative acts and surface realizations, specifies essentially prescriptions on grouping and ordering of textual units.",
        "This process is achieved through the application of discourse strategies which control local transitions from communicative acts to possible organizational prescriptions.",
        "We describe three strategics used for structuring causal explanations: a causal chain strategy (for organizing simple causal chains), a parallel strategy (to impose a parallel structure on the text), and a concessive strategy (for performing concessive acts).",
        "The second task segments the textual structure into sentential contents.",
        "Several factors are involved, mainly communicative form of textual relations and number of textual units expressed in a sentence.",
        "The stylistic adjustment task deals with stylistic considerations related to lex ico–syntactic choices.",
        "We want to ensure an inter–sentential compatibility, from a stylistic point of view, between linguistic realizations.",
        "Concerning surface generation, two types of systems have been considered: a sentence generator [Fournier 91] based on the Meaning–Text Theory I Mel' c uk 88a] and a syntactic component based on equivalence classes between sentence structures.",
        "Our approach suggests a clear separation of knowledge sources involved in each of these stages.",
        "We will start with a presentation of the conceptual model, where we propose a characterization of causal interactions between physical events (essentially, physical parameter changes).",
        "The next sections deal with the different stages of the text generation process."

        "Gradual parameters are associated to identified entities (individual views and processes) and causal dependencies are expressed by means of two types of qualitative relations: influences, for direct effects of processes, and qualitative proportionalities, which propagate direct effects of processes on the other parameters.",
        "It follows that the initial cause of a parameter change is always a process.",
        "Qualitative relations can aim at opposite effects.",
        "In the physical situation of figure 1, the mercury expansion tends to increase the mercury level while the tube expansion tends to lower it.",
        "The first influence is predominant, since an increase of the mercury level is observed in that situation, and thus the second is inhibited' .1n order to represent different types of causal interactions, we have introduced the causal primitives cause, contrary–cause and opposite– effects which are defined according to influences between events:",
        "• cause: causal relation between two events linked with a predominant influence (for example, mercury expansion is the cause of mercury level rise) • contrary–cause: contrastive relation between two events linked with an inhibited influence.",
        "One of the events is the \"contrary cause\" of the other (tube expansion is a contrary cause of mercury level rise).",
        "• opposite–effects: contrastive relation between two events which aim at opposite effects (mercury expansion and tube expansion).",
        "The last two primitives are called causal opposition relations.",
        "In that framework, physical system behaviours arc represented with influence graphs, where physical events are linked with causal primitives.",

      "text": [
        "The content specification is primarily concerned with selection of relevant physical events and causal interactions from the influence graph.",
        "But the problem should not be narrowed to factual knowledge selection, for the conceptual content of the text cannot be considered independently of the speaker's communicative intentions.",
        "Communicative roles assigned to conceptual entities have crucial implications at each stage of the text generation process.",
        "Hence, they should be made explicit at the content specification level as well as their related conceptual units.",

        "Note that in both cases the same conceptual content is involved.",
        "Some differences between sentences (1) and (2) as the order of information units are due to distinct communicative role assignments.",

        "But now let us turn to the content specification procedures.",
        "The determination of communicative acts highly depends on the problem solving activity (here, qualitative simulation)",
        "and thus is governed by both general rhetorical principles and domain dependent considerations.",
        "It proceeds as an incremental process and each step determines more precisely the relevant information.",
        "First the notion of theme– object, similar to global focus [Grosz 86] (and adapted to generation by Mc Keown), is used to carry out a rough selection of relevant causal interactions: events which are not in (direct or indirect) causal interaction with any theme– object are ignored.",
        "The theme–object identification depends on the user interaction mode with the system.",
        "In the simplest cases, theme–objects can be identified with privileged properties of the physical system, such as outputs of an artifact.",
        "But in a dialogue system, an analysis of user queries is necessary.",
        "Second, the selection is refined and communicative acts arc selected according to user's beliefs and expectations expressed in his request.",
        "Especially, communicative acts on causal opposition relations are introduced in two kind of situation: (a) if a complete description of causal behaviour is required or (b) within a concessive strategy, which seems appropriate when the user focuses on an expected but yet unocccurred event.",
        "For example, in order to reply to the question \"why doesn't the mercury level drop ?\", causal opposition relations are not ignored for it suggests that the user is interested with inhibited influences which might have caused a mercury drop.",

        "In RST, the structure of a text is obtained by composition of rhetorical relations expressing various kindsof dependencies, sometimes semantic (\"subject mat-ter\" relations in RST terminology), sometimes purely rhetorical (presentational relation in RST).",
        "In contrast, in our approach the intended rhetorical effects are considered as communicative goals and are specified at the content specification level.",
        "Asa consequence, inter–clausal relations involved in our system are exclusively semantic.",

        "But there is not necessarily a direct correspondence between relations of conceptual level and relations of textual level, as in the above transitions.",
        "Hence, the following transition may hold in some context, even if no causal interaction exists between on the one hand CI, El and on the other hand C2, E2:",
        "As mentioned in section 11, behavioural description of a physical system contains not only causal links between events but also causal opposition relations.",
        "These relations arc often phrased in natural language with concessive connectives (but, though, however,...) which, following Piaget [Piaget 78], express a discordance between cause and effect.",

        "The purpose of the segmentation task is to delimit the content of the sentences which will constitute the final text.",
        "The determination of a sentential content involves several heuristics.",
        "Some of them aim at increasing the scope of the sentence while others aim at reducing it.",
        "One of the main heuristics deals with the communicative nature of inter-clausal relations: since preponderant relations often appear in subordinate forms at syntactic level, equiponderant relations are privileged.",
        "Hence, delimitation of sentential content starts with the choice of equiponderant relations.",
        "The content is then completed with preponderant relations.",
        "In addition, the number of textual units of a sentence is limited and introduced relations may be removed from the sentential content if it contains too many textual units.",
        "The segmentation is also constrained by the conceptual nature of information units.",
        "For instance, an initial cause may be realized in a single sentence.",
        "The text planner is independent of the surface generation component.",
        "(except the stylistic adjustment task).",
        "Two different types of sentence generation approaches have been examined.",
        "Our main approach aims at coupling the text planning system with a generic sentence generator [Fournier 91] based on the Meaning–Text Theory [Mel'cuk 88].",
        "In the Mea-ning–Text Model, the input representation is a semantic network enriched with several structures, mainly the bipar-titions them e/rheme, asserted/presupposed and given/new.",
        "The construction of semantic networks is based on a con-ceptual–semantic dictionary, which specifies correspondences between concepts and semantic definitions.",
        "The given/new structure has already been integrated in text generation systems (e.g. [Ni ren burg 88]).",
        "It denotes specific linguistic constructions and will constrain choices during realization.",
        "For instance, a predicative structure will be rather realized as an assertion if it belongs to the new part or as a nom inalization if it belongs to the given part.",
        "This characterization of semantic representations plays a crucial role from a textual perspective.",
        "The generation process must be sensitive to progression of new information through the text, even at the realization stage.",
        "In this spirit, distribution of semantic units among given and new parts is carried out with regard to conceptual units introduced in previous sentences.",
        "Predicative structures of the semantic network whose referents have been previously evoked arc systematically marked as given and the others as new.",
        "Once the semantic representation is built (only the semantic network and the given/new structure have been considered), the realizer produces surface forms and paraphrases may be generated, essentially by lexical substitutions.",
        "The second approach we are experimenting relies on equivalence classes between sentence structures, which may be compared to Discourse Grammars described in [Danlos 85].",
        "An equivalence class represents potential realizations of a kind of semantic content.",
        "Our investigation is currently limited to classes related to causality.",
        "We have defined classes for expressing causal and opposition relations.",
        "This categorization of linguistic expressions provides a suitable basis for stylistic adjustment mechanisms.",
        "Syntactic and lexical constraints arising from stylistic considerations govern the choice of sentence structures within classes.",
        "In particular, we have implemented a \"principle of stylistic variety\" which prevents excessive use of similar syntactic constructions.",
        "This principle is particularly useful in causal explanation generation because concepts involved are of similar types.",
        "To illustrate this point, let us consider the text in figure 2.",
        "When generating the last sentence, stylistic adjustment recommends the realizer to avoid coordinative structures (with connectives such as thus, consequently, ...) since such a construction has been used in the previous sentence.",
        "A structure with a verb conveying causality (e.g. to cause, to result in, ...) is then selected.",
        "VI – RELATED WORKS Our system benefits from a number of earlier works on language generation, as those we have mentioned along the above sections.",
        "We will focus the comparison on two particular points.",
        "The first concerns the overall architecture and modularization in text generation systems; the second deals with text planning applied to causal explanation generation.",
        "Text planning and surface generation have often been conceived as separated components.",
        "But separation of tasks is not always extended within text planning.",
        "For example, rhetorical schemata used in TEXT [McKeown 85] specify in the same structure not only information units which may be introduced but also their orders in the final text.",
        "Other systems as GOSSIP [Carcagno & Iordanskaja 89] and PAULINE [Hovy 88b] have isolated content determination from text structuring.",
        "The approach described in this paper also proposes a clear separation of the content specification and the textual organization skills.",
        "The main motivation behind this division is that it is convenient to decide what to say (more precisely, to set (almost) all communicative goals to achieve) before taking any organizational decisions.",
        "Hence, content specification proceeds regardless of structuring considerations.",
        "However, we think that a more cooperative interaction between these two major components is necessary to allow goal revisions at the text organization level.",
        "Our system can also be compared to TAILOR [Paris 87] which generates natural language descriptions of physical devices.",
        "A significant advantage of TAILOR is its ability to combine structural and causal description strategies.",
        "Nevertheless, causal interactions are restricted to simple causal links and there is no attempt to explicit the roles they can play in discourse.",
        "VII – FUTHER DEVELOPMENTS First a better conceptual characterization of physical systems would contribute to improve the quality of causal explanations.",
        "We need a more precise description of causal interactions which allows, for instance, to discern enable-ment conditions from other causal links.",
        "With regards to text planning, number of extensions are possible.",
        "We intend to define strategies for structural descriptions and also enhance the control mechanisms of discourse strategies.",
        "Furthermore, practical validation of the overall approach requires a larger coverage of communicative acts.",
        "Another interesting extension would consist in relating stylistic adjustment mechanisms to pragmatic features [Hovy 89] in order to strengthen context sensitivity."
