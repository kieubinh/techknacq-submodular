        "machine translation The proposed system has the following advantages.",
        "(1) Quality",
        "Basically, a conventional machine translation system performs word-for-word translation.",
        "That is, a 11 sentence is created from words, each of which is a TL equivalent of a word in an SL sentence.",
        "An example-based machine translation system is, in contrast, capable of creating a more flexible translation whereby elements which do not have a word-for-word correspondence arc transferred as an undivided whole.",
        "We can therefore expect improvement in translation quality.",
        "(2) Customizability",
        "With conventional machine translation systems based on grammar rules, users are not allowed to modify the grammar rules, because they arc subtly related to each other and it is difficult to assess the overall effect of rule modification.",
        "But with the example-based machine translation, users can easily customize the system for their own fields, e.g. computer manuals, by providing their own translation examples.",
        "This system is particularly suitable for a field in which similar sentences are written repeatedly.",
        "(3) Transparency",
        "A translation template is regarded as a transfer rule.",
        "It is easy to understand, compared to a tree-to-tree transformation rule in conventional machine translation.",
        "Translation is primarily performed by direct transfer of word string patterns.",
        "A highly transparent system can therefore be realized.",
        "(4) Computation",
        "Generally speaking, example-based machine translation requires large amount of computation.",
        "In the proposed architecture, however, examples are transformed beforehand into intermediate forms by extracting useful information.",
        "The amount of required computation is therefore reduced compared to a system which uses translation examples directly.",
        "(5) Unified treatment of translation knowledge Various kinds of knowledge for translation are extracted and represented in a single translation template framework.",
        "For example, the template in Fig. 2 is a kind of transfer rule which bridges a structural gap between Japanese and English.",

        "have developed tools for constructing a bilingual corpus in which equivalent units are linked to each other.",
        "fSadler901 Full automatization, however, has not yet been realized.",
        "There are three distinguishing features of the algorithm presented in Section 3.",
        "First, the algorithm was designed on the assumption that syntactic ambiguities cannot be resolved completely by the preceding sentence analysis.",
        "Syntactic ambiguities are resolved instead in the phrase coupling process.",
        "Second, ambiguities in correspondence between words is resolved simultaneously as phrases are coupled.",
        "Third, correspondence between phrases is determined without comparing their internal structures, because structural coincidence cannot always be expected between a pair of Japanese and English sentences, even if a dependency structure is adopted.",
        "These features result in a reliable and efficient algorithm.",
        "6.3 Is the translation template inflexible ?",
        "The translation template may not be as flexible as the matching expression proposed by Sato.",
        "[Sato90] However, the introduction of fragmentary templates has made it sufficiently flexible.",
        "An obvious restriction of the template is that the word order is fixed.",
        "This is inconvenient for languages, like Japanese, in which word order is flexible.",
        "However, it is not a serious problem, as the system has a learning capability.",
        "If a corpus includes sentences which differ in word order, the system will learn a set of templates which differ in word order.",
        "A more important problem to be pursued is how to deal with omissible elements.",
        "It is not easy to decide which phrases can be omitted from an example sentence.",
        "Translation templates which include descriptions of phrase omissibility, however, would certainly be effective.",
        "7.",
        "Conclusion We have developed an algorithm for learning translation templates from translation examples.",
        "A translation template is a bilingual pair of sentences in which corresponding units are coupled and replaced with variables.",
        "Correspondence between units is reliably identified by using a bilingual dictionary and the results of syntactic analysis of the sentences.",
        "Syntactic ambiguity and ambiguity in correspondence between units are simultaneously resolved.",
        "All translation templates generated from a bilingual corpus are grouped by their source language part, and they are then further refined to resolve conflicts among templates whose source language parts are the same but whose target language parts are different.",
        "This algorithm makes it possible to effectively extract a variety of knowledge from a bilingual corpus.",
        "Not only is the quality of translations improved, but machine translation systems can be easily customized.",
