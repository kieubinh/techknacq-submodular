        "In the current machine translation system, users cannot always get correct translated sentences at the first translation.",
        "This is due to the low ability of the grammar rules and low quality of the dictionary.",
        "Moreover, the grammar rules and the dictionary need customization for each document of varying fields and contents.",
        "It is very difficult to prepare beforehand the information corresponding to various fields.",
        "NEC has developed a machine translation system \"PIVOT\"(Japanese to English/English to Japanese) as the translation support system for business use.",
        "The translation part of PIVOT is the rule-based system and adopts the interlingua method.",
        "PIVOT provides a special editor so that the user can correct the analysis results.",
        "The user can interactively select suitable translation equivalents, can correct dependency, case (semantic relation), and so on.",
        "In technical manual documents which are the main objects of machine translation, there are many expressions that appear more than once.",
        "The analysis results of such expressions are often the same.",
        "At present, PIVOT has learning function for selection of translation equivalents, but it does not have such mechanism for dependency and case.",
        "The user has to correct many similar errors in dependency and case, so a heavy burden is laid on the user.",
        "Information given by the user can be regarded as customizing information for the document to be translated.",
        "Therefore, for a practical use system, it is an important issue to provide a framework to improve translation by using correction information from the user.",
        "There are various approaches for analyzing sentences by using accumulated dependencies.",
        "One system automatically extracts all dependencies which have no ambiguitYT5).",
        "Another system accumulates only the dependencies which are directly corrected by the user [2].",
        "In Miura et al.",
        "[4], the system accumulates all dependencies in the sentence that are corrected or confirmed by the user.",
        "There are two ways for remembering the keys in the dependency structures to be accumulated: one by the spelling and the other by the semantic code.",
        "However, the rough semantic code used in the current system does not have high distinguishing ability, and often causes bad influence.",
        "For example, consider the following sentences.",
        "a. i61tt71-97.-clk,-c1069PL.M.t...",
        "He looked at the singing man with opera glasses.",
        "He looked at the man who is singing with the microphone.",
        "The semantic code \"Instrument\" is usually assigned to A(oper, glasses)\" and \"74 :,(microphone)\".",
        "Therefore, it isn't possible to fix dependency relation such as \"tt'.i(singing)\" with \"-74 &,(microphone)\", and \"M6(look)\" with \"xT-,1 :t(opera glasses)\".",
        "In the process of using learning results there is an approach that adopts best matching by computing similarity with accumulated informationTa The example-based approach that translates by retrieving examples and calculating similarity has been investigated.",
        "These systems also adopt best matching[l][6]f7).",
        "This paper proposes an approach that can improve the translation quality by interactively accumulating dependency and case structures corrected by the user.",
        "In the learning process, the syntactic head, the syntactic dependent, and the case between them are stored in the association database.",
        "To avoid side effects, head and dependent words are stored in the form of spellings.",
        "This makes it easier for the user to understand the behavior of the system.",
        "Four types of matching methods are examined that arc used in matching between the possible analysis structures and the association database.",
        "Section 2 describes analysis editing function in PIVOT/JE(Japanese to English).",
