        "Case-Based/Example-Based Machine Translation (CBMT/EBMT) has been proposed as a way of overcoming the knowledge acquisition bottleneck in machine translation.",
        "This approach is based on the simple concept of translating sentences by analogy with similar cases stored in a set of cases(a case-base) [1, 2, 3, 4].",
        "This approach has two advantages in terms of knowledge acquisition.",
        "CBMT/EBMT ensures that (1) if the same case as the input exists in the case-base, then the same result will be obtained, and (2) if a similar case exists in the case-base, then a similar result will be obtained.",
        "In the first instance, which cases are regarded as the same depends on the equality metrics of the system.",
        "In the second instance, which cases are regarded as similar depends on the similarity metrics.",
        "Rule developers or users can control the system on the basis of equality and similarity without understanding the global flow of controls.",
        "In applying this idea to practical machine translation systems, there are still two serious problems.",
        "One is that CBMT/EBMT requires a great deal of computation because of its inherent need to retrieve a huge number of cases and calculate their similarities to the input.",
        "For practical systems, several hundreds of thousands of cases must be accessible.",
        "CBMT/EBMT systems should not impose any restrictions on cases to be added to the case-base in an effort to keep the case-base small, since the similarity metrics depends on the frequencies of cases.",
        "If cases are restricted, sufficient information to control the rules is not acquired.",
        "The other problem of CBMT/EBMT is the difficulty of defining a semantic distance.",
        "Though thesauri are used as bases for semantic distance calculation in CBMT/EBMT, it may be impossible to define a general semantic distance by using thesauri alone.",
        "Semantic distances between words are defined according to which specific words are related to their translations.",
        "For example, in translating the word \"k .6\"(eat,feed,...), \"(dog)-e-k-s\".6\"is equivalent to \"a dog eats,\" \"4- (cow)-b1-'k-'..- 6\" is equivalent to \"a cow feeds,\" and \".",
        "(6 (horse)451-1t^',..6\" is equivalent to \"a horse feeds.\" In these cases, \"\"(cow) is closer to \",%\" (horse) than \")\"(dog), because different words are selected for each translation of \"k\"< 6\" with✓(cow) and \"k' (dog).",
        "But in translating \"*6\"(run,gallop,...), \"* (dog)-1-k6\" is equivalent to \"a dog runs,\" (cow)-e-> 3\" is equivalent to \"a cow runs,\" and \".",
        "(horse)-b\"- '3\" is equivalent to \"a horse gallops.\" In these cases, (cow) is closer to \")\"(dog) than \"K\"(horse).",
        "If such incomplete semantic distances calculated by thesauri alone are used for CBMT/EBMT, exceptional cases may be interpreted as general ones(overgeneralization).",
        "Over-generalization is a major problem in translating idiomatic expressions.",
        "For example, '1 (head)-751-01.6\" has two translations: \"hurt one's head \" or, idiomatically, \"be smart.\" But \"Mli (head)-e-V]t1.6\" has only one interpretation, \"hurt one's head,\" though the word \"IiRgiS\" has almost the same meaning as \"fl .V.",
        "It is obvious that \"1fli-e-Vii1.6\" can be translated correctly by adding this translation pair into the case-base.",
        "The addition, however, cannot prevent the idiomatic expression \"ig-751-4Jil-Z\" from being interpreted generally.",
        "The idiomatic interpretation still may be adopted for \"X-'b147#1.\" if X is more similar to the word \"RR\" than the words in the case-base whose pattern is \"X-e-Vitt..6.\" Sato PI and Sumita [4) weigh each slot depending on how much it affects the translation.",
        "However, since such weights are calculated only for each slot, the over-generalization that occurs inside of a slot is not resolved.",
        "To avoid over-generalization, we need some mechanism to encapsulate exceptions rather than to adjust the semantic distance."

        "A case-base, in contrast to a set of rules, has inherent redundancy, because cases are collected without pre-selection.",
        "In the simplest case, if the sentence \"A\" has only one translation equivalent \"a,\" then the single case \"A\" \"a\" is enough to translate \"A.\" But if we view the case-base as a collection of sentences, the same sentences rarely seem to occur 1.",
        "Sentences can, however, be divided into smaller fragments which are meaningful units for translation according to the some linguistic models, which we call translation patterns.",
        "These fragments are combined for use in translating sentences.",
        "Fragments divided on the basis of translation patterns are obviously more effective than sentences, because smaller fragments are more likely to match than full sentences.",
        "We generalize such fragments extracted according to each translation pattern, using a thesaurus, by replacing the words that occur in cases by more general concepts in the thesaurus.",
        "The words to be replaced are determined by their frequencies in the case-base.",
        "Frequent occurring fragments should be assigned more weight than less frequent by occurring fragments.",
        "The frequencies of fragments are used to weigh generalized cases in generalization.",
        "Semantic distances are calculated for each translation pattern as the importances of generalized cases.",
        "Only meaningful categories for the translation pattern are stored as generalized cases, except that the most meaningful category is taken as a default.",

        "We distinguish CBMT from EBMT in accordance with this viewpoint.",

        "While generalizing cases, we can identify exceptional cases as those which cannot be generalized.",
        "Once we identify exceptions, then we can prevent such exceptions from being interpreted generally.",
        "In this way, cases are generalized according to the translation pattern into generalized cases with concepts as the values of their variables.",
        "In addition to generalized cases, rules can be formulated according to translation patterns.",
        "Generalized cases and manually written rules are assumed to he the same as objects in CBMT.",
        "It is valuable to have rules available as well as cases, especially when the case-base contains insufficient cases.",
        "If rules are not available, there must be sufficient cases from the time the system is first used.",
        "Incremental development of any domain is possible only if general rules are available.",
        "In accordance with these basic ideas, we propose a method of machine translation in which cases are generalized.",
        "In our approach, we define linguistic patterns in translation.",
        "According to these patterns, the cases in the case-base are divided into smaller fragments and are generalized.",
        "Both rules and generalized cases are used to translate sentences.",
        "CBMT is divided into two sub-processes: (1) best matching, to search for the most similar cases in the case-base, and (2) application control, to control the combination of similar cases for translation.",
        "Application control is a general problem in machine translation, whereas best matching is a problem unique to CBMT.",
        "If the best matching process returns certainty factors, the system is controlled using these factors on the basis of the some other model such as Watanabe's [5].",
