        "Given the causal and temporal relations between events in a knowledge base, what are the ways they can be described in text?",
        "Elsewhere, we have argued that during interpretation, the reader-hearer H must infer certain temporal information from knowledge about the world, language use and pragmatics.",
        "It is generally agreed that processes of Gricean implicature help determine the interpretation of text in context.",
        "But without a notion of logical consequence to underwrite them, the inferences â€“ often defensible in nature will appear arbitrary, and unprincipled.",
        "Hence, we have explored the requirements on a formal model of temporal im plicature, and outlined one passible nomnonotonic framework for discourse interpretation (Lascarides Asher [1991], Lascarides Iz Oberlander [1992a]).",
        "Here, we argue that if the writer-speaker S is to tailor text to II, then discourse generation can be informed by a similar formal model of implicature.",
        "We suggest two ways to do it: a version of Hobbs et al's [1988, 1990] Generation as Abduction; and the Interactive Defaults strategy introduced by Joshi et al. [l984a, 1984b, 1986].",
        "In investigating the latter strategy, the basic goal is to determine how notions of temporal reliability, precision and coherence can be used by a nonmonotonic logic to constrain the space of passible utterances.",
        "We explore a defensible reasoning framework in which the interactions between the relative knowledge bases of S and H helps do this.",
        "Finally, we briefly discuss limitations of the strategy: in particular, its apparent marginalisation of discourse structure.",
        "The paper focuses very specifically on implicatures of a temporal nature.",
        "To examine the relevant examples in sufficient detail, we have had to exclude discussion of many closely related issues in the theory of discourse structure.",
        "To motivate this restriction, let us therefore consider first why we might want to generate discourses with structures which lead to temporal complexities.",

        "ac.uk Getting Things Out of Order Consider the following suggestion for generating textual descriptions of causal-temporal structures.",
        "Describe things in exactly the order in which they happened.",
        "If textual order is made to match eventual order, then perhaps little can go wrong; for the hearer can safely assume that all the texts she hears are narrative.",
        "Under these circumstances, the problem of selecting adequate regions in the space of utterances pretty much dissolves.",
        "We do not believe that this suggestion will work, in general, and consider here two arguments against it.",
        "navy's argument Basically, the generation strategy suggested above fails to emphasise the force of some eventualities over others (cf. the nucleus-satellite distinction in itsT).",
        "A useful device for emphasis is the topic-counnent structure: we mention the important event first, and then the others, which fill out or give further detail about that important event.",
        "These 'comments' on the 'topic' may be effects, but they could also be the cause of the topic.",
        "If the latter, then textual order and temporal order mismatch; the text is a causal explanation in such cases, and having only narrative discourse structure available would preclude its generation.",
        "Compare (1) and (2), modified from Ilovy [1990].",
        "(1) First, Jim bumped Mike once and hurt him.",
        "Then they fought.",
        "Eventually, Mike stabbed Iiiin.",
        "As a result, Jim died.",
        "(2) Jim died in a fight with Mike.",
        "After Jim bumped Mike once, they fought, and eventually Mike stabbed him.",
        "The textual order in (1) matches temporal order, whereas in (2) there is mismatch.",
        "And yet (2) is much better than (1).",
        "This is because the 'important' event is Jim's death.",
        "Everything mentioned in (1) leads up to this.",
        "But because the events are mentioned in their temporal order, the text obscures the fact that all the events led to Jim's death, even though syntactic markers like and then and as a result are used.",
        "The causal groupings are clearer in (2) because it's clear during incremental processing that the text following the mention of Jim's death is a description of how it came about.",
        "This is so even though no AMES DE COLING-92, NAN-rEs, 23-28 noC-1 1992 7 2 1 PROC.",
        "OF COLING-92, NANFES, AUG. 23-28, 1992 syntactic markers indicate this causal structure.",
        "By contrast, in (1) the reader realises what's going on only at the last sentence.",
        "The discourse structure is therefore unclear until the whole text is heard, for the narrative requires a common topic which is only stated at the end.",
        "So (2)'s a better discourse than (1); but we would never generate it, if textual order had to mirror eventual order.",
        "If a generation system were permitted to generate (2), however, a price must be paid.",
        "The proper interpretation of (2) relies on the recruitment of certain causal information, left implicit by the utterance.",
        "The generator thus has some responsibility for ensuring that the interpreter accomplishes the required inferences.",
        "A formal model of implicature must be folded into the generation process, so that the appropriate reasoning can proceed.",
        "States interact with causal information In Lascarides and Oberlander [1992], we considered in detail the following pair of examples:",
        "(3) Max opened the door.",
        "The room was pitch dark.",
        "(4) Max switched off the light.",
        "The room was pitch dark.",
        "Now, no-one would want to say that (3) involved a room becoming pitch dark immediately after a door was opened.",
        "Rather, most accounts (such as those based in or around ORT, such as Hinrichs [1986]) will take the state of darkness to overlap the event of door-opening.",
        "That's how one might say states are dealt with in a narrative: events move things along; states leave them where they are.",
        "But if we have a piece of causal information to hand, things are rather different.",
        "In (4), it seems that the state doesn't overlap the previously mentioned event.",
        "If one wishes to preserve the assumption about the role of states in narrative, it would have to be weakened to the constraint that states either leave things where they are, or move them along.",
        "This is not a very convincing move.",
        "An alternative is to formalise the role of the additional causal knowledge.",
        "Informally, the basis for the distinct interpretations of (3) and (4) is that the interpretation of (4) is informed by a causal preference which is lacking in the case of (3): if there is a switching off of the light and a room's being dark that are connected by a causal, part/whole or overlap relation, then normally one infers that the former caused the latter.",
        "This knowledge is defeasible, of course.",
        "In generation, such knowledge will constrain the space of adequate utterances; if H lacks the defeasible causal knowledge that switching off lights cause darkness, then (4) won't be adequate for H, who will interpret (4) in the same way as (3), contrary to S's intentions.",
        "Given this, S must contain a defeasible reasoning component to compute over such knowledge.",
        "The important point for now is that even if we describe things in the order in which they are assumed to happen, this doesn't necessarily make the candidate utterance a good one.",
        "If the speaker and the hearer possess differing world knowledge, there may be problems in retrieving the correct causal-temporal structure."

        "There is a very general way in which we might view interpretation and generation in terms of defeasible reasoning.",
        "Consider the process of discourse interpretation as one of KB extension.",
        "The KB contains an utterance-interpretation, and a set of knowledge resources; the latter may include general knowledge of the world, knowledge of linguistic facts, knowledge about the discourse so far, and about the speaker's knowledge state.",
        "We then try to extend the KB so as to include the discourse interpretation.",
        "Consider now the process of generation; it too can be thought of as KB extension.",
        "This time, the KB contains a temporal-causal structure, and a set of knowledge resources, perhaps identical to that used in interpretation.",
        "We now try to extend the KB so as to include the realization of a linguistic structure's semantic features (with predicates, arguments, connectives, orderings), where these features ensure that the final linguistic string describes the causal structure in the KB.",
        "This view might be described as generation by defensible reasoning.",
        "Modulo more minor differences, these notions are close to the ideas of interpretation as abduction (Hobbs et al. [1988]) and generation as abduction (Hobbs et al. [1990:26-28]), where we take abduction, in the former case for instance, to be a process returning a temporal-causal structure which can explain the utterance in context.",
        "Correspondences between a defeasible deduction approach and an abductive approach have been established by Konolige [1991]; he shows that the two are nearly equivalent, the consistency-based approach being slightly more powerful [1991:15-16], once closure axioms are added to the background theory.",
        "Lascarides Oberlander [1992b] discuss in detail how such a generation process produces temporally adequate utterances.",
        "Interactive defaults Here, we turn to another, less powerful but simpler, method of applying defeasible reasoning: the Interactive Defaults (m) strategy introduced by Joshi, Webber and Weischedel [1984a, 1984b, 1986].",
        "Rather than considering the defeasible process as applying directly to the KB's causal network, we instead consider its role as constraining or debugging candidate lincarised utterances, generated by some other process; here we will remain neutral on the nature of that originating process.",
        "A speaker S and a hearer H interact through a dialogue; a writer S and a reader II interact through a text.",
        "Joshi et al. argue that it is inevitable that both S and H infer more from utterances than is explicitly contained within them.",
        "Taking Grice's [1975] Maxim of Quality seriously, they argue that since both S and H know this is going to happen, it is incumbent upon S to take into account the implicatures II is likely to make on the basis of a candidate utterance.",
        "If S detects that something S believes to be false will be among H's implicatures, S must block that inference somehow.",
        "The basic way to block it is for S to use a different utterance; one which 5 does not believe will mislead H. In terms of defeasible reasoning, the point is that S must use it to calculate the consequences of the candidate utterance; if the process allows the derivation of something S believes to be false, the utterance should not be used in its current form.",
        "Joshi et al. illustrate with the following example; given the KH in (5), and the question in (6), they want the process to show why the answer in (7b) is preferred to that in (7a):",

        "We wish to elaborate this interactive defaults strategy (In), and consider in greater formal detail the defensible reasoning about causal-temporal structures that S and H are assumed by S to indulge in; and to consider which candidate utterances arc eliminated on this basis.",
        "Discourse Structure and Temporal Constraints In requires a theory of implicative in terms of defaults, and an underlying logical notion of nonmonotonic or defeasible inference.",
        "We also require a formal characterisation of the properties an adequate candidate utterance must possess; we define these below in terms of temporal coherence, reliability and precision.",
        "Furthermore, we assume a model of discourse structure is required.",

        "Similarly, if p is the fact that Max opened the door, and while this was going on the room was pitch dark, then (3) is reliable and precise for 11:",
        "(3) Max opened the door.",
        "'1'he room was pitch dark.",
        "But what if p asserts a causal relation between two events that violates a &feasible causal preference that II has?",
        "Suppose p asserts that Max's fall immediately preceded John's pushing 11411.",
        "And suppose that S knows that II has the defensible causal law mentioned above, but lacks p. Then neither (9) nor (12) are reliable for II, indicating that .9 cannot generate an atomic text to assert p.",
        "(9) Max fell.",
        "John pushed birri.",
        "(12) John pushed Max.",
        "Ile fell.",
        "H would interpret (9) as an explanation; arid (12) as a narrative, for nothing will conflict with Narration in that case: the causal preference for pushings causing fallings would simply reinforce the temporal structure imposed by Narration.",
        "The obvious option is to move from (9) to (13); another option is to recruit the pluperfect, as in (14); note that (15) is riot a solution, since so can be read evidentially.",

        "And then John pushed him.",
        "(14) jolin pushed Max.",
        "Ile had fallen.",
        "(15) Max fell.",
        "So John pushed loin.",
        "The need to utter (13) rather than (9) explains why it can be necessary to use and then, even though the full-stop is always available and, by Narration, has the default effect of temporal progression.",
        "So, in general, one might wish to paraphrase Joshi et al: if a relation can be defeasibly inferred to hold between two eventualities, and S wants something different, it is essential to mark the desired relation with something stronger.",
        "In general, S will have only partial knowledge about H's beliefs.",
        "This has its drawbacks.",
        "p is a defensible causal preference Suppose that S isn't sure whether or not II believes the defeasible causal law relating falling and pushing.",
        "Then there are at least two ways in which S's model of IPs knowledge can be expanded to a complete statement of H's knowledge.",
        "The first, B1, contains the causal law.",
        "The second, B2, does not.",
        "Now impose that S wishes to convey the proposition that John's pushing Max caused Max to fall.",
        "Then, if S assumes H's knowledge corresponds to Br, then II will find a reliable interpretation for (9).",
        "(9) Max fell.",
        "John pushed him.",
        "On the other hand, if S assumes that H's knowledge corresponds to B2, then H will interpret (9) in an undesirable way, with the falling preceding the pushing; as we said before, Narration would win.",
        "Under this model, S isn't sure how H will interpret (9), because S doesn't know if H's knowledge corresponds to 131 or B2.",
        "Hence the ambiguity of (9) manifests itself to the generator S, if not to the hearer H, because S doesn't have sufficient information about II to predict which of the two alternative temporal structures H will infer for (9).",
        "This is slightly different to the previous case where S actually knows H lacks the causal law, making (9) unreliable.",
        "To avoid uttering unreliable text, S will have to utter something other than (9).",
        "Indeed, it may be possible for S not to worry about the ambiguity of (9) at all, if some 'safe' strategy can be found that would guide S's expansion of H's knowledge in a way that would ensure the generation of reliable text for H. A plausible strategy for S's reasoning about II would be the following: if S isn't sure whether or not H knows p, then assume II doesn't know p. On the face of it this seems plausible.",
        "But just how safe is it?",
        "We state it in terms of B+(II) and 11- (II):",
        "â€¢ If p BI (H) and p B'(H), assume p E (II) and generate-and-test under this assumption.",
        "But this won't work in general.",
        "If S wants to convey a violation of the causal law p, but H actually believes p, then the strategy will suggest the use of (9), which will actually be unreliable for H. In fact, there is no safe strategy, save the one where S considers several alternative expansions of H's knowledge.",
        "As a result, ambiguity of text will manifest itself to S in certain cases, because of her partial knowledge of II.",
        "This is perhaps somewhat surprising.",
        "Nonmonotonic reasoning is designed as a medium for reasoning with partial knowledge.",
        "And yet here we have shown S cannot maintain textual reliability on the basis of a partial statement of H's KB, even if nonmonotonic inference is exploited.",
        "p is a fact about the KB: Ambiguity Suppose that S wants to convey the information that Max's fall immediately preceded John pushing hint, and suppose S knows that II knows the causal law, but S doesn't know for sure if H knows already that Max fell before John pushed him.",
        "Then, for similar reasons as those mentioned earlier, S isn't sure if (9) is reliable or not.",
        "(9) Max fell.",
        "John pushed him.",
        "To be sure that text is reliable in this case, S will again have to exploit linguistic knowledge; for example, by uttering (13) instead of (9).",
        "(13) Max fell and then John pushed him.",
        "Case 3: H as advisor, S as pupil Suppose that for a certain proposition p, p B(S), p B+(H) and p B-(11).",
        "This corresponds to H potentially knowing more about p than 5', but S not knowing what more.",
        "That's pretty much the position of the tutee in a tutorial dialogue, and the advice-taker in an advisory dialogue.",
        "Case 4: S thinks that II is mistaken Suppose that p B(S) and p E B-1-(H).",
        "Then S doesn't believe p even though she's aware II does.",
        "This implies that S thinks II is mistaken in believing",
        "The fact that p B(S) and p E 13-1-(H) could entail that a text that's reliable for S isn't for H. For example, suppose that II believes, by some weird perception of social convention, that there is a defensible causal preference that greetings cause standing ups.",
        "Suppose that S wants to describe the situation where Max stood up and then John greeted him (i.e. an exception to H's causal preference).",
        "Then this is like the exception case above concerning falling and pushing: (16) is reliable for S but not for H. (16) Max stood up.",
        "John greeted him.",
        "Again, S could compensate for this by explicitly marking the temporal relation.",
        "Alternatively, the fact that p B(S) and p E B+(H) could entail that a text that's unreliable for S is reliable for H. Again, let p be the causal law that says that greetings cause standing ups.",
        "But this time suppose that S wants to describe the situation where John's greeting Max caused him to stand up.",
        "So this time, S wants to describe an instance of the causal law.",
        "Then both",
        "(16) and (17) are reliable for H, but only the latter is reliable for S. (17) John greeted Max.",
        "Be stood up.",
        "(16) is unreliable for S. Arguably, it wouldn't be in the set of possible linguistic realisations, but only if this set is assumed to be characterised by what S finds reliable.",
        "But we have no argument for this assumption, and so we don't make it."

        "ID applies to the candidate utterances (or the space of utterances), and criticises the utterances (or the space), producing better utterances, or a smaller space.",
        "The notion of logical consequence supported by CE was used to make precise how utterances are constrainted by ID.",
        "Crucially, we used Defensible Modus Ponens and the Penguin Principle.",
        "The grounds for criticism were the tempo.",
        "ral ramifications of the utterance; if it was incoherent for H, unreliable for II or dangerously ambiguous (for S), it was bad.",
        "One limitation of the model is that, although it permits reasoning about the knowledge or beliefs of interlocutors, it neglects their goals and intentions to do actions.",
        "ID does not deal with the phenomena which motivate the work following Cohen and Perrault [1979] and Allen and Perrault [1980], (cf. Cohen, Morgan and Pollack [1990]).",
        "In particular, ID does not let S take into account those inferences H will make in attempting to ascribe a plan to S. Hobbs et al. [1990:44-45] argue that inferences leading to plan recognition are less significant in interpreting long written texts or monologues.",
        "hence, it might be argued that the generation of such discourses need not give //'s plan recognition particular weight.",
        "Nonetheless, ID is incomplete, to the extent that such inferences influence discourse generation.",
        "Secondly, discourse structure and temporal structure have become somewhat detached.",
        "Sometimes, it's only the causal-temporal structure derivable from the candidate that is being criticized.",
        "It may therefore be thought that the discourse structure is an idle wheel as things stand, and should be either eliminated (cf. Sibun [1992]), or be trusted with a greater share of the work, enriching the discourse with useful clue words (cf. Scott and Souza [1990]).",
        "Our tentative view is that the latter view is plausible, and anyway is closer to the idea of generation by defeasible reasoning, canvassed early on.",
        "The ID strategy examined here seems to involve a lot of hard work generating simple candidates which almost always require debugging.",
        "It would be preferable if we could do this work in advance, by default.",

        "duction and abduction to derive linguistic realisations.",
        "But in turning to the more global approach, we should not lose sight of the fact that simple texts are sometimes best.",
        "(2) illustrates this point: the rhetorical relations inferred aren't syntactically marked, and yet the text is more natural than (1), where the relations are marked.",
        "As might be expected, there seems to he a trade-off between the naturalness of the output and its computational cost."
