        "The normal method for representing anaphoric dependencies in Unification Based (UB) grammar formalisms is that of re-entrance (often indicated graphically by means of subscripts, as in (lb)).",
        "The interpretation is that two or more attributes share (are pointers to) a single value.",
        "In the case of (1), the SUBJ of try is identical to that of employ.",
        "This means that changes to the value of the SUBJ of try (e.g. the addition of another feature) are necessarily changes to the value of the SUBJ of employ.",
        "This token identity should be distinguished from the type identity between these values, and the value of the OBJ attribute in (lb), which just happens to have the same attributes and values.",
        "(la) Linguists try to employ linguists.",
        "This device can be thought of as the attribute-value equivalent of a bound variable of logic, and though it is not appropriate for all kinds of anaphoric dependence, it is ubiquitous.",
        "This paper proposes a novel approach to the treatment of re-entrances in translation, which overcomes the problems of existing approaches using UB formalisms.",
        "These prob",
        "lems are considerable, but have been generally ignored in the literature.",
        "Section 2 will review existing approaches, pointing out the problems.",
        "Section 3 describes the approach, which provides a straightforward treatment of cases where filler-gap dependencies are subject to different constraints in source and target languages (e.g. where one language allows, and the other forbids, Preposition Stranding).",
        "In exemplifying this, we will focus on the treatment of relative clauses./"

        "Perhaps the most obvious way to use a UB formalism for translation is to use a standard UB grammar formalism in analysis to produce a feature structure (FS), which is a collection of attribute-value (A:V) pairs.",
        "This is then mapped to a target FS by means of a bilingual grammar of transfer rules whose left-hand-sides (lhs) are matched against the source structure, Elsewhere, we discuss caws where filler-gap dependencies in one language correspond to antecedent-pronoun dependencies in another.",
        "and whose right-hand-sides (rhs) indicate the content of the corresponding target FS.",
        "These rules are applied recursively to successively smaller collections of source language A:Vs.",
        "This is, of course, just a straightforward adaptation of the traditional transfer method to a A:V data structure in place of a tree, in particular, it resembles a classical transfer system in being 'structural' i.e. in involving the decomposition of source structures into smaller objects (on the Ills), and the actual construction of target structures (on the rhs).",
        "This is essentially the approach employed in ELU (Estival et al. 1990) and MiMo2 (van Noord et al. 1990).",
        "Though there is not much discussion of the treatment of referential dependencies in transfer in these formalisms, it is easy to see how one can deal with re-entrances which naturally fall within the scope of one transfer rule.",
        "In ELU, for example, such re-entrances can be translated by binding the re-entrant paths within the structure to the same variable and stating a correspondence between the relevant source side and the target side variables.",
        "In this way the re-entrance is translated as one structure.",
        "In MiMo2 the re-entrant paths are separately translated, but the re-entrance is explicitly mentioned on source and target side, requiring token-identity between the results of the separate translations.",
        "However, these structure based formalisms do not have any method for generalizing this to cases where re-entrances are not 'local'.",
        "This is serious, because phenomena classically regarded as involving Wh-Movement (e.g. Wh-Questions, Topicalization, Relativisa-non, etc.",
        "), are typically of this kind, and for these phenomena, the formalisms can provide no general treatment.",
        "Of course, there are a number of ways in which one might try to remedy this inadequacy.",
        "For example, one could unfold the re-entrances as type identities (i.e. reinterpret the DAG as a tree), or 'thread' shared values through the structure, in such a way that they become local (cf. standard gap threading techniques to reduce unbounded dependencies to local ones).",
        "However, none are satisfactory.",
        "The former looses information, so that source FS and target FS are no longer equivalent, and causes problems in generation, where some method must be found for ensuring that lexical content is not duplicated, and appears in the right place).",
        "Threading techniques are unattractive because of the (often extreme) complication they introduce in grammars and representations?"

        "In this section, we will outline the approach to the translation of non-local re-entrances proposed in Kaplan et al. (1989).",
        "In LFG projections are linguistically relevant mappings or correspondences between levels, whether these mappings are direct or involve function composition (Kaplan (1987), Halvorsen and Kaplan (1988), Dalrymple (1990) and Dalrymple et al. (1990)).",
        "By means of these projections, equations can be stated which co-describe elements of the two levels related by the projection.",
        "The standard projections are qi (normally expressed in terms of t and I, from c-structure to f-structure), and o (variously from c and f-structure to semantic structures).",
        "Kaplan et al. extend this approach to provide what amounts to a transfer formalism for LFG.3 In their proposal, the equational language of LFG is used to state bilingual constraints or correspondences between elements of source and target structures.",
        "They introduce mapping functions e (between f-structures) and -e' (between semantic structures).",
        "Achieving translation can be thought of as specifying and resolving a set of constraints on target structures, constraints which arc expressed by means of the x and z functions.",
        "The formalism permits a wide variety of source-target correspondences to be expressed: and V can be composed, as can t' and o. Equations specifying translations are added to (source language) lexical entries and c-structure rules.",
        "For example (2) composes t and V, identifying the t of the (source) SUBJ f-structure with the SUBJ attribute of the x of the f-structure associated with some node (the value of t), indicating that the translation of the value of the SUBJ slot in a source f-structure fills the SUBJ slot in the f-structure which is the translation of that source 2 The possibility of a 'threading' approach is hinted at in van Noord et al. (1990).",
        "The formalism described in Putman (ed) (1991) seems to allow an interesting variation, where instead of threading information about non-local re-entrance through the source structure, it is threaded through the 'virtual' structures that are built as the transfer mechanisms recurses through the source structure.",
        "This still does not avoid the basic objection to the use of such techniques, however.",

        "(2) T(tsuw) - (ti SUBJ)",
        "In this approach, then, relations between different types of linguistic description (i.e. levels) are defined in terms of correspondence functions, not by means of the recursive application of rules to source language structures.",
        "In particular, notice that transfer does not operate compositionally on a source language feature structure, rather the analysis procedure collects sets of constraints on various structures, including (t) constraints on target structures.",
        "The solution of a set of t equations is a (probably incomplete) target f-structure which must then be completed and validated by the target grammar.",
        "This allows information which is exhaustively determined by the target grammar to be ignored in the transfer process?",
        "In this sense, the system is constraint-based, rather than structure based like the approaches described in 2.1. above, and it has different expressive possibilities.",
        "As regards relative clauses, Kaplan et al. assume a reasonably standard LFG analysis: wh-relatives are represented as an attribute (here RELMOD) which contains a reentrance between the values of a RELTOPIC phrase and a within-clause function (see (8) below).",
        "The approach to translating these dependencies involves stating separate correspondences for both the within clause function and the RELTOPIC function.",
        "For a simple example like (3), with English as source language, the rules are as in (4-7) and the English and (incomplete) French f-structures as in (8) and (9) (the indices here are simply informal devices to allow easy reference to pieces of f-structure).",

        "This can be seen by looking at the relevant constraints, in (10), which are derived from these rules in relation to (8) and (9).",
        "Since t is a function, (f1 RELTOPIC) and (f1 OBJ) must be the same token.",
        "Hence the desired reentrance falls out automatically.",
        "Thus, it appears that, in principle, this approach requires neither the addition of special apparatus, nor modifications to the treatment of grammatical phenomena that do not involve reentrance.",
        "Unfortunately, this approach is only capable of producing intuitively correct structures in cases where the conditions on unbounded dependencies are parallel in the source and target languages.",
