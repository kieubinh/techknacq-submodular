        "Full exploration of resources offered by knowledge-based systems (KBS's) is only possible if their interface is able to convey a comprehensible image of the system's reasoning.",
        "Given the abstract and complex nature of such reasoning, natural language (NL) text is an intuitive means interface designers choose to convey the system's responses.",
        "The same line of thought is applicable to the input side of the interface system -- NL seems to be intuitively desirable to convey KBS users' questions.",
        "Consequently, the particular framework we envisage here for human-computer interaction is one in which a NL interpreter converts users' utterances into a representation language and a NL generator converts the system's reasoning represented in this language into NL text.",
        "Logic-based knowledge representation techniques have the advantage of being associated to a formal language, whose syntax and semantics is precisely defined and which ensures portability across domains.",
        "Unlike what often happens with other representation techniques, such as associative networks, in this case general methods can be conceived to translate any valid sentence of the formal language into one or more valid sentences in another language, including natural language.",
        "Our choice of a ND inference system [8] is not arbitrary.",
        "Previous research [1] has shown that ND renders more understandable proofs than the algorithmically more efficient resolution based systems, for instance.",
        "The output of a ND-based automatic prover is a recursively generated tree, whose branches are qualified by possibly different inference rules.",
        "The limited number of rule types, together with explicit principles to combine them, allows for the identification of proof patterns.",
        "Therefore, the input to the text generator of the interface system presents a low degree of variability, thus favoring the use of the schemata approach to text planning.",
        "For each pattern of proof there is a corresponding pattern of text.",
        "Moreover, as we will see, given that ND proofs are more understandable, only a few structural operations on the proof trees are needed to account for the content selection step during the NL text planning process."

        "In order to achieve the generation of coherent and cohesive multisentential NL texts, our processor performs two major steps: planning and realization.",
        "This separation is common to other approaches [4,5], and is meant to manage tasks involved in deciding what to say at a different step than those involved in deciding how to say it.",
        "In terms of text planning paradigms, specifically, choices refer to either a rhetorical grammar based approach -- which consists Our approach differs from those of McKeown and Paris's [7] or Moore and Swartout's [5], for example, because we use a theorem prover.",
        "It generates an idefinite number and variety of schemata (proof trees) instead of a limited set of schemata known to the designer.",
        "This feature forces us to conceive of transformational rules that will operate systematically on our schemata in order to turn them into acceptable NL text plans.",
        "Additionally, although we generate text plans dynamically by means of structural rules, our approach is also different from other RST-based approaches such as those suggested by Scott and Souza [9],",
        "essentially of planning text in a dynamic manner by using overall rhetorical structure rules combined with perlocutionary goals and users' beliefs, as provided by Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) [3] -- or a schemata based approach -- which amounts to selecting among alternative preexisting text structuring schemata, which are elaborated from ideal or typical NL texts actually written for the purposes at 'hand [4,7].",
        "We have chosen the schemata approach, although elements of rhetorical structure rules are present and accessible to the system's reasoning.",
        "for example, because the elements included in the specification of RST relations are not computed by the system to constrain the application of transformational rules.",
        "They are used by the designer of the system to map certain patterns found in the proof trees to certain rhetorical structures.",
        "So, it is not the case that the system fully controls the selection of rhetorical relations, but it can, nevertheless, have access to the reasons why the designer has selected them -- it suffices to interpret the specification of the preselected relations appearing in the derived schemata for a given proof."

        "In our approach, nuclei are always the information corresponding to premises of inference rules, and satellites, the conclusions.",
        "For the purpose of exposing the system's reasoning, the information about facts and axioms that have caused the conclusion is more central than the conclusion itself.",
        "It is worth saying that intermediary conclusions in the proof tree have, in each step, the role of premises, due to the recursiveness of the structure.",
        "Mapping inference rules onto RST structures results in a text plan which, if realized, is still far from acceptable.",
        "This is due to the a special mode.",
        "In particular, this is the case of hypothesis assumptions in ND-based systems, whose appropriate structuring in rhetorical terms is context-sensitive.",
        "Once hypotheses are raised, ND proof proceeds according to the same set of rules as in any other case.",
        "Later on, when desired (partial) conclusions are achieved, those hypotheses are discarded.",
        "Of course, discarding only makes sense if raising is in topic.",
        "So, the text plan has to explicitly introduce the status of discardable premises as hypotheses, so that when discarding is mapped onto a rhetorical schema, the reader can refer it to the hypothesized",
        "method of building text plans in a recursive fashion: in traversing the proof tree, inference rules are locally translated into rhetorical relation schemata.",
        "Also, if realization took place in an interleaved way [2], the resulting text plan could be sufficient for acceptable text rendition.",
        "However, since a sequential model is assumed, enhancements to this initial version of the text plan have to be made.",
        "Since text planning is the result of recursive context-free rule application, some important structures that improve the understandability of the final textual exposition of the system's reasoning have to be dealt with in information in topic.",
        "This is done through the use of a condition relation at the top of the rhetorical structured schema.",
        "In fact, cases as the above-mentioned are related to discourse structuring not at the level of informational content (ie.",
        "proof-bound) proper, but rather at the level of the writer's perlocutionary goals, such as clarity, understandability and the like.",
        "Clearly, proof-derived mapping rules account for informational content, but cannot fully ensure the achievement of perlocutionary goals in writing.",
        "This is why, in situations like assumption and ordering of hypotheses, for example, special mechanisms are introduced.",
        "Another similar case is that of repeating (ie.",
        "reintroducing as topic) information corresponding to premises logically related to a conclusive information, but linearly far from the point where that information is presented.",
        "The necessity of this kind of recall may be derived heuristically from the height of the corresponding proof tree.",
        "A relevant point that has to be considered in planning long and deductive texts is guiding the reader along the reasoning path.",
        "An interesting result of previous research [6] is that ND normal proof patterns offer the possibility by case.",
        "Proof by case is used when the premise available to the prover is a disjunction, and the proof consists of deriving the conclusion from each of the elements of the disjunction, considered separately.",
