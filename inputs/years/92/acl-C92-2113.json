        "In this article, we propose a method of utilizing domain and language specific constraints from the viewpoint of transfer phase in a dialogue translation system.",
        "Transfer processing sometimes requires various kinds of information: e.g., domain knowledge for ellipsis resolution, language dependent communicative structures(focus, theme, rheme, ...).",
        "Our standpoint is that there are certain language specific strategies on producing utterances in communication.",
        "As steps towards clarifying those strategies, we first discuss the issue of typical idiosyncratic gaps between two language pairs.",

        "The difficulty of translating spoken dialogues between two languages is often greater than that of translating written text.",
        "This is because translation of certain expressions in a source language are affected by previous context or communicative goals under common knowledge for dialogue participants.",
        "If the two languages are quite different from each other, possible expression candidates increase.",
        "This further complicates the problems of producing utterances in dialogue translation.",
        "In the author's recent work[12], the factors which affect lexical choices and setting the default translation considering those factors were discussed for selecting appropriate verbs.",
        "Of course the selection of an appropriate verb in given situations is only a small part of the great theme of translation in various levels of expression: e.g., selection of modality corresponding to illocutionary forces, correct choice of articles, etc.",
        "The problem, however, includes important aspects of linguistic phenomena related to other levels.",
        "In that article, some examples of relationships between Japanese and English verbs were investigated using a dialogue corpus translated by human interpreters.",
        "Through comparing corresponding verbs in Japanese and English, some tendencies were envisaged concerning the characteristics specific to dialogue translation.",
        "In another work[13], we discussed the issue of translating dialogue utterances through a partitioned semantic network, part of which is actually lexicalized.",
        "A method was proposed for managing the semantic network, i.e. repartitioning of the network, which yields a more natural translation of utterances.",
        "We assumed three kinds of partitions: theme vs. rheme, old vs. new information, and fore vs. background.",
        "The producing of target utterances starts with processing along the lines suggested by the source language, and then the given partition can be repartitioned according to properties of the target language.",
        "Along this examination, we started to describe actual transfer rules for certain kinds of Japanese utterance that seem to be difficult to translate directly into English, because of lacking substantial words in Japanese.",
        "This is the background and the motivation of the current study.",
        "Our presuppositions are as follows.",
        "• The analysis of input utterances are limited in the source language.",
        "Basically, definite/indefinite or plural/singular markers are not indicated in Japanese explicitly.",
        "Moreover, various kinds of arbitrary/obligatory ellipses of subjects/objects/predicates (occasionally) are difficult to resolve within sentential information",
        "• A transfer processing is performed between language dependent feature structures.",

        "According to Narita[9], we can assume two kinds of syntactic systems for any languages.",
        "The first is a core syntactic structure that is generally recognized as a universal system of syntax.",
        "The second syntactic structure is rather language dependent and peripheral.",
        "However, this does not mean that the second syntactic system is unimportant.",
        "Though it is difficult to translate into other languages, the second syntactic system just reflects the characteristics of a certain language.",
        "It includes many favorite expressions in the language.",
        "This issue is quite interesting also from the standpoint of sociolinguistics and cross language communication.",
        "From the viewpoint of translating dialogues, if an expression of a source language is peripheral and there is no corresponding structures in a target language, the source structure could be transformed into a universal structure before translation.",
        "In order to perform this idea, such a transformation should be possible to be formalized.",
        "Furthermore, certain implicit (domain- and language-specific) knowledge might be needed in some cases.",
        "The target expression in this article, a certain kind of \"da-expressions\", is regarded as a typical second syntactic structure described above.",
        "Our future efforts will be directed to investigating various structures and for refining and extending the methodology proposed here."
