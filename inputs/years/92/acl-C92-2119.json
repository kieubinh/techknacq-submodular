        "The troublesome aspect of these limits is clearly that when a dialogue manager fails to face properly misunderstandings, and failures in general, the conversation is tedious and often of no use.",
        "Thus one main aspect of a robust oral dialogue system is to be able to cope with misunderstandings of any type and to respect a minimum of ergonomy in use.",
        "This paper exposes some techniques developed in the SUNDIAL1 system (Speech SUNDIAL is partially funded by the Commission for the European Communities ESPRIT programme, as project UNDerstanding and DIALogue), a multi-user oral dialogue system over the telephone for database access.",
        "In this system the main objective is that the dialogue with the user must be efficient and robust such that computational problems arc not apparent to the user, i.e., she must have the feeling to talk with an intelligent and normal partner.",

        "The dialogue manager receives as input a semantic representation of what the speech understanding layer has recognized from the user's utterance.",
        "One functionality is to interpret the current user's goal(s) in the context of the conversation and to appropriately react so that the task progresses on the right track.",
        "However, inputs may be corrupted in several ways:",
        "• there may be confusions for some words, • only a part of the utterance is understood, • what is understood is not what the user said, • nothing is understood.",
        "So whenever the dialogue manager receives an input, it is aware of these problems.",

        "It has been also proved that participant roles depend on the type of the transaction and therefore participants' dialogue strategies vary according to the current transaction [Bilange 91bl.",

        "Things can be a bit more complex since initiatives, reactions and evaluations may not be a mere collection of dialogue acts but rather a collaborative process.",
