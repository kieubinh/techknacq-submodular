        "A prominent source of ambiguity confronting natural language processing systems is ambiguity of quantifier scope relations.",
        "For example, the sentence Some target was hit by every arrow has one reading on which the quantified noun phrase (NP) some target has wider scope than the quantified NP every arrow (some particular target got hit by all the arrows), and another reading on which every arrow has wide scope (each arrow hit some target or other).",
        "Many factors influence preferred scope readings.",
        "Semantic factors, for example: in Sam served one beer to all customers, we prefer wide scope for all because the alternative reading entails the unlikely scenario of patrons huddled around a single beer mug.",
        "Syntactic factors: e.g. embedded prepositional objects often scope over heads, as in Every teacher at some high school joined the union, whereas heads usually assume scope over NPs contained in a relative clause, as in Every teacher who is at some high school joined the union.",
        "Lexical factors (i.e. the lexical identity of quantifiers): e.g. each tends toward wide scope and a toward narrow scope.",
        "Linear order is a factor - leftmost quantifiers tend to have wide scope - and there are others as well.",
        "Given the relevance of different factors, a question arises: how can a system determine a scope reading based on the combination of factors present in any given sentence?",
        "The standard approach has two parts: first, assign measures to the scoping influences of specific factors taken individually, and second, integrate the individual measures.",
        "The first task is performed by various \"specialists\".",
        "A system may have a lexical specialist which represents the wide scope tendency of each, a specialist which represents the inverse scoping tendency of an embedded prepositional object, a specialist which represents the tendency of quantifiers to scope according to linear order, and so on.",
        "The system will prefer those scope orders for which fint(fspeci, fspec2, .••) is optimal, where fiat is the integrating function and each fsp„j is a specialist.",
        "For example, in the system of Grosz et al. (1987), the specialists are called \"critics.\" Given a candidate scope order, the \"left-right\" critic deducts points for each deviation from left-to-right scope order; the \"quantifier strength\" critic (i.e. lexical specialist) uses a numerical ranking of quantifiers to add and deduct points depending on how closely the candidate order respects the ranking; and so on.",
        "The integrating function tint simply adds up the critics' points, though Grosz et.",
        "al.",
        "allow that the critics' judgments may need to be variously weighted in some fashion.",
        "To my knowledge all current systems use an \"integration of specialists\" (henceforth IS) approach, though not always as explicitly as Grosz et al.; e.g. fins often is implicit in the order in which various specialized rules or preferences are tested in the clauses of a complex conditional.",
        "See e.g. van Lehn (1978), Woods (1978), Allen (1987), Hurum (1988), Moran (1988).",
        "(Note that the common categorization of IS systems does not deny the myriad differences of detail between systems; indeed the functional characterization is useful because it abstracts over these differences.)",
        "There is an alternative to IS.",
        "In what I will call \"hybridization,\" different factors are conjoined before any scope judgment is made.",
        "A system hybridized for lexical and syntactic factors has no lexical or syntactic specialists, but rather a single function, call it flex,„, whose input is the conjunction of lexical and syntactic factors in a sentence.",
        "Given an input with quantifiers ql and q2 and (relevant) syntactic features s j, sn, such a system computes",
        "The advantage of this is that scope intuitions can be recovered directly.",
        "Take the tendency for an embedded prepositional object to scope over a head NP.",
        "This tendency varies depending on the quantifiers involved, among other things.",
        "In e.g. Every man on some committee abstained, there is a preference for the embedded NP to assume wide scope, but in A man on many committees abstained, the preference seems reversed.",
        "A prepositional phrase (PP) specialist in an IS system will not know how the preference changes when a and many quantify the head and the embedded object; since it is a specialist, it does not consider lexical input.",
        "Rather, the system must turn to the lexical specialist, which for its part knows e.g. that a usually takes narrow scope, but not how the behavior of a and many varies with specific environments, such as embedded PP constructions.",
        "It is hard to see, then, how any integration of these specialists could prescribe a scoping of a over many in an embedded PP context, since both prefer the reverse scoping.",
        "(An additional ordering specialist may prefer the correct scoping but without ad hoc weighting, the integrated preference will still be incorrect.)",
        "But there is no problem in a hybrid system, because the values ficx_sy„(every, some, head-embedded-PP) and",
        "svn head-embedded-PP) are flex-, completely independent, as opposed to having a PP specialist in common, and can be specified however intuitions dictate.",
        "Scope judgments are based on all the lexical and syntactic factors present, rather than on each factor taken in abstraction from the others.",
        "My case for hybridization does not rely on counterexample, but on the fundamentally murky nature of IS.",
        "Consider an analogy.",
        "Suppose there is election data showing, for any pair of candidates and any state, the relative voting preference when the candidates ran in the state.",
        "How should we design a system to produce a preference given two candidates and a state?",
        "A natural approach would be to simply retrieve the datum based on the candidate and state input together.",
        "But on an IS approach, a \"candidate\" specialist would measure a tendency over all states of the relative performance of the two given candidates; a \"state\" specialist would measure a tendency over the relative performances of all candidates, taken pairwise, in the given state; then somehow the two measures would be integrated.",
        "The problem here is that whereas the desired datum is a simple, the computation is based on complex abstractions over much data other than the desired, relevant bit.",
        "That is the basic difficulty of an IS system, which the PP example was meant to illustrate.",
        "Though semantic and pragmatic factors also influence scope, they are not central to my current concern: the design of a \"base\" scoping unit which can be ported to different domains and adaptively extended, and which can be improved incrementally as bits of real-world knowledge are gradually added to the system (as with Grosz et.",
        "al.",
        "1987, Moran 1988, and Hurum 1988).",
        "Hence the focus on syntactic and lexical factors, which make up most of the domain-independent factors.",

        "Though eventually there will be translation to logical form, there is good reason for delaying this until after the scope determination.",
        "The problem with systems which translate a parse tree into an \"unscoped\" logical form as input to the scoping module (e.g. Hobbs and Shieber 1987) is that syntactic influences are not discernible to the module, since logical structure is not syntactic structure.",
        "For example, Every teacher who is at some high school joined the union and Every teacher at some high school joined the union have the same unscoped logical form: for Hobbs and Shieber, joined-union(<every t and (teacher(aat (t,<some h high-school(h)>))>).",
        "So the different syntactic influences are invisible.",
        "Though syntactic input can of course be added (e.g. Hurum 1988), doing so amounts to an admission that the translation was premature.",
        "It is more efficient to have the input to the module consist just of the parse, postponing the translation to logical form until after the scoping determination.",

        "Database PSM encodes a function fle„..syn defined for 26 quantifier elements, including 9 quantificational adverbs such as always, and 49 syntactic environments.",
        "There are three \"vertical\" environments - embedded PP, reduced and full relatives - and 46 \"horizontal\" environments, where a horizontal environment is defined by a combination of grammatical roles, voice, and/or various ordering relations.",
        "Defining the mapping from a conjunction of quantifier pair and environment to a prescribed scope order for the over 9000 mathematically and syntactically possible conjunctions admittedly is a daunting task.",
        "This may be the main reason to prefer an IS approach.",
        "But while the required research effort has been lengthy and tedious, it has paid dividends in a body of data (150 pages, described in the appendix of Chien 1992), which subsumes existing consensus on lexical and syntactic scoping influences while going deeper and beyond.",
        "However, the corpus is naturally subject to continual correction and extension, and while this upgrading can be accommodated, the process is not modular.",
        "It seems to me that this is the tradeoff for the hybrid's greater precision.",
        "Database implementation was motivated by the desire to make access to the large volume of data as efficient as possible.",
        "There are three levels of data objects.",
        "The first, top-level, object has slots corresponding to pairings of grammatical roles (subject, direct object, etc.",
        "; for their relevance to scope, see Ioup 1975).",
        "In each slot are pointers to several second-level objects, called \"rule groups''.",
        "In these, a \"conditions\" slot contains procedures which test for syntactic properties such as voice and linear ordering, and another slot contains pointers to third-level objects called \"rules\".",
        "In these, a conditions slot contains procedures to test for the lexical identity of a quantifier pair, and an \"actions\" slot contains procedures which effect a scope preference.",
        "Thus the latter procedures are invoked only after the collective syntactic and lexical properties of the input are verified.",
        "But checking the conditions in stages via the object hierarchy permits large aggregates of data to be eliminated from consideration at each stage.",

        "activated and its rules tested.",

        "To illustrate generalization by syntactic information alone, consider the verb objects in He sent a film each invoice: they appear to scope in order regardless of how they are quantified.",

        "There are problems with either alternative.",

        "The same is true for any new factors.",
        "My goal in this paper has been to show that syntactic and lexical factors are well-behaved enough that non-modularity restricted to these factors is a burden which however is bearable, and worth bearing.",
        "But if all factors including infinite complex meanings are hybridized, the problems become intractable.",
        "It would be perhaps impossible to determine even a large portion of the function flex_syn-sem-prag• And even if it were only excruciating but not impossible, the effort would have to be largely duplicated whenever the data was extended.",

        "To back away from this because it makes the engineering too hard may be understandable, but we should not forget the joke about the guy looking for lost keys where he knows they aren't because the light is better there.",
