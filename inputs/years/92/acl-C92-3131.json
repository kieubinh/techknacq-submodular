        "This research deals with the representation of causal relations found in texts written in natural language, in order for KALIPSOS [1], an NL-understanding and question-answering system, to encode causal information in conceptual graphs so as to handle causal information and reasoning.",
        "Natural languages such as French or English have many ways to express a causal relation.",
        "It can be syntactic (parce que/because) or lexical (provoquerlto produce), explicit or implicit (Je me StliS cassee la jambe et Je n'ai pas pu yenirl I broke my leg and I couldn't come), contained in a single sentence or extended over a whole paragraph.",
        "Being particularly interested in explicitly stated causal information, I have studied interpropositional relations introduced by parce quelbecause and puisquel since which are the more specifically causal conjunctions.",
        "My approach differs from previous work on causality which was either an attempt to define causal relations in logic ([2] [3] [4]) or the design of Al systems for planning and diagnosis [5].",
        "My research is based on natural language understanding.",
        "If one wants to retrieve and exploit causal information coded in NL-texts, a semantic analyser that builds an adequate representation of causal links is needed.",
        "The importance of this point has been underestimated.",
        "For KALIPSOS, Sawa's Conceptual Graph theory [6] has been taken as a target representation model; this model can be interpreted in logical terms, thus allowing deduction.",
        "Future research will use these interpretation rules and will exploit extralinguistic knowledge for automated reasoning.",
        "This subject is not addressed in this paper which focuses on the semantic analysis problem.",
        "Part I explains that the main difficulty in representing the semantics of parce quel because and puisquelsince is the anchoring of the causal relation.",
        "Parts II and III show how to deal with and represent this ambiguity on both syntactic and argumentative levels."

        "To begin with, it should be noted that this research has been done on the French language.",
        "The conjunction since, in English, raises other problems in addition to those raised by puisque in French, but they are not dealt with here.",
        "In this paper, since is never used to introduce a temporal relation.",
        "Because of lack of space, I have assumed that the reader is familiar with Sowa's Conceptual Graph model and notations [6].",
        "Traditionally, cause is viewed as a two-argument relation.",
        "In the CG-model the relation 'X has Y for cause\" can be represented as follows (the concepts are written in boxes and the relations in circles): --t-Allp IYI When studying such a relation three tasks have to be performed: the first and second arguments (resp.",
        "X and Y) have to be identified and the nature of the CAUSE relation has to be determined.",
        "1- Identifying the first argument of parce que/because and puisque/since relations is trivial because these conjunctions introduce a clearly defined subordinate clause.",
        "It would be much more difficult for conjunctions like en effetl actually, done/thus or alnsi/so, for instance.",
        "2- Determining the nature of the relation is more complex.",
        "A cause can be direct or indirect, essential or incidental, deliberate or accidental, several factors might be involved, and a cause may vary according to the point of view.",
        "But this question cannot be solved on purely semantic grounds.",
        "The conjunctions I have studied, in particular, and natural language, in general, do not make a systematic distinction between these types of causes.",
        "I assume that speakers and listeners either make do with a general, basic causal relation or use complementary information about the world.",
        "Therefore, in the KALIPSOS project, I have chosen not to raise this question during the text encoding phase but to solve it either during the pragmatic analysis or, if needed, during the question-answering phase (information retrieval process), using extralinguistic knowledge.",
        "AcrEs DE COLING-92, NANTEs, 23-28 Aoirr 1992 8 8 0 PRoc, OF COLING-92, NANTEs, AUG. 23-28, 1992 3 Identifying the second argument, however, raises difficulties.",
        "The question is to know where to anchor the causal relation in the main clause graph because this anchor may be ambiguous for two reasons.",
        "• Syntactic level",
        "Je veux que mon fill Tepouse parce qu'elle est riche.",
        "I want my son to many her because she is rich.",
        "This statement can be interpreted in two different ways depending on the context:",
        "This syntactic ambiguity will be analysed in more detail in the second part of this paper.",
        "• Argumentative level",
        "The statement Il a de la flevrel He has a fever can be considered from two points of view, as a fact or as the speaker's action.",
        "- Giving the cause of a statement considered as a fact produces an objective explanation as in: II a de la fievre parce gild est malade.",
        "He has a fever because he is sick.",
        "where the information 'he is sick' answers the question Pourquoi de la fievre71Why does he have a fever?",
        "- Giving the cause of a statement considered as a speaker's action produces a justification, implicating the speaker as in: II a de la Jlevre puisqu'il est tout rouge!",
        "He has a fever since he is flushed!",
        "where the information 'he is flushed' answers the question Pourquoi dis-tu gull a de la fievre?IWhy do you say he has a fever?",
        "The two interpretations differ with respect to the speaker's argumentation: either he explains a fact or he justifies himself.",
        "This argumentative ambiguity will be explained in the third part of this paper where I shall show how it can be represented in conceptual graph structures containing utterance type concepts.",
        "Please note that ''utterance\" is used in the sense of the act of uttering, not that which is uttered.",
        "II - Syntactic ambiguity when anchoring causal relations",
        "Except for the case where the conjunction follows a comma (which rules out the second syntactic analysis), I suggest that the statement is totally ambiguous and that it is impossible to choose between these interpretations on syntactic grounds.",
        "The parser must deliver two syntactic trees.",
        "The semantic analyser, however, must try to choose one reading only.",
        "There is no guaranteed determining factor but some clues may combine in favour of one or other interpretation.",
        "Three of these clues are shown below: coreference of pronouns, temporal correspondence and encyclopedic knowledge.",
        "Coreference of underlined pronouns favours the narrow scope interpretation for statement (2) and the broad scope one for statement (3).",
        "However, no interpretation is really ruled out.",
        "Although the definition of precise rules seems difficult and still has to be worked out, I think that this coreference is a factor in the cognitive process of natural disambiguation.",
        "Temporal correspondence It is useful to remember that an effect cannot precede its cause in time and that this temporal information can be computed.",
        "It depends on the choice of tenses, on the aspectual indications and on the situation characteristics given in the semantic definitions of the verbs.",
        "Several models of temporal representation using conceptual graphs have been designed and implemented [7].",
        "The semantic analyser can use this information to disambiguate a statement.",
        "Je pense gull a mange parce qu'll y a du fouillis.",
        "I think he has eaten because there is a mess.",
        "The tenses show that the mess comes after the action of eating.",
        "Therefore, the mess cannot be the cause of that action and the narrow scope interpretation is ruled out.",

        "I hope the weather will be nice because Franck is on vacation.",
        "Unless we accept a magic causality of meteorological phenomena, everyone knows that clouds do not depend on Frank's activity.",
        "This information rules out the narrow scope interpretation for the above statement.",
        "Common sense knowledge may be the most important factor of disambiguation.",
        "Soya's model has tools to encode this kind of knowledge but the relevant information, which is not semantic but pragmatic, must be defined in connection with a specific application.",
        "For statement (1) and similar statements the parser must deliver two different analyses.",

        "The above paraphrases show that statement (4) could be represented as follows:",
        "Several remarks can be made about the suggested representation.",
        "1- Fever is no longer considered as a cause of illness; it causes the speaker's declaration II est malade/He is sick.",

        "As a presupposed piece of information it cannot be stated; in the representation I have chosen it cannot be the theme of an utterance.",
        "3- The suggested representation shows that it is necessary to introduce a new type of concept (U) in order to represent the speech situation (which is not a proposition) and the related linguistic phenomena.",
        "I suggest that this type of concept will enhance the analysis of linguistic phenomena such as modality, temporal relations, reported speech, or any facts dealing with the circumstances surrounding an utterance.",
