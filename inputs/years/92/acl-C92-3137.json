        "One of the most significant characteristics of persuasive discourse is that it involves the expression of people's beliefs, desires, preferences, etc.",
        "These beliefs, desires, and preferences constitute a model of mental attitudes (or, an attitude model) which characterizes the mind of the speaker engaging in a persuasive discourse.",
        "An attitude model is important for figuring out what the speaker means; i.e., his speech intent.",
        "More specifically, often when the speaker expresses his beliefs, desires or preferences in persuasive discourse, he means to induce a reaction, in the forms of comparable mental attitudes, on the part of a hearer.",
        "For example, an expression of the speaker's belief can be intended to induce such an belief in the hearer.",
        "However, in general, inferring the speech intent through attitude model reasoning is complex.",
        "For instance, in our domain of persuasive discourse - advertisements - a major statement may be followed by minor statements, as demonstrated in the following passage.",
        "(1.1) Nabisco is great.",
        "(1.2) It is nutritious whole wheat, (1.3) low in cholesterol and saturated fat, (1.4) has plenty of fiber and vitamin.",
        "Arranged in this fashion, the expression of the speaker's preference in (1.1) - Nabisco is great - comes to be supported by statements (1.2) through (1.4).",
        "This makes the acceptance of (1.1) as the hearer's own much more compelling, intending to induce in the hearer the same preference expressed in (1.1).",
        "Although this explanation sounds intuitively simple and correct, the question remains: how do statements such as (1.2) to (1.4), which are on the surface, \"disjoint\" expressions of the speaker's belief, come to have a real psychological impact on the hearer?",
        "Some sort of reasoning must have been employed to bridge them with (1.1) and to produce the persuasive effects.",
        "Previously, model-based reasoning has been investigated for many tasks, such as belief ascription and metaphor understanding (Ballirn et al.",
        "1991), logical reasoning (Dinsmore 1987), and natural language understanding in general (Fauconnier 1985).",
        "One previous approach to attitude model reasoning concentrates exactly on issues of inferring speech intents.",
        "As discussed concisely in (Wilks and Bien 1979), the statement \"Frank is coming tomorrow\" can be interpreted in many ways, depending on the context.",
        "For instance, if the hearer believes that the speaker believes that Frank is hostile to the hearer, and the hearer has no personal knowledge about Frank, then this statement might be interpreted as a threat to the hearer.",
        "To account for different possible interpretations of statements like these, Wilks et al.",
        "propose an attitude percolation mechanism, in which a statement is pushed down to the frame of the system's belief to create the attitude context - the system's belief of the speaker's belief.",
        "Since in this more specific context, the following statements are simultaneously present': Frank comes tomorrow and Frank is hostile to the system.",
        "Thus, the system can infer that Frank may harm the system, which in turn, allows the system to interpret the original statement as a threat to itself.",
        "In our domain of advertisement persuasive discourse, much fewer facts are privately known compared to what are mutually known'.",
        "Therefore, it is argued 'If the system has personal knowledge otherwise about Frank, then this may affect the reasoning process.",
        "that the push down operation, which investigates into the personal knowledge about one another, will be limited.",
        "Instead, in this paper, a more relevant mechanism, called attitude emergence, is investigated.",
        "It is a more comprehensive treatment of attitude models, utilizing mutually known semantic and world knowledge to convey speech intent, as observed in the interpretation of our earlier example.",
        "More specifically, attitude models for statements are constructed, and assimilated through bridging inferences based on mutual knowledge, The semantic association resulting from assimilation then gets percolated up along attitude model contexts so that the proper interpretation of speech intent is recognized.",
        "This attitude emergence mechanism is being implemented in a system called BUYER, which understands food advertisements taken from Reader's Digest.",
        "A corpus of 120 advertisements has been collected.",
        "Part of the ads are used for constructing the system, while the rest of them are used to verify the generality of BITYER's knowledge base.",
        "In this paper, we present an example of BUYER processing one of these ads.",
        "The basic framework of attitude emergence As observed above, the recognition of speech intent in persuasive discourse is rather complex.",
        "Various sorts of mutual knowledge may be employed in bridging the statements and bringing out the speech intents.",
        "In (Wu and Lytinen 1991), we proposed a three-step procedure of attitude emergence: Step I: Construct the initial attitude model (or A-model).",
        "Step 2: Assimilate the successive statements coherently into one A-model (if possible) and recognize the semantic association between the models.",
        "Step 3: Percolate upwards along A-model context to effect attitude change due to the semantic association recognized in Step 2.",
        "A-models arc recursive structures of information with attitude contexts, each layer of which consists of an agent and an attitude he holds toward the deeper level information.",
        "A simple passage is analyzed in (Wu and Lytinen 1991), (2.1) Peter loves antique cars.",
        "(2.2) His favorite model is the laid Duryea.",
        "The evolution of A-models through this three-step procedure can be summarized as -follows: At the end of Step 1 (see Fig. 1), an A-model is constructed consisting of an attitude context â€¢ - (Report Speaker ...), which embeds another attitude context -- (Love Peter ...), which contains an object -- antique -cars.",
        "Note that, these linear formula arc just short bands for models.",
        "We take that in implementation, models are formula plus indexing and encapsulation, :vs the boxes it, Fig. 1 is intended to capture: the indices on agents are called S-bow, and on attitude/, A-boxes.",
        "Each attitude context creates its own environment for simulative, reasoning (Willa; and Hadley 1990),",
        "which involves only entities with comparable attitude status.",
        "In turn, simulative reasoning can produce results applicable to the attitude context where it takes place, and may sometimes affect related contexts, e.g., causing re-evaluation of the attitude in the embedding attitude contexts.",
        "Thus, in Step 2, while statement (2.2) is being assimilated with statement (2.1), some reasoning takes place marked as (A), (B) and (C) in Fig. 2.",
        "At point (A), an IS-A semantic relation is recognized between \"antique_cars\" and \"1887_Duryea\" in the semantic space which, as depicted as orthogonal to attitude space in Fig. 2, stores attitude-independent semantic information.",
        "In order to trigger emergence of more attitude related information, the recognition of the IS-A relation is percolated up along layers of attitude contexts to reach the (Report Speaker ...) context, where (B) and (C) occur.",
        "At points (B) and (C), statements (2.2) and (2.1) are found to be related; in particular, the (Report Speaker ...) context of (2.2) is calibrated to he \"evidential\" (to (2.1)), while, that of (2.1) to be \"supported\" (by (2.2)).",
        "That (B) and (C) occur is due to the following world knowledge (WK 1):",
        "If the speaker provides more detailed information about a claim (Y) in a statement (X) Then Y is \"supported\" by \"evidence\" X and becomes more believable As demonstrated by (A) (C), semantic association emerges from embedded attitude contexts to calibrate the attitude in higher contexts - i.e., how attitude emergence happens.",
        "In this simple example, the attitude emergence mechanism has involved, nonetheless, a large amount of knowledge.",
        "This knowledge is briefly reviewed below.",
        "Yet, more sophisticated reasoning is required to process real world ads (see below).",
        "First, there is knowledge concerning A-model construction based on the following mapping rules: (1) Sentence types to A-boxes, e.g., a declarative sentence type maps into a belief; (2) Attitude verbs to A-boxes, e.g., \"loves\" into a preference; (3) Evaluative predicates to A-boxes, e.g., \"favorite\" into a preference; (4) Adverbs to A-models, e.g., \"certainly\" into a belief; (5) Cue phrases to A-models, \"it is time that\" into a desire (recommendation).",
        "Secondly, there is knowledge concerning A-model assimilation and bridging inferences.",
        "For example, in passage (2), the expression \"his favorite model\" is resolved through the following three separate bridging inference steps:",
        "1.",
        "That \"his\" refers to things pertinent to Peter.",
        "2.",
        "That \"favorite\" is an evaluative predicate translated into a \"prefer\" attitude box.",
        "3.",
        "That cars have models.",
        "For step (1), a focusing mechanism is required to locate the S-box â€“ Peter, since a pronominal expression usually (but not always) refers to some object in the focus.",
        "For step (2), the A-model helps to guide the resolution further into the most relevant A-box; in other words, an A-model itself can serve as a marker to find the most relevant A-model earlier in the discourse.",
        "For step (3), a basic semantic association occurs to recognize possible semantic relations.",
        "In summary, the resolution of the expression \"his favorite model,\" and similarly for all other expressions, is achieved by bridging inferences which synthesize many knowledge sources, including focusing, A-models themselves, and semantic association.",
        "A real world example from BUYER.",
        "In this section, a real world advertisement is presented to demonstrate the application of attitude emergence in processing persuasive discourse.",
        "As discussed above, a simple version of A-model construction and assimilation has to be extended to include more general world knowledge.",
        "The following ad, which BUYER has processed, demonstrates this.",
        "The Folgers ad.",
        "SI.",
        "Is your decaffeinated a.s dark as ours?",
        "52.",
        "Start with one teaspoon of both.",
        "53.",
        "But just because the amounts are equal doesn't mean the results will be.",
        "54.",
        "Mountain Grown Folgers dark, sparkling Crystals are the difference.",
        "55.",
        "So dark and rich, shouldn't you switch?",
        "In the process of understanding this ad, the system has to figure out many things, for example: Is SI a question or a prompt for suggesting an action (for the hearer to perform)?",
        "Is S2, given the proper interpretation of SI, an order or a recommendation; Does 53 affect the status of the attitude expressed in Sl?",
        "and so on.",
        "In order to answer these questions concerning speech intents, the attitude model of each statement has to go through more involved calibration and enhancement than the simple version presented in the previous section.",
        "First, the reading of statement SI is ambiguous.",
        "It could mean that the speaker wants the hearer to inform him as to whether the hearer's decaffeinated is as dark as ours.",
        "Or, it can have another reading: the speaker wants the hearer to know whether the hearer's decaffeinated is as dark as ours.",
        "The latter reading is inferred by the following world knowledge (WK2)3: If the advertiser already knows everything about his products (which is reasonable to assume), Then a question concerning the product is actually an intention to inform.",
        "The two possible attitude models for the two readings of S1 are depicted in Fig. 3.",
        "Note that the two variables eland el' stand for the different events specified by (Inform-whether Hearer ...) and (Know-whether Hearer ...), respectively.",
        "The two events are indexed by their event types, as demonstrated by the ovals in the boxes in Fig. 3.",
        "Then, when 52 is processed, from its sentence type (imperative), it is inferred that its attitude context is compatible with both readings of SI, 3 For simplicity and readability, we represent BUYER's knowledge in this and following examples as English-like rules.",

        "SC: The speaker wants the hearer to do experiment Y to Know X.",
        "i.e., (Want Speaker (P Hearer ...)).",
        "Hence, the semantic association begins to emerge when the events e2, specified as \"start with one teaspoon of both,\" and el or el' (see Fig. 3) are being assimilated.",
        "The coherence reasoning component of BUYER (Wu and Lytinen 1990) is able to recognize the following Enable coherence relation: That the hearer starts with one teaspoon of both kinds of coffee can enable that he knows which coffee is better.",
        "That is, the action e2 suggested in S2 is an experiment to find out something.",
        "The choice between eland el' is now clear, clue to the following world knowledge (WK3): If an agent has a goal to find out something about X, Then he can perform an experiment with X.",
        "Since el' - (Know-whether Hearer ...) is acquired as a goal for the hearer according to Reading 2, el' and hence, Reading 2 is determined as the speech intent.",
        "Then, when 53 is processed, it logically means: It is not the case that Pr implies Qi where P1 stands for - the amounts are equal; (h. - the results are equal.",
        "The common sense logical reasoning employed in constructing the attitude model of 53 proceeds as follows: assume Pi is a fact/observation, should we assume Qr or Qi according PFI?",
        "If Q1 is assumed, then it produces: P1 implies Ch , which would be contradictory.",
        "So, the only alternative is to choose Q.",
        "The result is then the attitude model shown in Fig. 4.",
        "Following attitude percolation, the attitude model of Fig. 4 is pushed down into the one in Fig. 3 for Reading 2, creating the attitude context of (Want Speaker (Believe Hearer ...)).",
        "At this point, BUYER is able to reason that P1 -- the amounts are equal - is a fact, by resolving \"the amounts\" to \"the amounts of coffee used in e2.\" Given that the conditional PF1 has a satisfying antecedent, the consequent Q1, (or \"the results are not equal\") is derived as a fact.",
        "Note that, similar to how \"the amounts\" is resolved, \"the results\" would be resolved as \"the results in the experiments with the two coffees.\" Next, when S4 is processed, by pushing down and resolving \"the difference\" to \"the difference between the results in the experiment,\" it is recognized that S4 is supporting the implicit speech intent made in S3 - â€¢",
        "the speaker wants the hearer to believe that the results of the experiments are not equal.",
        "This is due to the following world knowledge (WK4): If the speaker gives the physical cause of a consequence statement, Then the consequence statement becomes more believable.",
        "Thus, the intended belief that the results are not equal is further enhanced.",
        "Finally, S5, like S3, is not a literal conditional statement.",
        "It logically means: P2 implies should?",
        "(-, Q2) where P2 is that Folgers is so dark and rich and Q2, switch to Folgers.",
        "However, the intended meaning is, obviously - switch to Folgers.",
        "The derivation hinges on the following \"dogma\" about \"abnormal vs. normal states\": (I) Unfamiliar external states may be abnormal; (2) If unknown external states are indeed abnormal, people query about them using \"should X?\"; (3) Abnormal states are to be corrected.",

        "In this sense, our approach is closer to those proposed in (Cohen 1987) and (Mann and Thompson 1988), while (Cohen 1987) considered only support relations and (Mann and Thompson 1988) remained as a descriptive theory, and both did not consider A-models as essential for inferring speech intent.",
