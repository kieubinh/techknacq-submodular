        "The current state of the art in natural language processing calls for components capable of sophisticated deep semantic analysis, modular representation of resources, and re-usability of those resources across different NLP applications.",
        "Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the sheer diversity of interactions between distinct kinds of linguistic information is guaranteed to defeat any staged approach to generation/understanding that successively maps between levels of representation [1].",
        "One strategy for addressing these problems is to stratify resources so that inter-stratal mappings are simplified.",
        "This is aimed at allowing high-level information to apply as early in analysis as possible at a minimal cost.",
        "A number of current processing architectures call for such a design.",
        "The stratification technique is also one way of ensuring modularity and improved re-usability.",
        "However, one important problem with almost all existing linguistic resources is that the inter-stratal mappings between, for example, strings and semantics, are anything but simple.",
        "This,is because the standard syntax-semantics-pragmatics modularization under-stratifies by imposing fewer distinctions than are necessary.",
        "Computational systemic-functional grammars [4] offer significant solutions to this deficiency by imposing a higher degree of stratification (cf.",
        "Section 3), thus keeping inter-stratal relations simple.",
        "SFGs have supported the construction of natural language generation components that are able to take highly abstract, purely semantic specifications as input and produce corresponding surface strings as output.",
        "Furthermore, the generation task has required extensive work on the more abstract strata: without a rich breadth of communicative goals, grammatical resources for expression cannot be satisfactorily constrained.",
        "Problematic with current computational instantiations of SFG, however, is that implementations have been directionally committed: the higher strata of information have not been available for constraining lower level analyses.",
        "This problem has been compounded by a further lack of detail at the lower, syntagmatic/constituency stratum in SFG.",

        "A combination of the two paradigms should enable us to fill gaps in the respective coverage of strata.",
        "Information-based grammars have already been presented using declarative representations such as feature structures.",
        "In this paper, we present a formalization of all the information to be found in the strata of computational SFG and their inter-stratal mappings in terms of feature structures also in order to initiate a combined description of the two paradigms.",
        "In particular, we will formalize SFG in terms of the Typed-Feature System (TFS) developed within the POLYGLOSS project at Stuttgart.",
        "TFS has previously been applied to the strata of the linguistic system addressed by HPSG and LFG.",
        "Here, we argue further that it is appropriate to adopt this representation for SFGs and the higher strata of the linguistic system that SFG proposes.",
        "The result of this inquiry is then to provide the basis for populating a highly-stratified processing architecture with maximally appropriate linguistic representations.",
        "Moreover, the higher levels of abstraction are rarely dealt with within a theory that talks about syntax.",
        "Rather, their treatment is left to a separate process using a separate representation language and a completely separate processing strategy.",
        "Our approach offers a solution to this problem as well by providing a unique framework to talk about (almost) all levels of linguistic information in a single formal language using a single processing scheme."

        "The objects used to represent linguistic information are typed feature terms, i.e., feature terms that have a type symbol associated with each node in the directed graph representing an ordinary feature term.",
        "A linguistic description consists of a set of feature type definitions which contain information about the placement of the feature term in the type hierarchy and about the set of well-formedness constraints that hold for this particular type.",
        "The feature type definitions define the well-formedness constraints for all representation levels, simultaneously specifying what constitutes a 'well-formed linguistic sign', i.e., an object containing all the information that can be collected about an utterance ---- be it analyzed (where the phonological form of the utterance is the input), or generated (where parts of the `content' of the complete description serves as the input); an example of such an object appears below in Figure 3.",
        "Given a partial description (a feature term with (possibly partial) type information) as input, the interpreter computes the set of most specific feature terms derivable from that term by first classifying the term according to the features it contains and their values, and subsequently recursively applying feature type definitions to all type symbols contained in the term.",
        "Only one operation is used: Rewriting based on unifying substitutions of feature terms.",
        "For full details of the formalism and its implementation see [6, 7].",
        "Since the TFS language is fundamentally a constraint-based language, and none of the operations involved is dependent on a particular order of, e.g., the availability of certain pieces of information, no directionality is involved in the constraint-solving process.",
        "Thus, a successful encoding of the information contained in a systemic grammar description in TFS will of necessity be strictly bidirectional.",

        "Furthermore, the analysis achieved with our experimental fragment supports the mapping from surface representation to deep semantic levels of representation that are far removed from the contingencies of surface syntax.",
        "These representations also preserve breadth, in that the semantic distinctions necessary for generation concerning 'pragmatic' information such as textual organization and interpersonal communicative goals are also recovered.",
        "It is especially important that all of these diverse levels have now been made accessible for analysis within a system where there is only one representational formalism and only one interpretational device operating on the representations.",
        "This paper has described and motivated the basis for a host of important further research questions, some of which we are now following up.",
        "For example, the fragment we have illustrated here is very small: the problem of handling large lattices needs to be addressed both on implementational and theoretical levels.",
        "A full specification of the grammar component of PENMAN alone as we describe it here would involve tens, possibly hundreds, of thousands of types: this needs to be supported by sufficiently powerful and robust implementations.",
        "But on the theoretical level, there are also further modularities within the SFG account that we have not yet utilized to constrain term explosions due to forming crossproducts across sublattices: two areas here clearly present themselves -- stronger modularization according to the paradigmatic/syntagmatic dimension and according to functional regions in the grammar [4], which already provide a meta-level of organization across sublattices that remains unused.",
        "A further area is a closer study of the similarities and differences between, e.g., the information of the SFG and the HPSG modules – it is to he expected that there is currently duplication which could be more effectively distributed, perhaps providing a more effective TFS translation.",
        "Finally, the availability of a representation of some systemic-functional grammars in a standard formalism should further facilitate comparison and evaluation of the grammatical description with respect to other current computational accounts of grammar: it should be more straightforward to identify the distinctive features and claims of the approach, thus opening the door to an easier exchange of information and analyses.",
        "Further, performing the TFS translation for the entire PENMAN grammar would provide an effective test of the TFS formalism (and its implementation) overall since there are no comparable grammars (i.e., paradigmatic feature based without a phrase structure skeleton) of this size available elsewhere."
