        "This article describes a project whose aim is to specify tools to be integrated in an environment for lexical analyses.",
        "As a result, a prototype of a workbench can be created which provides a user with several modules possessing different functions, in order to approach a text from different viewpoints.",
        "The prototype has been implemented on Macintosh.",
        "Every module can be used autonomously; once integrated in the environment they realize a sort of network of tools interacting with one another.",
        "Let us take a look at the single components of the system.",
        "Firstly, the user has at his disposal tools for the processing of a text in order to obtain indexes, concordances, lemmatizations and various types of statistic analyses.",
        "The prototype also supplies the representational tools for structuring knowledge.",
        "A module containing an ontological reference scheme may be used to show a network of relationships between concepts or to suggest the description of single concepts.",
        "The user is also given a further possibility: access, starting from any node in the ontological network, to a lexical archive indicating all the terms that describe a specific conceptual field, with their relative definitions.",
        "In this way, the system helps in the interactive treatment of texts and makes it possible to analyze and to organize various types of information about a text.",
        "The front-end and certain modules have been implemented by using HyperCardTM.",
        "This has certain consequences on the interface to the global system, and on the structure and function of any single component.",
        "In a hypermedia framework, a text is no more a sequence of words or sentences, as phenomenologically it appears to a user, but it is a virtual network of the associations implicit in it.",
        "In this way, the substance of a text coincides with the set of its possible readings: its informative content is a magma of fragments whose sense is recreated in the path of each reading.",
        "From a theoretical viewpoint, a hypertext denotes a non-linear writing whose structure is a set of nodes linked by arcs.",
        "Nodes contain informative contents, while arcs represent the possible associations between different informative contents, in accordance with the logic of the hypertext itself.",
        "To sum up, the organization of the different knowledge sources within the system facilitates the behaviour of a human operator working on a text from different viewpoints by using the computational metaphor of hypertexts as a means of presentation of data: he can consult a library of electronic books, generate and consult lexical archives and indexes of frequencies, and contextualize words representing the knowledge of a text, while using knowledge sources of different types as a control and a guide.",
        "The global architecture of the system is shown in figure 1."

        "The terminological part may be used for the definition of generic concepts, representing classes of objects, while the assertional part is used for the definition of individual concepts, representing single objects.",

        "Furthermore it is possible to indicate, by means of other generic concepts, the relationships that exist between the properties of the generic concept that we arc defining: these relationships are known as structural descriptions.",
        "The syntax of the terminology is shown in the following <terminology> ::= <generic declarations> ; <role declarations> ; <paraindividual declarations> ; <generic declarations> ::= (<generic identifier> = <generic>)* <role declarations> ::= (<role identifier> = <role>)* <paraindividual declarations> ::=",

        "The language is based on an intensional semantics, formally specified in Mazzeranghi (1991), and its constructors are interpreted on a universe of structured objects.",
        "In other words, the denotation of a generic concept is represented by its properties.",
        "It is thus suitable to account for complex processes involving properties of objects which are specific to the linguistic analysis of a text and, in particular, to the structuring of lexical knowledge.",
        "The expressive power of the language has been further increased in order to account for other conceptual facts, such as recursive definitions (father/mother) or definitions expressed by procedures (length, addition, subtraction) (Mazzeranghi, 1991).",
