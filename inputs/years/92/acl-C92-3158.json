        "During the past few years we have been concerned with developing models for the automatic planning and realization of report texts within technical sub-languages of English and French.",
        "Since 1987 we have been implementing Meaning–Text language models (MTMs) [6, 7] for the task of realizing sentences from semantic specifications that are output by a text planner.",
        "A relatively complete MTM implementation for English was tested in the domain of operating system audit summaries in the Gossip project of 1987-89 [3].",
        "At COLING-90 a report was given on the fully operational FoG system for generating marine forecasts in both English and French at weather centres in Eastern Canada [1].",
        "The work reported on here concerns the experimental generation of extended bilingual summaries of Canadian statistical data.",
        "Our first focus has been on labour force surveys (LFS), where an extensive corpus of published reports in each language is available for empirical study.",
        "The current LFS system has built on the experience of the two preceding systems, but goes beyond either of them 1.",
        "In contrast to FoG, but similar to Gossip, LFS uses a semantic net representation of sentences as input to the realization process.",
        "Like Gossip, LFS also makes use of theme/rheme constraints to help optimize lexical and syntactic choices during sentence realization.",
        "But in contrast to Gossip, which produced only English texts, LFS is bilingual, making use of the conceptual level of representation produced by the planner as an interlingua from which to derive the linguistic semantic representations for texts in the two languages independently.",
        "Hence the LFS interlingua is much \"deeper\" than FoG's deep-syntactic interlingua.",
        "This allows us to introduce certain semantic differences between English and French sentences that we observe in natural \"translation twin\" texts.",
        "'The LFS system is being developed by CoGenTex Inc. under contract 36902-0-0749/01-XAF with Communications Canada, Canadian Workplace Automation Research Centre.",
        "The first four authors have current academic affiliations with the University de Montreal.",
        "Polguere is now at the National University of Singapore.",
        "LFS is based on a much more detailed text planning process than was attempted earlier, and results in texts of much greater length and complexity.",
        "For example, sentence order within certain parts of statistical texts depends on data salience, therefore requiring locally dynamic text planning.",
        "Text planning also includes tests that allow for appropriate use of certain quantifier expressions (e.g., all, mosl), evaluative words such as also and only, and intra-sentential pronominalization.",
        "LFS also incorporates some substantial extensions in our use of the Meaning–Text framework.",
        "First, it makes more use of lexical functions (cf.[8]), the mechanism in MTMs that allows computation of appropriate collocations and semantically related lexemes needed in paraphrasing and in conflict resolution during generation.",
        "Second, the grammar is more extensive, covering important types of conjunction and ellipsis.",
        "Generation in the domain of employment statistics is not new.",
        "Roesner's Semtex system [10] produced German (and later, English) summaries of such data that are remarkably similar in style as well as content to our own.",
        "The difference lies in our use of a powerful linguistic model that promises to simplify the problem of scaling up the generator to more complex and varied texts, or extend them to other varieties of text.",
        "Furthermore, the LFS project is using feedback from domain experts to refine the rules used in both text planning and realization."

        "The instantiated tree gives a preliminary hierarchical structure for the future text, and provides a framework for further processing on the content to determine the details of text structure.",
        "For example, comparisons of employment changes in various labour force groups will lead to ordering messages (future clauses) so as to highlight the most significant changes.",
        "The tree structure is traversed and modified as a part of this process.",
        "The conceptual text tree also carries annotations of theme and rheme specifications which will constrain the set of possible texts which can be derived from it.",
        "An important part of text planning is the identification of messages which can be grouped together into structures which will give rise to single sentences.",
        "This includes conjoining two messages with identical theme to give marked structures that will produce linguistic conjunction and subject pronominalization later as in:",
        "(1) Employment increased by 20,000 among women while it decreased slightly among men.",
        "Conceptual conjunction includes checking and marking similarities in thematic elements that may later lead to ellipsis, as in (2), with the possible introduction of lexical functions such as in (3)2.",
        "(2) Employment increased by 5000 in Manitoba, by 10,000 in Alberta and by 15,000 in Ontario.",

        "It has been noticed [5] that certain types of report texts have complex internal dependencies that put special demands on the planning mechanism used.",
        "In particular, top-down expansion of rhetorical operators is inadequate for generating statistical reports in our domain.",
        "Our planning approach, by making use of the power of arbitrary tests and operations on tree schemata, allows us to adequately represent the cross-serial dependencies found among the pieces of content of these reports.",
        "However, a more general, but appropriately constrained language for report planning seems to be a desirable goal for future research.",

        "A comparable realizer for French has been built for LFS.",
        "As in the case of Gossip, we use four main linguistic levels of representation between conceptual structures and texts: semantic nets (SemR), deep syntactic dependency trees (DSyntR), surface syntactic dependency trees (SSyntR) and morphological strings (MorphR).",
        "For each language, the first linguistic operation requires searching the semantic net for a given sentence to determine the communicatively dominant node.",
        "This search is constrained by the theme/rheme specifications which the SemR inherits from the conceptual structure (see [9, 3]).",
        "The second operation consists of \"replacing\" single or complex (configurations of) meaning-bearing nodes in the semantic network by actual lexemes of the language, and replacing semantic features on those nodes by grammatical features which will be attached to the nodes of the future deep-syntactic tree.",

        "The production of the DSyntR tree out of the RSernR, called \"arborization\", entails the mapping of predicate-argument relations to deep syntactic relations using information about potential dominant nodes of the RSernR and grammatical features.",

        "Single DSyntR nodes corresponding to phrasemes (i.e., locutions) give rise to syntactic subtrees in SSyntR, and some grammatical lexemes are introduced, including auxiliary verbs, articles and syntactically motivated prepositions.",

        "Briefly stated, lexical functions (LFs) can be considered abstract meanings which have different lexical values depending on their argument lexemes.",
        "LFs provide a way of delaying some idiosyncratic lexical realizations until after major syntactic choices have been made.",
        "They also allow us to formulate very general paraphrase rules.",

        "A general paraphrase rule states that a verbal lexeme (here, decrease), can be paraphrased by a syntactic construction where the new verb (i.e., show) is the value of Oper1 operating on the nominalization (i.e., So) of the old verb.",
        "This computation, carried out by successively looking up LF values in argument word lexical entries, derives the new verb show by functional composition.",
        "In the derived paraphrase sentence (6) this new verb takes as its syntactic object the nominalization of the old verb.",
        "In a separate operation which if factored out of the paraphrase operation, the lexical value of the intensifier sharp is computed via the lexical function Magn operating on lexeme decrease.",
        "It is simpler to delay its evaluation until after the change in grammatical category of the head word.",
        "The paraphrase rule which relates the two verbal constructions of (5) and (6) can be stated using only lexical functions, lexical class (part-of-speech) symbols and grammatical relations, without reference to specific lexical items.",
        "In addition to the above \"well-known\" lexical functions, our domain also makes use of Syn (synonym), AntiMagn (diminutive modifier), Locj (locative preposition), Adv1 (locative adverb) and several more \"exotic\" ones.",
        "Most LFs used in our system are introduced during the mapping from RSemR to DSyntR.",
        "Exceptions include Syn, which is used during reduction of SemR to RSemR.",
