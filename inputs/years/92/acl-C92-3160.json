        "European languages contain thousands of what Maurice Gross calls \"frozen\" or \"compound words\" (Gross, 1986).",
        "In contrast to \"free forms\", frozen words - though being separable into several words and suffixes lack syntactic and/or semantic composition-ality.",
        "This 'lack of compositionality is apparent from lexical restrictions\" (at night, but: *at day, *at evening, etc.)",
        "as well as \"by the impossibility of inserting material that is a priori plausible\" (*at {coming, present, cold, dark} night) (Gross, 1986).",
        "Now, these kinds of co-occurrence restrictions (Harris, 1970) determine not only the concrete lexical composition of an individual compound word but also its spelling.",
        "Consider, as an example, the German noun \"Bezug\" which - like any other noun in German - starts with a capital letter and occurs as a free form e.g. in contexts like \"mit Bezug auf\" - such that its co-occurrents can vary freely.",
        "There is a single exception to this rule, namely the phrase \"in bezug auf\", which is entirely frozen, in the sense that it excludes any variation of its parts or structure, and which, by the same token, restricts the spelling of the noun to lower case.",
        "For examples like this we introduce the term \"frozen phrases\" as referring to (the subclass of) those frozen words that are compounds of several words.",
        "As Zimmermann (Zimmermann, 1987) points out for multi-words in general, frozen phrases are clearly out of scope of standard spelling correction systems due to the fact that these systems check for isolated words only and disregard the respective contexts.",
        "Yet, as Gross (Gross, 1986) indicates, at least the entirely and nearly entirely frozen forms can be recognized and compared with the help of simple string operations.",
        "Thus, these kinds of frozen phrases are accessible to the methods of classical automatic proofreading.",
        "Following Gross (Gross, 1986) and Zimmermann (Zimmermann, 1987), we propose to further extend standard spelling correction systems onto the level of frozen phrases by simply making them capable of treating more than a single word at a time.",
        "This implies that we arrive at a context-sensitive system.",
        "Focusing on individual co-occurrences (Harris, 1970), the proposed extension will he a conservative one, in the sense that it requires just widening the scope of the string matching/comparing operations that classically are used in spelling correction systems.",
        "No deep and time-consuming analysis, like parsing, is involved.",
        "Restricting the system that way makes our approach different from the one considered in (Wilton and Herz, 1991), where a context sensitive spelling verification is proposed to he done with the help of \"local constraints automata (LCAs)\" which process contextual constraints on the level of lexical or syntactic categories rather than on the basic level of strings.",
        "In fact, proofreading with LCAs rather amounts to genuine grammar checking and as such belongs to a different and higher level of language checking.",

      "text": [
        "The essential feature of the new level of automatic proofreading is that lexicalized co-occurrence restrictions determine the orthography of whole phrases beyond the scope of what can be accepted or rejected on the basis of isolated words alone.",
        "For German, these restrictions determine, among other things, whether or not certain forms (1) begin with an upper or lower case letter; (2) have to be separated by (2.1) blank, (2.2) hyphen, (2.3) or not at all; (3) combine with certain other forms; or even (4) influence punctuation.",
        "Examples are:",
        "(2.1) Es war bitter kalt.",
        "versus (2.3) Es war cin bitterkalter Tag.",
        "(2.2) Er liebt kh-Rornane.",

        "Like conventional spelling correction of isolated words, proofreading of frozen phrases is a lexicon-based process.",
        "However, while in conventional spelling correction \"referencing a dictionary of correctly spelled words\" (Frisch and Zamora, 1988) is standard, proofreading of the higher-level orthographic features mentioned in 2 above can be done on the basis of a lexicon that encodes the corresponding error patterns directly.",
        "Thus, each entry in the system lexicon is modelled as a quintuple <W,L,R,C,E> specifying an error pattern of a (multi-) word W for which a correction C will be proposed accompanied by an explanation E just in case a given match of W against some passage in the text under scrutiny differs significantly from C and the - possibly empty - left and right contexts I, and R of W also match the environment of W's counterpart in the text.",
        "Disregarding F for a moment, this is tantamount to saying that each such record is interpreted as a string rewriting rule"

        "replacing W (e.g.: Bezug) by C (e.g.: bezug) in the environment L. R (e.g.: in out).",
        "The form of these productions can best be characterized with an eye to the Chomsky hierarchy as unrestricted, since we can have any non-null number of symbols on the LEIS replaced by any number of symbols on the RHS, possibly by null (Partee et al., 1990).",
        "With an eye to semi-Thue or extended axiomatic systems one could say that a linearly ordered sequence of strings W, Cl, C2, ..., Cm is a derivation of Cm iff (1) W is a (faulty) string (in the text to be corrected) and (2) each Ci follows from the immediately preceding string by one of the productions listed in the lexicon (Partee et al., 1990).",
        "Thus, theoretically, a single mistake can be corrected by applying a whole sequence of productions, though in practice the default is clearly that a correction be done in a single derivational step, at least as long as the system is just operating on strings and not on additional non-terminal symbols.",
        "Occurrences of W, L, and R in a text are recognized by pattern matching techniques.",
        "An error pattern W ignores the particularly error-prone aspects upper/lower case and word separator (sec the examples in 2 above).",
        "It thus matches both the correct and incorrect spellings with respect to these features.",
        "Beside wildcards for characters, like \"*\", a pattern for W, L,, or R may contain also wildcards for words allowing, for example, the specification of a maximal distance of L or R with respect to W. Since the types of errors discussed here only occur within Acres DE COL1NG-92, NANres, 23-28 AOU 1992 1 0 3 0 PROC.",
        "or COL1NG-92, NANTES, Auu.",
        "23-28, 1992 sentences, such a distant match has to be restricted by the sentence boundaries.",
        "Thus, by having the system operate sentencewise, any left or right context is naturally restricted to he some string within the same sentence as W or to be a boundary of that sentence (e.g.: a punctuation mark).",
        "Any left or right context is either a positive or a negative one, i.e., its components are homogeneously either required or forbidden in order for the corresponding rule to fire.",
        "So far it has not been necessary to allow for mixed modes within a left or right context.",
        "In case a correction C is proposed to the user, additionally a message will be displayed to him identifying the reason why C is correct rather than W. Depending on the user's knowledge of the language under investigation, he can take this either as an opportunity to learn or rather as a help for deciding whether to finally accept or reject the proposal.",
        "There are two kinds of explanations, absolute and conditional ones.",
        "Whereas absolute rules indicate that the system has necessary and sufficient evidence for W's deviance, there clearly are cases where either W or C could be correct and this question cannot he decided on the basis of the system's lexical information alone.",
        "In these cases, a conditional or if-then explanation is given to the user offering a higher-level decision criterion which the system itself is unable to apply.",
        "Take, as an example, the sentence Dieser Film betrat kit und Jung.",
        "which clearly allows for two readings, one which renders \"Alt und June as the false spelling of the frozen phrase \"alt und jung\" meaning \"everybody\", and another one which takes \"Alt und Jung\" as the correct free form that literally designates the old and the young while excluding the middle-aged.",
        "Thus, substitutability by \"jedermann\" (i.e.: \"everybody\") would he an adequate decision criterion to convey to the user.",
        "In its present design, the system is based on the simplest possible working hypothesis, i.e. the assumption that the higher-level or cognitive errors in a sentence can be corrected independently.",
        "The intuition behind this assumption is that, normally, cognitive (or orthographical) errors are by far less frequent than ordinary motoric (or typographical) errors (for this distinction see Berkel and Smedt, 1990), and that, as a consequence of this, they occur within distinct contexts such that it is excluded that the correction of one error be conditional upon the correction of another.",
        "According to this assumption, each sentence of the text is processed only once in the following manner: The system reads from a plain text copy, T2, of the original formatted text, 'I' I, processes the errors on T2 one after the other, and finally writes the corresponding corrections to T1, without also writing them to T2.",
        "Now, an abstract counterexample to the working hypothesis can he construed quite easily: Given a sentence containing the sequence of errors ... WI W2 ... and given lexical rules",
        "rewriting (i.e. correcting) WI as Cl in any context, and W2 as C2 if preceeded by CI, then, clearly, the system will correct WI_ but will fail to correct W2.",
        "For the system to also correct W2, it must be able to take its previous Output into account again.",
        "That is, it should not only read from T2 but also write to it.",
        "lowever, to allow corrections to be written also to T2 would mean to stepwise introduce new contexts on T2.",
        "As a consequence, the system would have to redo the checking of the whole sentence each time a correction has been made, for this correction might well he a relevant context of some previously encountered expression.",
        "Thus, giving up the working hypothesis would result in having the system take multiple runs through one and the same sentence instead of a single run, and this, of course, would drastically reduce system performance.",
        "Fortunately, we have not yet come across any (significant amount of) data that would justify such a redesign of the system.",

        "OF COLING-92, NANTES, AuG. 23-28, 1992 However, since the data captured in the system's lexicon covers at present some 50 % of the relevant phenomena compared to the Duden (Berger 1985), the ultimate complexity of the system has to be regarded as an open and empirical question."

        "A first prototype of the system described above has been developed in C under UNIX within the ESPRIT II project 2315 \"Translator's Workbench\" (TWB) as one of several orthogonal modules checking basic as well as higher levels (like grammar and style; see (Thurmair, 1990) and (Winkelmann, 1990)) of various languages.",

        "This extended version has been combined with a conventional spelling verifier to form a single proofreader for the user.",
        "Internally, however, its hidden sub-modules are still totally independent from one another and process a sentence one after the other.",
        "Thus, it may happen that the checkers disturb each others results by proposing antagonistic corrections with respect to one and the same expression: Within the correct passage \"in bezug auf', for example, \"bezug\" will first he regarded as an error by the standard checker which then will propose to rewrite it as \"Bezug\".",
        "If the user accepts this proposal he will receive the exactly opposite advice by the frozen phrases checker.",
        "On the other hand, checking on different levels could nicely go hand in hand and produce synergetic effects: For, clearly, any context sensitive checking requires that the contexts themselves be correct and thus possibly have been corrected in a previous, possibly context free, step.",
        "The checking of a single word could in turn profit from contextual knowledge in narrowing down the number of correction alternatives to be proposed for a given error: While there may be some eight or nine plausible candidates as corrections of \"Bezjg\" when regarded in isolation, only one candidate, i.e. \"bezug\", is left when the context \"in auf' is taken into account.",
        "The same interdependence seems to exist with respect to higher levels of language checking.",
        "At least it can be argued that a grammar checker will profit from integration with a frozen phrases checker: For nothing but an expert for frozen phrases can verify the correctness of (idiomatic) expressions like \"ruhig Blut bewahren\" or \"auf gut Gluck\", and thus prevent a grammar checker from flagging the missing inflection of the adjective (\"ruing\" or \"gut\") in attributive position.",
        "Thus, there is a strong demand for arriving at a holistic solution for multilevel language checking rather than for just having various level experts particularistically hooked together in series.",

        "As concerns the German language, we have shown that there is a well-defined level of automatic proofreading in between the classical level of checking isolated words and the more advanced level of grammar checking.",
        "On the basis of work done by Zellig Harris (Harris, 1970) and Maurice Gross (Gross, 1986) we have identified this level as that of so-called \"frozen phrases\", and we have proposed and implemented an automatic proofreading system that covers a significant amount of the frozen phrases of German.",
        "We take it that a similar approach is feasible for languages other than German as well.",
        "Although in comparison with English, French, Italian, and Spanish, German seems to be unique as concerns co-occurrence restrictions for upper/lower case spellings in a large number of cases, there are at least, as indicated in (Gross, 1986), the thousands of compounds or frozen words in each of these languages which are clearly within reach for the methods discussed.",
        "In addition, the generalizability of our approach has received some confirmation from case studies carried out for English and Italian."
