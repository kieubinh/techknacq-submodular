        "The distinctive features of the system are as follows.",
        "(1) Japanese continuous speech input can be recognized with high accuracy.",
        "Moreover, speaker independent recognition using speaker adaptation technique has been developed.",
        "(2) Various expressions peculiar to spoken language can be accepted and translated properly into the target language.",
        "In Japanese, the style of spoken sentences is generally quite different from that of written texts.",
        "Spoken utterances are fragmentary and include the speaker's intention directly or indirectly.",

        "By referring to these rules, the recognizer predicts the next possible phones and verifies their existence by matching them with corresponding IIMMs.",

        "The next analysis component checks the validity of each hypothesis and selects the most plausible one*2).",
        "After analysis, some zero anaphora (noun phrase ellipses) are supplemented using pragmatics such as honorific expressions in Japanese.",
        "Then, the semantics of the sentence is output in the form of a feature structure.",
        "This feature structure is generally composed of two parts: an intentional content and a propositional content.",
        "The former indicates the speaker's intention and is expressed in terms of language-independent concepts.",
