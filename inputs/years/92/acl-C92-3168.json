        "Any expert system is only as good as the knowledge programmed into it; the same is true of a knowledge-based translation system.",
        "A KBMT system can only produce accurate, high-quality translations if it can unambiguously determine the meaning of the input text and choose an appropriate phrasing of that meaning in the target language.",
        "This implies a significant domain knowledge base in addition to the usual syntactic grammars, lexicons, etc.",
        "The question is, how much knowledge is enough?",
        "It is probably the case that the implementation of a world knowledge base sufficient to support knowledge-based translation in any domain of discourse is some years from realization.",
        "Nevertheless, there are significant practical problems in translation that can be solved with current knowledge-based technology, because they do not require general translation in all domains of discourse, In particular, we have explored the use of machine translation for multi-language output in a controlled authoring environment for technical documentation.",
        "Our goal has been to identify and develop the following:",
        "• Principled designs for source language texts that encour• Algorithms for knowledge-based interpretation of text that effectively disambiguate source language sentences; • A powerful yet efficient rule formalism for target text generation; • A combination of automatic and semi-automatic knowledge acquisition tools to streamline the creation of large-scale knowledge bases for translation in a particular application domain; • Techniques for the compilation of knowledge bases that support a clear, declarative style of input for the linguist/knowledge engineer and produce efficient runtime knowledge sources for translation; • A modular system architecture that allows extension to additional target languages without any change to existing knowledge.",
        "In this project note, we describe the development of these ideas in the KANT system, a knowledge-based interlingua translation system for multilingual document production.",
        "We believe that KANT is the first system to bring these ideas together in a system that provides fast, accurate, high-quality knowledge-based translation.",
        "A complete working prototype of the KANT architecture which translates to French, German, and Japanese has been demonstrated successfully, and KANT is currently being extended in a large-scale commercial application for document production in several languages."

        "There are two broad classes of restrictions which KANT places on the source text.",
        "The first concerns the vocabulary used by the author.",
        "The general (non-domain specific) words used in the source text are limited to a basic vocabulary of about 14,000 distinct word senses.",
        "The domain-specific technical terms are limited to a predefined vocabulary.",
        "The second restriction concerns the level of syntactic complexity present in the source text.",

        "23-28, 1992 difficulties in parsing, while still providing the author with a subset of English which is large enough to support authoring of clear, understandable technical prose.",
        "For example, KANT allows the use of subject-gap relative clauses with an explicit relative pronoun (e.g., \"Clean the ventilation slots which are located on the rear of the chassis\"), but does not allow reduced relative clauses.",
        "An example of a controlled input language text is shown in Figure 2.",
        "Previous attempts to define controlled input languages for translation have tried to reduce complexity by either limiting the vocabulary to a very small size or by limiting syntax to just a few constructions'.",
        "In contrast to systems which limit vocabulary to just a few thousand words, KANT allows a larger vocabulary to be represented in the lexicon.",
        "KANT also places principled grammatical limitations on the source text that are loose enough to allow a degree of stylistic variation which supports productive authoring, while controlling the complexity of the input in areas that are crucial for accurate translation."

        "Although it is possible to reduce ambiguity by limiting the use of certain kinds of phrases, some phrases which introduce a high level of ambiguity (such as prepositional phrases) cannot be ruled out.",
        "To resolve the ambiguity introduced by multiple possible phrase attachments, KANT uses an explicit domain model to narrow the set of potential interpretations (cf.",
        "Figure 1).",
        "For every phrase (such as verb phrase or noun phrase) that accepts a potentially ambiguous phrase attachment (such as a prepositional phrase), KANT constrains the set of allowable attached phrases to just those that meet the narrow semantic restrictions of the particular domain.",
        "The system's domain model is rich enough to allow all interpretations possible within the domain, but narrow enough to rule out irrelevant interpretations.",
        "The complexity of the domain model is only as deep as required to resolve ambiguity, which is the appropriate criterion for limiting the size of a domain model in a practical KBMT system.",
        "By constraining the set of possible syntactic structures and ruling out ambiguous interpretations, it is possible for KANT to assign a complete and accurate semantic representation to each input sentence.",
        "Although the creation of a comprehensive set of mapping rules requires intensive development, we have eliminated redundancy through structure-sharing and pre-compilation (Mitamura, 1989; Mitamura and Nyberg, 1990).",
        "Interpretation rules are organized into an inheritance hierarchy, so that general rules can be shared via inheritance; the hierarchy is then pre-compiled into cached structures for fast access at runtime.",
        "13 A Powerful Rule Formalism for Generation High-quality output in an Interlingua-based system presupposes a generation component that is powerful and flexible, 'For example, the Multinational Customized English used by XEROX Corporation (De Mauro and Russo, 1984) helped to decrease post-editing to the point where semi-automated translation became 5 times faster than manual translation.",

        "Figure 1).",
        "Each mapping rule is intended to apply to a single Interlingua concept, which may contain other Interlingua concepts as slot fillers; the Mapper uses a recursive-descent f-structure composition algorithm, which is discussed in (Nyberg et al., 1991).",
        "A mapping rule combines three types of information: a pattern slot, a context that must match the Interlingua concept to be mapped; a syn slot, a pointer to the lexical item to be used to realize the concept; and a map slot, which specifies how the embedded components of the Interlingua map to grammatical functions in the Target F-Structure.",

        "This architecture allows knowledge sources for different languages to be combined easily in new applications to support various source and target combinations.",
        "It is also the case that a modular design decreases development time, since it allows parallel development of knowledge bases for the source and target language(s).",
        "Each linguistic processing module in our system consists of a procedural and a declarative component, the procedural component capturing the general algorithm to be used, and the declarative component representing the specific knowledge required by that algorithm for a particular language.",

        "• Semantic Accuracy and Completeness.",

        "In a narrow technical domain, KANT achieves near-perfect semantic accuracy.",
        "Once all relevant domain knowledge has been acquired by the system, the Interpreter is able to disambiguate any potentially ambiguous structural attachments to remove spurious interpretations of the input.",
        "The Interpreter also discards any Interlingua representations which are not complete interpretations of the Source F-Structure.",
        "• Grammatical Accuracy.",
        "To achieve the objective of no post-editing, semantic accuracy by itself does not suffice.",
        "Accurate Interlingua representations cannot be produced unless the system has an adequate grasp of the source language syntax; nor can the system produce accurate target text from an accurate Interlingua unless it has adequate coverage of the target language syntax.",
        "In addition to purely semantic information, the Interlingua must also represent certain features of the input text, such as modality, aspect, discourse markers, etc.",
        "in order to generate grammatically accurate output texts.",
        "Our system uses explicit syntactic grammars, written in the LFG grammatical formalism, for the source language and target language(s).",
        "Our grammars include rules to handle both the basic sentential syntax of the language and discourse-level markers.",
        "• High Quality Output.",
        "To go beyond semantic and grammatical accuracy and produce stylistically correct output, a translation system must have a good grasp of the textual structure of the target language as well as its sentential syntax.",
        "This requires an explicit representation of textual relations between clauses and sentences, and the ability to select and produce complex sentence structures when appropriate.",
        "The mapping rules used by KANT's Mapper can not only select the correct single phrase for an Interlingua concept, but also create more complex syntactic constructions when appropriate.",
        "Thus the ability of the system to generate stylistically correct output is limited only by the amount of effort dedicated to the construction of mapping rules for the target language.",
