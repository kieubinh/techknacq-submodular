        "Much work has been done in both the formal aspects of situation theory and its use in natural language semantics (situation semantics), however so far little work has been done in its computational aspects.",
        "It is the eventual goal of the work presented here to show how situation theory can be used computationally and how a computational situation theoretic language can provide an environment in which different semantic theories can be easily compared.",
        "Because there are so many variants of ST we must define our own here.",
        "The language ASTL [3] has been defined.",
        "Although it uses surprisingly few features of situation theory, it seems powerful enough to act as a basic language for semantics.",
        "It has been considered that some extension to \"classical\" feature structures be made and use those to encode semantic forms.",
        "Features systems augmented with set values, cyclicity and other extensions may be powerful enough but the method described here takes an existing semantic theory and refines it rather than building a new one.",

        "The first discusses how ST can be used in a computational system, and introduces the language ASTL.",
