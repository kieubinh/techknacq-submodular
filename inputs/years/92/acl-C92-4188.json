        "One of the major bottlenecks for large-scale NLP applications such as the METAL® MT systeml is the acquisition of their lexicons2.",
        "Whereas the development and fine-tuning of the grammars of such systems reaches its saturation point after a few years of R&D, the extension of their lexicons is a constant and ever growing concern.",
        "In order to speed up the lexical acquisition process, coding tools are developed to increase the human lexicographer's productivity and existing electronic dictionaries are looked for that can be converted and integrated with the particular NLP application at hand.",
        "In this paper we report on a large-scale conversion effort with an eye to enhancing the METAL verb dictionaries with several thousands of entries.",
        "While the system is capable of defaulting the necessary morphological information for verbs on the basis of their surface appearance (cp.",
        "Adriaens & Lemmens 1990), it cannot automatically create the complex syntactic-semantic valency information, i.e. the quantitative and qualitative characterization of the arguments of a verb.",
        "Still, this information is of crucial importance for the system to parse and translate correctly.",
        "Valency characterizations can be used to discriminate different readings of a sentence during analysis (cp.",
        "e.g. the different usages of hail: it is hailing, she hailed curses at me, he hailed me from the window, the people hailed him king).",
        "Moreover, they are often useful for disambiguating purposes with an eye to translation: for Dutch, for",
        "instance, to reach for something is a usage that needs a different translation from to reach somebody something (pakken versus overhandigen).",
        "(For a detailed discussion of the importance of valency for NLP and MT in particular, we refer to Gebruers 1991.)",
        "To recognize the need for detailed valency descriptions in NLP applications is one thing, to acquire them is less self-evident.",
        "In a system like METAL, the valency feature on verbs represents the most complex and hard-to-code element in its lexical representations.",
        "Hence, to automate and speed up the acquisition process, we used electronic valency dictionaries for Dutch and French as coded by the PROTON project (see van den Eynde et al.",
        "1988, Eggermont & van den Eynde 1990, Eggermont et al.",
        "forthcoming) as our starting point.",
        "The conversion was a non-trivial exercise in computational lexicography for several reasons.",
        "First, the PROTON databases are mainly descriptive and exhaustive in nature; they were not conceived with particular NLP applications in mind.",
        "METAL, on the other hand, seeks parsimony for efficient computational treatment within a machine translation application.",
        "More in particular, PROTON codes one entry per valency frame of a verb, whereas METAL merges valency patterns into \"superframes\", storing these only once for each verb.",
        "Second, their representation formalism is based on a particular distributional linguistic approach (the Pronominal Approach, see 2.2) not completely alien to the METAL representation, but not straightforwardly convertible either.",
        "And third, the PROTON databases take the form of Prolog clauses, whereas METAL uses Lisp lists.",
        "Beside the purely practical goal of fast lexicon extension, there are a few interesting questions to be asked that may be relevant beyond that goal: - Is such a conversion worth the effort of defining a \"waterproof' mapping between the source and target formalisms, and of developing the programs to do the mapping?",
        "In other words, could we riot simply have coded the several thousand verbs by hand instead of spending months on the conversion?",
        "- To what extent are these conversion experiments useful for an attempt at defining a theory-neutral standard for the representation of valency information in verb dictionaries for NLP applications?",
        "Or, less ambitiously, can we come up with a set of requirements for convertibility of lexical resources?"

        "In linguistic terms, verbal valency can be characterized as lexically controlled structural potential of a verb; in artificial intelligence terms, one would say that the verb has a frame structure with different role slots to be filled by constituents in the sentence.",
        "Since the verb is often the nucleus of information around which the different sentential elements are organized, it is important for an NLP system to contain this valency information.",
        "What then are the aspects of representation one has to take into account, in particular with an eye to NLP applications?",
        "The first problem to he solved is what falls within the scope of the verb's valency (i.e. the number and kind of valency-bound elements) and what falls outside of it (i.e. the free adjuncts of the sentence).",
        "An answer to this question leads to a quantitative classification of verbs as monovalent (only one valency clement), bivalent (two) etc, and a qualitative classification of verbs as intransitive (subject, no object), trimsitive (subject and object), etc.",
        "Next, one faces the problem of the distinction between obligatory and optional valency-bound elements (a distinction that is of particular importance to a role assignment algorithm).",
        "And finally, one must name, categorize and subcategorize these elements, defining legal fillers for a certain slot.",
        "If a verb has several valencies (corresponding to different syntactic/semantic readings), an additional representational matter to be handled (at a higher level of lexicon organization) is the way to store the different valencies.",
        "Are patterns stored separately with a repetition of the verb for each pattern?",
        "Can patterns be collapsed and stored just once with the verb?",
        "Decisions on these matters influence the database organization and consultation for NLP applications.",
        "In the next two subsections, we will show how the two formalisms between which the conversion was made try to provide answers to the representation questions formulated here, in particular for large sets of French and Dutch verbs."

        "The Proton (Prolog en taalonderzoek, Prolog and linguistic research) project started in 1986 with as one of its major objectives the construction of on-line valency dictionaries for French and Dutch.",
        "The starting point was not a particular NLP application, but rather a linguistic concern for descriptive correctness and completeness.",
        "Still, computational concerns were present right from the start, which led to the choice of Prolog as the declarative language for storing and processing the verbs (with processing ranging from simple retrieval of specific subsets of verbs to NLP applications in computer-aided language learning and parsing).",
        "Paper dictionaries, both general (Lc Petit Robert for French, Van Dale Basiswoordenboek for Dutch) and valency dictionaries (Busse & Dubost 1983 for French) were used as background material.",

        "Although there are many interesting sides to this approach (e.g. the exact methodology followed to determine reading",
        "distinctions in verbs), we are mainly interested here in the actual output of the lexicographic work, both quantitatively and for representation issues.",
        "As far as numbers are concerned, the current status of the valency dictionaries of Dutch and French is the following.",
        "The Dutch valency dictionary contains about 4500 verbs; since each syntactic/semantic reading is coded separately, there arc actually about 6300 valency patterns coded.",
        "For French the two figures are 4(XX) and 85004.",
        "(Note, in the passing that the frame/verb ratio is 1.3 for Dutch and 2.1 for French.)",
        "A rough estimate of the effort spent in doing this coding is 2 man-years for French, 1 man-year for Dutch.",
        "The difference is mainly due to the fact that French was the first language Proton started out with; by the time Dutch was handled, coding experience and coding tools were available.",
        "Proton database entries are Prolog facts, consisting of a three-place v predicate; the three arguments are an identification number, the verb's infinitive, and a list structure containing the information related to one valency realization.",

        "For clarity's sake, we informally give the meaning of important abbreviated notions: p0 relates to the notion of subject, p1 to that of direct object, p2 to indirect object, p3 to a specific prepositional object with de (related to French en), pprep to other prepositional objects, plocipmannerlptemplpyt to adverbial of localionlinanneritimelquaniiiiy respectively.",
        "la general, it can he said that Proton valency entries are dense in information, but on the other hand somewhat loosely structured.",
        "We will sec below that NLP applications like Metal have a more rigid structure that is not so dense in information.",

        "Here, we will just give a general idea of the place of valency information in the Metal system and of how this information is used in the translation process.",
        "Valency patterns are stored as a feature-value pair on verbs in the monolingual dictionaries, in such a way that all patterns are coded only once with the verb; reading distinctions can give rise to different valency patterns, but even then they are all stored together with the verb.",
        "During analysis by an augmented context-free grammar (handled by a chart parser), rules at sentence level call a procedure for role assignment to the constituents of the sentence.",
        "This process is an intricate combination of general pattern matching algorithms and linguistically defined procedures (triggered by the valency information) for determining the best fitting valency pattern.",
        "In fact, the role assignment process can be said to consist of a grammar within the grammar, and a parser within the parser; it takes up a substantial proportion of the total time spent on sentence analysis.",
        "During transfer, valency information is again used (in the transfer dictionary) to disambiguate among different verb readings.",
        "For mapping into the target language, there are two approaches within Metal that have implications for the amount of valency-related information in the transfer dictionary.",
        "One approach tries to build a minimal hypothetical target language frame on the basis of the source role assignments and some crucial mapping information (e.g. for to like -> plaire, the subject is mapped into an indirect object, and the direct object becomes the subject: I like you -> Tu me plats).",
        "It then searches the monolingual target dictionary for a valency pattern that fits best with its hypothesis.",
        "The other approach tries to build the target frame without using the target dictionary at all: on the basis of the source role assignments and mapping information in the transfer dictionary, it builds the valency information for the target (see Gebruers 1991 for a detailed comparison of these approaches, with their advantages and disadvantages).",
        "In short, valency plays an important role in all phases of the translation process6, involving complicated grammar and coding work.",
        "We conclude this brief sketch of valency in Metal by adding some figures of the size of the monolingual dictionaries.",
        "At the time of the conversion (March 1990), Metal contained 1600 Dutch verbs with 2050 valency patterns (a frame/verb ratio of 1.3) and 1055 French verbs with 1600 patterns (a frame/verb ratio of 1.5).",
        "Let us add right away that partly thanks to the conversion effort we were able to increase these figures drastically in a short period of time (see section 4).",
        "Currently, there are 3000 Dutch verbs with 3700 valency patterns (frame/verb ratio = 1.2) and 2130 French verbs with 2850 valency patterns (frame/verb ratio = 1.3).",
        "In general, all other monolingual dictionaries of the commercially available systems (i.e. English, Spanish and German) also contain over 20(10 verbs (2500, 2300 and 4000 respectively).",
        "In METAL, valency is coded as one of the feature-value pairs on the lexicon entries for verbs (along with other information about morphology, syntax and semantics).",
        "Since the system is written in Lisp, its elements show the typical Lisp list structure.",
        "As for Proton, we have to refer to De Braekeleer 1991 for a full formal account of the METAL valency format; examples can be found in section 4.",
        "The meaning of some important abbreviations is the following: $SUBJ stands for subject, $DOBJ for direct object, $IOBJ for indirect object, $ADV for adverbial complement, $POBJ for prepositional object, $SCOMP for subject complement, and $OCOMP for object complement.",
        "N1, NO, IMPS and ADJ indicate nominal, sentential, impersonal and adjectival subcategorizations respectively.",
        "Adverbial complements are further divided into LOC (ative), MAN(ner), MOV(ement), R(a)NG(e), T(e)MP(oral) and MEA(sure).",
        "Further subcategorization information is rendered as feature-value pairs, e.g. (TYPE P1) roughly corresponds to +human role fillers.",
        "Metal further uses the \"OPT\" atom in its valency patterns to indicate the optional valency-bound elements.",
        "Obligatory elements come first, those following the \"OPT\" atom are optional.",
        "Finally, the valency pattern contains General Frame Tests (after the \"GFT\" atom).",
        "These tests are executed before the role assigning mechanism tries to find fillers; they concern features that if present at the clause level should have specific values: the auxiliary (values are II/Z, hebbenlzijn for Dutch; AlE avoirlétre for French) and the sentence's voice (VC; AIP, active/passive).",
        "It is interesting to note how in an application like Metal this kind of information (also present in the Proton descriptions) receives a special status with an eye to an efficient role assignment algorithm: if a valency pattern can be found not to apply because some restriction at the clause level is not satisfied, the pattern is discarded and no computation is wasted on checking die potential role fillers."

        "Ideally, the conversion should be a fully automatic process that takes the Proton database as input and delivers a Metal monolingual verb lexicon.",
        "Given that the Proton database also contains a field with several translations for each verb reading, we could even envisage creating transfer entries for the verbs as well.",
        "Yet, there are several reasons why we could only achieve a semi-automatic conversion.",
        "As to the automatic generation of transfer entries, this idea had to be abandoned altogether, because it was too hard to pinpoint the distinctive information among the different patterns and translate that into contextual tests and actions in the Metal transfer dictionaries.",
        "Still, the translation field was preserved in the conversion output, so that lexicographers coding the transfer entries already had the translations on-line.",
        "As to the fully automatic generation of a monolingual lexicon, several problems could not be overcome.",
        "First, we already noted in the previous section that not all information needed for Metal was present in the Proton database; this implies that manual checks for completeness of the frames had to be made in any case.",
        "Second (and most important), we could find no satisfactory algorithmic solution to the problem of mapping the one-entry one-valency-pattern organization of Proton into the one-entry all-patterns organization of Metal.",
        "Note that this is not a simple matter of collecting all the separately coded valency patterns for the same verb, and storing them once as a long list with the verb in the target database.",
        "For one thing, Metal does not need all possible valency patterns for its purpose of machine translation; the amount of patterns is kept as small as possible for efficient storage and computation reasons.",
        "Moreover, the patterns that remain are merged into \"superpatterns\" or \"superfrarnes\" as much as possible; where relevant for translation, the transfer dictionaries take them apart again.",
        "The way Metal lexicographers decide on distinguishing valency patterns (verb readings) monolingually proved hard to translate into a foolproof algorithm; there arc at the most some intuitions, heuristics or rules of thumb.",
        "Hence, it was decided to convert on a per pattern basis, and leave the merging of patterns to die human lexicographer.",
        "The conversion software itself is written in Common Lisp (about 1000 lines of code).",
        "It works in two phases.",
        "First, the Proton Prolog clauses pass through a finite-state transducer interpreting them as plain character strings.",
        "The output of this pass is \"lispified Prolog\": Prolog clauses are turned into Lisp lists.",
        "At the same time, the necessary conversions at the character level arc taken care of: characters that would have a special meaning to the \"Lisp reader\" software (such as a comma or a backquote) arc neutralized, and the extended ASCII-character sequences for accented characters arc turned into Metal's ISO-8859-1 characters.",
        "The second pass parses the lists and converts them into structures whose most important field is the Metal frame.",
        "Additional software takes care of putting the Metal frames in their canonical order (i.e. a subject is coded before an object, etc.",
        "), and provides tools for lexicographers to manipulate the conversion output.",

        "This already led to an improvement of the existing database.",
        "In the second place, additional verb coding is now being done on the basis of the conversion output, and not from scratch (i.e. from paper dictionaries).",
        "The total effort spent on developing the software (including the preliminary study phase constructing the mapping table) was about four man-months.",
        "When we compared the time needed to code Metal valency frames starting from scratch (the way the first 1000 verbs were added to the system) with the time needed to code frames starting from the output of the conversion, we found that on the whole, and subtracting the conversion development effort, coding productivity is speeded up by a factor of 2.",
        "In other words, the practical goal of fast extension of the verb dictionaries was certainly reached.",
        "As to the more general questions of requirements for convertibility of lexical resources or standardization of lexical information, a few remarks are in place.",
        "First, in our case the input lexical resource was in a fairly easily convertible format, viz. Prolog clauses.",
        "Even so, since it was the first time the Proton databases were used outside of the project, several ambiguities and inconsistencies were found that needed correction before the conversion could take place.",
        "A basic requirement for convertibility then seems to be a rigid description of the syntax and semantics of the database entries; before the resource is made available to the outside world, it should be checked thoroughly against its own specifications (parsers can be generated automatically on the basis of a BNF-like syntax).",
        "More ambitiously, if the formats of valency information in different applications were known, the resource could be made available along with converters or converter specifications.",
        "As to the long-term goal of standardization, we are planning to use the experiences gathered from the conversion (along with knowledge about other formalisms, like that used in EUROTRA or in the databases of the Nijmegen Centre for Lexical Information CELEX) to study the requirements for a theory-neutral and application-neutral standard for valency representation.",
        "Since valency is not restricted to verbs, but also concerns adjectives and nouns, the standard could even try to be category-neutral as well.",
        "Although the Proton-Metal conversion proved a successful experiment in computational lexicography, many linguistic and computational issues concerning valency and its processing have not been touched upon here and certainly need further research.",
        "To name but a few: nominal and adjectival valency, a foolproof methodology for making and/or merging reading distinctions, valency and idiomatic expressions, the interactions of the different types of valency information in an NLP application, and the link with more semantically oriented approaches to valency.",
        "On the basis of the availability of large amounts of valency data, and the experience with different formalisms, we hope to be able to tackle some of these issues in the future."
