        "With minor variations, Jacobson [1964] and Quirk et al. [1985, p438-74] classify adverbs semantically as: adverbs of time, manner, degree, location, direction, transition and hedges.",
        "Adverbs of time, for example, answer questions such as \"When?,\" \"How often?,\" \"How long?.\" Some examples of adverbs in this class are \"before,\" \"during,\" \"now,\" \"forever,\" \"seldom,\" etc.",
        "Adverbs of manner answer questions like \"How?\" and \"In what manner (way)?\" Examples are \"quickly,\" \"like,\" \"together,\" and \"without.\" Hedges indicate fuzzy restrictions such as \"essentially,\" \"sort of,\" and \"virtually\" [Lakoff, 1972].",
        "We have classified adverbs by systematically analyzing CED definitions.",
        "More details on this process can be found in Conlon et al., [1990] and Pin-Ngern [1990].",
        "These semantic classes are stored in our adverbial lexicon as in Table 1.",
        "The first line indicates that in CED, the adverb \"about\" with homograph number 1, sense number 2, and subsense number 1 belongs to the degree and lime class.",
        "(To facilitate exposition, the tables here and below are not normalized.)",
        "Huang [1975] provides a similar classification of adverbs based on semantic usage with verbs.",
        "These classes of adverbs include: State Qf Mind Adverbs.",
        "Adverbs in this group indicate a participant's state of mind.",
        "Examples are carefully and willingly in the following sentences: He carefully stepped into the room.",
        "Mary was willingly taken advantage of ... Evaluative Adverbs.",
        "These adverbs express an evaluation of the actor's participation in the event such as \"clumsily\" in \"He clumsily stepped on the snail.\" Adverbs Qf Result.",
        "These describe aspects of the result of an event such as the adverb \"correctly\" in the sentence \"He spelled the words correctly.\" Huang's classifications can also be incorporated into Table 1.",
        "These adverb classifications can be extremely useful to NLP systems, in particular, in the statement of selectional restrictions (or preferences).",
        "Huang describes a number of selectional restrictions between adverbs and other parts of speech.",
        "Some examples are: Adverbs of manner or direction can modify verbs of motion.",
        "Adverbs of result are proper to accomplishment and achievement verbs.",
        "Time and locative adverbs usually occur in action sentences and specify the temporal and spatial circumstances of the events.",
        "Degree adverbs express the degree or extent of a certain quality or state and presuppose an analysis of grading properties in the semantics of adjectives in particular.",
        "Conjunctive adverbs are used in almost the same way as conjunctions.",
        "This type of information should help text generation systems to select appropriate types of adverb to suit nouns, verbs, adjective, and adverbs which have already been chosen.",
        "It may also be useful for resolution of ambiguity in natural language understanding",

        "Adverbs that function as modifiers, in turn, can modify verbs (\"He spelled correctly\"), adjectives (\"They are very tall\"), other adverbs (\"He works extremely well\"), or even clauses and the whole sentences (\"Fortunately he was not drunk\").",

        "This same functional classification also allows Jackendoff to derive positions of adverbs by using parse trees.",
