        "In this paper an expert system is described which is called Lexicographer and which aims at supplying the user with diverse information about Russian words, including bibliographic information concerning individual lexical items.",
        "It is supposed that the system may be of use for a practical computational linguist and at the same time will serve as an instrument, of linguistic research.",
        "1 Lexical database and its advantages over traditional dictionaries In this paper we investigate general principles implemented in an expert system (called LEXICOGRAPHER), designed to supply the user with diverse, information about Russian words, cf. 121.",
        "The system is conceived as an aid both in the area of natural language processing and in the traditional lexicography.",
        "'11w system consists of two basic components: - Lexicon (containing some 13.000 most common words); - Bibliographical database.",
        "It is the Lexicon that is of primary concern in this paper.",
        "The idea was to present the Lexicon in a form of a lexical database (1,1)13).",
        "LIM is a vocabulary presented in a machine readable form and consisting of several do-mantes, as in a usual relational database.",
        "The user may got information about morphology, syntactic combinability and semantic features of individual lexical items.",
        "It is semantics that we concentrate upon in this paper.",
        "Many attempts have been made to use traditional dictionaries in order to assign word senses to general semantic categories, cf. [1].",
        "Our LDB contains semantic information that cannot be elicited from the existing dictionaries.",
        "The priority is given to semantic features influencing lexical or grammatical co-occurrence.",
        "In this paper possibilities are discussed of predicting selectional restrictions, syntactic features and other formal characteristics of the utterance - such as the array of arguments and their semantic interpretation, the meaning of an aspectual form of a verb etc., on the basis of semantic features of a word in the lexicon.",
        "The main advantage of a lexical database as compared with a traditional dictionary consists in the fact that a database makes it possible to present semantic information in a format enabling the computer to locate efficiently various types of information specified for a given class of words.",
        "To put it differently, the main advantage of a database consists in the possibility of compiling lists of words possessing a common feature or a set of features.",
        "There are three main principles that the system is based upon.",
        "1.",
        "We are convinced that semantic features of words determine co-occurence to a much greater extent than it is usually acknowledged.",
        "In other words, we claim that many aspects of syntactic subcategorization of lexical items are",
        "predictable from their meaning.",
        "2.",
        "A semantic feature of a word is essentially a semantic component (or components) in its lexicographic definition.",
        "3.",
        "A great amount of information about the meaning of a lexical unit; about its combina-tory possibilities; prosody; referential features; or about its regular ambiguity, need not be stored in the dictionary: this information belongs to what may be called a grammar of lexicon and should be formulated in a generalized form.",
        "In this form it can be stored in a Lexical Knowledge-Base of semantic and syntactic regularities.",
        "This Knowledge-Base has not yet been designed, but semantic features of words in LDB are conceived as an input for general rules that will be stored in this hypothetical Knowledge-Base.",
        "2 Lexical Database for Concrete Nouns There are different layers of lexicon that require specific formats of a database, and the choice of the format is one of the main problems of database formation.",
        "In what follows we list domains in the Lexical Database for Concrete Nouns - one of the components of Lexicographer, now implemented in a working program.",
        "Each domain is interpreted as a feature that can take a definite set of values.",
        "Domain I. Morphological and syntacticoAcres of COLING-92, IsborrEs, 23-28 AOCTF 1992 1 2 9 6 PROC.",
        "OF COLING-92, NiorrEs, AuG. 23-28, 1992 morphological information (taken from the grammatical dictionary [3]).",
        "This domain is subdivided into three do",
        "All the other domains contain semantic information.",
        "We do not mean that the system of semantic features would provide a word with an exhaustive lexicographic definition - this is not the appropriate task for a lexical database.",
        "The purpose of a database is to highlight those semantic aspects of a word that unite semantically cognate words and differentiate many of semantically different words from one another.",
        "In other words, lexical database is an instrument of predicting and calculating all sorts of useful semantic classes of words.",
        "Domains HO and 11.2 specify Mereological status of a word (more precisely, of a lexeme - namely, of a word taken in one of its lexical meanings).",
        "The values of the feature 11.1 may be: PART, SET or WHOLE.",
        "In the later case domain 11.2 is empty while in the first two cases it specifies the WHOLE for the PART and the ELEMENT for the SET: PART (SET) of what?",
        "E.g.,",
        "Domain 11.3 provides a lexeme with a taxonomic supercategory, SUIT] as Person, Plant, Animal, Metal, Building, Sphere of activity etc.",
        "This domain is of primary importance and it is this domain that defines the most interesting classes of concrete lexemes.",
        "The system of taxonomic categories has a hierarchical structure.",
        "Thus, the possibility is provided to state implicative dependencies between categories, so that the lower category inherits all the information from the category of a higher level.",
        "E.g., 7'-category (osobiljak 'private residence') = dom 'house': T-category ((tom) pus trojka 'building': 'I'-category (postrojka) soontzenie 'construction'.",
        "Thus, lexeme osolmjak will be assigned not only to the class of houses but also to the class of buildings and to the class of constructions.",
        "Domain 11.4 specifies a Predicate semantically connected with the noun in question.",
        "It turns out that such predicates occupy the most prominent place in lexicographic definitions of a great majority of concrete nouns.",
        "Usually these are predicates that determine a standard way in which the corresponding object is used",
        "Predicate (goblet) = to drink.",
        "There are also nouns that imply a non-functional predicate in their lexicographic definition - a predicate that determines its characteristic property, cf. Predicate (liquide) = to flow.",
        "Some nouns require predicates of both types, cf.",
        "Predicate (cellar) = 1) to store products; 2) digged under the floor of a house.",
        "For some classes of nouns Domain 1.4 Predicate is empty, e.g., for some (not all!)",
        "names of the so-called natural classes and for the names of parts of the corresponding objects, cf. krab 'crab': M-status I WHOLE Of what I - T-category animal Predicate I - Inclusion of predicates into a lexicographic definition of concrete nouns may be considered an attempt to fertilize theoretical lexicography with the ideas of frame semantics.",
        "Domain 11.5: Predicate may have a Restriction as for the range of possible taxonomic classes of its arguments, e.g. khishchnik 'beast of prey'"

        "Examples of this kind are abundant.",
