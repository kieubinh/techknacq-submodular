        "The MADCOW data collection effort, and systems developed with this data, made use of this revised relational database (Version 3.3).",
        "• The MADCOW data collection effort provided data from five sites (AT&T, BBN, CMU, MIT/LCS, and SRI), rather than the single ATIS data collection site (TI) used for the June 1990 and February 1991 tests.",
        "• Some (but not all) of the collecting sites provided secondary (Crown PCC-160) microphone data in addition to the primary (close- talking Sennheiser) microphone.",
        "The use of the secondary microphone data was encouraged, but not required, for the February 1992 tests.",
        "• The definition of \"Class D\" queries was broadened to include \"Class Dl\" queries.",
        "• The files indicating the \"classification\" (i.e., Class A, D or X) for each query were not provided along with the test queries (as they had been in previous tests), so 'that each site had no extra information regarding the context-dependency or answerability of each query.",
        "• Similarly, \"unanswerable\" (Class X) queries were not identified when the test material was released.",
        "If system developers provided answers for these queries, they were not scored.",
        "• No utterances were to be treated differently on the grounds of the presence of disfluencies such as false starts or restarts.",
        "In the February 1991 tests, these utterances were regarded as \"Optional\".",
        "• Concern had been expressed at the February 1991 meeting that some sites might have chosen to \"overgenerate\" (by providing verbose) NL and SLS answers rather than provide more succinct answers.",
        "It was argued that \"correct\" answers should have at",
        "least the information in the \".ref\" files previously used in scoring answers, but no more than in some specified maximal answer.",
        "Bob Moore and Eric Jackson, at SRI, proposed and implemented an algorithmic procedure for deriving maximal reference answers (\".rf2\") from the NLParse-generated SQL files used to generate the .ref files.",
        "Bill Fisher at NIST subsequently modified the NIST comparator (used in scoring the NL and SLS results) to implement the new \"minimum/maximum\" scoring procedure.",
        "The Principles of Interpretation document was modified to accommodate these changes.",
        "• Special reports were to be prepared by NIST to partition the tabulations of results according to the originating sites for the test data.",
        "• Following completion of each phase of scoring the results, NIST was to prepare and make available to all participants both detailed and summary reports via anonymous ftp.",
        "• Because there had been a recommendation to report results for all answerable queries in complete subject-scenarios (i.e., the material collected during one subject's working of one scenario), test material was to be provided to the testing sites in complete subject-scenarios.",
        "Emphasis was to be placed on analysis of the subset of \"answerable\" queries (i.e., Class A+D), rather than on the individual classes A and/or D. Further, the weighted error percentage (defined as twice the percentage of incorrect or \"false\" answers plus the percentage of \"No_Answer\" responses) was identified as preferable to the single-number \"Score\" reported at the February 1991 meeting (Score (%) = 100 (%) - [Weighted Error (%)])"

        "Several sites expressed interest in having results for additional systems included in NIST's \"official\" summary, although these results typically were not available at the required time for \"official\" scoring.",
        "At least one site took exception to an idiosyncratic property of the \"official\" comparator's treatment of their system's responses to several queries, and requested permission to present \"unofficial\" results at the meeting.",
        "Another site noted that they had identified a \"bug\" in their CAS-answer- format software, and after it was fixed, they also requested permission to report unofficial results.",
        "It was subsequently decided that the results submitted to NIST by the specified deadline, and uniformly scored at NIST with the \"official\" comparator and the adjudicated final set of reference answers would comprise the only \"official\" results, and that locally scored results should be represented as \"unofficial\", even if scored with the same scoring software and answer set as the \"official\" results.",
        "It should be noted that since the results are for locally implemented tests, and since NIST's role in the tests is principally one of selecting and distributing the test material, and implementing the scoring software and uniformly tabulating the results of the tests, the results are not to be construed or represented as endorsements of any systems or official findings on the part of NIST, DARPA or the U.S. Government.",
