        "We have analyzed three factors affecting user satisfaction and system performance using an SLS implemented in the ATIS domain.",
        "We have found that: (1) trade-offs between speed and accuracy have different implications for user satisfaction; (2) recognition performance improves over time, at least in part because of a reduction in sentence perplexity; and (3) hyperarticulation increases recognition errors, and while instructions can reduce this behavior, they do not result in improved recognition performance.",
        "We conclude that while users may adapt to some aspects of an SLS, certain types of user behavior may require technological solutions."

        "Data collection is a critical component of the DARPA Spoken Language Systems (SLS) program.",
        "Data are crucial not only for system training, development and evaluation, but also for analyses that can provide insight to guide future research and development.",
        "By observing users interacting with an SLS under different conditions, we can assess which issues may best be addressed by human factors and which will require technological solutions.",
        "System developers can benefit from considering not only initial use of an SLS, but also the experience of a user over time.",
        "Systems based on current technology work best when speech and language closely resemble the training data used to develop the system.",
        "However, there is considerable variability in the degree to which the speech and language of new users match that of the training data.",
        "The current paper examines the importance of this initial match.",
        "It is possible that users whose speech does not conform to the system may be able to adapt their behavior over time (e.g., Stem and Rudnicky [11]).",
        "In order to evaluate technology in terms of the demands of the application, we need to understand the extent and the nature of such adaptation and the conditions that affect it.",
        "Although system performance can be measured in a number of ways, in this paper, we focus on (1) self-reports of user satisfaction, and (2) recognition performance.",
        "Further studies could include additional measures.",
        "SRI has been collecting data in the air travel planning domain using a number of different systems (see Bly et al.",
        "[1]; Kowtko and Price [5]).",
        "In moving from wizard-based data collection to the use of SRI's SLS, we observed changes in user behavior that were associated with system errors.",
        "Some of these behaviors were adaptive; for example, learning to avoid out-of-vocabulary words or unusual syntax should facilitate successful interaction.",
        "Other behaviors, however, were non-adaptive and could actually impede the interaction.",
        "For example, speaking more loudly or in a hyperarticulate style may be detrimental to system performance insofar as these styles differ from those observed in training material dominated by wizard-mediated data in which system errors are minimal.",
        "It is difficult to predict how well an SLS will need to perform in order to be acceptable to users.",
        "Both speed and accuracy are crucial to system acceptability; we have therefore collected data using versions of the system that prioritize one of these parameters at the expense of the other.",
        "The present study first addresses the issue of user satisfaction with different levels of system speed and accuracy and then focuses on an example of an adaptive behavior and another that is maladaptive.",
        "These behaviors represent a subset of potential factors influencing human-machine interaction.",
        "Because these issues are not restricted to any particular system, they should be of general interest to developers of SLS technology.",
        "In the first study, we compared three points in the speed-accuracy space for this application: (1) an extremely slow but very accurate wizard-mediated system (described in Bly et al.",
        "[1]) with a 2-3 minute response time and a minimal error rate; (2) a software version of the DECIPHER recognizer with a response time of several times real time and a fairly low word error rate; and (3) a version of the DECIPHER recognizer implemented in special-purpose hardware using older word models, which has a very fast response time but currently has a higher word error rate.",
        "We compared user satisfaction based on responses to a post-session questionnaire.",
        "The second study investigated the effect of user experience on syntax and word choice.",
        "We hypothesized that one way users might adapt would be to conform to the language models constraining recognition.",
        "We therefore measured recognition performance in subjects' first and second scenarios, and compared sentence perplexities in order to determine whether any changes in recognition performance could be attributed to a change in perplexity.",
        "The third study examined the effect of hyperarticulate speech on recognition and tested whether instructions to users could reduce this potentially maladaptive behavior.",
        "We coded each utterance for hyperarticulation and compared recognizer performance for normal and hyperarticulate utterances.",
        "We also compared rates of hyperarticulation for subjects who were either given or not given the instructions."

        "higher went from an average of 31.3% errors down to 19.6%, while subjects with initially lower error rates showed no statistically significant change.",
        "For those subjects who did improve recognition performance, the improvement could only be due to user adaptation, since the same SLS version was used for both scenarios.",
        "The improvement in recognition may be due in part to user adaptation to the language models used.",
        "As a measure of deviation from the system's language models, we used test-set perplexity, which was based on the bigram probabilities of the observed word sequences.",
        "As would be expected, there was a significant, positive average correlation between utterance word error and perplexity: mean r = .28, t = 4.55, p < .001.",
        "Thus, one way for subjects to improve recognition accuracy would be to change their language to conform to that of the system model.",
        "Perplexity may therefore play a role in the decrease in recognition error rates observed over time for those subjects who had an error rate of 20% or worse in their first scenario.",
        "For this group of subjects, there was a tendency to produce queries with lower sentence perplexity in the second scenario (Figure 3).",

        "Another potential source of recognition errors arises when the speech of the user deviates from the acoustic models of the system.",
        "Since the vast majority of the data used to train the DECIPHER recognizer came from wizard-mediated data collection [6], where recognition performance was nearly perfect, examples of \"frustrated\" speech were rare.",
        "In human-human interaction, when an addressee (such as a foreigner) has difficulty understanding, speakers change their speech style to enunciate more clearly than usual (Ferguson [3]).",
        "We suspected that a similar effect might occur for people speaking to a machine that displayed feedback showing less than perfect understanding.",
        "We noticed that, when using an SLS as opposed to a wizard-mediated system, subjects tended to hyperarticulate: releasing stops, emphasizing initial word segments, pausing between words, and increasing vocal effort.",
        "Although hyperarticulation is a multifaceted behavior, it was nevertheless possible to make global judgments about individual utterances.",
        "Hyperarticulation was coded for each utterance on a three-point scale by listening to the utterances.",
        "Utterances were coded as (1) clearly natural sounding, (2) strongly hyperarticulated, or (3) somewhat hyperarticulated.",
        "The coding was done blindly without reference to session context or system performance.",
        "Using a within-subjects design, so that any differences in recognition performance could be attributed to a change in speech style, rather than speaker effects, we analyzed the speech style of 24 subjects' first scenarios (future analyses will also examine repeat scenarios).",
        "These subjects (of whom 20 were also included in the previous analysis of user experience) all used the hardware system.",
        "The subjects averaged about 10 natural sounding, 4 somewhat hyperarticulate, and 5 strongly hyperarticulate utterances each.",
        "For the 13 subjects who had at least three natural and three strongly hyperarticulated utterances, we compared recognition performance within subjects and found that the strongly hyperarticulate utterances resulted in higher word error rates, F(1,12) = 5.19, p < .05.",
        "Hyperarticulation was reduced, however, by giving users instructions not to \"overenunciate\" and by explaining that the system was trained on \"normal\" speech.",
        "We calculated a hyperarticulation score for each subject by weighting \"strongly hyperarticulated\" utterances as 1, \"somewhat hyperarticulated\" utterances as 0.5, and \"nonhyperarticulated\" utterances as 0, and taking the mean weight across all utterances in the scenario.",
        "The 12 subjects who heard the instructions (the \"instruction group\") had lower mean hyperarticulation scores, 0.22 as compared with 0.60 for the 12 subjects who received no special instructions (the \"no instruction group\"), a significant difference F(1,22) = 11.97, p < .01.",
        "Given that the instruction group had significantly fewer hyperarticulated utterances, and given that hyperarticulation is associated with lower recognition accuracy, we would expect the instruction group to have better recognition performance overall.",
        "However, although the trend was in that direction (18.1% word error for the instruction group versus 22.5% for the no-instruction group.",
        "), the difference was not reliable.",
        "One possible explanation is a lack of power in the analysis, as a result of the small number of subjects and large individual differences in error rates.",
        "A second, not necessarily conflicting explanation is that the subjects given the instructions to \"speak naturally\" used somewhat less planned and less formal speech.",
        "We noticed that these subjects tended to have more spontaneous speech effects, such as verbal deletions, word fragments, lengthen-ings and filled pauses.",
        "Overall, spontaneous speech effects occurred in 15% of the 232 utterances for the instruction group, compared with 10% for the 229 utterances for the no-instruction group.",
        "Although these baseline rates are low, they may nevertheless have contributed to poorer recognition rates (see Butzberger et al.",

        "We have examined the effect of user experience on recognition performance and found a decrease in word error rate over repeated scenarios.",
        "Adaptation was relatively greater for those subjects who had more than 20% errors on the first scenario.",
        "The decrease in errors could be attributed at least in part to a decrease in sentence perplexity and to a reduction in the use of out-of-vocabulary words.",
        "We have also shown a significant relationship between word error rates and hyperarticulation, a speech style that occurs relatively frequently with an imperfect recognizer.",
        "We have shown that instructions not to hyperarticulate reduced this maladaptive speech style, but that instructions did not result in improved recognition performance overall.",
        "Our studies have shown that along some dimensions, humans are flexible and can adapt in ways that improve system performance.",
        "However, hyperarticulation may be a maladaptive behavior for which a technological solution should be investigated.",
        "In particular we have found that strategies people use to try to improve normal human communication (e.g., hyperarticulation) can have the reverse effect in the context of our current models.",
        "While hyperarticulation is an \"exaggerated\" speech style that might improve comprehension for humans, it can cause poor recognition for automatic systems in which \"exaggeration\" is not adequately modeled."
