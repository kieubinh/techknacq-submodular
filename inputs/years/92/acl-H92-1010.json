        "The Human-Machine Communication Department conducts research in closely related areas: Speech, Language, Vision and other means of communication between humans and machines.",
        "These areas use common methodologies and, having them studied in the same laboratory, allows for an in-depth study of the different communication modes, which, we believe, is mandatory for the development of multimodal communication systems.",
        "The research activities are multidisciplinary, and deal with Computer Science, Linguistics, Cognitive Psychology and Neuro-Sciences, and have both theoretical and applied aspects.",
        "The communication process is studied as a triplet Perception - Production - Cognition: Perception by the machine of speech (that could be enlarged to any sound), of vision (with reading as a subpart), of touch or gesture; Production of speech or text, image synthesis (that could be enlarged to Solid Modeling); And all the cognitive aspects related to dialogue, reasoning, knowledge representation and integration of different communication modes.",
        "We try as much as possible to link the studies of production and perception (i.e. the emission and reception of information), as it can be observed in speech recognition and synthesis, text analysis and generation, scene analysis and image synthesis, movement sensing and effort feedback.",
        "The relationship between Language and Image processing is becoming more and more important, with the concept of \"Intelligent Images\", where the different parts of the image are in agreement with their mutual constraints, and with the constraints of the real physical world (Newton Law of gravity, phenomena which occurs in an explosion ...).",
        "Those images need advanced Human-Machine Communication, as the task is complex with commands like \"Put the ball on the table and make it bounce back\".",
        "This opens the perspective of a true multimodal communication system, including oral, written, visual and gestual communication, with the typical problems of multireference processing (like a voice message accompanied by a gesture).",
        "It can even be thought that processing multiple communication modes simultaneously is mandatory for each of the modes, as it is a necessity for knowledge acquisition in training within self-organizing approaches.",

        "The Speech Communication group produced very early a Text-to-Speech standalone synthesis system in French (Ico-phone).",
        "The Icophone V system was marketed in 1975 (and appeared in Electronics, June 1975) by the TITN company, and a single unit of this one cubic meter TTS system was sold (to the Iranian Minister of Education...) at that time.",
        "The TTS system used a battery of 44 analog oscillators to produce diphone-based synthesis (using 427 diphones).",
        "In 1980, it was replaced by a single board digital version, Icolog, which is marketed by the Vecsys company.",
        "The grapheme-to-phoneme conversion algorithm uses about 1,000 rules.",
        "It has to take into account the difficult problem of liaisons between words in French.",
        "Another early application was formant synthesis with a first synthesizer designed in 1975 (Icophone VI).",
        "A parallel formant synthesizer based on segmental rules is now being developed in the framework of the CEC/Esprit Polyglot project, and should be adapted for 7 different languages within the consortium.",
        "Together with the Text-to-Speech effort, research was conducted on segmentation of continuous speech into phonemes and speech recognition.",
        "An analog speech segmentator, using a 32 analog filters bank was presented in 1974 (J.S.",
        "Lienard et al., 1974).",
        "The speech recognition work addressed both analytical phoneme recognition, in the design of a \"Speech Understanding System\" comparable to those developed in the ARPA-SUR project (J. Mariani et al., 1978), and word-based recognition.",
        "The first approach was also aimed at designing a \"phoneme vocoder\", with a 50 b/s rate.",
        "The experiments conducted in this project showed that a phoneme recognition rate of at least 85%, with no major recognition errors (like vowel/consonant substitutions), was necessary in order to transmit a message that can be understood by the human listener (J.S.",
        "Lienard et al., 1977).",
        "The word-based approach took advantage of the idea that the stationary parts of the signal convey less, and more variable information than transition parts (J.L.",
        "Gauvain, J. Mariani, J.S.",
        "Lienard, 1983).",
        "This led us to non-linear fixed-length compression for isolated word recognition (Moise system in 1980), and non-linear variable-length compression for connected word recognition (Mozart system in 1982) (J.L.",
        "Gauvain, J. Mariani, 1982).",
        "Both systems used template matching via dynamic programming.",
        "Both systems resulted in single-board products which were marketed by the Vecsys company.",
        "Theses systems were the first IWR and CWR systems made in France and have been used in several applications, like Voice-activated telephone dialing (Jeumont-Schneider, 1985), or packet sorting (NMPP, 1983).",
        "Most of these applications provided the opportunity for experimenting with voice input as a new communication means, and the market stayed limited to a few units.",
        "The application where most efforts have been devoted was pilot-plane dialog.",
        "In collaboration with the Crouzet company, a program was conducted for the \"Research and Technology Agency\" (Dret) of the French DoD.",
        "A flight with an IWR voice command system with actual commands to the plane was made in July 1982, and was reported as the first voice-controlled flight.",
        "The conclusions of the flight trials specified the need of continuous speech recognition, the necessity of a stable level of performances, whoever the pilot, and that voice input was especially interesting in critical conditions (high Gs, stress), which unfortunately correspond to adverse environments which tend to lower the recognition rates.",
        "The computing power needed for the Dynamic Programming algorithm led us to develop an Asic chip.",
        "The MuPCD (Microprocessor for Dynamic Programming) was developed at Limsi, together with the Bull company on a contract of the Ministry of Telecommunications.",
        "It was available in 1989 (G. Quenot et al., 1989).",
        "It has 120,000 transistors in Cmos 2 micron technology, and a power of 70 MOPS.",
        "It allows for the recognition of up to 5,000 isolated words, or 300 connected words.",
        "This chip is used in the last generation of Vecsys Datavox recognition systems.",
        "The work on Language modeling was also an early project at LIMSI.",
        "It started with a set of experiments on the problem of phoneme-to-grapheme conversion in French.",
        "A casual 9 phoneme string can generate more than 32,000 possible combinations of segmentation into words, and spelling of those words.",
        "In many cases, the absence of pronunciation of the mark of the plural (-s at the end of the nouns, -nt at the end of verbs), generates many of those homophones.",
        "First, a simple heuristic was tried with a 20,000 word lexicon which segmented the phoneme string into the smallest number of words.",
        "It gave good results for the segmentation task, but also demonstrated the necessity of using a language model to improve the quality.",
        "This resulted in a collaboration with researchers using stochastic language modeling based on grammatical categories for document retrieval, and results were reported in 1979 on phoneme-to-grapheme conversion with a 270,000 word full-form lexicon (A. Andreewski et al., 1979).",
        "This approach was also applied to stenotype-to-grapheme conversion.",
        "Another area of research is speaker verification (J. Mariani et al., 1983).",
        "The algorithm used for word-based recognition was adapted to speaker verification, with dynamic adaptation of the reference templates of the speaker to their daily variations.",
        "The Sesame system was tested \"live\" at the Machines Parlantes exhibition in 1985, and had an impostor acceptance of 4 per 1000 obtained with informal test conditions.",

        "Continuing the study on phoneme-to-grapheme conversion, for continuous, error-free phonemic strings, using a large vocabulary and a natural language syntax, LIMSI participated in the ESPRIT project 860 \"Linguistic Analysis of the European Languages\".",
        "In this framework, the approach for language modeling developed at LIMSI has been extended to 7 European languages.",
        "The link between the language model and the acoustic recognition was made, and resulted in a complete system (Hamlet), for a limited vocabulary (2,000 words), pronounced in isolation, and then to a 5,000 word VAT system taking advantage of the existence of the specialized MuPCD DTW chip.",

        "The dialog project has been explored within the framework of the application of air-controller training.",
        "Currently, the training sessions are limited by the availability of the human instructor who plays the role of a pilot.",
        "Our goal is to replace him by a spoken dialog system.",
        "This allows for more availability of the system, and also to have several voices corresponding to different pilots in the synthesis module.",
        "In this project, speech understanding uses speech recognition in conjunction with a representation of the semantic and pragmatic knowledge related to the task.",
        "While the language is supposed to follow a predefined \"phraseology\", it is not the case most of the time.",
        "The language model is a bigram model based on grammatical categories.",
        "The",
        "probabilities for word successions are changed depending on the previous step in the dialog (prediction), and corrections of the recognized sentence can be made, using redundancy within the sentence, and a word confusion matrix.",
        "An evaluation test involving 6 speakers, and 5 scripts of an average of 20 sentences each, prediction improved the results by 10%, and correction added an extra 18.5% (the sentence understanding rate improved from 68% to 96.5%) (A. Matrouf et al., 1991).",
        "Prior to this work, large \"Wizard of Oz\" experiments were conducted (D. Luzzati, 1984), and the linguistic analysis of the resulting corpus in a train timetable enquiry system simulation was realized (D. Luzzati, 1987).",
        "In general, all the implementations used linguistic analysis of real corpora in order to meet the user's needs.",
        "The recording of a spontaneous speech database (Spot) has also been started.",
        "Other research topics concern speech signal processing, with both basic research on wavelet analysis, and development of a real time PC-Based speech analysis tools (the Unice package which is marketed by Vecsys).",
        "The study of phonological variations has been pursued on a text (\"La Bise et le Soleil\") pronounced by several speakers, and will continue with the analysis of BREF.",
        "Another area of interest is the use of symbolic coding for improving cochlear implants.",
