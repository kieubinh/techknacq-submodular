        "In fact, if we look at the performance of the phonetic models in terms of their ability to match the \"forced-recognition\" phonetic string (the string obtained during recognition allowing only the correct word string), we see a much larger reduction in error rate in the ATIS domain (37.5%) than in the Resource Management domain (18.8%).",

        "This has led to a corresponding decrease in weighted error of the overall spoken language system.",
        "Much of the phonetic recognition parts of our system has been ported to a set of off-the-shelf DSP boards.",
        "The complete system, using an IBM RS6000 for lexical access and a Sun SPARCstation-II for the rest of the processing, now runs in 2-3 times real-time.",
        "In the coming months, we plan to conduct research in several directions that will hopefully lead to further improvement in system performance.",
        "These areas include the introduction of gender-specific acoustic models, modelling out-of-vocabulary words, modelling, spontaneous speech effects such as pauses, increasing the size of the lexicon and training set size, and better language models.",
        "Our results show that better language modelling is crucial to improved performance.",
        "Our future research",
        "in this area falls in several categories.",
        "In addition to developing a bigram grammar, we have begun to explore the use of class bigram's as well as more general N-grams.",
        "The class bigrams we examined grouped similar words together in order to reduce the number of unseen word pairs.",
        "We investigated both grouping the conditioning context into classes:",
        "as well as the word itself: P(wa 'Loa) /3(Lob 1C(wb))/3(C(Lob)lwa) where C(wb) is the general class of words that wb belongs to.",
        "We explored a number of different classes and found that we could reduce the development set perplexity by a small amount, to 19.5.",
        "We have also begun to explore the use of more general N-grams and class N-grams.",
        "The N-gram language model store all word sequences observed in the training data.",
        "In order to represent these grammars efficiently we store them in the form of a hierarchical tree, where each node deeper in the tree represents one word farther back in the past.",
        "Smoothing becomes extremely important for the N-gram.",
        "Thus far we have used the generalization of the bigram interpolation procedure so that N-gram smoothing is done recursively:",
        "Our initial experiments suggest that, by incorporating a class 4-gram directly into the N-best search, we can reduce our sentence error rate from 62.5% to 56.3% (for N = 1) on the development set, although there is a corresponding increase in the amount of search required.",
        "We have also found that by simply adding the class 4 gram scores into our N-best resorting algorithm we can reduce our sentence error rate from 59.6% to 56.0%on the February '92 test set.",
        "The PLR model implemented for the ATIS system and the N-gram models described above are both instances of a larger class of language models based on Stack Automata.",
        "A Probabilistic Stack Automata language model approximates conditional word probabilities as: P(wilwo•••wi_i) P (wi 'stack after parsing wo...wi_i) This model can also be considered as an extension to a class N-gram, in which the class members can be phrases as well as words.",
        "Future work in language modelling will focus on application of this general model.",
        "In particular, conditioning the probabilities on the entire parse stack rather than on the current state (essentially the top of stack) should further reduce perplexity and bring long-distance constraints to bear."
