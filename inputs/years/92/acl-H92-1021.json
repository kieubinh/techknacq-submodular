        "The backoff language model is a compact yet powerful way of modeling the dependence of the current word on its immediate history.",
        "An important factor in the backoff model is its behavior on the backed-off cases, namely when a given n-gram IV; is found not to have occurred in the training data.",
        "In these cases, the model assumes that the probabil_itny_iispr:Iwpno.nal to the estimate provided by the n-1-gram, P This last assumption is reasonable most of the time, since no other sources of information are available.",
        "But for frequent n-1-grams, there may exist sufficient statistical evidence to suggest that the backed-off probabilities should in fact be much lower.",
        "This phenomenon occurs at any value of n, but is easiest to demonstrate for the simple case of n = 2, i.e. a bigram.",
        "Consider the following fictitious but typical example: N = 1,000,000",

        "In the case of \"CALL\", the expected number of (\"ON\",\"CALL\") bigrams, assuming independence between \"ON\" and \"CALL\", is 1, so an actual count of 0 does not give much information, and may be ignored.",
        "However, in the case of \"AT\", the expected chance count of (\"ON\",\"AT') is 100, so an actual count of 0 means that the real probability of P(\"AT\"I\"ON\") is in fact much lower than chance.",
        "The backoff model does not capture this information, and thus grossly overestimates P(\"AT\"I \"ON\").",
        "This deficiency of the backoff model has been pointed out before[2, p.457], but, to the best of our knowledge, has never been corrected.",
        "We suspect the reasons are twofold.",
        "First, it only occurs during backed-off cases.",
        "For a well trained bigram or trigram, this happens in only a small fraction of the time.",
        "Second, overestimation degrades perplexity only mildly and indirectly, by affecting a slight underestimation of all the other probabilities.",
