        "In February 1991, we introduced at the DARPA Speech and Natural Language Workshop the concept of a Segmental Neural Net (SNN) for phonetic modeling in continuous speech recognition [1].",
        "The SNN was introduced to overcome some of the well-known limitations of hidden Markov models (HMM) which now represent the state of the art in continuous speech recognition (CSR).",
        "Two such limitations are (i) the conditional-independence assumption, which prevents a HMM from taking full advantage of the correlation that exists among the frames of a phonetic segment, and (ii) the awkwardness with which segmental features (such as duration) can be incorporated into HMM systems.",
        "We developed the concept of SNN specifically to overcome the two HMM limitations just mentioned for phonetic modeling in speech.",
        "However, neural nets are known to require a large amount of computation, especially for training.",
        "Also, there is no known efficient search technique for finding the best scoring segmentation with neural nets in continuous speech.",
        "Therefore, we have developed a hybrid SNN/HMM system that is designed to take full advantage of the good properties of both methods: the phonetic modeling properties of SNNs and the good computational properties of HMMs.",
        "The two methods are integrated through the use of the N-best paradigm, which was developed in conjunction with the BYBLOS system at BBN [7,6].",
        "A year ago, we presented very preliminary results using our hybrid system on the speaker-dependent portion of the DARPA Resource Management Corpus [1].",
        "Also, the training of the neural net was performed only on the correct transcription of the utterances.",
        "In this paper, we describe the performance of the hybrid system on the speaker-independent portion of the Resource Management corpus, using discriminative training on the whole N-best list.",
        "Below, we give a description of the SNN, the integration of the SNN with the HMM models using the N-best paradigm, the training of the hybrid SNN/HMM system using the whole N-best list, and the results on a development set."

        "The SNN differs from other approaches to the use of neural networks in speech recognition in that it attempts to recognize each phoneme by using all the frames in a phonetic segment simultaneously to perform the recognition.",
        "The SNN is a neural network that takes the frames of a phonetic segment as input and produces as output an estimate of the probability of a phoneme given the input segment.",
        "But the SNN requires the availability of some form of phonetic segmentation of the speech.",
        "To consider all possible segmentations of the input speech would be computationally prohibitive.",

        "Thus, the input to the SNN consists of a total of 80 features.",
        "But the actual number of actual frames in a phonetic segment is variable.",

        "One most obvious way in which the SNN could use the N-best list would be to use the HMM system to generate a segmentation for each N-best hypothesis (by finding the most likely HMM state sequence according to that hypothesis) and to use the SNN to generate a score for the hypothesis using this segmentation.",
