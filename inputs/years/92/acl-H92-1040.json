      "heading": "1. OVERALL DESIGN",
      "text": [
        "Our information retrieval system consists of a traditional statistical backbone (Harman and Candela, 1989) augmented with various natural language processing components that assist the system in database processing (stemming, indexing, word and phrase clustering, selectional restrictions), and translate a user's information request into an effective query.",
        "This design is a careful compromise between purely statistical non-linguistic approaches and those requiring rather accomplished (and expensive) semantic analysis of data, often referred to as 'conceptual retrieval'.",
        "The conceptual retrieval systems, though quite effective, are not yet mature enough to be considered in serious information retrieval applications, the major problems being their extreme inefficiency and the need for manual encoding of domain knowledge (Mauldin, 1991).",
        "In our system the database text is first processed with a fast syntactic parser.",
        "Subsequently certain types of phrases are extracted from the parse trees and used as compound indexing terms in addition to single-word terms.",
        "The extracted phrases are statistically analyzed as syntactic contexts in order to discover a variety of similarity links between smaller subphrases and words occurring in them.",
        "A further filtering process maps these similarity links onto semantic relations (generalization, specialization, synonymy, etc.)",
        "after which they are used to transform user's request into a search query.",
        "The user's natural language request is also parsed, and all indexing terms occurring in them are identified.",
        "Next, certain highly ambiguous (usually single-word) terms are dropped, provided that they also occur as elements in some compound terms.",
        "For example, \"natural\" is deleted from a query already containing \"natural language\" because \"natural\" occurs in many unrelated contexts: \"natural number\", \"natural logarithm\", \"natural approach\", etc.",
        "At the same time, other terms may be added, namely those which are linked to some query term through admissible similarity relations.",
        "For example, \"fortran\" is added to a query containing the compound term \"program language\" via a specification link.",
        "After the final query is constructed, the database search follows, and a ranked list of documents is returned.",
        "It should be noted that all the processing steps, those performed by the backbone system, and these performed by the natural language processing components, are fully automated, and no human intervention or manual encoding is required."

      "text": [
        "TTP (Tagged Text Parser) is based on the Linguistic String Grammar developed by Sager (1981).",
        "Written in Quintus Prolog, the parser currently encompasses more than 400 grammar productions.",
        "It produces regularized parse tree representations for each sentence that reflect the sentence's logical structure.",
        "The parser is equipped with a powerful skip-and-fit recovery mechanism that allows it to operate effectively in the face of ill-formed input or under a severe time pressure.",
        "In the recent experiments with approximately 6 million words of English texts,' the parser's speed averaged between 0.45 and 0.5 seconds per sentence, or up to 2600 words per minute, on a 21 MIPS SparcStation ELC.",
        "Some details of the parser are discussed below.2 TTP is a full grammar parser, and initially, it attempts to generate a complete analysis for each sentence.",
        "However, unlike an ordinary parser, it has a built-in timer which regulates the amount of time allowed for parsing any one sentence.",
        "If a parse is not returned before the allotted time",
        "elapses, the parser enters the skip-and-fit mode in which it will try to \"fit\" the parse.",
        "While in the skip-and-fit mode, the parser will attempt to forcibly reduce incomplete constituents, possibly skipping portions of input in order to restart processing at a next unattempted constituent.",
        "In other words, the parser will favor reduction to backtracking while in the skip-and-fit mode.",
        "The result of this strategy is an approximate parse, partially fitted using top-down predictions.",
        "The fragments skipped in the first pass are not thrown out, instead they are analyzed by a simple phrasal parser that looks for noun phrases and relative clauses and then attaches the recovered material to the main parse structure.",
        "As an illustration, consider the following sentence taken from the CACM-3204 corpus: The method is illustrated by the automatic construction of both recursive and iterative programs operating on natural numbers, lists, and trees, in order to construct a program satisfying certain specifications a theorem induced by those specifications is proved, and the desired program is extracted from the proof.",
        "The italicized fragment is likely to cause additional complications in parsing this lengthy string, and the parser may be better off ignoring this fragment altogether.",
        "To do so successfully, the parser must close the currently open constituent (i.e., reduce a program satisfying certain specifications to NP), and possibly a few of its parent constituents, removing corresponding productions from further consideration, until an appropriate production is reactivated.",
        "In this case, TTP may force the following reductions: SI – > to V NP; SA ---> SI; S – > NP V NP SA, until the production S S and S is reached.",
        "Next, the parser skips input to find and, and resumes normal processing.",
        "As may be expected, the skip-and-fit strategy will only be effective if the input skipping can be performed with a degree of determinism.",
        "This means that most of the lexical level ambiguity must be removed from the input text, prior to parsing.",
        "We achieve this using a stochastic parts of speech tagger 3 to preprocess the text."

        "In our system we replaced a traditional morphological stem-mer with a conservative dictionary-assisted suffix trimmer.",
        "The suffix trimmer performs essentially two tasks: (1) it reduces inflected word forms to their root forms as specified in the dictionary, and (2) it converts nominalized verb",
        "We use Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary (OALD) MRD.",
        "forms (eg.",
        "\"implementation\", \"storage\") to the root forms of corresponding verbs (i.e., \"implement\", \"store\").",
        "This is accomplished by removing a standard suffix, eg.",
        "\"stor+age\", replacing it with a standard root ending (\"+e\"), and checking the newly created word against the dictionary, i.e., we check whether the original root (\"storage\") is defined using the new root (\"store\").",
        "This allows reducing \"diversion\" to \"diverse\" while preventing \"version\" to be replaced by \"verse\".",

        "The head in such a pair is a central element of a phrase (verb, main noun, etc.)",
        "while the modifier is one of the adjunct arguments of the heads For example, the phrase fast algorithm for parsing context-free languages yields the following pairs: algorithm+fast, algorithm+parse, parse+language, language+context_free.",

        "For example, the pair [retrieve,information] is extracted from any of the following fragments: information retrieval system; retrieval of information from databases; and information that can be retrieved by a user-controlled interactive search process.6 An example is shown in the appendix.7"

        "They noted that while generally satisfactory, the mutual information formula often produces counterintuitive results for low-frequency data.",
        "This is particularly worrisome for relatively smaller IR collections since many important indexing terms would be eliminated from consideration.",

        "(1990), we adopted a revised formula that displays a more stable behavior even on very low counts.",

        "The similarity is determined by comparing distribution characteristics for both terms within the corpus: how much information contents do they carry, do their information contribution over contexts vary greatly, are the common contexts in which these terms occur specific enough?",
        "In general we will credit high-contents terms appearing in identical contexts, especially if these contexts are not too commonplace.",

        "Although the two methods of term clustering may be considered mutually complementary in certain situations, we believe that more and stronger associations can be obtained through syntactic-context clustering, given sufficient amount of data and a reasonably accurate syntactic parser.9"

        "Similarly, the effectiveness of a query containing fortran is likely to diminish if we add a similar but far more general term such as language.",
        "On the other hand, database search is likely to miss relevant documents if we overlook the fact that fortran is a programming language, or that interpolate is a specification of approximate.",

        "This has indeed been confirmed in our experiments where a relatively crude filter has visibly increased retrieval precision.",

        "ICW is calculated for each term across all contexts in which it occurs.",
        "The general philosophy here is that a more specific word/phrase would have a more limited use, i.e., would appear in fewer distinct contexts.",
        "ICW is similar to the standard inverted document frequency (idf) measure except that term frequency is measured over syntactic units rather than 9 Non-syntactic contexts cross sentence boundaries with no fuss, which is helpful with short, succinct documents (such as CACM abstracts), but less so with longer texts.",
        "1° Query expansion (in the sense considered here, though not quite in the same way) has been used in information retrieval research before (eg.",
        "Sparck Jones and Tait, 1984; Harman, 1988), usually with mixed results.",
        "An alternative is to use term clusters to create new terms, \"metaterms\", and use them to index the database instead (eg.",
        "Crouch, 1988; Lewis and Croft, 1990).",

        "This improvement is a combined effect of the new Stemmer, compound terms, term selection in queries, and query expansion using filtered similarity relations.",

        "These results, while modest by IR standards, are significant for another reason as well.",

        "(1991) report results similar to ours but they take advantage of Computer Reviews categories manually assigned to some documents.",
