        "Retrieval of information from computerized databases is a complex process whose success depends heavily on the user's knowledge of the structure and logic of the particular database being searched.",
        "Many databases have associated with them a controlled indexing vocabulary, or thesaurus, which is the primary access point to the material at search time.",
        "For example, the National of Library of Medicine's MeSHO thesaurus includes some 16,000 headings that are available for indexing and searching the biomedical literature stored in MEDLINEÂ®, NLM's bibliographic database.",
        "The major retrieval strategy is to coordinate MeSH terms with boolean operators, although limited text word searching of titles and abstracts is also possible.",
        "Several years ago NLM launched its Unified Medical Language SystemTM (UMLSTm) project.",
        "This is a major research initiative whose goal it is to facilitate retrieval and integration of information from multiple disparate biomedical databases.",
        "NLM itself has developed and maintains over 40 databases, and there are many other sources of computerized information in the biomedical sciences.",
        "These include factual databases of various kinds, diagnostic expert systems, clinical information systems, as well as bibliographic databases.",
        "The UMLS project is attempting to develop methods whereby access is provided to these different systems with their different vocabularies in a way which allows the user to navigate among them with relative ease.",
        "Recent results of the project have been the development of an Information Sources Map of biomedical databases, a MetathesaurusTM of biomedical vocabularies and a Semantic Network of high-level biomedical concepts[1,2].",
        "The first release of the Information Sources Map contains a description of the scope, content, and access conditions for approximately fifty biomedical databases.",
        "The Metathesaurus includes over 67,000 biomedical concepts from a variety of controlled vocabularies.",
        "Definitions, lexical category information, hierarchical contexts, and interrelationships among many of the terms found in its constituent vocabularies are provided.",
        "Each concept in the Metathesaurus has been assigned to at least one of the 131 semantic types in the Semantic Network.",
        "The Network has top level nodes for organisms, anatomical structures, biologic function and dysfunction, chemicals, events, and concepts.",
        "The Network defines these types and establishes a set of 35 potential relationships between them.",
        "These include physical, temporal, functional, and conceptual links, e.g., part of, co-occurs with, causes, measures.",
        "The Network and the Metathesaurus together form a rich knowledge source of biomedical concepts.",
        "The knowledge sources will continue to be augmented and refined based on experimentation in a variety of applications, including our own.",
        "Our work is motivated by an interest in the development and testing of natural language processing techniques for improved methods of information retrieval.",
        "Document retrieval systems, in particular, are \"language-rich\" and afford the opportunity to conduct basic research in processing complex natural language text.",
        "The focus of our work is the development of SPECIALIST, an experimental NLP system for the biomedical domain[3,4,5].",
        "The system includes a broad coverage parsers supported by a large lexicon, a module that accesses the UMLS knowledge sources, and a retrieval module.",
        "SPECIALIST runs on Sun workstations and is implemented in Quintus Prolog, with some support modules written in C. We have recently conducted experiments using a test collection of user queries and MEDLINE citation records retrieved for those queries.",
        "The data for the test collection were se",
        "lected from 2,000 search request forms submitted by health professionals to the NIH and NLM libraries.",
        "155 queries were chosen, approximately 50 each in the three major areas covered by MEDLINE - clinical medicine research, basic science research, and health services research.",
        "Searches were conducted by an expert NLM searcher, and the approximately 3,000 citations retrieved were evaluated for relevancy by a subject matter expert[8].",
        "Each citation record in the collection includes a title and an author-prepared abstract.",
        "We parsed the queries, titles and selected portions of abstracts in the test collection.",
        "For all successful parses, noun phrases were extracted and whatever synonyms could be found in the Metathesaurus and in our online version of the Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary[5] were added to the noun phrases to form a concept group.",
        "We then attempted to effect a match between the concepts in the queries and the concepts in relevant citations.",
        "We found that the mapping involves a wide range of inferences.",
        "It is only in rare cases that concepts map directly from queries to documents.",
        "More commonly, several inferences are necessary in order to determine that a citation is in fact relevant to a request.",
        "The remainder of this paper begins with a discussion of some of the salient issues in information retrieval.",
        "This is followed by a brief description of the major components of the SPECIALIST system, and the paper ends with an account of our recent investigations in mapping queries to relevant documents."

        "One of the essential characteristics of document storage and retrieval is the parallelism between the indexing and searching processes.",
        "Text is subjected to either manual or automatic indexing.",
        "If it is manual, there will generally be indexing rules.",
        "For example, in the case of NLM's MEDLINE database, one rule says that articles should be indexed with the most specific terms available in NLM's MeSH vocabulary[9].",
        "Thus, if an article is about aplastic anemia it should be indexed under that term (which is a bona fide MeSH term) and not under either the more general term \"anemia\" or the even more general term \"hematologic diseases\".",
        "At search time, the user (or program acting on the user's behalf) needs to take this into account when formulating a search strategy and statement.",
        "Even if the indexing is automatic, and it may be as simple as creating an inverted index for all the words in the document, the user (or program) needs to be aware of the conventions for creating that index.",
        "This includes recognition of the fact that text words are generally run against a stopword list of function words and other highly frequent words before they are entered in the database.",
        "For example, if the user wants to query the MEDLINE database on \"the effects of acidosis on ATP\" and uses text words only, the two words \"acidosis\" and \"AT?\" will individually yield many postings and their coordination will yield another, smaller, set.",
        "However, adding in the word \"effects\" will not make the search results any more precise, since, as a highly frequent word in biomedical documents, this word has been placed on the stopword list.",
        "Without some knowledge of these conventions, the results can be confusing to end users.",
        "Feedback of various kinds allows the user to negotiate with the retrieval system.",
        "This may involve refining a search statement based on viewing the set of titles or documents initially retrieved, or finding that because the number of postings for a search statement is unacceptably large or small that the search strategy has been too broad, or too narrow, or misformulated in some other way.",
        "It may also involve accessing information about the indexing rules or controlled vocabulary used in the system.",
        "The effect of this feedback is that it makes the user more aware of both the potential of the retrieval system as well as its limitations.",
        "Most researchers in intelligent interface design assume to one degree or another that the user will be \"left in the loop\" to negotiate with the system, resolving ambiguities, making relevancy judgements, and revising searches based on (user-independent) information supplied by the system.",
        "(See[10] for a strong statement about the desirabilty of giving the user maximum control over the entire search interaction.)",
        "Many of the attempts that have been made to apply NLP to information retrieval have involved the search interface; others have involved the indexing process.",
        "See[1]] for a review of some of the more recent research efforts.",
        "The results of applying NLP to the information retrieval problem have not always been encouraging [12].",
        "It is important to recognize why this might be so.",
        "First, retrieval experiments have been carried out that use partially developed parsing systems and then compare these results with other non-NLP methods.",
        "The results of these comparisons should, therefore, be viewed with caution.",
        "In some cases, so-called stemming procedures have been used which embody some linguistic sophistication, but, again, are not fully motivated or developed.",
        "The results of these experiments again underscore the limitations of the incomplete methods used.",
        "Second, given that the indexing and retrieval processes are so closely related, a successful application of NLP will need to be fully integrated with both processes.",
        "Some of the inconclusive results in[13], for example, may derive from a decision to ignore this point."

        "The grammar includes context-free BNF rules together with context-sensitive restrictions.",
        "It is based heavily on the Pundit grammar, but we continue to refine and modify it so that it can handle new constructions and additional lexical attributes.",
