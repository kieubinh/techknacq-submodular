        "Several focal issues have emerged in machine translation (MT) research as the result of recent intensive studies in the field.",

        "Though new frameworks of MT such as Statistics-based MT (SBMT), Example-based MT (EBMT), Analogy-based MT (ABMT), Knowledge-based MT (KBMT) etc.",
        "look radically different from conventional linguistic-based MT (LBMT) such as Transfer-based, they address one or two of the above focal issues and ignore the rest [7] [9].",
        "In particular, the new paradigms of MT tend to ignore the first issue ie.",
        "declarative representation of bilingual knowledge and the complexities involved n the process of combining units of bilingual knowledge.",
        "It is our contention that any MT system, whichever paradigm it belongs to, has to store a set of translation-equivalent units for a pair of languages and combine these to produce larger units of translation.",
        "In EBMT, for example, a set of translation examples has to be stored and several of them have to be combined properly to produce translation.",
        "Because of the declarative nature of translation examples, EBMT inevitably encounters the same complexities of combining translation units in declarative representation as LBMT does.",
        "Research in LBMT [1] [2] [3] [10] [12] has revealed that difficulties in the declarative representation of bilingual knowledge stem mainly from the treatment of idiosyncratic structural changes caused by lexical items, and interactions of such idiosyncratic structural changes when they coexist in single sentences.",
        "These types of structural changes also cause problems when they are combined with general or ordinary linguistic phenomena such as coordination.",
        "A formal framework to cope with these matters is essential in other approaches, such as EBMT, as in LBMT, if the translation is produced in a compositional way.",
        "In this paper, we discuss problems caused by such interaction, and give solutions in our logic-based transfer framework [8].",
        "Our transfer model views the transfer process as deduction; it produces the target linguistic description without changing the source description.",
        "This gives a clear contrast to the conventional tree-transducer model, which gradually transforms the source description, and is therefore hard to control.",
        "Because of the logic oriented nature of out framework, it can also be extended to cope with the other focal issue of MT such as the integration of knowledge-based processing with translation[4]."

        "The precise definition may change depending on how the coordinate structure is represented.",

        "A simple transfer algorithm, for example, may choose the target word when it finds the first applicable transfer rule for a source word: this algorithm may produce \"boushito kutsu-wo kaburu\" for the sentence (la), which means that the semantic relation between \"wear\" and \"shoes\" is ignored.",
