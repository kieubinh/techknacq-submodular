        "A number of techniques have been developed to compensate for the effects that varying microphone and channels have on the acoustic signal.",
        "Erell and Weintraub [4, 5] have used additive corrections in the filter-bank log energy or cepstral domains based on equalizing the long-term average of the observed filter-bank log energy or cepstral vector to that of the training data.",
        "The techniques developed by Rose and Paul [6] and Acero [7] used an iterative technique for estimating the cepstral bias vector that will maximize the likelihood of the input utterance.",
        "Nadas et al.",
        "[8] used an adaptive linear transformation applied to the input representation, where the adaptation uses the VQ distortion vector with respect to a predefined codebook.",
        "VanCompemolle [10] scaled the filter-bank log energies to a specified range using running histograms, and Rohlicek [9] experimented with a number of histogram-based compensation metrics based on equalizing different aspects of the probability distribution.",
        "One important limitation of the above approaches is that they rely on a speech/nonspeech detector.",
        "Each of the above approaches computes spectral properties of the input speech sentence and subsequently compensates for the statistical differences with certain properties of the training data.",
        "If the input acoustical signal is not segmented by sentence (e.g. open microphone with no push-to-talk button) and there are long periods of silence, the above approaches would not be able to operate without some type of reliable automatic speech-input/sentence-detection mechanism.",
        "An automatic sentence-detection mechanism would have considerable difficulty in reliably computing the average speech spectrum if there were many other nonspeech sounds in the environment.",
        "A second class of techniques developed around auditory models (Lyon [11]; Cohen [12]; Seneff [13]; Ghitza [14]).",
        "These techniques use various automatic gain control and other auditory-type modeling techniques to output a spectral vector that has been adapted based on the acoustic history.",
        "A potential limitation of this approach is that many of these techniques are very computationally intensive."

        "RASTA filtering is a high-pass filter applied to a log-spectral representation of speech.",
        "It removes slow-moving variations from the log spectrum.",
        "The filtering is done on the log-spectral representation so that multiplicative distortions (such as a linear filter) become additive and may be removed with the RASTA filter.",
        "A simple RASTA filter may be implemented as follows:",
        "where x(t), as implemented in DECIPIIERTM, is a log bandpass energy which is normally used in DECIPHERTM to compute the Mel-cepstral feature vector.",
        "Instead, x(t) is replaced by y(t), the high-pass version of x(t), when performing the cepstral transform.",
        "The constant, C, in the above equation defines the time constant of the RASTA filter.",
        "It is desirable that C be such",
        "that short-term variations in the log spectra (presumably important parts of the speech signal) are passed by the filter, but slower variations are blocked.",
        "We set C = 0.97 so that signals that vary faster than about 1 Hz are passed and those that vary less than once per second tend to be blocked.",
        "Figure 1 below plots the characteristic of this filter.",
        "When used in conjunction with SRT's spectral estimation algorithms [4, 5], the high-pass filter is applied to the filter-bank log energies after the spectral estimation operation.",
        "The estimates of clean filter-bank energies are highpass filtered and then transformed to obtain the cepstral vector.",
        "The cepstral vector is then differenced twice to obtain the delta-cepstral vector and the delta-delta-cepstral vector."

        "The performance on CMU's Crown recordings were much lower.",
        "CMU's audio recordings for were noticeably noisier; the speaker sounded as if he was much farther from the microphone, and there were other nonstationary sounds in the background.",
        "Note that the error rate with the standard signal processing is extremely high (90.7% word error).",
        "For the CMU Crown microphone recordings, the addition of RASTA processing helped reduce the error rate for both the standard and noise-robust estimation processing conditions.",

        "The estimation algorithms were designed to work independently from any spectral shape introduced by the microphone and channel variations.",
        "Therefore, some type of additional spectral normalization is required to compensate for these effects: the combined \"NRFE + RASTA\" system serves that purpose.",

        "The relative distortion for cepstral coefficient C, is computed by comparing the cepstral value of the first microphone with the same cepstral value computed on the secondary microphone.",
