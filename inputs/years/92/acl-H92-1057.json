        "Normal performance, with no language model, i.e., raw word-level performance, is currently about 81% for a set of talkers not in the training set and about 91% for training set data.",
        "The system has been trained and tested using a close-talking head-mounted microphone.",
        "Since a meaningful comparison requires using the same speech, the existing speech database was appropriately pre-filtered, played out through a transducer (speaker) in the room environment, picked-up by the microphone array, and restored as a digital file.",
        "The resulting file was post-processed and used as input to the recognizer; the recognition performance indicates the effect of the input device.",
        "The baseline experiment showed that both a single remote microphone and the beamformed signal reduced performance by 12% in a room with no other talkers.",
        "For the array tested, the error is generally attributable to reverberation off the floor and ceiling."

        "It is widely accepted that appropriate data-acquisition technology must be available in order to make speech-recognition a viable computer input mode [1, 2, 3].",
        "While work has been done in the area of signal conditioning [4], for the last three years, research at Brown University has been in progress to develop hardware, software and algorithms as a means to make non-intrusive speech acquisition a practical reality [5, 6] Principal focus to date has been to use the phase relationships among a group of microphones spaced in a line - hence a linear array - for the remote, real-time acquisition of a talker's data.",
        "Various beamforming and talker location/tracking algorithms have been studied, reported, and evaluated relative to listening quality [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] The quality of a speech data acquisition system may be assessed in several ways.",
        "For many applications, evaluation is usually given, quantitatively, in terms of some signal-to-noise measure or human-listening experiment score, or qualitatively in terms of human evaluation.",

        "A key problem for such systems to overcome is that of reverberation.",
        "Acoustic reflections in a normal room environment make the output of a remote microphone quite different from that taken from the normal, close-talking, recognizer microphone.",
        "Several ways have been suggested to alleviate this problem:",
        "• A more focused array system will attenuate reflections coming from a wider off-axis volume[13].",
        "Many microphones are required to do this, and a system with beam-width control over a broad spectrum and in two or three directions is essential.",
        "This is the spatial-filtering approach to solving the problem.",
        "• The acoustic environment near the microphones is very critical.",
        "New ways of mounting the microphones in an appropriately sound absorbent material substantially improve performance, without necessarily limiting the practicality of the array.",
        "More directional elements can also be used.",
        "This is an acoustical approach to helping to resolve the problem.",
        "• One form or another of deconvolution can be used to undo the effects of reverberations [3, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19].",
        "Either directly or indirectly, some characterization of the room is obtained, usually as some spatially-dependent impulse response.",
        "After this non-trivial problem is solved, some processing \"art\" is often essential to overcome nulls in the spectrum and perform inverse filtering.",
        "This project investigates all of the above methods.",
        "It might be added that, when working with real acoustic systems, mechanisms for reducing reverberations must be carefully applied; it is a hard problem.",
        "However, the purpose of this paper is not to deal with the improvements achieved by employing various means to dereverberate the output signal of the array; rather, it is to set a baseline standard against which to compare future developments.",
        "The problem is posed: how badly does recognizer performance degrade when the input signal is from 1) a single remote omnidirectional microphone,",
        "or from 2) the beamformed output from a linear microphone array?",

        "• Low-frequency background noise is not effectively eliminated by an acoustic array of this type and size.",
        "Some filtering, perhaps combined with sub-band types of enhancements, should help.",
        "• The major reverberations in the room come from the ceiling and floor.",
        "They have been measured as being as much as 25% of the original wavefront in intensity.",
        "Even if the reflections average 10%, implying a 14dB signal-to-noise ratio, 'quiet' room conditions no longer hold.",
        "A focused two or three dimensional array could attenuate these reflections and thus address the problem.",
        "Alternatively, pressure gradient microphones could be used in a one-dimensional array as done in [13].",
        "• There is always some variability in an acoustical experiment regarding equipment positioning, overall amplitudes, microphone calibration etc.",
        "While great care was taken, certainly the beamformer output would be more susceptible to these variabilities than would be the single remote microphone.",
        "In order to determine the impact of beamforming, the testing data were run through the data conversion system (source at (1m, 2m)) several additional times, each with a second transducer located at (2m, 2m).",
        "This second transducer repeated a few seconds of speech at various, controlled levels as the testing data were being recorded.",
        "This procedure permits the assessment of the effects of beamforming with respect to spatial filtering of off-axis noise.",
        "The test datasets for both the single remote microphone and the beamformed data were run through their respective quiet-room recognizers.",
        "As the purpose of this test was to check the simple beamformer, more elaborate beamformer were not used to generate the data of Figure 6.",
        "Also, note that no background noise processing (such as high-pass filtering the signals) was used to remove the low-frequency 'rumble' of the room.",
        "As the graph indicates, there is an appreciable performance gain using the array for acoustic data collection in a noisy environment.",
        "The simple beamformer consistently scored 10-15% higher than a single microphone for SNR's less than 16dB.",
        "Note that in one case the recognition result is negative.",
