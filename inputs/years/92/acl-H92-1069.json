        "This paper reports on a series of experiments for speaker-independent, continuous speech phone recognition of French, using the recently recorded BREF corpus[4, 6].",
        "BREF was designed to provide speech data for the development of dictation machines, the evaluation of continuous speech recognition systems (both speaker-dependent and speaker-independent), and to provide a large corpus of continuous speech to study phonological variations.",
        "These experiments are the first to use this corpus, and are meant to provide a baseline performance evaluation for vocabulary-independent (VI) phone recognition, as well as the development of a procedure for automatic segmentation and labeling of the corpus.",
        "First a brief description of BREF is given, along with the procedure for semi-automatic (verified) labeling and automatic segmentation of the speech data.",
        "The ability to accurately predict the phone labels from the text is assessed, as is the accuracy of the automatic segmentation.",
        "Next the phone recognition experiments performed using speech data from 62 speakers (43 for training, 19 for test) are described.",
        "A hidden Markov model (HMM) based recognizer has been evaluated with context-independent (CI) and context-dependent (CD) model sets, both with and without a duration model.",
        "Results are also given with and without the use of 1-gram and 2-gram statistics to provide phonotactic constraints.",
        "Preliminary VI word recognition results are presented with no grammar.",
        "The final section provides a discussion and summary, and a comparison of these results to the performance of other phone recognizers."

        "A procedure for automatic segmentation and labeling of the BREF corpus is being developed.",
        "The preliminary investigations indicate that the main problems lie in predicting the phone string, and that while the segmentation is not exact, the vast majority of segment boundaries are located within the same frame as a hand-segmentation.",
        "However, it is expected that more accurate segmentations will be obtained by using CD models for segmentation.",
        "In addition, a smaller frame step will be used to provide a finer segmentation.",
        "Text-to-phone prediction can be improved by including difficult items, such as foreign words and acronyums, in the exception dictionary.",
        "This will not, however, eliminate the need for verification, as it will not handle alternate pronunciations.",
        "One option is to have the text-to-phoneme system propose alternate pronunciations for dates and acronyms, and to allow liaison and the pronunciation of mute-e to be optional.",
        "In addition, providing a means of flagging poor matches would greatly ease the process of verification.",
        "An HMM-based recognizer has been used for a baseline performance evaluation and verification of the data.",
        "In the future better acoustic phone models and duration models will be used.",
        "The improvement observed using the sets of CD models indicates, at least with these preliminary experiments, that the improvement appears to be related to the number of CD models that can be trained.",
