        "The DARPA Spoken Language System (SLS) community has long taken a leadership position in designing, implementing, and globally distributing significant speech corpora widely used for advancing speech recognition research.",
        "The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) CSR Corpus described here is the newest addition to this valuable set of resources.",
        "In contrast to previous corpora, the WSJ corpus will provide DARPA its first general-purpose English, large vocabulary, natural language, high perplexity, corpus containing significant quantities of both speech data (400 hrs.)",
        "and text data (47M words), thereby providing a means to integrate speech recognition and natural language processing in application domains with high potential practical value.",
        "This paper presents the motivating goals, acoustic data design, text processing steps, lexicons, and testing paradigms incorporated into the multifaceted WSJ CSR Corpus."

        "As spoken language technology progresses and goals expand, progressively larger, and more challenging corpora need to be created to support advanced research.",
        "The SLS DARPA 1994 goals are ambitious, focusing on cooperative speakers, generating goal-directed, spontaneous continuous speech, in speaker-adaptive and speaker-independent modes, for expandable vocabularies (5000 or more words active), moderate perplexity (100-200), with integrated speech and natural language processing, for speakers in a moderate noise environment, using multiple types of microphones, engaged in command/database and dictation applications.",
        "In contrast to typical command/database applications, dictation (i.e. interactive speech-driven word processing) tasks focus on cooperative speakers (e.g. speaker dependent/adaptive sustained usage) who generate continuous speech (usually in a somewhat careful fashion to facilitate accurate transcription) verbalizing their words and sentence punctuation.",
        "The existing Resource Management[15] and subsequent Air Travel Information System[16] corpora target specific database inquiry tasks, characterized by medium vocabularies (<1500 words) with language model perplexities ranging from 9 to 60.",
        "The WSJ corpus described here is designed to advance CSR technology and support the 1994 SLS research goals.",
        "A similar read speech corpus in the French language has been success-This work was sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.",
        "The views expressed are those of the authors and do not reflect the official policy or position of the U.S. Government.",
        "fully completed using text from the newspaper Le Monde[5].",
        "Commencing with serious contractor concerns regarding suitable CSR corpora[12] starting in the mid 1980's, the DARPA SLS Coordinating Committee started considering new corpora requirements in early 1990, with the subsequent formation of the CSR Corpus Committee, culminating in the WSJ Corpus design.",
        "The CSR Corpus Committee members include J.M.",
        "Baker (Dragon, chair), F. Kubala (BBN), D. Pallett (NIST), D. Paul (LL), M. Phillips (MIT), M. Picheny (IBM), R. Rajasekran (TI), B. Weide (CMU), M. Weintraub (SRI), and J. Wilpon (ATT).",
        "A survey taken of the DARPA contractors for CSR research interests disclosed highly diverse, often opposing views of research interest.",
        "All contractors, however, cited a common interest in pursuing research on \"Domain-independent Acoustic Models\", \"Domain-independent Language Models\", and \"Speaker-adaptation\".",
        "The outcome of lively meetings and discussions resulted in the definition and preliminary authorization of a major (>400 hrs.)",
        "corpus with materials based primarily on WSJ material (backed by WSJ text from 1987-89 provided by the ACL/DCI[9] to enable statistical language modeling) and supplemented by other material (spontaneous dictation, Hansard, etc., shown in Table 1).",
        "This corpus will provide a uniquely rich resource, in a carefully crafted structure designed to elicit a highly productive flow of diagnostic research information with an array of comparative test paradigms.",
        "Although this WSJ corpus is large relative to many other available corpora, it should be cautioned that insofar as most research experiments continue to show marked improvement with the increased availability of training data, it is likely that this corpus also will fail to allow us to find or achieve asymptotic performance.",
        "Most systems continue to be under-trained or constrained to work in suboptimal lower dimensional spaces, due to their data-starvation.",
        "Indeed, this result is not really surprising in light of the much larger amounts of speech data to which young children must be exposed before gaining recognition proficiency of even modest size vocabularies.",
        "The structure, features, and dimensions of this corpus constitute the outcome of a heavily debated consensus process, which satisfies the basic (though certainly not all) different requirements of the different research foci of all parties involved.",
        "There are significant portions of this corpus which",
        "will be more heavily used by one or more research groups, and not at all by others.",
        "Nonetheless, the common basis and careful structuring of these materials should allow for highly informative intra and intergroup comparisons.",
        "The members of this committee are to be commended and should take pride in their success in jointly exercising a rare \"statesmanlike\" cooperation to support the legitimate diversity of expert research interests in this field (often overcoming strong pressures of both personal and political convictions to support only their own narrower research interests)."

        "Specifically, the WSJ corpus is scalable and built to accommodate variable size large vocabularies (5K, 20K, and larger), variable perplexities (80, 120, 160, 240, and larger), speaker dependent (SD) and independent (SI) training with variable amounts of data (ranging from 100 to 9600 sentences/speaker), including equal portions of verbalized and non-verbalized punctuation (to reflect both dictation-mode and non-dictation-mode applications), separate speaker adaptation materials (40 phonetically rich sentences/speaker), simultaneous standard close talking and multiple secondary microphones, variable moderate noise environments, equal numbers of male and female speakers chosen for diversity of voice quality and dialect.",
        "In order to collect large quantities of speech data very cost-effectively, it was decided to collect the majority of the recorded speech in a \"read\" speech mode, whereby speakers are prompted by newspaper text paragraphs.",
        "The presentation of coherent paragraph blocks of text provides semantically meaningful material, thereby facilitating the production of realistic speech prosodics.",
        "Small amounts of unprompted \"spontaneous\" speech are provided for comparison (utilizing some naive speakers as well as some who are experienced at dictation for human transcription).",
        "Testing paradigms were carefully constructed to accommodate efficient comparisons of SI and SD performance and variable size vocabulary \"open\" and \"closed\" tests to permit evaluation both with and without \"out-of-vocabulary\" lexical items.",
        "The value of variable amounts of training set materials can be directly assessed both within and across speakers.",
        "Well-trained speaker-dependent performance provides an upper bound against which the success of different speaker-independent modeling and speaker-adaptive methodologies may be rigorously compared.",
        "Adaptive acoustic and language modeling is easily supported through the following simple though rigorous automatic paradigm: 1) Recognition of a sentence is performed and assessed as usual against existing system acoustic and language models.",
        "2) The system commences to adapt using (supervised) or not using (unsupervised) the correct \"clear text\" to modify its internal acoustic and language models automatically before proceeding to recognition of the next utterance.",
        "Recognition performance with this kind of automatic adaptation is assessable with standard scoring routines.",
        "This mode provides an easy means to maximize performance for speakers by tracking and accommodating to speaker and environmental changes in a dynamic fashion, also simulating (in a reproducible fashion) an interactive system mode where speakers correct system recognition errors, and using systems which can utilize this feedback to improve performance, in a continuous automatic fashion.",
        "The results of automatic adaptation can be assessed in an ongoing \"dynamic\" fashion, or stopped after varying amounts of adaptation, for subsequent \"static\" testing on materials to which the system is not subsequently adapted[1,2,3].",
        "The availability of large amounts of machine-readable text from nearly three years of the Wall Street Journal enables meaningful statistical benchmark language models (including bigrams and trigrams) to be generated, and the results from these to be easily contrasted.",
        "By varying the types of language models chosen, the effect on recognition performance of variable perplexities for the same textual materials can be assessed.",
        "The availability of this text provides a valuable resource enabling novel language models and language models adapted from other tasks to be developed and evaluated as well."

        "The preprocessing began with integrity checks: one file from 1987 and 38 from 1988 were discarded due to duplication of articles in the same file (1987) or duplication of data found in other files (1988).",
        "274 files were retained, which yielded 47M with-verbalized-punctuation words from 1.8M sentences.",

        "Each file was characterized by its most frequent date (used later to temporally order the files).",
        "Since the CSR Committee had decided to support both with and without verbalized punctuation modes, it was necessary to produce four versions of each text: with/without verbalized punctuation x prompt/truth texts.",
        "(A prompt text is the version read by the speaker and the truth text is the version used by the training, recognition, and scoring algorithms.)",
        "The preprocessing consisted of a general preprocessor (GP) followed by four customizing preprocessors to convert the GP output in the four specific outputs.",

        "The general preprocessor started by labeling all paragraphs and sentences using an SGML-like scheme based upon the file name, document-control number, paragraph number within the article, and sentence number within the paragraph.",
        "This marking scheme, which was carried transparently though all of the processing, made it very easy to locate any of the text at any stage of the processing.",
