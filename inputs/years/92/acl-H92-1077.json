        "This session featured a summary of the first dry run benchmark tests on the new Wall Street Journal (WSJ) continuous speech recognition (CSR) pilot corpus, and a description of the techniques used and lessons learned by the four sites who conducted the large vocabulary CSR tests.",
        "For the first presentation, Dave Polka distributed a handout with system descriptions and results.",
        "He credited the people involved, and indicated the tight schedule which was met.",
        "The tests included three training paradigms: speaker-dependent (SD); longitudinal speaker-dependent (LSD), with much more training speech; and speaker-independent (SI).",
        "Tests included 5K and 20K vocabularies, bigram and trigram language models, and recognition on speech collected with verbalized punctuation (VP) and with no verbalized punctuation (NVP).",
        "Data was shown indicating special difficulties with a few of the speakers.",
        "Results were presented on signal-to-noise ratios for both the primary and secondary microphones.",
        "The data are summarized in PaIlett's Proceedings paper.",
        "Some comments on the results are given below.",
        "The next four papers, on recognition of the WSJ data at Dragon, CMU, Lincoln Laboratory, and SRI, included the common theme that extending a CSR system to a much larger vocabulary and more general task domain required more than a new dictionary and language model.",
        "In particular, major increases in search time, computation for matching, and memory utilization required each site to make compromises or revise strategies in acoustic mod-elling, search, and matching strategies.",
        "Despite the preliminary nature of the work on this corpus, encouraging results were obtained and important issues were raised.",
        "The Dragon paper was presented by Francesco Scattone, and described two recognition approaches that were developed and tested.",
        "The first method utilized unimodal phonetic elements (PELs), and the second a variation of tied mixtures very recently implemented at Dragon, which",
        "was used in Dragon's dry run evaluation test on the 5,000 word SD portion of the corpus.",
        "The tied-mixture models proved very effective in modelling the multi-modality of parameter distributions, and generally yielded better recognition results.",
        "Scattone indicated that future work will focus on further development of the tied-mixture techniques, including efforts to develop high-performance speaker-independent recognition techniques.",
        "Next, Fil Alleva discussed the application of CMU's SPHINX-II system to the WSJ CSR task.",
        "An important change to SPHINX-II which was made to reduce running time was to use only left-context-dependent cross word models; in addition, a number of changes were made to the Viterbi search to reduce running time.",
        "Tests were run on a variety of conditions, including the spontaneous speech, and results are summarized in the paper.",
        "The next paper, by Doug Paul, described substantial changes made to the Lincoln Tied-Mixture HMM CSR, to achieve effective operation for the large-vocabulary CSR task.",
        "The recognizer, which had previously used a time-synchronous beam-pruned search, was converted to a stack-decoder-based search strategy with an acoustic fast match.",
        "Crossword models had not yet been included.",
        "The stack decoder strategy was shown to perform effectively for the larger vocabularies, and a variety of development test and evaluation test results were presented.",
        "In addition, a rapid speaker enrollment procedure was described, and positive (but preliminary) results on rapid adaptation (using the standard WSJ 40 adaptation sentences) were presented.",
        "A discussion followed, focusing on the language modelling, and on perplexity for closed and open vocabularies.",
        "Hy Murveit described the application of SRI's DECIPHER system to the WSJ CSR task.",
        "He focused primarily on performance, since the CSR system used was essentially identical to the system used in ATIS.",
        "He acknowledged help from Dragon (Lexicon) and Lincoln (Language Models) in porting to the WSJ task.",
        "He described how DECIPHER was stripped down to reduce computation for the task.",
        "Tests on the secondary microphone were described, with about 40% increase in error rate.",
        "An experiment was described to investigate the effects of additional"

        "The experiment indicated that substantial increases in SI training data could produce significant reductions in error rate relative to those reported in the dry run evaluation tests.",
        "First, a sampling of the comments in favor of continuing to collect data with a split between VP and NVP.",
        "The chairman initiated the discussion period which followed this final presentation by presenting a plot of error rate vs perplexity for the WSJ dry run tests, the previous best resource management (RM) results, and CSR dictation results which had been presented by IBM at ICASSP-89 (Bahl, et.al., Large Vocabulary Natural Language Continuous Speech Recognition).",
        "For perplexity80, the WSJ error rates ranged from 9.0% (LSD) to 12.9% (best SD) to 16.6% (best SI).",
        "These error rates were considerably higher than the most recent perplexity 60 RM results (1.8% for SD) and (3.6% for SI), but not as much higher than the perplexity-90 SD IBM results (an 11% error rate was reported in the ICASSP-89 Proceedings paper, and an improved error rate of about 5% was presented at the ICASSP-89 talk).",
        "With the understanding that results obtained in these different tests are not directly comparable, still a fair conclusion which could be drawn is that the WSJ corpus is a sufficiently-challenging one (especially when 20K vocabularies, spontaneous speech, and secondary microphones are considered), and that the results of the first dry run test were quite encouraging.",
        "Most of the ensuing discussion focused on the WSJ corpus and evaluation issues which George Doddington had listed in his earlier CCCC talk.",
        "These are summarized below by topic.",
        "In summarizing the discussion, an attempt is made to sample the range of comments and issues raised."

        "Francis Kubala: The sampling of conditions had worked out well; the number of conditions should probably be narrowed a bit over the next few months.",

        "Janet Baker: People using real dictation systems use VP, so any recognition system for dictation must handle VP.",
        "Doug Paul: Both NVP and VP are needed to support both general recognition and dictation; reading with VP may be awkward at first, but not hard to get used to.",
        "Michael Picheny: Might as well use VP since it is easier for the recognizer, and people who dictate do not seem to mind.",
