        "The system was evaluated on the speaker-independent (SI) portion of DARPA's February 1992 \"Dry-Run\" WSJO test and achieved 17.1% word error without verbalized punctuation (NVP) and 16.6% error with verbalized punctuation (VP).",
        "In addition, we increased the amount of training data and reduced the VP error rate to 12.9%.",
        "This SI error rate (with a larger amount of training data) equalled the best 600-training-sentence speaker-dependent error rate reported for the February CSR evaluation.",
        "Finally, the system was evaluated on the VP data using microphones unknown to the system instead of the training-set's Sennheiser microphone and the error rate only increased to 26.0%."

        "This is a preliminary report demonstrating that the DECIPHER Tm speech recognition system was ported from a 1,000-word task (ATIS) to a large vocabulary (5,000-word) task (DARPA's CSR task).",
        "We have achieved word error rates between of 16.6% and 17.1% as measured by NIST on DARPA's February 1992 Dry-Run WSJO evaluation where no test words were outside the prescribed vocabulary.",
        "We evaluated using alternate microphone data and found that the error rate increased only by 62%.",
        "Finally, by increasing the amount of training data, we were able to achieve an error rate that matched the error rates reported for this task from 600 sentence/speaker speaker-dependent systems.",
        "This could not have been done without substantial support from the rest of the DARPA community in the form of speech data, pronunciation tables, and language models."
