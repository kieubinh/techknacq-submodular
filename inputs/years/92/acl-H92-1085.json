        "Thus of 10,517 sentences of varying lengths, it pulled out 500 as possibly containing a repair and missed 97 sentences actually containing a repair.",
        "Of the 500 that it proposed as containing a repair, 62% actually did and 38% did not.",
        "Of the 62% that had repairs, it made the appropriate correction for 57%.",
        "These numbers show that although pattern matching is useful in identifying possible repairs, it is less successful at making appropriate corrections.",
        "This problem stems largely from the overlap of related patterns.",
        "Many sentences contain a subsequence of words that match not one but several patterns.",
        "For example the phrase \"FLIGHT <word> FLIGHT\" matches three different patterns: show the FLIGHT earliest FLIGHT",

        "Each of these sentences is a false positive for the other two patterns.",
        "Despite these problems of overlap, pattern matching is useful in reducing the set of candidate sentences to be processed for repairs.",

        "If parsing succeeded, the sentence was marked as a false positive.",
        "If parsing did not succeed, then pattern matching was used to detect possible repairs, and the edits associated with the repairs were made.",
        "Parsing was then reattempted.",
        "If parsing succeeded at this point, the sentence was marked as a repair.",
        "Otherwise, it was marked as NO OPINION.",
        "Since multiple repairs and false positives can occur in the same sentence, the pattern matching process is constrained to prefer fewer repairs to more repairs, and shorter repairs to longer repairs.",
        "This is done to favor an analysis that deletes the fewest words from a sentence.",
        "It is often the case that more drastic repairs would result in a syntactically and semantically well-formed sentence, but not the sentence that the speaker intended.",
        "For instance, the sentence \"show me <flights> daily flights to boston\" could be repaired by deleting the words \"flights daily\", and would then yield a grammatical sentence, but in this case the speaker intended to delete only \"flights.\" Table 4 shows the results of these experiments.",
        "We ran them two ways: once using syntactic constraints alone and again using both syntactic and semantic constraints.",
        "As can be seen, Gemini is quite accurate at detecting a repair, although somewhat less accurate at detecting a false positive.",
        "Furthermore, in cases where Gemini detected a repair, it produced the intended correction in 62 out of 68 cases for syntax alone, and in 60 out of 64 cases using combined syntax and semantics.",
        "In both cases, a large number of sentences (29% for syntax, 50% for semantics) received a NO OPINION evaluation.",
        "The NO OPINION cases were evenly split between repairs and false positives in both tests.",
        "The main points to be noted from Table 4 are that with syntax alone, the system is quite accurate in detecting repairs, and with syntax and semantics working together, it is accurate at detecting false positives.",

        "Our approach in studying the ways in which acoustics might be helpful was to begin by looking at two patterns conducive to acoustic measurement and comparison.",
        "First, we focused on patterns in which there is only one matched word, and in which the two occurrences of that word are either adjacent or separated by only one word.",
        "Matched words allow for comparisons of word duration; proximity helps avoid variability due to global intonation contours not associated with the patterns themselves.",

        "In both analyses, a number of features were measured to allow for comparisons between the words of interest.",
        "Word onsets and offsets were labeled by inspection of waveforms and parameter files (pitch tracks and spectrograms) obtained using the Entropic Waves software package.",
        "Files with questionable pitch tracks were excluded from the analysis.",

        "In examining the M1 repair pattern, we found that the strongest distinguishing cue between the repairs (N = 20) and the false positives (N = 20) was the interval between the offset of the first word and the onset of the second.",
        "False positives had a mean gap of 42 ms (s.d.",

        "For example, for cases in which there was a pause (defined for purposes of this analysis as a silence of greater than 200 ms) on only one side of the inserted word, the pause was never after the insertion (X) for the repairs",
        "and rarely before the X in the false positives.",
        "Note that values do not add up to 100% because cases of no pauses, or pauses on both sides are not included in the table.",
        "A second distinguishing characteristic was the FO value of X.",
        "For repairs, the inserted word was nearly always higher in FO than the preceding M1; for false positives, this increase in FO was rarely observed.",
        "Table 6 shows the results of combining the acoustic constraints in Table 5.",
        "As can be seen, although acoustic features may be helpful individually, certain combinations of features widen the gap between observed rates of repairs and false positives possessing the relevant set of features.",
        "Finally, in a preliminary study of the cue words \"no\" and \"well,\" we compared 9 examples of these words at the site of a repair to 15 examples of the same words occurring in fluent speech.",
        "We found that these groups were quite distinguishable on the basis of simple prosodic features.",
