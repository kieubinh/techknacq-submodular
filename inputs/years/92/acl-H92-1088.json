      "text": [
        "A persistent problem for keyword-driven speech recognition systems is that users often embed the to-be-recognized words or phrases in longer utterances.",
        "The recognizer needs to locate the relevant sections of the speech signal and ignore extraneous words.",
        "Prosody might provide an extra source of information to help locate target words embedded in other speech.",
        "In this paper we examine some prosodic characteristics of 160 such utterances and compare matched read and spontaneous versions.",
        "Half of the utterances are from a corpus of spontaneous answers to requests for the name of a city, recorded from calls to Directory Assistance Operators.",
        "The other half are the same word strings read by volunteers attempting to model the real dialogue.",
        "Results show a consistent pattern across both sets of data: embedded city names almost always bear nuclear pitch accents and are in their own intonational phrases.",
        "However the distributions of tonal make-up of these prosodic features differ markedly in read versus spontaneous speech, implying that if algorithms that exploit these prosodic regularities are trained on read speech, then the probabilities are likely to be incorrect models of real user speech."

        "This work addresses two related questions.",
        "One is whether spontaneous goal-directed utterances collected from real users in a particular application domain exhibit reliable prosodic patterns that could be exploited by recognition algorithms.",
        "We focus on to-be-recognized words that are spoken within longer utterances, in order to investigate whether these embedded words have particular prosodic characteristics that could help a recognizer to locate them.",
        "One of the original motivations for this study was our observation from informal listening to our corpus that such embedded words bear nuclear pitch accents.",
        "If this is a consistent pattern, it would mean that they are (1) louder, longer and more clearly articulated than they would be without nuclear accents, and (2) they would bear characteristic fundamental frequency movements.",
        "Corpora of spontaneous goal-directed speech from real users are not readily obtainable, and so it is common practice to record speech read out by volunteers in order to develop, train and test recognition algorithms.",
        "To the extent that the prosody of read speech differs from that of spontaneous goal-directed speech, such \"laboratory\" corpora may obscure or misrepresent any reliable prosodic properties found in spontaneous \"real user\" speech.",
        "Consequently the second question investigated in this work is whether such patterns can also be found in recordings of speech read out by volunteers.",
        "We are interested in prosodic differences between read and spontaneous speech because of their relevance to speech recognition, and for increasing the naturalness of synthetic speech.",
        "It is worth pointing out a methodological issue at this stage: the prosody used when people are reading can of course differ dramatically from that used in spontaneous communication.",
        "Speech databases that we know of vary widely in how much effort was taken to ensure that the prosody of the speech realistically reflects the speech that recognizers have to deal with in real-world applications.",
        "In this experiment we chose to do everything we could to encourage our volunteers to use realistic spontaneous-sounding prosody.",
        "Most existing speech corpora used in the recognition field have been collected with less emphasis on realistic prosody.",
        "We therefore believe that the read speech in this experiment is as similar as possible to spontaneously produced utterances.",
        "The degree of prosodic similarity that we report between read and spontaneous speech represent a \"best case\"."

        "Our particular application is automatic recognition of the name of a city in telephone calls to a Directory Assistance Operator.",
        "A corpus of 26,946 recordings of real users has been collected and was reported on in detail in a previous DARPA meeting[1].",
        "In each case a caller was played an automated request for the name of a city.",
        "In 37% of those utterances that do contain a city name, that city name is embedded in a longer string of connected speech.",
        "In some cases there is relatively little extraneous material (\"In Boston, please\"), but often (55% in this corpus) there is considerably more (\"Yes Ma' m Central Auto Service in",
        "Stoughton, please.\").",
        "We refer to these as \"complex embed-ded\" utterances.",
        "In all of these embedded utterances speakers have considerably more options concerning how they say the speech than when they say only an isolated city name, and so we would expect prosody to contribute significantly to the variability in the signal.",
        "The current study deals with the complex embedded utterances, because (i) these represent the more serious challenge for speech recognition, and (ii) these contain richer prosodic variation that is more representative of spontaneous speech in other discourse domains.",
        "Although the current study focuses on a telephone network application, we believe that the results have general applicability to the behavior of users of spoken language systems (SLS).",
        "Often users will answer a request for a single item of information with a sentence containing not only the requested item, but also (1) extraneous material, and (2) answers to anticipated subsequent requests in the discourse.",
        "For example, in an ATIS-like domain, a user may answer a request for a destination with \"I'd like to arrive in Boston on Tuesday morning before 9:30 am\", bundling the arrival day and arrival time into the same utterance.",
        "Prosody can mark all of the discourse-relevant information-bearing words in such an answer, and so could help a SLS to avoid reprompting for material that has already been said.",
        "For this investigation, we selected 80 of the spontaneous complex embedded utterances that reflected the variation in length and structure of the larger set.",
        "Each utterance was spoken by a different speaker, half of the speakers were male and half were female.",
        "The shortest utterance was two words (\"Arlington, McCarthy\") and the longest was twenty words (\"Have you a listing in Jamaica Plain for Robert Scheinkopf-S-C-H-E-I-N-K-O-P-F\").",
        "Half of the 80 utterances were in \"telegram\" style - bearing few or no function words (\"Boston Woolworth's on Washington Street\"), and the set was chosen to reflect variation in whether the target city name was a first, medial, or last content word in the utterance.",
        "We then collected a matched corpus in which volunteers called an automated recording facility in our laboratory and read out orthographic transcriptions of the same utterances.",
        "Participants knew that these texts were originally spoken by people calling Directory Assistance asking for information about a telephone number, and were encouraged to rehearse the items several times before calling with this in mind.",
        "Participants confirmed during subsequent debriefing that they had tried to make their utterances sound realistically natural, acting out the situation of making a telephone call to get information.",
        "Each participant read a list of 25 sentences: the first and last two were fillers, and one of the middle sentences was the utterance relevant to the current study.",
        "This \"read speech\" corpus consists of 2000 utterances altogether, collected from 80 volunteers, of which one utterance per reader is used in this investigation.",

        "Because transcriptions are linear strings of symbols, one way to calculate agreement between 2 transcribers is: Agreement = 100 (Matches Matches + Insertions + Substitutions) where: Matches = number of symbols in the string where the transcribers agree concerning location and the symbol itself', Insertions = number of symbols marked by one transcriber only (an omission by either transcriber is equivalent to an insertion by the other), and Substitutions = number of locations where each transcriber used a different symbol.",

        "Exact match means both transcribers had to use exactly the same symbols in the same locations to score a match.",

        "Near boundary match: (1) a 0 (z.-- cliticized word) matches a 1 (= normal phrase-medial interword boundary), (2) a 1 matches a 2 (= separation between words, but with no tonal correlates of a boundary) If agreement includes near-matches, then we have clearly met the reliability criteria.",
        "If not, then we still have met it in the tonal transcriptions, but not in the boundary transcriptions.",

        "Our initial informal impression which motivated this study was borne out by the transcriptions: in both corpora the embedded city names usually bear a nuclear accent (94% of spontaneous, 97% of read utterances, no significant differences), and are set off in an intonational phrase of their own.",
        "Moreover the tonal combinations carried by these city names represent only a relatively small subset of the possible combinations that can occur in spoken English.",
        "Within the transcription framework used in this study, there are 16 different possible combinations of pitch accent, phrase accent and boundary tone (the three tonal elements of a city name in most of our corpus).",

        "These same five tunes occurred in both the read and the spontaneous corpora.",
        "We interpret this as another similarity between the read and spontaneous corpora: the readers not only succeeded in putting nuclear accents on the city names, but also chose from the same inventory that is used in spontaneous interactions in this domain.",
        "However",
        "although the embedded city names were almost all nuclear in the read and spontaneous utterances, the distributions of the five tunes across the corpora were not at all the same.",
        "It is commonplace in the literature to categorize nuclear pitch very grossly movements into rising (or high level) versus falling.",
        "This corresponds in our case largely to the phrase accent being H or L (this would not be the case if there had been any L phrase accents followed by HI boundary tones).",
        "In Table 2 we compare the read and spontaneous versions of 791 of the pairs of city names according to this gross division.",
        "For the few city names that bore prenuclear H* accents, we categorized them as falling if the next accent was either a L* or downstepped, else as rising.",

        "In fact, less than half of the data (46%) lies in these two cells.",
        "The main reason is that 47% of the city names were spoken with a rising intonation in spontaneous versions, but with falling intonation in the read versions.",
        "This shift from rising to falling intonation is also reflected in the marginal totals: 73% of the spontaneous city names had rises, but only 34% of their read counterparts did.",
        "The data argue that prosody is not directly derivable from the word string itself.",
        "Two possible reasons for this difference are:",
        "• A rising intonation is a marker of politeness in this particular dialogue context.",
        "When volunteers participate in a recording session, even when they attempt to act out the real dialogue, they do not feel compelled to be polite to the recording equipment.",
        "• In the real interaction with a telephone operator the speaker uses rising intonation to seek confirmation that the operator has indeed understood the city 1.",
        "One of the read versions was truncated in such a way that it had to be left out of this analysis",
        "name.",
        "Speakers may not be consciously aware that they do this, and so fail to replicate it when attempting to emulate the interaction The preponderance of falls in read speech, when compared to the preponderance of rises in spontaneous speech, has a number of implications for speech technology.",
        "One of these concerns the acoustic models in a recognizer: low final boundary tones (which are located at the right hand edge of most of the falling nuclear accents, and therefore are common in read speech) tend to be associated with laryngealization and devoicing of the segmental material.",
        "Consequently these spectral effects will be built into acoustic models that are trained on read speech, but will be the exception rather than the rule in the spontaneous speech that a recognizer will ultimately have to process.",
        "These rising-versus-falling differences also bear on a potential use of prosody for speech understanding systems: in a system where the user can both ask questions and also deliver answers to questions asked by the system itself, the natural language processing part of the discourse manager could be helped if it could use prosody to distinguish between these two different speech acts.",
        "Suggestions have been made that questions usually have high or rising intonation, whereas information-delivering statements usually have falling intonation.",
        "The current results indicate that at least in the application domain used in this experiment, this distinction is more complicated.",
        "Users are delivering information in response to a question from the system, rather than asking the system a direct question themselves, and yet they use rising tunes more often than falling.",
        "The tonal differences between the corpora were not restricted to the phrase accents alone.",
        "In read speech, 81% of the city names carried a H*, whereas in spontaneous speech this was only 52%, with the remaining cases bearing either a L+H* (35%) or a L* (8%).",
        "The majority of the city names were final in their intonational phrase, and therefore contained an additional boundary tone on the right.",
