        "The performance of speech recognizers often degrades dramatically in noise, with different talking styles, when the microphone is changed, and as a talker moves relative to a microphone.",
        "New auditory front ends that mimic some aspects of human auditory-nerve and psychoacoustic behavior have been proposed to reduce these problems.",
        "Although past limited experiments suggest that these front ends improve robustness, no thorough comparisons have been performed using high-performance Hidden Markov Model (HMM) recognizers.",
        "In addition, few studies have evaluated the effect of speech babble noise and frequency response variability on performance or explored alternative approaches to feature reduction.",
        "This is an early progress report on research in this area.",
        "Further ongoing experiments are exploring additional front ends and alternative data reduction techniques."
