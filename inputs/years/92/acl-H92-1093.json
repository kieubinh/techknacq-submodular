        "The N-Best rescoring paradigm involves the generation of a list of the N best sentence hypotheses by a recognition system and the subsequent rescoring of these hypotheses by other knowledge sources.",
        "The sentence hypotheses are then reranked according to a weighted linear combination of the different scores.",
        "This paradigm has the potential of achieving better performance than that of any individual knowledge source, if these scores are combined in an \"optimal\" manner.",

        "In the initial work [1], the weights used in the linear score combination were chosen to minimize the generalized mean of the rank of the correct hypothesis using an iterative search algorithm based on Powell's method [2].",
        "Further experience using this technique suggested that the result was very sensitive to the large number of local minima in the optimization criterion.",
        "Several steps have been taken to address this issue.",
        "The optimization criterion now minimizes the average word error in the top ranking hypothesis.",
        "The use of this criterion results in a \"smoother\" weight space, i.e., having fewer local minima.",
        "Also addressing the problem of local minima, we examine a large number of points in the weight space on a lattice spanning the range of probable weights.",
        "Powell's method may be used with points on the grid as the initial estimate of weights to find the best performance, or the points on a fine grid may be evaluated directly.",
        "The error function is piecewise constant over the weight â€¢This research was jointly funded by NSF and DARPA under NSF grant number IRI-8902124.",
        "space.",
        "A particular ranking of the hypotheses corresponds to a region (cell) defined by a set of inequalities that describe a polytope.",
        "In the hope of obtaining a more robust estimate, we measure the amount of slack for the different coefficients along the coordinate axes such that the weight remains within the cell as well as determine the \"center\" of the cell.",
        "The product of the slacks in the different coordinate directions at the \"center\" is an approximate indicator of the \"volume\" of the cell.",
        "If more than one cell gives the same performance, we choose the one with the largest \"volume\".",
        "Weights which correspond to the \"center\" of this cell are used for combining scores in the test set."

        "Experiments were conducted to gain a better understanding of the weight space.",
        "In our implementation of the N-Best rescoring paradigm [1], the N-Best list (N = 20) is generated by the BBN BYBLOS system [3].",
        "This list is rescored by the BU system, which is based on the stochastic segment model (SSM) [4, 5], a statistical model for the sequence of observations that comprise a phoneme segment.",
        "The SSM models are based on independent-frame assumptions, are gender-dependent and are context-dependent with context tying based on automatic clustering.",
        "Results are reported on the speaker-independent Resource Management corpus using the Word-Pair grammar.",

        "The training of weights may be either gender-dependent or gender-independent.",
        "Figure 1 and Figure 2 show contour plots for the word error distribution as a function of normalized HMM and SSM scores on the two test sets, keeping the phoneme and word insertion penalties fixed at typical values.",
        "The contours have been drawn for the ten lowest word errors, with intensity being inversely proportional to error.",

        "The weight space for the two test sets appears vastly different.",
        "The effects of gender-independent optimization is shown in Figure 2.",
        "Though the Oct 89 figure has fewer local optima, it must be noted that the best region for one test set still does not match that of the other.",
        "Normalizing the acoustic scores shows that the HMM is weighted higher than the SSM, but the weights are of the same order of magnitude.",
        "The word vs. phoneme count contours (not shown) suggest that typical values of the word penalty are about 3-5 times that of the phoneme penalty.",
        "Our current word recognition results on the Feb 89 test set are 4.2% for SSM and 2.8% for the combined system (HMM-SSM) using weights estimated on this test set.",
        "Using the same weights and testing on the Oct 89 test set, the results are 4.8% for the SSM and 3.3% for the combined system.",
        "Combining the SSM with the BBN HMM yields a 13% reduction in error rate over the HMM performance alone which was 3.8%."
