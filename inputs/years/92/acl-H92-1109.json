        "The major objective of this program is to develop and demonstrate robust, high-performance continuous speech recognition (CSR) techniques and systems focused on applications in spoken language systems (SLS).",
        "A key supporting objective is to develop techniques for integration of CSR, and natural language processing (NLP) systems in SLS applications.",
        "The CSR techniques are based on a continuous-observation hidden Markov model (HMM) approach, using tied Gaussian mixtures to model the speech parameters.",
        "A stack-decoder control structure is being developed and utilized, both for efficient large-vocabulary recognition, and to facilitate integration of CSR and NLP systems."

      "text": [
        "The Lincoln program began with a focus on improving speaker stress robustness for the fighter aircraft environment.",
        "A robust HMM isolated-word recognition (IWR) system was developed with very high performance under stress conditions.",
        "The robust HMM system has since been adapted and extended to large vocabulary CSR.",
        "This effort has included the development of a number of new modeling and recognition techniques, and the resulting tied-mixture HMM CSR system achieved state-of-the-art performance for both speaker-dependent (SD) and speaker-independent (SI) recognition on the DARPA Resource Management (RM) database.",
        "Current work focuses on extension to the new Wall Street Journal (WSJ) CSR corpus, with vocabularies of 5,000- 20,000 words.",
        "'This work was sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.",
