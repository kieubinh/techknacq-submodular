        "• Evaluation of SRI's NL, SLS, and speech recognition technologies.",
        "SRI's February-92 weighted error rate for ATIS class A and D utterances combined was 31.0% for NL and 45.4% for SLS.",
        "SRI's February-92 SPREC word error rate for all ATIS utterances was 11.0%.",
        "For the speaker-independent, closed 5K vocabulary CSR task, SRI achieved a 16.6% word error rate in the verbalized punctuation test and a 17.1% word error rate in the non-verbalized-punctuation test, using the standard bigram language model.",
        "• Encouraging initial results in a study of verbal repairs in the ATIS MADCOW corpus; the study included analysis and classification of the repairs in the corpus as well as a method using both pattern matching techniques and acoustic evidence to detect and correct the repairs.",
        "• Implementation of RASTA filtering (high-pass filtering in the Log Spectral domain to remove time-invariant or slow moving linear channel effects) to improve channel robustness.",
        "• Experiments showing differences between spontaneous and read speech and the need for including spontaneous speech in training, development, and test sets.",
        "• Development of infrastructure necessary for dealing with very large vocabularies and language models such as those associated with the CSR corpus.",
        "• Improvement in GEMINI natural-language processing system's linguistic coverage of a 2100-utterance ATIS traning corpus to 92% syntactic coverage, 77% semantic coverage.",
        "• Development of algorithms for tracking evolving discourse structure.",
        "On the development set of the ATIS corpus, we find these algorithms correctly determine the discourse context with greater than 90% accuracy.",
        "• Improvements to the template matcher: new templates, improved portability, more linguistic knowledge incorporated, reduced overgeneration, improved context handling, improved coverage of database retrieval component, all without significantly increasing response time, which is still less than a second.",
        "• Analysis of data on human-machine problem solving using our SLS ATIS system: we have analyzed the effect on user satisfaction and system performance of system errors, user experience, and instructions to users.",
        "We have also explored trade-offs of time vs.speed and user satisfaction.",
        "• Collection of data (speech, transcriptions, and log-files) using our SLS ATIS system.",
        "To date this includes 72 speakers, 2301 utterances, and 134 scenarios.",
        "• Improvements in the SLS ATIS demo system, including better paraphrasing of system's understanding, easier to read displays, improved system error messages, simpler control of context mechanism.",
        "• Development with MIT of a method for end-to-end evaluation that takes into account the whole interaction; implementation of the method is in progress."

        "word-accuracy performance for the ATIS and CSR domains with better models of the channel, speaker, and spontaneous speech effects."
