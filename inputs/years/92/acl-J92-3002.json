        "The lexicon is a large and complex set of information about the words used in a grammar or natural language processing system.",
        "Its importance has become more central in the research of the past decade, which has seen the rise of radically lexical-ized theories such as head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG), in which phrase structure rules play a vestigial role.",
        "Newer theories place increasingly high demands on lexical representation.",
        "A simple calculation may illustrate the quandary of lexical representation: feature systems for contemporary systems normally distinguish at least 30 features (while 40 or 50 is not rare).",
        "The number of values a feature takes ranges from 2 to the number of categories (more exactly, to the number of sequences or sets of a small size, where all the members of the sequence, etc.",
        "are categories).",
        "Under the undoubtedly optimistic assumption that feature value ranges could be reduced to booleans, we still are faced with 230 109 feature combinations – whose individual",
        "representation is clearly to be avoided, not \"solved.'",
        "The natural tack is certainly to represent just the categories actually used in the vocabulary, but this could incur a good deal of redundancy if it meant that each feature combination were represented separately on each word.",
        "The structured or hierarchical lexicon solves this difficulty (cf. Flickinger, Pollard, and Wasow 1985 and Flickinger 1987).",
        "In structured lexicons, word classes may stand in a relationship of inheritance to one another, in which case the properties of the bequeathing class accrue automatically to the inheriting class.",
        "Once we allow that a single class may be heir to more than one bequeathing class, we allow, in principle, that no word class property ever need be examined more than once.",
        "Thus we eliminate one central source of redundancy in lexical specification.",
        "One of the goals of this paper is to motivate the use of inheritance in lexical specification.",
        "To do this, we take a narrowly circumscribed phenomenon in English grammar – that of vp-complementtaking adjectives, as in hard + to deliver – and spell out the lexical specifications a thorough treatment demands.",
        "The sheer complexity of these specifications cries out for a redundancy-eliminating approach, and we propose a structured lexicon treatment.",
        "The grammatical analysis not only serves to motivate the general approach, it also illustrates several key issues in the design of structured lexicons, such as the use of default inheritance, the need for lexical rules, and the range of phenomena amenable to this sort of treatment.",
        "The goals of this paper are to introduce the structured lexicon in a fairly simple form, to motivate its basic theoretical device, that of inheritance, with a real example taken from an existing system, and finally to show how the elimination of redundancy achieved with the structured lexicon aids in maintaining the lexicon.",
        "We argue for improved maintainability by examining concrete extensions and potential modifications of the grammatical description provided.",
        "We turn now to a brief characterization of this phenomenon.",
        "The rich collection of syntactic and semantic phenomena exhibited by a familiar group of adjectives such as tough and easy present a challenge to those who seek to provide explicit formal characterizations of linguistic properties.",
        "We offer here a detailed description of the properties of these adjectives, involving optional and obligatory complementation, control, long-distance dependence, optional modification, and specification.",
        "The purpose of this description here is not the linguistic analysis itself (which we find interesting nonetheless), but rather its use in demonstrating the practical utility of inheritance as a tool for linguistic description, and also the predictive analytical power that inheritance affords in the study of the lexicon.",
        "In illustration of the latter, we extend our analysis of easy adjectives to a similar group of nouns such as pleasure, and then to the unusual adverbs too and enough, which function as specifiers in adjectival gradation.",
        "The fundamental data are illustrated in (1); examples such as these have not attracted attention in computational linguistics, even if they have often appeared in studies within the generative framework.",
        "An early discussion of them is found in Miller and Chomsky (1963), with a score and more of additional studies published in the years since.",
        "Most of the salient properties of these adjectives have already been brought to light, but in piecemeal fashion and most often as part of a larger debate about the nature of unbounded dependencies, where detailed syntactic and semantic characterizations of these missing object constructions proved less important.'",
        "We",
        "return to the characteristic properties of these adjectives in Section 3, where they are catalogued and given formal representation.",

        "It is easy to talk to Bill.",
        "c. Bill is easy for Mary to talk to.",
        "d. It is easy for Mary to talk to Bill.",
        "We chose this phenomenon as a vehicle to recommend lexical inheritance because it illustrates a wide range of grammatical phenomena, all of which make demands on lexical resources (at least in the lexicalized grammar in which the analysis is framed).",
        "In addition to the grammatical demands, the data justify the use of a lexical rule (derivational rule) to relate pairs such as (a) and (b) in (1) – so we shall argue at any rate – thus illustrating a further inheritance-like relationship in the lexicon.",
        "The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 summarizes the aspects of HPSG that are important to our proposal, and Section 3 develops the fundamental analysis that Section 4 illustrates in a series of analytical \"snapshots\" of a single example.",
        "Section 5 suggests extensions of the fundamental analysis, especially to further lexical classes (developing the argument that structured lexicons are easily maintained and extended), and a final section summarizes and suggests directions for future work.",
        "Appendix A presents the framework for lexical description developed in Flickinger et al.",
        "(1985) and Flickinger (1987).",
        "The framework is convenient for feature-based grammars, but it allows the specification of other lexical properties as well.",
        "This Appendix presents a notation that is precise while avoiding redundancy, e.g., in characterizing the kinds of complements that these adjectives permit, and in expressing the relationships that hold between pairs like the easy of (1a) and that of (lb).",
        "Since a fundamental claim of hierarchical lexicons is that they eliminate redundancy and thus improve modifiability, there is a second appendix, Appendix B, which demonstrates the modifiability of the structured lexicon."

        "Any attempt to do so seems to run afoul of the standard (if limited) determination and adjectival modification found in phrases such as no great pleasure to watch; at least such examples point out the inevitable duplication a semantic analysis would incur if predicative nominals had no denotation.",
        "We therefore interpret pleasure as a three-place relation pleasure (theme : e, for : x, soa : s) which obtains just in case e is the pleasure x has in case s. It should of course also turn out that this relation for some e holds iff pleasant (for : x, soa : y), but we will not be concerned with showing that here.",

      "heading": "6.2 Hypotheses or Tools?",
      "text": [
        "The conclusions above may be read as a plea for the employment of an important tool in computational linguistics, and, indeed, we see the primary significance of the use of structured lexicons not in new expressive power which they bring to natural language processing or description (there is perhaps none), but rather in the increased ease and reliability with which they allow old hypotheses to be formulated and put to use.",
        "Brachman (1983, p. 35) summarizes the dominant view of inheritance in knowledge representation: Even though much has been made in the past of the significance of inheritance in semantic nets, no one has been able to show that it makes any difference in the expressive power of the system that advertises it...",
        "It is strictly implementational.",
        "Given this authority on the technical side, it may be surprising to hear more application-oriented users of inheritance mechanisms hedging at all on whether there is any scientific significance to the proposal here.",
        "But there is at least a potential candidate: lexical rules may distinguish inherited from specified information.",
        "In expressing the relationships between members of two sets of lexical entries, we make crucial use of the distinction between idiosyncratically specified information (which appears in a sparse [nonredundant] lexical entry) and inherited information.",
        "We have adopted here the restrictive hypothesis, proposed in Flickinger (1987), that lexical rules hold for minimally specified lexical entries, without having access to inherited, predictable information.",
        "Adopting this hypothesis imposes a constraint on the form and function of lexical rules that is strong, perhaps too strong, but one that allows a simpler formulation of rules by keeping to a minimum the amount of information to be managed.",
        "Only two kinds of information are relevant for a lexical rule: the word classes that each of the two related entries belong to, and any idiosyncratic properties specified by either lexical entry.",
        "We note that if lexical rules were insensitive to the distinction between idiosyncratic and predictable properties of lexical entries, the statement of even a simple rule like LR-PAST, given earlier, would be much more difficult.",
        "If the lexical rule for past tense verbs had to cope with fully specified entries that blurred this distinction, it would be difficult to express in the rule just which properties of the one entry had to match in the other, related entry.",
        "For example, the verb like idiosyncratically requires a verbal complement that is either infinitival or gerundive, while the verb enjoy does not allow the infinitival form, allowing only the gerundive form for its complement.",
        "Since all of the inflected forms of like allow the same choice of two permissible forms for the verbal complement, while all of the inflected forms of enjoy insist on the gerundive complement, the lexical rules like LR-PAST or the similar one for present third singular forms must preserve these idiosyncracies.",
        "Yet a fully specified entry for the base form enjoy stipulates not just the form of the complement, which would have to be identical in the present third singular entry enjoys; the fully specified base entry for enjoy also specifies that its subject be unmarked for number, an indifference that crucially must not be shared by the entry for enjoys.",
        "Short of tagging each attribute value in a fully specified entry as local or inherited, it is not clear how the lexical rule for present third singular forms could be constrained to ensure identity of the verbal complement's VFORM value while ignoring differences in the subject's AGREEMENT value for these two entries for enjoy.",
        "In sharp contrast, this difference in idiosyncratic vs. inherited information can be exploited by lexical rules without stipulation when they are constrained to apply only to minimally specified entries.",
        " It may not be superfluous to add that, even if the argument above about distinguishing inherited and specified information is ultimately fallacious, so that the use of inheritance were seen purely as a tool, and not at all as a scientific hypothesis, it may nonetheless prove to be of great significance, just as many tools have advanced areas of science that nothing to do with their development.",

        "Put differently, one can make use of these word classes to capture generalizations about the elements of the lexicon and to make predictions about the behavior and distribution of a lexical item on the basis of the classes it belongs to.",
        "To avoid redundancy entirely, each property relevant to representing the elements of a lexicon should only be mentioned once in some single class, with all elements of the lexicon that have this property being members of that class.",
        "If so, a given lexical item may have to belong to many classes in order to obtain all of its properties.",
        "These word classes form a hierarchy over which rules are defined that govern the inheritance of information from class to class, and ultimately to individual lexical entries.",
        "One of the nicest aspects of this idea is that it is readily visualized (cf.",
        "Figure 7).",
        "In order to present the class definitions that formally express the properties of the adjectives governing VP complements as collections of attributes with assigned values, we shall make use of the hierarchy of word classes above, where classes inherit their properties from other more general classes, or indeed from several such classes.",
        "This hierarchy of classes is intended as the repository of both the syntactic and semantic properties that comprise the fully fleshed-out lexical entries of a language; we will of course only present a very few of the classes that would populate a complete hierarchy, sufficient we hope to prove the promise of such a representation.",
        "Part of this hierarchy is devoted to specifying the number and types of complements that predicates allow or require, and among this group of word classes is one defining the properties shared by lexical entries that take a subject and a complement that is semantically controlled (possibly by the subject); we label this class simply CONTROL.",
