        "A goal of natural language research is to provide a computer model capable of generating an internal representation for the meaning of each sentence processed.",
        "The building of this representation can be approached in two ways.",
        "The first approach requires the generation of an unambiguous internal representation for each sentence before attempting to represent subsequent sentences.",
        "There are, however, several problems with this approach.",
        "First, the enumeration and testing of each possible reading of an ambiguous sentence to determine which is correct can require significant computational resources.",
        "Second, an application may not require the precise meaning for a sentence; hence, determining a single meaning would be a waste of resources.",
        "Third, many times an ambiguous sentence cannot be disambiguated until information contained in subsequent sentences has been processed.",
        "Another approach, the one adopted in this paper, is to use an intermediate representation called logical form (LF) (Schubert and Pelletier 1984; Allen 1987; Harper 1988) to avoid immediately committing to a single meaning of an ambiguous sentence.",
        "LF partially specifies the meaning of a sentence based on syntactic and sentence-level information, without considering the effects of pragmatics and context.",
        "This partial specification of meaning allows us to process additional sentences before further limiting the meaning of an ambiguous sentence.",
        "Later, as relevant information becomes available (from a context processing module), the intermediate representation of the ambiguous sentence can be incrementally updated.",
        "This process can continue until all of the ambiguities are resolved and an unambiguous internal representation of the sentence is generated (although this is not a requirement of the approach).",
        "The process of mapping a sentence to an unambiguous internal representation is shown in Figure 1.",
        "Because LF is a component of a computer model for language comprehension, it must be designed with two goals in mind.",
        "First, it should accurately model the",
        "An architecture for language processing.",
        "linguistic behavior of language.",
        "Second, it should be computationally tractable.",
        "In fact, we have defined three constraints for using LF in a computational framework (Harper 1988, 1990).",
        "1.",
        "Compactness Constraint: The compactness constraint, which captures the spirit of LF as presented by Allen (1987), is important in a computer model of language comprehension because of the need to postpone decisions about ambiguity without large storage requirements.",
        "LF should compactly represent the underdetermined meaning of a sentence – underdetermined in that ambiguities and anaphora are not resolved.",
        "Ideally, LF should only require polynomial (in the number of words in a sentence) space.",
        "2.",
        "Modularity Constraint: The modularity constraint requires LF to be initially computable from syntax and local (sentence-level) semantics only.",
        "In particular, it should not be initially dependent on contextual information, which requires significantly more computational resources to extract.",
        "3.",
        "Formal Consistency Constraint: The formal consistency constraint requires that any update to the meaning of LF should be a refinement of the original meaning.",
        "Initially, LF provides a composite representation for a sentence.",
        "However, as more information becomes available, the meaning of the sentence is incrementally updated (without contradicting the composite meaning) until all ambiguity is resolved.",
        "To obey the formal consistency constraint, it is important to explicitly detail the syntax and semantics of the LF (see Appendix A for the syntax and semantics of the LF we are about to describe) and to indicate how formal consistency would be violated.",
        "In the next section, we describe how LF has been used to represent quantifier scope ambiguity and how this representation conforms to our computational constraints.",
        "Then, we introduce our LF representations for pronouns, singular definite NPs, and singular indefinite NPs, considering how to update each representation when new information becomes available (though not how to determine that information).",
        "We also discuss an implementation that uses our representations and compare our approach with related work."

        "Quantifier scope ambiguity has been handled by some researchers by using an intermediate scope-neutral LF (e.g., Hobbs 1983; Schubert and Pelletier 1984; Allen 1987) for the initial representation of sentences.",
        "Hence, sentences like Someone loves everyone are initially represented without committing to one particular meaning, as shown in Example 1.",

        "Another type of scope-neutral form initially gives universal quantifiers scope over all existentials.",
        "This solution provides a general reading that in many cases subsumes readings where the existential is outside of the scope of the universal.",
        "However, if we are to handle NPs containing pronouns and sentences with verb phrase ellipsis, this solution is inadequate.",
        "An LF that avoids committing to a single meaning must be capable of being updated once information is available to limit the scoping possibilities.",
        "There are a variety of mechanisms for expressing scoping decisions.",
        "For example, Schubert and Pelletier (1984) indicate quantifier scoping by extracting and linearly ordering the quantifiers to the left of the predicate-argument structure.",
        "Allen (1987) indicates for each pair of quantifiers which one has scope over the other; a method that is not limited to a linear sequence of operators.",
        "Finally, Creaney and McTear (1990) use constraints to limit scope possibilities.",

        "Consider a sentence with four quantifiers, two universals and two existentials: Every boy; wanted every girls to introduce a friend of his, to a friend of hers.",
        "It should be possible for every boy to have scope over a friend of his, without having scope over a friend of hers.",
        "Similarly, every girl could have scope over a friend of hers, but not a friend of his.",
        "There is no way to express this with a linear quantifier scoping string, but Allen and Creaney and McTear have no trouble indicating nonlinear scoping using their approaches.",
        "A scope-neutral LF compactly represents a sentence.",
        "Since the size of the scope-neutral representation is directly proportional to the length of the sentence, it is consistent with the compactness constraint.",
        "This representation also avoids committing to",
        "a single meaning by separating the process of making a scoping decision from the process of constructing the initial representation for a sentence and its constituents (this separation is consistent with the modularity constraint).",
        "Later, when enough information becomes available to make a scoping decision, there are several different methods for indicating which quantifier has scope over the other.",
        "These modifications commit to one of the meanings encoded in the scope-neutral form and so are compatible with the formal consistency constraint.",
        "There are other types of semantic ambiguities in addition to quantifier scope ambiguity that can be handled by using LF.",
        "For example, the meanings of pronouns, singular definite NPs, and singular indefinite NPs often cannot be determined without additional contextual information.",
        "Postponing decisions about the precise meanings of sentences containing these types of constituents could be extremely useful, as the following example illustrates: Every man showed a boy a picture of his mother.",
        "The precise meaning of the sentence cannot be specified until information is available to select the pronoun's antecedent and to determine the quantifier scoping.",
        "The pronoun his can have many different antecedents, including: every man, a boy, some entity introduced in other sentences, or some individual in the environment of the speaker or hearer.",
        "The meaning of his mother is ambiguous because it depends on the pronoun's antecedent.",
        "Also, a picture of his mother is ambiguous; its meaning cannot be determined until we determine the meaning of his mother and decide whether the universally quantified NP has scope over the indefinite.",

        "However, to provide a file card for his mother, the model must know that his refers to every man; accommodation requires more than syntax and sentence-level information to provide the representation for some definite NPs.",
        "Additionally, Heim's model would have trouble handling any definite NPs without an accommodation link to a previous NP in the discourse model.",
        "Heim's approach requires a considerable amount of information before a definite or indefinite NP is represented in file change semantics (including quantifier scoping information and pronoun antecedents).",

        "On the other hand, discourse binding is needed to handle anaphoric dependencies on things that don't c-command a pronoun or anaphoric definite.",
        "For example, consider the sentence Every miner who owns a donkey beats it.",
        "In Robert's approach, if a donkey had c-commanded it, then no discourse referent would be created for it; instead, the pronoun would be represented using the discourse referent of its antecedent.",
