        "This was achieved by comparing two systems to see if their actual difference in performance stands out in comparison with the results for random combinations of their scores.",

        "A key element in hypothesis testing is obviously the hypothesis.",
        "Statistics can be used to reject a hypothesis.",
        "In statistical hypothesis testing, it is important to compose the hypothesis in such a way as to be able to use statistics to reject it and to thereby be able to conclude that something of interest is true.",
        "The hypothesis formulated to be rejected is called the null hypothesis.",
        "In Table 1, some elementary terms are defined, including the null hypothesis.",
        "We are interested in determining whether two systems are significantly different in their performance on a MUC-4 test set.",
        "To conclude that two systems are significantly different, we would formulate null hypotheses of the following form to be tested for each test set: The absolute value of the difference between System X's overall recall (precision, F-measure) score for the data extraction task and System Y's overall recall (precision, F-measure) score for the data extraction task is approximately equal to zero.",
        "If this null hypothesis can be rejected, then we can conclude that the systems are significantly different.",
        "Another key element in hypothesis testing found within the null hypothesis is the test statistic.",
        "A test statistic is a function which can be applied to a set of sample data to produce a single numerical value.",
        "A simple example of a test statistic is recall, which is a function of the number correct, the number partially correct, and the number of possible fills.",
        "The test statistic we used in our hypothesis testing is the absolute value of the difference in recall, precision, or F-measure of systems.",
        "Observations are instances of a set of random variables.",
        "An example of an observation is the four-tuple for a MUC-4 message consisting of the number possible, actual, correct, and partially correct.",
        "This four-tuple plays an important role in our application of the approximate randomization method.",
        "The final key element in hypothesis testing is some means of generating the probability distribution of the test statistic under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.",
        "Instead of assuming a distribution, such as the Normal distribution, we empirically generate the distribution as illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "As shown, the significance level is the area under the distribution curve bounded on the lower end by the actual value of the test statistic .The significance level is the probability that a test statistic that is as extreme or more extreme than the actual value could have arisen by chance, given the null hypothesis.",
        "Thus, the lower the significance level, the more likely it is that the two systems are significantly different."

        "Traditional statistical analysis requires knowledge of or an assumption about the distribution of the data in the sample.",
        "We do not know the distribution for our sample and prefer to not make an assumption about it.",
        "Computationally-intensive methods empirically generate the distribution.",
        "Exact randomization testing generates all of the logically possible outcomes and compares the actual outcome to these.",
        "This amount of generation is often impractical because of the large number of data points involved, so approximate randomization is used instead.",
        "A confidence level is calculated to indicate how close the approximate randomization is to the exact randomization.",
        "The method of approximate randomization involves random shuffling of the data to generate the distribution.",
        "We used the approximate randomization method described by Noreen in [1] with stratified shuffling to control for categorical variables that are not of primary interest in the hypothesis test.",
        "The first step in approximate randomization is to select a test statistic.",
        "Our formulation of the null hypothesis indicates that the test statistic is the absolute value of the difference in recall, precision, or F-measure.",
        "The next step is to input the data.",
        "The data for each test set consists of the four-tuples of number possible, actual, correct, and partially correct for each message for each system.",
        "The actual statistic is calculated for the pair of systems as they come under scrutiny.",
        "The desired number of shuffles is set to 9,999 because it takes about eight hours to run the test for each test set and the confidence levels can be easily looked up in a table given in [1].",
        "We have arbitrarily chosen the cutoff confidence level to be a conservative 99%.",
        "In a test of how the confidence levels were affected by the number of shuffles, 9,999 shuffles produced slightly higher confidence levels than 999 and were worth the 16-fold increase in computing time.",
        "Once the desired number of shuffles is set, the counters for the number of shuffles, ns, and the number of times the pseudostatistic is greater than or equal to the actual statistic, nge, are set to 0.",
        "A loop then increments ns until it has exceeded 9,999, the desired number of shuffles.",
        "The first step in this loop is to shuffle the data, which is the first major operation that occurs during approximate randomization.",
        "Table 2 contains an outline of the major operations involved in approximate randomization.",
        "Figure 2 illustrates the stratified shuffling used for the analysis of the MUC4 results.",

        "The estimate of the significance level is (nge + 1)!",
        "(us + 1) (the l's are added to ensure the test is valid).",
        "The confidence level is found by calculation or table lookup.",
        "In Figure 2, data is shuffled by exchange of the systems' message scores depending on the outcome of a computer-simulated coin flip.",
        "After 100 coin flips, one per message, the absolute value of the difference in the metrics of the resulting pseudosystems can be compared to the corresponding absolute value of the difference in the metrics of the actual systems.",
        "The inequality for the comparison is shown in operation 2 of Table 2.",
        "The value of nge is incremented every time a randomized pair of pseudosystems satisfies this inequality.",
        "The significance level is calculated according to the formula in operation 3 of Table 2.",
        "The corresponding confidence level is then found in the appropriate table in [1].",
        "According to Noreen, Randomization is used to test the generic null hypothesis that one variable (or group of variables) is unrelated to another variable (or group of variables).",
        "Significance is assessed by shuffling one variable (or set of variables) relative to another variable (or set of variables).",
        "Shuffling ensures that there is in fact no relationship between the variables.",
        "If the variables are related, then the value of the test statistic for the original tmshuffled data should be unusual relative to the values of the test statistic that are obtained after shuffling.",
        "I In our case, the four-tuple of data associated with each message for each system is the dependent set of variables that is shuffled.",
        "The explanatory variable is the system.",
        "Shuffling ensures that there is no relationship between the differences in the scores and the systems that produced them, i.e., that the differences were achieved by chance.",
        "If they were not achieved by chance, then the value of the actual test statistic will be far enough out on the tail of the empirically-generated distribution to be significant.",
        "The area under the distribution curve with the lower bound of the actual test statistic will be smaller than the cutoff in this case.",
        "We have arbitrarily chosen the cutoff to be 0.1 because we are able to distinguish reasonable groupings of systems at this level.",
        "At lower cutoffs, too many systems are not significantly different.",
        "The choice of a cutoff has traditionally been based on the practical implications of the choice.",
        "We need more data before we will know more of the implications of the cutoff given the sample sizes that we now have.",
        "The stratified shuffling that was limited to exchange at the message level was the most conservative approach to shuffling because it eliminated the effect of the varying number of slots filled per message in the key.",
        "We did not want to introduce the effect of this nuisance variable.",
        "Instead, we wanted the simplest, most straightforward method to be used for the initial introduction of approximate randomization in this application.",

        "On the other hand, if two systems have similar recall scores, they are likely to produce a high nge and a larger significance level, giving a lower likelihood that the differences are significant A pair of messages that show consistent differences across a range of messages will be more likely to be statistically significantly different in their score than two systems which have a small number of differences appearing in just a few messages.",

        "The pseudostatistic will always be the same as the measured absolute difference between the systems, i.e., 1.5%, so the significance level is 1.0 and the difference is not statistically significant.",
        "Let us suppose that there is a System C with a precision score of 18120 on each of 50 relevant messages and with no spurious templates.",
        "Any random shuffle of Systems A and C is likely to produce a smaller difference than the absolute value of the difference between A and C. The significance level will be extremely close to zero, indicating with virtual certainty that the two systems are significantly different."
