        "In this adjunct test, we investigate the issues and effect of transforming the MUC-4 template design automatically into an object-oriented design, with associated object-level matching conditions affecting the overall score.",
        "An object is simply a collection of slots that all refer to one item originating in the text.",
        "This collection of slots is logically connected due to their implicit reference to one particular filler.",
        "In addition, objects may be nested so that one object contains another object, or may be recursive, with one object pointing to another and back again.",
        "Finally, there may be multiple instances of any given object.",
        "In MUC-4 is is possible to isolate three distinct levels of objects.",
        "The first level contains a STORY object.",
        "Attached to a STORY object are INCIDENT objects, each of which contains participant objects; TARGET, INSTRUMENT and PERPETRATOR.",
        "The Figure 1 illustrates an object-oriented template design.",
        "The MUC template design has been moving from a flat structure to a more object-oriented structure with cross-references tying together multiple slots into what has been termed a \"pseudo-object\".",
        "Slots tied together with cross-references are pseudo-objects and not true objects because the cross-references are not enforced.",
        "For example, consider the following scenario depicted in Figure 2.",
        "Although the human target (\"MARY\") is wrong, the system is allowed partial credit for the other slots, even though they are clearly cross-referenced to different, and equal incorrect, fills."

        "fields in the object, although it could be argued that all that was incorrect was the association of the object with an incorrect incident.",
        "Finally, with objected-oriented totals, it is very easy to isolate performance problems down to the object-level.",
        "With a flat design, less-than-perfect templates must be examined to determine where the problems occurred.",
        "With object matching totals, it is possible to immediately isolate object-level errors which facilitates the error diagnosis process.",
        "The rest of this paper maps out the processes used to transform the flat MUC-4 template design to an object-oriented design.",
        "We then overview the scoring experiments we performed to test the effect of various configurations.",

        "We assign full credit for these fields because the objects align (under the duplicated MUC-4 condition) due to the match of the DESC field.",
        "When objects align, the cross-reference is no longer considered when scoring slots within the object.",
        "These differences in credit assignment account for the small increases in scores in between the official score and our object-oriented duplication (see Figure 4).",
        "As expected, the first condition of incident-match only improved every sites' scores.",
        "This is because sites are now getting credit for those slots that match even when the events in the key clearly do not match the events in the answers.",
        "This is due to the assignment of partial credit as exemplified in Figure 2.",
        "Figure 4 gives the difference between the official MUC-4 score, the duplicated condition, and enforcing string-primacy for object alignment.",
        "As can be seen from this table, the duplicated condition causes small increases in every sites' scores.",
        "However, enforcing the cross-references by requiring either a partial or full match on the object string (if present) did not significantly change the MUC-4 scores.",
        "Finally for \"freefloating\" object matches, there was across-the-board, although small, improvement in the object scores, and in all the total system scores.",
        "The improvement in overall score would be greater than these figures suggest, because each slot of each object that was in the wrong template is counted as both missing (in the correct template) and spurious (in the incorrect template).",

        "Finally, we believe that object-level matching allows for more in-depth diagnosis and evaluation of system performance.",
