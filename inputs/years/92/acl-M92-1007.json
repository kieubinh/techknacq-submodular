        "Our midterm to long-term goals in data extraction from text for the next one to three years are to achieve much greater portability to new languages and new domains, greater robustness, and greater scalability.",
        "The novel aspect to our approach is the use of learning algorithms and probabilistic models to learn the domain-specific and language-specific knowledge necessary for a new domain and new language.",
        "Learning algorithms should contribute to scalability by making it feasible to deal with domains where it would be infeasible to invest sufficient human effort to bring a system up.",
        "Probabilistic models can contribute to robustness by allowing for words, constructions, and forms not anticipated ahead of time and by looking for the most likely interpretation in context.",
        "We began this research agenda approximately two years ago.",
        "During the last twelve months, we have focused much of our effort on porting our data extraction system (PLUM) to a new language (Japanese) and to two new domains.",
        "During the next twelve months, we anticipate porting PLUM to two or three additional domains.",
        "For any group to participate in MUC is a significant investment.",
        "To be consistent with our midterm and longterm goals, we imposed the following constraints on ourselves in participating in MUC-4: We would focus our effort on semi-automatically acquired knowledge.",
        "We would minimize effort on handcrafted knowledge, and most generally.",
        "We would minimize MUC-specific effort.",
        "Though the three self-imposed constraints meant our overall scores on the objective evaluation were not as high as if we had focused on handtuning and handcrafting the knowledge bases, MUC-4 became a vehicle for evaluating our progress on the long-term goals."

        "PLUM had demonstrated quite high recall in MUC-3 and scored among the top systems.",
        "We chose to focus on the following goals in MUC-4: Increasing precision and reducing overgeneration, without hurting recall.",
        "Demonstrating a broad range of tradeoff in recall and precision.",
        "Goal 1: Increasing precision and reducing overgeneration, without hurting recall.",
        "As the graph in Figure 1 shows, we doubled our precision in MUC-4 (compared to MUC-3) and reduced our overgeneration by roughly one third.",
        "The overall impact was to increase PLUM's F-Measure by 50%.",
        "Naturally one would ideally base this measurement on the new test sets for MUC-4 (TST3, TST4); however, between MUC-3 and MUC-4 both the definition of the templates to be produced and the evaluation function changed dramatically, so that there was no easy way to run the MUC-3 version of PLUM on TST3 and TST4 to produce results comparable to that of the MUC-4 version of the system.",
        "However, since the Government had converted our MUC-3 TST2 templates to the MUC-4 format, and since we had never examined the corpus of messages or the answer key to TST2, we could easily use it as a basis for comparison.",
        "Goal 2: Demonstrating a broad range of tradeoff in recall and precision.",
        "As Figure 2 illustrates, the user can select from a broad range of system performance, emphasizing either recall or precision to various degrees.",
        "No system had displayed such a span favoring recall versus favoring precision in MUC-3.",
        "Only one other system, GE's, demonstrated a broad range; at a cost of 17 points of recall, GE's system could achieve an increase of roughly 8 points of precision.",
        "For PLUM, the tradeoff of recall for precision was far more balanced.",
        "Two independent parameters primarily contributed to this: a discrete parameter controlling how aggressively or conservatively two descriptions are fused into a single view of the same event, and a continuously variable threshold on a classification algorithm predicting whether a paragraph is relevant or irrelevant (with respect to reporting any terrorist incident).",
        "Together, these two parameters offer a user the ability to turn a knob to emphasize recall or precision based on their application preference."

      "heading": "KEY SYSTEM FEATURES",
      "text": [
        "Two design features stand out in our minds: partial understanding and statistical language modeling.",
        "By partial understanding we mean that the parser and grammar are designed to find analyses for a non-overlapping sequence of fragments.",
        "When cases of permanent, predictable ambiguity arise, such as a prepositional phrase that can be attached in multiple ways, or most conjoined phrases, the parser finishes the analysis of the current fragment, and begins the analysis of a new fragment.",
        "Therefore, the entities mentioned and some relations between them are processed in every sentence, whether syntactically ill-formed, complex, novel, or straightforward.",
        "Furthermore, this parsing is done using essentially domain-independent syntactic information.",
        "The semantic interpreter and the rest of the system in turn do not assume having complete understanding.",
        "The second key feature is the use of statistical algorithms to guide processing.",
        "Determining the part of speech of highly ambiguous words is done by well-known Markov modeling techniques.",
        "To improve the recognition of Latin American names, we employed a statistically derived five-gram (five letter) model of words of Spanish origin and a similar five-gram model of English words.",
        "This model was integrated into the part-of-speech tagger.",
        "Another usage of statistical algorithms was a statistical induction algorithm to learn case frames for verbs from examples.",
        "This saved substantial effort compared to building the case frames by hand.",
        "The algorithm and empirical results are described in [3].",
        "The statistical methods mentioned above were already available and used in the MUC-3 version of PLUM.",
        "A new statistical algorithm employed in MUC-4 is a classification algorithm that automatically learns features to discriminate among classes.",
        "Given a list of relevant paragraphs and a list of irrelevant ones (made available by New Mexico State University), we employed a chi square measurement to determine word stems (though other features could be used as well) whose presence or absence in text is significantly correlated with the text being relevant (or irrelevant).",
        "Given that ordering, the user must select how many features to use.",
        "At runtime, the classifier sums the logarithm of the odds that the paragraph is relevant given the presence of the features.",
        "If the sum exceeds a user-specified threshold, the paragraph is considered relevant.",
        "If the classifier predicts that the paragraph is relevant, then events found in the paragraph can be used to generate templates; if not, terrorist events that would otherwise have been produced from that paragraph are blocked.",
        "The performance of the overall system, given various thresholds of the text classifier, is shown in Figure 3.",
        "A more detailed description of the system components, their individual outputs, and their knowledge bases is presented in Ayuso et al., [1].",
        "We expect the particular implementations to change and improve substantially during the next three years of research and development."

        "• The percentage of relevant articles was abnormally high for TST3.",
        "• The density of templates produced, i.e., the number of templates per 100 messages was abnormally high, roughly 50% higher than the 1300 message development set, TST1, and TST4.",
        "• The density of human targets produced, i.e., the number of human target slot fills per 100 messages, was abnormally high, roughly double the number in TST1, TST4, or the development corpus.",

        "Taken together, the first two observations above suggest the following: Systems tuned to overgenerate (i.e., produce a high percentage of templates, what Hirschman labels the \"lazy merge problem\" in this volume) should perform significantly better on TST3 than TST4.",
        "The observations above suggest, in part, why PLUM's recall for TST3 was abnormally low:",
        "• PLUM's merging algorithm is under user-control, and was set to avoid overgenemtion, therefore yielding worse performance on TST3 than on TST4.",
        "• A large number of human targets exercise two known weaknesses of the MUC-4 version of PLUM: (1) known, temporary grammar problems and (2) a challenge for discourse processing to be able to collect targets across sentences.",
        "• A bug in the official scoring program was encountered for TST3, but not for TST4.",
        "If this bug is corrected, we",
        "estimate it would improve PLUM's scores by at least one point in recall, at least one point in precision, and at least two points in overgeneration.",
        "(That clearly is not sufficient to fully account for the discrepancy in performance on TST3 and TST4.)",
        "One other point confirming the normalcy of TST4, contrasted with the abnormal characteristics of TST3, can be seen in PLUM's performance under various settings.",
        "Prior to the test, we ran PLUM with numerous parameter settings on TST1, TST2, and one set of 100 messages from the development set.",
        "This predicted the setting that would maximize the F-Measure, or come indistinguishably close to the maximum F-measure.",

        "Successes.",
        "Though the structure of PLUM did not change radically between MUC-3 and MUC-4, the one new component, a statistically based text classification algorithm, was quite successful.",
        "It was trained fully automatically.",
        "Once the system is trained on sets of text representing the various classes, such as relevant paragraphs versus irrelevant paragraphs for the MUC domain, the user need do only two things: select a cutoff for words to be used for each class in the log probability model and set a continuous variable which serves as the threshold for inclusion in a given class.",
        "The result was a significant, continuous tradeoff in recall versus precision.",
        "A second new success in our experience this year was the heuristic for when to merge (fuse) two descriptions into a single event representation.",
        "Many of the heuristics do not require domain-specific knowledge.",
        "The heuristic was not knowledge-intensive, yet significantly reduced oveageneration, while increasing precision.",
        "These two heuristics together enabled us to double precision and reduce overgeneration by one third, thus effecting an overall improvement in performance (F-measure) by 50% compared to the MUC-3 version of PLUM.",
        "What Limited Success.",
        "Having an investment in the terrorist domain and FBIS corpus inhibited significant changes that we might otherwise have made, such as (1) moving away from a purely deterministic parser (i.e., a beam search of width one) to a more general probabilistically controlled beam search, (2) moving from the present semantic interpreter to a more declarative one, and (3) replacing the MUC backend with a general purpose one driven by knowledge bases derived in part from training data.",
        "Improvements Desired.",
        "Improving syntactic coverage is a priority.",
        "Increased coverage normally leads to greater perceived ambiguity in the system; we hope to counter that through probabilistic models.",
        "A second priority is improving coverage of the discourse component.",
        "The template generator today is based on handcrafted rules of thumb.",
        "Within the next year we hope to develop and test an acquisition algorithm that would acquire most of the rules from examples in a new domain.",
        "Lastly, though the classification algorithm was a pleasant success, we believe an even more accurate classifier is possible."
