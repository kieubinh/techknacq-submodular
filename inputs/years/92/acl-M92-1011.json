        "LSI's overall natural language processing (NLP) objective is the development of a broad coverage, reusable system which is readily transportable to additional domains, applications, and sublanguages in English, as well as providing a foundation for our multilingual work.",
        "Our system, called DBG, for Data Base Generator, is comprised of a set of NLP components which have been developed, extended, and rebuilt over a period of some years.",
        "The core of the system is an innovative Principle-based parser, using ideas from [1], which we began developing in the course of MUC-3 to replace our previous chart parser.",
        "Our approach thus relies on the concept of powerful, robust parsing as the most crucial component in an NLP system.",
        "In applying our NLP system to text extraction, our ultimate objective is to develop a high quality text extraction system, where \"high quality\" is defined as scoring above 80% -- a number well beyond any current MUC scores.",
        "In line with these NLP objectives, our major focus for MUC-4 was a follow-up to our main \"lesson learned\" in MUC-3, which was to acquire a machine-readable dictionary (MRD) and integrate its content into the DBG system.",
        "When attempts to acquire the computer-friendly Longmans or one of the Oxford Dictionaries were unsuccessful, we turned to ACL's CD-ROM containing the Collins English Dictionary.",
        "The most correct version of the CED on the ACL CD-ROM was apparently developed directly from a medium prepared for the typographer, and unfortunately lacks any documentation of features, fonts, language, etc.",
        "The effort of acquiring and integrating the CED was clearly a worthwhile endeavor, since we were able to increase the number of entries in our lexicon threefold in a relatively short time (see Table 1).",
        "The increase in lexicon size will benefit all the applications LSI is currently working on.",

        "The complete LSI TST3 and TST4 score reports are included in Appendix G, \"Final Test Score Summaries\".",
        "As an indication of system development during MUC4, we can compare our TST3 results with our results on the MUC-4 interim test (TST2).",
        "The relevant portions of the TST3 and TST2 results are shown in Tables 2 and 3.",
        "Figure 1 graphically presents the TST2 and TST3 recall and precision matrices.",
        "Although our overall TST3 and TST4 scores clearly fell short of our goals, there are important comparisons to be made between TST2 and TST3.",
        "Most importantly, our recall scores made a definite improvement, as can be seen in the TST3 REC column (vs. the TST2 REC column) and on the Recall axis in Figure 1.",
        "This is due to improvements in the extraction of events and entities, from the text, at our knowledge representation level.",
        "(Some examples of this are given in the system summary paper in our discussion of Message 0048).",
        "Unfortunately, our precision did not significantly improve.",
        "This is in large part due to template overgeneration, which is caused by deficiencies in our event template merging.",
        "We are not yet properly merging event references across multiple sentences.",
        "Although improvements in both recall and precision are required, we anticipate that first solving the overgeneration problem will give us a more accurate picture of how the system is really performing in terms of recall and",
        "precision, and where additional work will produce the most significant improvement in system performance."

      "text": [
        "MUC is unfortunately a resource-limited undertaking for LSI; however, we did expend a significant effort on the lexicon and parser for MUC-4.",
        "Although LSI is a small company, we were able to devote these resources to MUC-4 in part due to the sponsorship of DARPA and BRL (see Footnote 1), and additionally, because the work was directly in line with our overall NLP objectives mentioned previously.",
        "Limiting factors included all those on the list -- time, people, cpu cycles -- as well as the budgetary limits mentioned above.",
        "Knowledge was also a limiting factor in the sense that portions of the knowledge embedded in the system were not exploited, and other crucial knowledge was not added, due to resource limitations.",
        "On the other hand, the amount of knowledge represented in the expanded lexicon is significant, so significant achievements are possible if limited resources are focused on particular problem areas."

        "However, with our new, much larger lexicon, LUX/WAM was invoked far less frequently than during MUC-3 processing, and so was not really a significant factor in MUC-4.",
        "A second module mentioned last year as a candidate for rewriting was LXI, the lexical lookup component.",
