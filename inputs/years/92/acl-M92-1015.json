        "The \"ALL TEMPLATES\" results of our \"official\" runs were as follows:",
        "Evaluating the degree of improvement over the MUC-3 runs is complicated by the changes between MUC-3 and MUC-4: there were changes in the template structure, the MURDER templates were eliminated, content mapping constraints were incorporated into the scoring program, and the rules for manual remapping were much more constrained.",
        "We resumed system development specifically for MUC (with regular runs and rescorings) in mid-March, approximately two weeks before the \"Dry Run\" was due, and the modifications prior to the Dry Run primarily reflected the changes needed for the new template structure (no significant changes were made to concepts, verb models, inference rules, etc.).",
        "The changes between our final MUC-3 scores and our Dry Run scores thus roughly reflect the changes due to the change in the task -- for both TST1 and TS1'2, a loss of about 7 points of recall.",
        "During the following 8 weeks, we made a number of system modifications which recovered much of this loss of recall and substantially improved system precision.",
        "During the period from mid-March, when we adapted the system for the MUC-4 templates and began scoring runs, until the evaluation at the end of May, approximately 5 to 6 person-months were involved in development specifically addressed to MUC-4 performance.",
        "This does not count the time we spent since MUC-3 on research using the MUC-3 data, on such topics as semantic pattern acquisition, Wordnet, and grammar evaluation; most of this work was not directly used in the MUC-4 system."

        "(2) We incorporated a more elaborate time analysis component to handle constructs such as \"Three weeks later ...\" and \"Two weeks after <event 1>, <event 2> ...\", in addition to the absolute times (explicit dates) and times relative to the dateline (\"two weeks ago\") which were handled in our MUC-3 system.",
        "The system now produces a time graph relating events, and computes absolute times as the information becomes available.",
        "This produced a small benefit in recall and precision.",
        "In our MUC-3 system, if no parse could be obtained of the entire sentence, we identified the longest string starting at the first word which could be analyzed as a sentence.",
        "We now have the option of taking the remaining words, identifying the longest clauses and noun phrases, and processing these (in addition to the longest initial substring).",
        "We refer to this as \"syntactic debris\".",
        "Because most sentences obtain a full-sentence parse, this option has only a small effect.",
        "On TST3, selecting \"syntactic debris\" increased recall by 1% and reduced precision by 1%.",
        "(4) We implemented a simple mechanism for dynamically shifting the parsing strategy.",
        "For each sentence, up to a certain point, all hypotheses are followed, in a best-first order determined by our scoring function.",
        "Once a specified number of hypotheses have been generated (15000 in the official runs), we shift to a mode where only the highest-ranking hypothesis for each non-terminal and each span of sentence words is retained.",
        "This mode may yield a suboptimal analysis (because many constraints are non-local), but will converge to some analyisis much more quickly (effectively shifting from an exponential to a polynomial-time algorithm).",
        "We made several improvements to reference resolution.",
        "In particular, we refined the semantic slot/filler representation we use for people in order to improve anaphor-antecedent matching.",
        "(6) We have been steadily expanding our grammatical coverage.",
        "Except as needed for our other system changes, we made relatively few additions to the sets of concepts and lexical models developed for MUC-3.1 We did not extend the effort at extensive corpus analysis pursued prior to MUC-3; rather we experimented with various strategies which would lead to greater automation of this process in the future (see the sections below on \"Wordnet\" and \"Acquiring Selectional Constraints\")."

      "text": [
        "At MUC-3, discourse analysis was frequently cited as a serious shortcoming of many of the systems.",
        "In our system, discourse analysis (beyond reference resolution) is reflected mainly in decisions about merging events to form templates.",
        "Roughly speaking, our MUC-3 system tried to merge events (barring conflicting time, location, etc.)",
        "• when they affected the same target • when they appeared in the same sentence • when an attack (including bombing, arson, etc.)",
        "was followed by effect (death, damage, injury, etc.)",
        "For MUC-4 we tried 3 variations on our discourse analysis procedure: (1) blocking attack/effect merging across paragraph boundaries (2) in addition, making use of anaphoric references to events in the merging procedure (so that \"Five civilians were killed in the attack.\"",
        "would cause the templates for the attack and the killings to be merged even if the antecedent of \"attack\" were in a prior paragraph).",
        "(3) identifying and attempting to merge general and specific descriptions of events (this happens quite often in newspaper-style articles, where the introductory paragraph is a summary of several distinct events which are",
        "reported separately later in the article).",
        "This linking of general and specific events was then used by reference resolution to order the search for antecedents.",
        "(This can be viewed as an attempt at a Grosz/Sidner focus stack.)",
        "Variation 1 did slightly better than the MUC-3 base system (on TST3, it got 1% better recall at no loss in precision).",
        "Variations 2 and 3, although more \"linguistically principled\", did slightly worse (variation 2 lost 2% recall, 1% precision on TST3).",
        "We therefore used variation 1 for our official run.",
        "'The set of lexico-semantic models grew by about 25% over MUC-3; the set of concepts (except for geographical names) by about 15%.",
        "A partial failure analysis for TST3 suggested that many of the template errors could be attributed to gaps or errors in the models or concepts, and hence that further improvements in these two components were crucial to improved performance.",
        "An examination of some of the errors indicated that, while variations 2 and 3 did OK in and of themselves, they were sensitive to errors in prior stages of processing (in particular, shortcomings in semantic interpretation led to occasional incorrect anaphora resolution, which in turn led to excess event merging).",
        "In contrast, paragraph boundaries, while not as reliable a discourse indicator, are more reliably observed.",
        "Thus, the best component in isolation may not be the best choice for a system, because it may be too sensitive to errors made by prior components."
