        "In commenting on PRC's performance in MlUC-3, we reported [1] that the component of our system that could most improve performance was discourse analysis.",
        "The MUC-4 exercise has strongly confirmed that view.",
        "We added a new discourse module to PAKTUS, made very few changes to the other system components, and the result was significantly improved performance.",
        "This paper discusses our test results, what we focused on for this task, what worked well, and what would improve performance further.",
        "A companion paper in this volume describes how our system functions."

        "The PRC PAKTUS system used for MUC-4 is essentially the same linguistic system that we used for MUC-3, with the addition of a generic discourse analysis module.",
        "PAKTUS applies lexical, syntactic, semantic, and discourse analysis to all text in each document.",
        "The linguistic modules for this are nearly independent of the task domain (i.e., MUC-4, but some of the data – lexical entries, and a few grammar rules – are tuned for the MUC-4 text corpus).",
        "Task-specific template filling and filtering operations are performed only after linguistic analysis is completed.",
        "The task-specific patterns that determine what to extract from the discourse structures were only minimally defined due to the limited time and effort available.",
        "The other task-specific additions to the system were the location set list, and functions for better recognizing time and location of events."

        "Figure 1 summarizes PRC's scores for MUC-4.",
        "The scoring notation is explained in Appendix G. Overall, we were pleased with the performance improvement since MUC-3, which was obtained with only about 4 person months of linguistic development effort, little of which was specific to the MUC-4 task.",
        "The most significant new development, compared to our MUC-3 system, is the addition of the discourse analysis module.",
        "This module is generic for expository discourse such as is found in news reports.",
        "Application-specific extraction requirements are maintained separately from the discourse module, are applied only after it executes, and were minimally specified for MUC-4.",
        "Our system generally had much better precision than recall in these tests.",
        "We expected this because it uses complete linguistic analysis designed for text understanding, and because it has only a very limited amount of task-specific knowledge.",
        "For example, its discourse analysis module was trained on only 8 of the MUC-4 pretest corpus of 1500 reports.",
        "For these same",
        "reasons, we also expected a high degree of corpus independence, and this was supported by the similarity of scores on TST3 and TST4.",
        "The main limiting factors for PRC were time and availability of people for development.",
        "We directed most of our energies to generic linguistic development, and the linguistic aspects of the task have essentially been completed.",
        "Because we had little time remaining to devote to MUC-4specific issues, however, much of the information that PAKTUS produced through syntactic, semantic, and discourse analysis did not find its way into the template fills."

        "Three PRC researchers participated in linguistic development that contributed to MUC-4 performance.",
        "Most of this development was generic, however, and will support applications other than MUC-4.",
        "Figure 2 shows an estimate of our level of effort broken down by linguistic task.",
        "Our total linguistic development effort was about four months, with almost 40% of that on discourse analysis.",
        "Significant effort also went into time and location grammar functions, although this is small compared to the prior effort that went into the overall grammar.",
        "Lexicon entry was minimal, consisting primarily of semi-automatic entry of the MUC-4 location set list.",
        "Many words from the MUC-4 corpus have never been entered into the PAKTUS lexicon.",
        "Instead, heuristics based on word morphology make guesses about these unrecognized words.",
        "The specific changes and additions to the PAKTUS knowledge bases for MUC-4 are enumerated in Figure 3.",
        "Most of the lexical additions were from the MUC-4 location set list.",
        "These were added semi-automatically in batch mode.",
        "Other lexical additions were based on short",
        "One notable area that would have significantly improved performance was the definition of MUC-4-specific conceptual patterns.",
        "These are used to extract information from the discourse structures.",
        "Very little was done here, however, due to limited time and resources.",
        "Only 88 of these patterns were added.",
        "We had intended to define several hundred, but that would have required about another month of effort."

        "As already noted, the most significant system improvement was in discourse analysis.",

        "These were documents 1, 3, 10, 11, 48, 63, 99, and 100.",
        "The time and location grammar and functional changes were based on manual analysis of the 100 test2 documents.",
        "The entire pretest corpus was scanned automatically to identify words missing from our lexicon, but only a few of these were entered – those more common words that did not conform to our unrecognized word heuristics.",
        "The improvement in PAKTUS's linguistic performance from MUC-3 up to the day of testing for MUC-4 can be seen in Figure 4, derived from the test runs on the test2 corpus, using the F-measure specified for MUC-4.",
        "The development was carried out during April and May, 1992.",
        "The basic functionality of the new discourse module was completed on May 6, and it dramatically improved performance.",
        "This module has two main functions: 1) it builds discourse topic structures, and 2) it unifies noun phrases that refer to the same entity.",
        "There is a rather",
        "intricate interaction between these two functions, and this had to be carefully developed over the next ten days (through May 17), so that improvement in one function did not impair the other.",
        "After completion of the two basic discourse functions, enhancements (pronoun reference, etc.)",
        "were added to the discourse module, through May 25.",
        "This allowed only three days for MUC-4specific knowledge to be added that could take advantage of the new discourse module.",
        "It can be seen from figure 4 that, once the discourse functions were properly integrated (on May 17), performance improvement averaged one point per day over the last eleven days before official MUC-4 testing.",
        "We believe that the system is far from the limit of its extraction capability based on its existing linguistic components.",
        "This belief is supported by the ease with which we improved performance on the MUC-4 conference walkthrough document (test2, document 48) by adding a few MUC-4-specific conceptual patterns."

        "For example, the system might correctly fill in 75% of the information for a template, but not report it because it got the wrong date (events over three months old are not reported), or the wrong country.",
        "We would prefer to report all incidents, with an extra slot indicating whether they are considered relevant or not.",
        "This seems more appropriate for evaluating linguistic competence.",
