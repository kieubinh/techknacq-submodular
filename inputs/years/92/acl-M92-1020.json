        "The most significant limiting factor we experienced was development time.",
        "The ICTOAN system was written from scratch during the first five months of 1992; only the template generation software was reused from our MUG3 system.",
        "The effect of the short development time was compounded by our selection of C as the programming language for the project.",
        "We chose C for its speed, and to gain leverage from existing ConQuest software.",
        "However, because C is such a low-level language, development of a piece of code in C takes longer than development of equivalent code in a higher-level language such as LISP.",
        "Recall scores for the evaluation system were uniformly poor.",
        "The main factors contributing to the low recall scores were:",
        "• The evaluation system did not attempt to fill all template slots.",
        "In particular, we did not attempt to guess any slot values that were not known, even when guessing would lead to a significant partial score (e.g. in the data slot).",

        "• No grammar rules were in place for performing semantic analysis of nominalized attack actions, or for interpretation of passive verbs.",
        "Therefore, the only attacks that were interpreted were ones that were described by active verbs.",
        "A low percentage of the reported attacks were described in this way in the test corpora.",
        "• No merging of co-referential phrases or sentences was performed.",
        "Thus, two interpretable descriptions of the same attack always led to the generation of two different templates.",
        "In addition to increasing overgeneration, this had the effect of reducing recall for slots that were filled in templates that were eventually discarded by the scoring program.",
        "• Although significant hooks are in place in the system for discourse segmentation, the lack of merging of co-referential items made discourse segmentation algorithms irrelevant for the purposes of the evaluation."

        "The evaluation system had a number of known memory leaks.",
        "Because of these leaks, we chose to break up the input texts into individual files and run ICTOAN separately on each.",
        "Given time to eliminate these leaks, we believe that the system is capable of processing 100 texts on the same platform in under twelve minutes.",
        "One result made possible by the system's speed is that the ICTOAN system does no skimming.",
        "That is, the system does not look for 'hot' areas of the text and concentrate its processing power on those areas.",

        "Bottom-up processes can be written to read ,data from low-level streams and build items to be placed on high-level streams.",
        "Top-down processes can be written to search for desired elements on low-level streams, based on the items that appear in high-level streams.",
        "Since individual processes may be placed in any order along the pipeline, it is easy to explore the interactions between for example top-down and bottom-up processes.",
        "The user needs only to modify a configuration file that indicates which processes should be used and in what order.",
        "Furthermore, the overall effectiveness of a particular process can be evaluated by comparing the performance of the system running with the component of interest against the performance of the system running without that component.",
        "We believe that the flexibility of the system will make it easily adaptable to other uses.",
        "For example, we intend to use all of the system except the template generator as an automatic text-to-hypertext conversion system [1]."
