        "Traditional approaches to the problem of extracting data from texts have emphasized hand-crafted linguistic knowledge.",
        "In contrast, BBN's PLUM system (Probabilistic Language Understanding Model) was developed as part of a DARPA-funded research effort on integrating probabilistic language models with more traditional linguistic techniques.",
        "Our research and development goals are",
        "• more rapid development of new applications, • the ability to train (and re-train) systems based on user markings of correct and incorrect output, • more accurate selection among interpretations when more than one is found, and • more robust partial interpretation when no complete interpretation can be found.",
        "A central assumption of our approach is that in processing unrestricted text for data extraction, a non-trivial amount of the text will not be understood.",
        "As a result, all components of PLUM are designed to operate on partially understood input, taking advantage of information when available, and not failing when information is unavailable.",
        "We had previously performed experiments on components of the system with texts from the Wall Street Journal, however, the MUC-3 task was the first end-to-end application of PLUM.",
        "Very little hand-tuning of knowledge bases was done for MUC-4; since MUC-3, the system architecture as depicted in figure 1 has remained essentially the same.",
        "In addition to participating in MUC-4, since MUC-3 we focused on porting to new domains and a new language, and on performing various experiments designed to control recall/precision tradeoffs.",
        "To support these goals, the preprocessing component and the fragment combiner were made declarative; the semantics component was generalized to use probabilities on word senses; we expanded our treatment of reference; we enlarged the set of system parameters at all levels; and we created a new probabilistic classifier for text relevance which filters discourse events."

        "The preprocessing module determines message boundaries, identifies the header, and determines paragraph and sentence boundaries.",
        "The specification of the input format is now a declarative component of the preprocessor, which enables us to easily digest messages in different formats.",
        "This component has proved its utility in porting to two non-MUC formats in the last year."

        "Since these predictions for unknown words were very inaccurate for input that is all upper case, we augmented this part-of-speech tagging with probabilistic models (automatically trained) for recognizing words of Spanish origin and words of English origin.",
        "This allowed us to tag new words that were actually Latin American names highly reliably.",

        "The semantic interpreter operates on each fragment produced by FPP in a bottom-up, compositional fashion.",
        "Throughout the system, defaults are provided so that missing semantic information or rules do not produce errors, but simply mark semantic elements or relationships as unknown.",
        "This is consistent with our belief that partial understanding has to be a key element of text processing systems, and missing data has to be regarded as a normal event.",
        "The semantic component encompasses both lexical semantics and semantic rules.",
        "The semantic lexicon is separate from the parser's lexicon and has much less coverage.",
        "We used an automatic case frame induction procedure to construct an initial version of the lexicon [2].",
        "Word senses of the semantic lexicon have probability assignments, which we plan to derive automatically from corpora.",
        "For MUC-4, probabilities were assigned so each word sense is more probable than the next sense of the word as entered in the lexicon.",
        "Lexical semantic entries indicate the word's semantic type (a domain model concept), as well as predicates pertaining to it.",
        "For example, here is the lexical semantics for the verb BOMB: (defverb \"BOMB\" (BOMB-V-i BOMBING (:case (subject PEOPLE TI-PERP-OF) (object ANYTYPE OBJECT-OF)))) This entry indicates that the type is BOMBING, that a subject argument whose type is PEOPLE should be given the role TI-PERP-OF, and that an object argument of any type should be given the role OBJECT-OF.",
        "BOMB-V-1 is the unique identifier of this (only) word sense.",
        "The semantic rules are based on general syntactic patterns, using wildc,ards and similar mechanisms to provide an extra measure of robustness.",
        "The basic elements of our semantic representation are \"semantic forms\", each of which introduces a variable (e.g. ?13) with a type and a collection of predicates pertaining to that variable.",
        "There are three basic types of semantic forms: entities of the domain, events, and states of affairs.",
        "Each of these three can be further categorized as known, unknown, and referential.",
        "Entities correspond to the people, places, things, and time intervals of the domain.",
        "These are related in important ways, such as through events (who did what to whom) and states of affairs (properties of the entities).",
        "Entity descriptions typically arise from noun phrases; events and states of affairs may be described in clauses.",
        "Not everything that is represented in the semantics has actually been understood.",
        "For example, the predicate",
        "PP-MODIFIER mdicates that two entities (expressed as noun phrases) are connected via a certain preposition.",
        "In this way, we have a \"placeholder\" for the information that a certain structural relation holds between these two items, even though we do not know what the actual semantic relation is.",
        "Sometimes understanding the relation more fully is of no consequence, since the information does not contribute to the template-filling task.",
        "The information is maintained, however, so that later expectation-driven processing can use it if necessary.",
        "Here is a semantic rule which handles, for example, \"group of businessmen\", \"murder of a man\", and \"terrorists of the FMLN\":",
        "An important consequence of the fragmentation produced by FPP is that top-level constituents are typically more shallow and less varied than full sentence parses.",
        "As a result, more semantics coverage was obtained early on in the development process with few semantic rules than would have been expected if the system had had to cover widely varied syntactic structures before producing any semantic structures.",
        "In this way, semantic coverage can be added gradually, while the rest of the system is progressing in parallel.",
        "After having assigned semantic representations to the fragments produced by FPP, it is often possible to make some of the attachment decisions which had been deferred.",
        "For example, it is possible to combine two NPs of compatible semantic types that are conjoined, or attach prepositional phrases preferentially, using information automatically derived from a corpus [7].",
        "Our basic system uses fragment combination for certain proper name constructions, while some of our submitted optional runs used more extensive patterns for fragment combination.",
        "Figure 2 shows a graphical version of the semantics generated for the first fragment of SI in TST2-MUC4-0048.",
        "In this example note the UNKNOWN-EVENT created for the main verb \"CONDEMNED\", which has no lexical semantics in our system, but still generates a useful semantic representation."

        "The semantic representation of an event in the text only includes information contained locally in a fragment (after fragment combination); in creating corresponding event objects, the discourse module must infer other long-distance or indirect relations not explicitly found by the interpreter, and resolve any references in the text.",

        "This heuristic assumes that the events were possibly derived from repeated references to a single real event.",
