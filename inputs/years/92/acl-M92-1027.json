        "The objective of the Hughes Trainable Text Skimmer (TTS) Project is to create text skimming software that: (1) can be easily reconfigured for new applications, (2) improves its performance with use, and (3) is fast enough to process several megabytes of text per day.",
        "The TTS-MUC4 system is our second full-scale prototype.",
        "It is an adaptation of the TTS-MUC3 system [1] [2], which constituted our first-full scale text skimming prototype.",
        "TTS-MUC3 utilized a previously-constructed text database facility and pattern matcher used for shallow parsing.",
        "Its modular process model integrated the results of case memory retrieval over sentences from multiple stories, extracting the date and location of incidents, and computing cross-reference information for various slots.",
        "One calendar month and approximately three (3) person months were spent developing TI'S for MUC-3.",
        "TTS-1V1UC3 demonstrated that a pattern classification approach was promising for performing text skimming.",
        "TTS-MUC4 is similar to TTS-MUC3, with a few minor changes.",
        "First, the K-Nearest Neighbor classifier used in TTS-MUC3 was replaced in T1'S-MUC4 with a Bayesian Classifier which actually includes specialized classifiers for each slot.",
        "Therefore, for : INCIDENT-TYPE the set of features present in an entire sentence were used as features, but for :HUM-TGT-NAME the features just before and after a candidate were used.",
        "Secondly, in the new prototype, code was added to extract information to fill the new and revised slots of the MUC-4 templates.",
        "Thirdly, additional filters were developed to improve the precision of the values of the template fillers.",
        "Like our first prototype, TTS-MUC4 incorporates semi-automated lexicon generation and almost fully automated phrase pattern generation.",
        "Two calendar months and approximately 2.5 person months were spent on enhancing the TTS-MUC3 system to create TTS-MUC4.",
        "As with TTS-MUC3, all the modules in TTS-MUC4 are domain independent.",
        "All the modules except the date and location extraction modules are trained prior to skimming.",
        "In addition, the location extraction module requires a location database, including the specification of which locations are contained within others.",
        "The goal of the TI'S project is to develop a text skimmer that can be used in a variety of applications.",
        "By relying on statistical information processing and keeping the amount of domain-dependent information to a minimum, it is hoped that this system can be easily ported to a variety of tasks, such as analysis of finance-related wire-service stories."

        "There are two aspects of TTS.",
        "The first is system training, or the process of deriving or identifying the phrases which are used in the training corpus.",

        "Figure 1 illustrates the key components of both aspects of Hughes Trainable Text Skimmer.",
        "The training involves deriving the set of phrases used to generate the templates associated with a particular corpus of texts, and the generation of training features which map features to the actual text in the stories.",
