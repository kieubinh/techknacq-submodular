        "• Self-extensibility, focusing primarily on machine learning of natural language and user-configurable semantics.",

        "This initiative has been underway for just over half a year, prior to which our group was focusing nearly exclusively on natural language interfaces to expert systems.",

        "The system's underlying architecture, shown in Figure 1, follows a task breakdown used in several other systems that have recently participated in muc (e.g., PLUM [10] or NLTOOLSET [4]).",
        "Processing occurs in three distinct phases: preprocessing, natural language analysis, and application-specific output generation.",
        "One of the ways ALEMBIC differs from other muc systems, however, is in exploiting sctviu as the interchange lingua franca between these three processing phases.",
        "The intention is to allow system modules whose invocation occurs early in the analysis of a document to record processing results directly in the document through SGML markup.",
        "This information then becomes available to subsequent modules as meta-data.",
        "As a result of this sGmL-based architecture, the system's overall flow of control is governed from an object-oriented document manager built on top of a Common Lisp port of Goldfarb's public domain SGML parser.",
        "For muc-4, the preprocessing phase thus takes a FBIS message file and normalizes it by recoding it in SGML The document manager then builds an internal document object by parsing the resulting SGML.",
        "The actual content lalembic 1 : an alchemical apparatus used for distillation 2: something that refines or transmutes as if by distillation.",
        "analysis of the document is performed by invoking the natural language analysis modules on the internal document object, and the results of these analyses are stored as attributes of the document.",
        "The system's output is normally just another SGML file, in which the content analysis is simply encoded as additional (semantic) markup.",
        "For MUC-4, we also provided selective output that consisted solely of filled templates.",
        "As an example of this overall flow of control, and its corresponding encoding in SGML, consider the first paragraph of message TST2-MUC4-0048:"

        "For other details on SGML, see, e.g., I8d.",

        "In the case of a mono-transitive verb's past tense/participle (e.g., \"condemned,\" the first verb in TST2-MUC4-0048), this includes the active voice (e.g., \"Cristiani.",
        "condemned the terrorist killing\"), the passive voice, and ancillary forms such as the detransitivized active voice and verbal adjectives.",
        "In our variant of CCG's, lexical categories are treated either as complex vectors of features, or as mathematical functions over such vectors.",
        "For example, stripping away all syntactic and semantic features, the syntactic category corresponding to a transitive verb is the function S\\NPINP, i.e., a function that will produce an S given an object NP on its right (the INP term) and a subject NP on its left (the \\NP term).",
        "To accomodate syntactic and semantic features, categories are actually implemented in a standard unification framework (as in [11]).",
        "Some features can be themselves category-valued, and so the overall category structure is actually a reentrant graph that can become fairly involved, as attested to by a partial expansion of \"condemned\" in the active voice:",
        "This encoding is based on Pareschi and Steedman's category notation [6], wherein the res, arg, and dir features are used to encode a syntactic function's result, argument, and direction of application.",
        "To reduce the complexity of defining tens of thousands of such lexical entries, we associate to each category type (such as the active voice of a transitive verb) a lexical skeleton, that is, a partial lexical entry that is fleshed out during the expansion of a stem.",
        "The fleshing out of skeletons does not actually occur until run time, when a word form is actually found in a document.",

        "As a back up, we also encoded a small grammar of Spanish geographical names – for example, \"son\" has a reading as a functor that produces geographical names given a personal name on its right.",
        "For personal names, we relied primarily on a cross-cultural database of 15,000 names obtained from various public domain databases.",
        "Most of these are first names, with only about 2,000 family names covered by the database.",

        "In this light, categorial grammars are effectively the uhr-bottom-up linguistic framework, as one cannot meaningfully speak of top-down parsing in this framework.",
        "We also wanted a framework that was strongly lexically governed, as in CCG's, in order to reduce the parsing search space.",

        "In addition, we extended the CCG framework per se in order to cover optional and displaced arguments, which are typically weaknesses of traditional categorial grammar frameworks.",
        "The approach we've taken involves introducing a pair of features for each optional argument, one feature to encode the type of argument that is expected, and the second to encode the disposition of the argument's semantics.",

        "First, the muc-4 version of the title sub-grammar was weak: title modifiers such as elect or general were simply absent from the grammar.",
        "Second, prepositional phrase coverage was incomplete: PP's that appeared as optional arguments of categories would parse, but those that should be treated as modifiers failed to do so.",
        "In addition, many verbs simply lacked the appropriate subcategorization frame for PP arguments, as in this case with accused.",

        "The approach embodied in our system attempts to perform the integration by exploiting a Bayesian belief network.",
        "The network combines a number of evidence sources that bear upon whether an anaphor (either a definite reference or a pronoun) can be resolved to a particular candidate referent.",

        "The comparison is performed by populating the evidence nodes of the network according to the characteristics of the anaphor and candidate.",

        "In the case of our actual run on TST2-MUC4-0048, for example, the bracketing of the first sentence produced by the semi-parser lead to identifying as mentions (among others) Alfredo Cristiani, and the murder event introduced by the nominalization of \"kill.\" The second of these phrases was then taken as potentially anaphoric and compared to earlier mentions in the sentence, including that for Cristiani.",
        "In the case, of Cristiani the mentions were found not to co-refer, reflecting the importance of KR compatibility.",
        "Nevertheless, the fragmentary nature of the parses, coupled with the relative lack of grammatical features in the Bayesian network, led to disapoiming reference resolution performance overall.",

        "In our actual run on TST2-MUC4-0048, two such pegs were found in the first paragraph: one for \"killing\" and one for \"the crime.\" The fact that two separate pegs were found for these phrases reflects a failure on the part of our reference resolution mechanism, as these two phrases should properly have been determined to be co-referential.",
        "In the IVIUC-4 version of ALEMBIC, the actual generation of templates is keyed off of the pegs for violent events.",

        "This strategy is very straightforward, but it places a tremendous burden on the system's ability to identify coreferential events.",
