        "The ICTOAN system is a natural language processing system developed jointly by ConQuest, Inc. and the University of Maryland Baltimore County.",
        "The system was written from scratch during the first five months of 1992 using an estimated eight person-months of labor.",
        "The template generation routines were reused from our MUC-3 system [1], providing leverage of perhaps one person-month.",
        "Adaptation of software designed for the ConQuest text retrieval system provided leverage of another six person-months.",
        "The system code was written by the author and by Paul Nelson of ConQuest, Inc.",
        "The semantic net representations of world knowledge were developed by Alexander Ho.",
        "Roy Cutts, Terri Hobbs, Mark Wilson, and the author wrote the various grammars.",
        "Tern Hobbs also cleaned up significant portions of the dictionaries.",
        "Paul Riddle modified our MUG3 template generation software to work with the new template specifications.",
        "We had two main goals in designing the system:",
        "1. to develop a flexible architecture that would support the interleaving of top-down and bottom-up processing.",
        "2. to produce a fast system.",
        "We were largely successful at achieving both of these goals.",
        "The ICTOAN system architecture allows low-level and high-level processes to be interleaved and duplicated in arbitrary configurations, which are specified at runtime.",
        "And the system is quite fast, processing 100 texts in under twenty minutes."

      "heading": "ARCHITECTURE",
      "text": [
        "The ICTOAN system architecture is based on the idea of multiple parallel streams of data.",
        "Each stream carries a particular class of information about the text being processed.",
        "For example, a constituent stream carries all linguistic constituents found in the text, while an object stream carries semantic net nodes representing the meaning of those constituents.",
        "The data in the streams travel in parallel through a pipeline of processes.",
        "Each process can read items from one or more streams, make any inferences it chooses about those items, and place those same items or new items it creates onto one or more streams.",
        "The processes used for the MUC-4 evaluation first build a semantic net representation of the input story, then fill out templates based on this representation.",
        "Three main types of processes were used by ICTOAN to generate a semantic net representation of a MUC-4 input text:",
        "1.",
        "Parsing processes: these processes attempt to uncover the linguistic structure of the input text.",
        "2.",
        "Disambiguation processes: these processes reject unlikely interpretations of the input text.",
        "3.",
        "Interpretation processes: these processes build semantic net structures that represent the meaning of portions of the input text.",
        "The system is designed so that these three types of processes can be intermingled in any desired order.",
        "This provides the researcher with an environment in which it is easy to test the effectiveness of a particular process, and affords the system designer great flexibility in tailoring the system to a particular application."

        "This grammar enforces semantic constraints by verifying that any interpretation to be built meets all constraints expressed in the semantic net.",
        "For example, the following rule was used to interpret sentences based on the verb 'assaulted' or the verb 'attacked':",
        "In the section labeled 'syntax,' the names 'subject,' 'verb,' and 'object' are labels given to the semantic representations of the corresponding sub-constituents.",
