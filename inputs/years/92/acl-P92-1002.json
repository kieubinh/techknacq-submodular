        "b. only â€“ it did not.",
        "To interpret the elliptical VP \"did not\", the antecedent must be determined: in this case, \"rained\" is the only possibility.",
        "The input to the algorithm is an elliptical VP and a list of VP's occurring in proximity to the elliptical VP.",
        "The algorithm eliminates certain VP's",
        "that are impossible antecedents.",
        "Then it assigns preference levels to the remaining VP's, based on syntactic configurations as well as other factors.",
        "Any VP's with the same preference level are ordered in terms of proximity to the elliptical VP.",
        "The antecedent is the VP with the highest preference level.",
        "In what follows, I begin with the overall structure of the algorithm.",
        "Next the subparts of the algorithm are described, consisting of the elimination of impossible antecedents, and the determination of a preference ordering based on clausal relationships and subject coreference.",
        "I then present the results of testing the algorithm on 304 examples of VP ellipsis collected from the Brown Corpus.",
        "Finally, I examine other approaches to this problem in the literature."

        "First, impossible antecedents are removed from the VPlist.",
        "Then, the remaining items in VPlist are assigned preference levels, and the item with the highest preference level is selected as the antecedent.",

        "The definition of the function remove-impossible is as follows: remove-impossible(VPlist,VPE) For all v in VPlist if ACD(v,VPE) or BE-DO-conflict(v,VPE) then remove(v, VPlist) There are two types of impossible antecedents: the first involves certain antecedent-containment structures, and the second involves cases in which the antecedent contains a BE-form and the target contains a DO-form.",
        "These are described in detail below.",
