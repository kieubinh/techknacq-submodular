        "In this paper we present algorithms for the interpretation and generation of a certain kind of conversational implicature occurring in the following type of conversational exchange.",
        "One participant (Q) makes an illocutionary-level request' to be informed if p; the addressee (A), whose reply may consist of more than one sentence, conversationally implicates one of these replies: p, that there is support for p, or that there is support for For example, in (1), assuming Q's utterance has been interpreted as a request to be informed if A went shopping, and given certain mutual beliefs (e.g., that A's car breaking down would normally be sufficient to prevent A from going shopping, and 1We wish to thank Kathy McCoy for her comments on this paper.",
        "2i.e., using Austin's (Austin, 1962) distinction between locutionary and illocutionary force, Q's utterance is intended to function as a request (although it need not have the grammatical form of a question) that A's reply is coherent and cooperative), A's reply is intended to convey, in part, a 'no'.",
        "(1) Q: Did you go shopping?",
        "Such indirect replies satisfy the conditions proposed by Grice and others (Grice, 1975; Hirschberg, 1985; Sadock, 1978) for being classified as particularized conversational implicatures.",
        "First, A's reply does not entail (in virtue of its conventional meaning) that A did not go shopping.",
        "Second, the putative implicature can be cancelled; for example, it can be denied without the result sounding inconsistent, as can be seen by considering the addition of (2) to the end of A's reply in (1).",
        "(2) A: So I took the bus to the mall.",
        "Third, it is reinforceable; A's reply in (1) could have been preceded by an explicit \"no\" without destroying coherency or sounding redundant.",
        "Fourth, the putative implicature is nondetachable; the same reply would have been conveyed by an alternative realization of (la) and (lb) (assuming that the alternative did not convey a Manner-based implicature).",
        "Fifth, Q and A must mutually believe that, given the assumption that A's reply is cooperative, and given certain shared background information, Q can and will infer that by A's reply, A meant 'no'.",
        "This paper presents algorithms for calculating such an inference from an indirect response and for generating an indirect response intended to carry such an inference."

        "In the type of exchange we are studying, at the point after Q's contribution, the participants share the beliefs that Q has requested to be informed if p and that the request was appropriate; hence, they share the discourse expectation that for A to be cooperative, he must now say as much as he can truthfully say in regard to the truth of p.

        "In existing sentence-at-a-time models of calculating implicatures (Gazdar, 1979; Hirschberg, 1985), processing (22a) would result in an implicated 'yes' being added to the context, which would successfully block the addition of an implicated 'no' on processing (22b).",

        "The structure proposed for (22A)/(23A) is illustrated in Figure 1.8 Linear precedence in the tree does not necessarily represent narrative order; one way of ordering the two nodes directly dominated by Tell(MVA) gives (22A), another gives (23A).",
        "(Narrative order in the generation of indirect replies is an area we are currently investigating also; for related research, see section 3.)",

        "Third, by making use of properties of discourse which have been used in models of other discourse phenomena, our approach can be integrated with those models.",
        "Also, our model permits the same information to be used both in interpretation and in generation.",
        "Our current and anticipated research includes: refining and implementing our algorithms (including developing an inference mechanism for the discourse relation rules); extending our model to other types of implicatures; and investigating the integration of our model into general interpretation and generation frameworks."
