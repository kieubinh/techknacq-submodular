        "Computational Linguistics research has recognized two independent mechanisms of context change.",
        "The first to have been recognized might be called context change by entity introduction.",
        "It was first implemented in Woods' question-answering system LUNAR [21; 22].",
        "For each non-anaphoric referential noun phrase (NP) in a question, including a questioned NP itself, LUNAR would create a new constant symbol to represent the new entity, putting an appropriate description on its property list.",
        "For example, if asked the question \"Which breccias contain molybdenum?\", LUNAR would create one new constant to represent molybdenum and another to represent the set of breccias which contain molybdenum.",
        "Each new constant would be added to the front of LUNAR's history list, thereby making it available as a potential referent for subsequent pronominal and definite NP anaphors (e.g. \"Do they also contain ti-tanium?\").",
        "Webber [19] further developed this procedure for introducing and characterizing discourse entities available for anaphoric reference A similar mechanism of context change is embedded in formal dynamic theories of discourse, including Kamp's Discourse Representation Theory [11] and Heim's File Change Semantics [10].",
        "We briefly describe Heim's approach, to show this similarity.",
        "Heim's files constitute an intermediate level of representation between the sentences of a text and the model which gives them their truth values.",
        "A sentence can be viewed as denoting a function from an input file to an output file.",
        "Each indefinite NP in a sentence requires a new file card in the output file which does not appear in the input file, on which is inscribed the properties of the new entity.",
        "Each definite NP must either map to an existing file card or have a semantic association with an existing card, allowing it to be accommodated into the discourse.",
        "In the latter case, a new file card is inserted in the input file which the definite NP is now taken as mapping to.",
        "Context change therefore consists of new annotations to existing cards and new cards added for indefinite NPs and accommodated definite NPs.",
        "The files do not change in any other way that reflects events described in the text.",
        "Formal theories of discourse have been broadened to allow for types of \"embedded contexts\" associated with modals [17] and with propositional attitudes [1].",
        "Although they have also begun to deal with problems of tense and the temporal relationship of events described in a text [12; 16], there is still no connection between the events described in a text and the individuals introduced therein.",
        "Context change by event simulation is a feature of Dale's recent Natural Language generation system EPICURE [3], which generates recipe texts from an underlying plan representation.",
        "In EPICURE, the individuals available for reference change in step with the events described in the text.2 In a sense, EPICURE is simulating the effects of the events that the text describes.",
        "In implementing this, Dale represents actions with STRIPS-like operators which can change the world from one state to another.",
        "Each object and state in EPICURE has a unique index, with the set of objects available in a given state constituting its working set.",
        "With respect to objects3, an action can have two types of effects: it can change a property of an object (e.g., from being an individual carrot to being a mass of grated carrot), or it can add an object to or remove it from the world, as represented in the current working set (e.g., flour disappears as an independent entity when combined with water, and dough appears).",
        "The preconditions and postconditions of each action indicate the objects required in the working set for its performance and the changes it makes to objects in the working set as a result.",
        "For example, ADD (in the sense of \"add X to Y\") has as preconditions that X and Y be in the current working set and as post-conditions, that X and Y are absent from the resulting working set and a new object Z is present whose constituents are X and Y.",
        "The form of recipe that EPICURE generates is the common one in which a list of ingredients is followed by instructions as to what to do with them.",
        "Thus all entities are introduced to the reader in this initial list (e.g., \"four ounces of butter beans\", \"a large onion\", \"some sea salt\", etc.)",
        "before any mention of the events that will (deterministically) change their properties or their existential status.",
        "As a result, in the text of the recipe, EPICURE only embodies context change by event simulation: no new entities are introduced in the text that are not already known from the list of ingredients.",
        "2 In earlier work, Grosz [8] noticed that in task-oriented dialogues, the performance of actions could alter what objects the speakers would take to be in focus and hence take as the intended referents of definite pronouns and NPs.",
        "However, actual changes in the properties and existential status of objects due to actions were not part of Grosz' study.",
        "3Dale construes and also implements the notion of object very broadly, so that the term applies equally well to a two-pound package of parsnips and a tablespoon of salt",
        "Our work on integrating these two mechanisms of WS; that persist through to WS° continue to be context change involves dropping Dale's assumption available for reference in clauses describing subse-that states are complete specifications of an underly- quent events, as illustrated by the subsequent ref-ing model.",
        "(To emphasize that descriptions are par erence to John (\"he\") above.",
        "tial, we will use the term situation rather than state.)",
        "The alternative follow-on As in EPICURE, actions are represented here by op He had taken it from his brother's car.",
        "erators – functions from one situation to another.",
        "describes the situation prior to the previous event.",

        "The only way to refer text.",
        "For clarity, we refer to the working set associ- anaphorically to entities from different working sets ated with the situation prior to the described event is with a follow-on that refers atemporally across sit-as the WS;, and the working set associated with the uations (e.g. \"Neither of them was particularly use-situation after it as the WS„.",
