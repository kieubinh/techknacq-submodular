        "A typical information retrieval (IR) task is to select documents from a database in response to a user's query, and rank these documents according to relevance.",
        "This has been usually accomplished using statistical methods (often coupled with manual encoding), but it is now widely believed that these traditional methods have reached their limits!",
        "These limits are particularly acute for text databases, where natural language processing (NLP) has long been considered necessary for further progress.",
        "Unfortunately, the difficulties encountered in applying computational linguistics technologies to text processing have contributed to a widespread belief that automated NLP may not be suitable in IR.",
        "These difficulties included inefficiency, limited coverage, and prohibitive cost of manual effort required to build lexicons and knowledge bases for each new text domain.",

        "I As far as the automatic document retrieval is concerned.",
        "Techniques involving various forms of relevance feedback are usually far more effective, but they require user's manual intervention in the retrieval process.",
        "In this paper, we are concerned with fully automated retrieval only.",
        "experiments did not establish the usefulness of NLP, they cannot be considered conclusive because of their very limited scale.",
        "Another reason is the limited scale at which NLP was used.",
        "Syntactic parsing of the database contents, for example, has been attempted in order to extract linguistically motivated \"syntactic phrases\", which presumably were better indicators of contents than \"statistical phrases\" where words were grouped solely on the basis of physical proximity (eg.",
        "\"college junior\" is not the same as \"junior college\").",
        "These intuitions, however, were not confirmed by experiments; worse still, statistical phrases regularly outperformed syntactic phrases (Fagan, 1987).",
        "Attempts to overcome the poor statistical behavior of syntactic phrases has led to various clustering techniques that grouped synonymous or near synonymous phrases into \"clusters\" and replaced these by single \"metaterms\".",
        "Clustering techniques were somewhat successful in upgrading overall system performance, but their effectiveness was diminished by frequently poor quality of syntactic analysis.",
        "Since full-analysis wide-coverage syntactic parsers were either unavailable or inefficient, various partial parsing methods have been used.",
        "Partial parsing was usually fast enough, but it also generated noisy data: as many as 50% of all generated phrases could be incorrect (Lewis and Croft, 1990).",
        "Other efforts concentrated on processing of user queries (eg.",
        "Speck Jones and Tait, 1984; Smeaton and van Rijsbergen, 1988).",
        "Since queries were usually short and few, even relatively inefficient NLP techniques could be of benefit to the system.",
        "None of these attempts proved conclusive, and some were never properly evaluated either.",
        "2 Standard IR benchmark collections are statistically too small and the experiments can easily produce counterintuitive results.",
        "For example, Cranfield collection is only approx.",
        "180,000 English words, while CACM-3204 collection used in the present experiments is approx.",
        "200,000 words.",
        "We believe that linguistic processing of both the database and the user's queries need to be done for a maximum benefit, and moreover, the two processes must be appropriately coordinated.",
        "This prognosis is supported by the experiments performed by the NYU group (Strzalkowsld and Vauthey, 1991; Grishman and Strzalkowski, 1991), and by the group at the University of Massachussetts (Croft et al., 1991).",

      "text": [
        "Our information retrieval system consists of a traditional statistical backbone (Harman and Candela, 1989) augmented with various natural language processing components that assist the system in database processing (stemming, indexing, word and phrase clustering, selectional restrictions), and translate a user's information request into an effective query.",
        "This design is a careful compromise between purely statistical non-linguistic approaches and those requiring rather accomplished (and expensive) semantic analysis of data, often referred to as 'conceptual retrieval'.",
        "The conceptual retrieval systems, though quite effective, are not yet mature enough to be considered in serious information retrieval applications, the major problems being their extreme inefficiency and the need for manual encoding of domain knowledge (Mauldin, 1991).",
        "In our system the database text is first processed with a fast syntactic parser.",
        "Subsequently certain types of phrases are extracted from the parse trees and used as compound indexing terms in addition to single-word terms.",
        "The extracted phrases are statistically analyzed as syntactic contexts in order to discover a variety of similarity links between smaller subphrases and words occurring in them.",
        "A further filtering process maps these similarity links onto semantic relations (generalization, specialization, synonymy, etc.)",
        "after which they are used to transform user's request into a search query.",
        "The user's natural language request is also parsed, and all indexing terms occurring in them are identified.",
        "Next, certain highly ambiguous (usually single-word) terms are dropped, provided that they also occur as elements in some compound terms.",
        "For example, \"natural\" is deleted from a query already containing \"natural language\" because \"natural\" occurs in many unrelated contexts: \"natural number\", \"natural logarithm\", \"natural approach\", etc.",
        "At the same time, other terms may be added, namely those which are linked to some query term through admissible similarity relations.",
        "For example, \"fortran\" is added to a query containing the compound term \"program language\" via a specification link.",
        "After the final query is constructed, the database search follows, and a ranked list of documents is returned.",
        "It should be noted that all the processing steps, those performed by the backbone system, and these performed by the natural language processing components, are fully automated, and no human intervention or manual encoding is required."

      "text": [
        "TTP (Tagged Text Parser) is based on the Linguistic String Grammar developed by Sager (1981).",
        "Written in Quintus Prolog, the parser currently encompasses more than 400 grammar productions.",
        "It produces regularized parse tree representations for each sentence that reflect the sentence's logical structure.",
        "The parser is equipped with a powerful skip-and-fit recovery mechanism that allows it to operate effectively in the face of ill-formed input or under a severe time pressure.",
        "In the recent experiments with approximately 6 million words of English texts,3 the parser's speed averaged between 0.45 and 0.5 seconds per sentence, or up to 2600 words per minute, on a 21 MIPS SparcStation ELC.",
        "Some details of the parser are discussed below.4 TT?",
        "is a full grammar parser, and initially, it attempts to generate a complete analysis for each sentence.",
        "However, unlike an ordinary parser, it has a built-in timer which regulates the amount of time allowed for parsing any one sentence.",
        "If a parse is not returned before the allotted time elapses, the parser enters the skip-and-fit mode in which it will try to \"fit\" the parse.",
        "While in the skip-and-fit mode, the parser will attempt to forcibly reduce incomplete constituents, possibly skipping portions of input in order to restart processing at a next unattempted constituent.",
        "In other words, the parser will favor reduction to backtracking while in the skip-and-fit mode.",
        "The result of this strategy is an approximate parse, partially fitted using top-down predictions.",
        "The fragments skipped in the first pass are not thrown out, instead they are analyzed by a simple phrasal parser that looks for noun phrases and relative clauses and then attaches the recovered material to the main parse structure.",
        "As an illustration, consider the following sentence taken from the CACM-3204 corpus: 3 These include CACM-3204, MUC-3, and a selection of nearly 6,000 technical articles extracted from Computer Library database (a Ziff Communications Inc. CD-ROM).",
        "A complete description can be found in (Strzalkowski,",
        "The method is illustrated by the automatic construction of both recursive and iterative programs operating on natural numbers, lists, and trees, in order to construct a program satisfying certain specifications a theorem induced by those specifications is proved, and the desired program is extracted from the proof.",
        "The italicized fragment is likely to cause additional complications in parsing this lengthy string, and the parser may be better off ignoring this fragment altogether.",
        "To do so successfully, the parser must close the currently open constituent (i.e., reduce a program satisfying certain specifications to NP), and possibly a few of its parent constituents, removing corresponding productions from further consideration, until an appropriate production is reactivated.",
        "In this case, 1TP may force the following reductions: S/ – ) to V NP; SA --) SI; S --) NP V NP SA, until the production S S and S is reached.",
        "Next, the parser skips input to find and, and resumes normal processing.",
        "As may be expected, the skip-and-fit strategy will only be effective if the input skipping can be performed with a degree of determinism.",
        "This means that most of the lexical level ambiguity must be removed from the input text, prior to parsing.",
        "We achieve this using a stochastic parts of speech tagger 5 to preprocess the text.",
        "WORD SUFFIX TRIMMER Word stemming has been an effective way of improving document recall since it reduces words to their common morphological root, thus allowing more successful matches.",
        "On the other hand, stemming tends to decrease retrieval precision, if care is not taken to prevent situations where otherwise unrelated words are reduced to the same stem.",
        "In our system we replaced a traditional morphological stemmer with a conservative dictionary-assisted suffix trimmer.",
        "The suffix trimmer performs essentially two tasks: (1) it reduces inflected word forms to their root forms as specified in the dictionary, and (2) it converts nominalized verb forms (eg.",
        "\"implementation\", \"storage\") to the root forms of corresponding verbs (i.e., \"implement\", \"store\").",
        "This is accomplished by removing a standard suffix, eg.",
        "\"stor+age\", replacing it with a standard root ending (\"+e\"), and checking the newly created word against the dictionary, i.e., we check whether the new root (\"store\") is indeed a legal word, and whether the original root (\"storage\")"

        "In phase one, all and only unambiguous head-modifier pairs are extracted, and frequencies of their occurrence are recorded.",

        "The connection between the terms co-occurrences and the information they are transmitting (or otherwise, their meaning) was established and discussed in detail by Harris (1968, 1982, 1991) as fundamental for his mathematical theory of language.",

        "This relation can be given by the function – log p(x) which corresponds to information which a single word is contributing to the entropy of the entire language.",
        "In contrast to information theory, the goal of the present study is not to calculate informational capacities of a language, but to measure the relative strength of connection between the words in syntactic pairs.",
