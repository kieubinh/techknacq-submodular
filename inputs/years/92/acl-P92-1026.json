        "Depending on the grammar formalism, different languages are used for stating the constraints on permissible linearizations.",
        "LP rules, first proposed by Gazdar and Pullum (1982) for GPSG, are used, in different guises, by several contemporary grammar formalisms.",
        "In Functional Unification Grammar (Kay 1985) and implemented versions of Lexical Functional Grammar, pattern languages with the power of regular expressions have been utilized.",
        "Depending on the grammar model, LP statements apply within different ordering domains.",
        "In most frameworks, such as GPSG and HPSG, the ordering domains are local trees.",

        "In this paper we do not attempt to resolve the linguistic issue of the most adequate universal treatment of word order.",
        "However we will present a method for integrating word order constraints in a typed feature unification formalism without adding new formal devices.",
        "Although some proposals for the interaction between feature unification and LP constraints have been published (e.g. Seiffert 1991), no encoding has yet been shown that integrates LP constraints in the linguistic type system of a typed feature unification formalism.",
        "Linguistic processing with a head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG) containing LP constraints has not yet been described in the literature.",

        "In this paper we will demonstrate how LP constraints can be incorporated into the linguistic type system of HPSG through the use of parametrized types.",

        "LP constraints are applied through regular unification whenever the head combines with a complement or adjunct.",
        "Although we use certain LP-relevant features in our examples, our aproach does not hinge on the selection of specific linguistic criteria for constraining linear order.",
        "Since there is no conclusive evidence to the contrary, we assume the simplest constraint language for formulating LP statements, i.e., binary LP constraints.",
        "For computational purposes such constraints are compiled into the type definitions for grammatical categories.",

        "We have presented a formal method for the treatment of LP constraints, which requires no addition to standard feature unification formalisms.",

        "The linguist does not lose any of the descriptive means nor the conceptual clarity that an ID/LP formalism offers.",
        "Yet he gains an adequate computational interpretation of LP constraints.",
        "Because of the declarative specification of LP constraints, this encoding is neutral with respect to processing direction (parsing-generation).",
        "It does not depend on specific strategies (top-down vs. bottom-up) although, as usual, some combinations are more efficient than others.",
        "This is an advantage over the formalization of unification ID/LP grammars in Seiffert (1991) and the approach by Erbach (1991).",
        "Seiffert's approach, in which LP constraints operate over siblings, requires an addition to the parsing algorithm, by which LP constraints are checked during processing to detect violations as early as possible, and again after processing, in case LP-relevant information has been added later by unification.",
        "Erbach's approach can handle LP constraints in head domains by building up a list of constituents over which the LP constraints are enforced, but also requires an addition to the parsing algorithm for checking LP constraints during as well as after processing.",
        "Our encoding of LP constraints does not require any particular format of the grammar, such as left or right-branching structures.",
        "Therefore it can be incorporated into a variety of linguistic analyses.",
        "There is no need to work out the formal semantics of LP constraints because feature unification formalisms already have a well-defined formal semantics.",
        "Reape (1989) proposes a different strategy for treating partially free word order.",
        "His approach also permits the application of LP constraints across local trees.",
        "This is achieved by separating word order variation from the problem of building a semantically motivated phrase structure.",
        "Permutation across constituents can be described by merging the fringes (terminal yields) of the constituents using the operation of sequence union.",
        "All orderings imposed on the two merged fringes by LP constraints are preserved in the merged fringe.",
        "Reape treats clause union and scrambling as permutation that does not affect constituent structure.",
        "Although we are intrigued by the elegance and descriptive power of Reape's approach, we keep our bets with our more conservative proposal.",
        "The main problem we see with Reape's strategy is the additional",
        "burden for the LP component of the grammar.",
        "For every single constituent that is scrambled out of some clause into a higher clause, the two clauses need to be sequence-unioned.",
        "A new type of LP constraints that refer to the position of the constituents in the phrase or dependency structure is employed for ensuring that the two clauses are not completely interleaved.",
        "Hopefully future research will enable us to arrive at better judgements on the adequacy of the different approaches.",

        "The resulting constituent can be fronted.",
        "The remaining arguments and adjuncts are raised to the subcategorization list7 of the auxiliary verb above the main verb.",
        "Yet, even if a flat structure is assumed for both the fronted part of the clause and the part remaining in situ as in (Pollard 1990), LP constraints have to order major constituents across the two parts.",

        "Sketchy as the data may be, they suggest that violation of certain LP-constraints merely makes a sentence less acceptable.",
        "Degrees of acceptability are not easily captured in feature structures as they are viewed today.",
        "In terms of our theory, we must ensure that the unification of the complement's or adjunct's left or right context restriction with the head's LP-STORE does not fail in case of a value clash, but rather results in a feature structure with lower acceptability than the structure in which there is no feature clash.",
        "But until we have developed a well-founded theory of degrees of acceptability, and explored appropriate formal means such as weighted feature structures, as proposed in (Uszkoreit 1991a), we will either have to ignore ordering principles or treat them as absolute constraints."
