        "Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) has been offered as a theory of coordination in natural language (Steedman [1990]).",
        "It has usually been implemented in languages based on first order unification.",
        "Moore [1989] however has pointed out that coordination presents problems for first-order unification-based semantic interpretation.",
        "We show that it is possible to get over the problem by compiling the lambda reduction steps that are associated with coordination in the lexicon.",
        "We show how our first-order unification handles the following examples of coordinate constructs.",
        "(1.1) Harry walks and every farmer walks.",
        "(1.2) A farmer walks and talks.",
        "(1.3) A farmer and every senator talk.",
        "(1.4) Harry finds and a woman cooks a mushroom.",
        "(1.5) Mary gives every dog a bone and some policeman a flower.",
        "We will first start with an illustration of why standard Montagovian semantics of coordination cannot be immediately rendered into a first-order unification strategy.",
        "The lexicon must contain multiple entries for the single lexical item \"and\", since only like categories are supposed to conjoin.",
        "For example, the lexical entry for \"and\" in (1.1) specifies the constraint that the lexical item should expect on both sides sentences to give a sentence.",
        "Moore [1989] predicts that a unification-based semantic interpretation for sentences which involve for example noun phrase coordination won't be possible without an explicit use of lambda expressions, though there are cases where some lambda expressions can be eliminated by directly assigning values to variables embedded in a logical-form expression.",
        "The problematic example is shown in (1.6), where proper noun subjects are conjoined.",
        "(1.6) john and bill walk.",
        "The argument is that if we do not change the semantics of \"john\" from j to AP.P(j), where P is a second order variable for property in the Montagovian sensel , then the single predicate AX .",
        "walk (X) should accommodate two different constants j and b in a single variable X at the same time.",
        "Since the unification simply blocks in this case, the argument goes, we need to use higher order lambda expressions such as AP P ( j ) or AP â€¢ P (b) , which when conjoined together, will yield semantics for e.g. \"john and bill\" as",
        "Combined finally with the predicate, this will result in the semantics (1.7), after lambda reduction.",
        "'Montague [1974].",
        "APvP(j) to be exact, taking in-tensionality into account.",
        "The semantics of the predicate \"walks\" will then be (A Mt.",
        "valk(X)).",
        "Although Moore did not use quantified noun phrases to illustrate the point, his observation generalizes straightforwardly to the sentence (1.3).",
        "In this case, the semantics of \"and\", \"every\" and \"some\" (or \"a\") will be (1.8) a, b, and c, respectively.",
        "(1.8) (a) AQ.AR.Ap.",
        "(Q(p) & R(P)) (b) AS.AP'.forall(X,S(X)=>P1(X)) (c) As.AP'' .exists(X,S(X)&P' ' (X))",
        "Thus, after four lambda reduction steps, one for each of Q, R, p, and P\" , the semantics of \"a farmer and every senator\" will be",
        "as desired.",
        "Moore's paper showed how lambda reduction could be avoided by performing lambda reduction steps at compile time, by utilizing the lexicon, instead of doing them at run time.",
        "Consider again (1.8a).",
        "The reason why this formulation requires four subsequent lambda reduction steps, not three, is that the property p should be applied to each of the conjuncts, requiring two separate lambda reduction steps.",
        "Suppose that we try to eliminate these two lambda reduction steps at compile time by making the argument of the property p explicit in the lexicon, following the semantics (1.9).",
        "The first-order variable X ranges over the set of individuals, and the hope is that after lambda reduction it will be bound by the quantifiers, such as forall, embedded in the expressions denoted by the variables Q and R. Since the same variable is used for both constructs, however, (1.9) works only for pairs of quantified noun phrases, which don't provide constants, but not for pairs involving proper nouns, which do provide constants.",
        "Incidentally, this problem is particular to a unification approach, and there is nothing wrong with the semantics (1.9), which is equivalent to (1.8a).",
        "This unification problem cannot be avoided by having two distinct variables Y and Z as in (1.10) either, since there is only one source for the predicate property for the coordinate noun phrases, thus there is no way to isolate the argument of the predicate and assign distinct variables for it at compile time.",
        "The way we propose to eliminate the gap between (1.9) and (1.10) is to introduce some spurious binding which can always be removed subsequently.",
        "The suggestion then is to use (1.11) for the semantics of \"and\" for noun phrase conjunction.",
        "(1.11) Semantics of \"and\" for NP Conjunction: AQ.AR.AP.",
        "(Q(AY.exists(X,X=YtiP(X))) & ROZ.exists(X,X=Z&P(X))))",
        "This satisfies, we believe, the two requirements, one that the predicate have the same form, the other that the variables for each conjunct be kept distinct, at the same time.",
        "The rest of the lambda expressions can be eliminated by using the notion of partial execution (Pereira & Shieber [1987]).",
        "Details will be shown in Section 3, along with some \"more immediate but faulty\" solutions.",
        "It is surprising that the same idea can be applied to some fairly complicated examples as (1.5), and we believe that the solution proposed is quite general.",
        "In order to show how the idea works, we use a first-order Montagovian Intensional Logic (Jowsey [1987]; Jowsey [1990]) for a semantics.",
        "We apply the proposal to CCG, but it could equally well be applied to any lexicon based grammar formalism.",
        "We explain briefly how a CCG works in the first part of Section 2.",
        "As for the semantics, nothing hinges on a particular choice, and in fact the code we show is devoid of some crucial features of Jowsey's semantics, such as indices for situations or sortal constraints for variable binding.",
        "We present the version of Jowsey's semantics that we adopt for our purposes in the second part of Section 2, mainly for completeness.",
        "In Section 3, each of the cases in (1.1) through (1.5), or variations thereof, is accounted for by encoding lexical entries of \"and\", although only (1.3) and (1.5) depend crucially on the technique.",
        "We have a few words for the organization of a semantic interpretation system we are assuming in this paper.",
        "We imagine that it consists of two levels, where the second level takes a scope-neutral logical form to produce every possible, genuinely ambiguous, scoping possibilities in parallel and the first level produces this scope-neutral logical form from the source sentence.",
        "We assume that our second level, which we leave for future research, will not be very different from the one in Hobbs Az Shieber [1987] or Pereira Shieber [1987].",
        "The goal of this paper is to show how the scope-neutral logical forms are de",
        "rived from natural language sentences with coordinate constructs.",
        "Our \"scope-neutral\" logical form, which we call \"canonical\" logical form (cis), syntactically reflects derivation-dependent order of quantifiers since they are derived by a derivation-dependent sequence of combination.",
        "We emphasize that this derivation-dependence is an artifact of our illustrative example, and that it is not an inherent consequence of our technique."
