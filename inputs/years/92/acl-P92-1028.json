        "State-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) systems typically rely on heuristics to resolve many classes of ambiguities, e.g., prepositional phrase attachment, part of speech disambiguation, word sense disambiguation, conjunction, pronoun resolution, and concept activation.",
        "However, the manual encoding of these heuristics, either as part of a formal grammar or as a set of disambiguation rules, is difficult because successful heuristics demand the assimilation of complex syntactic and semantic knowledge.",
        "Consider, for example, the problem of prepositional phrase attachment.",
        "A number of purely structural solutions have been proposed including the theories of Minimal Attachment (Frazier, 1978) and Right Association (Kimball, 1973).",
        "While these models may suggest the existence of strong syntactic preferences in effect during sentence understanding, other studies provide clear evidence that purely syntactic heuristics for prepositional phrase attachment will not work (see (Whittemore, Ferrara, & Brunner, 1990), (Taraban, & McClelland, 1988)).",
        "However, computational linguists have found the manual encoding of disambiguation rules – especially those that merge syntactic and semantic constraints – to be difficult, time-consuming, and prone to error.",
        "In addition, hand-coded heuristics are often incomplete and perform poorly in new domains comprised of specialized vocabularies or a different genre of text.",
        "In this paper, we focus on a single ambiguity in sentence processing: locating the antecedents of relative pronouns.",
        "We present an implemented corpus-based approach for the automatic acquisition of disambiguation heuristics for that task.",
        "The technique uses an existing hierarchical clustering system to determine the antecedent of a relative pronoun given a description of the clause that precedes it and requires only minimal syntactic parsing capabilities and a very general semantic feature set for describing nouns.",
        "Unlike other corpus-based techniques, only a small number of training examples is needed, making the approach practical even for small to medium-sized on-line corpora.",
        "For the task of relative pronoun disambiguation, the automated approach duplicates the performance of hand-coded rules and makes it possible to compile heuristics tuned to a new corpus with little human intervention.",
        "Moreover, we believe that the technique may provide a general approach for the automated acquisition of disambiguation heuristics for additional problems in natural language processing.",
        "In the next section, we briefly describe the task of relative pronoun disambiguation.",
        "Sections 3 and 4 give the details of the acquisition algorithm and evaluate its performance.",
        "Problems with the approach and extensions required for use with large corpora of unrestricted text are discussed in Section 5."

        "It is especially a concern for corpora where the sentences tend to be long and information-packed.",
        "Unfortunately, to understand a sentence containing a relative pronoun, an NLP system must solve two difficult problems: the system has to locate the antecedent of the relative pronoun and then determine the antecedent's implicit position in the embedded clause.",
        "Although finding the gap in the embedded clause is an equally difficult",
        "problem, the work we describe here focuses on locating the relative pronoun antecedent.1 This task may at rust seem relatively simple: the antecedent of a relative pronoun is just the most recent constituent that is a human.",
        "This is the case for sentences Si-Si in Figure 1, for example.",
        "However, this strategy assumes that the NLP system produces a perfect syntactic and semantic parse of the clause preceding the relative pronoun, including prepositional phrase attachment (e.g., S3, S4, and S7) and interpretation of conjunctions (e.g., S4, S5, and S6) and appositives (e.g., S6).",

        "Moreover, the parser must access both syntactic and semantic knowledge in finding the antecedent of a relative pronoun.",
        "The syntactic structure of the clause preceding \"who\" in S7 and S8, for example, is identical (NP-PP) but the antecedent in each case is different.",

        "Sometimes there is no apparent antecedent at all (e.g., S9).",
        "Other times the antecedent is truly ambiguous without seeing more of the surrounding context (e.g., S10).",
        "As a direct result of these difficulties, NLP system builders have found the manual coding of rules that find relative pronoun antecedents to be very hard.",
        "In addition, the resulting heuristics are prone to errors of omission and may not generalize to new contexts.",
        "For example, the UMass/MUC-3 system2 began with 19 rules for finding the antecedents of relative pronouns.",
        "These rules included both structural and semantic knowledge and were based on approximately 50 instances of relative pronouns.",
        "As counterexamples were identified, new rules were added (approximately 10) and existing rules changed.",
        "Over time, however, we became increasingly reluctant to modify the rule set because the global effects of local rule changes were difficult to measure.",
        "Moreover, the original rules were based on sentences that UMass/MUC-3 had found to contain important information.",
        "As a result, the rules tended to work well for relative pronoun disambiguation in sentences of this class (93% correct for one test set of 50 texts), but did not generalize to sentences outside of the class (78% correct on the same test set of 50 texts)."

        "Alternatively, a syntactic filter is applied to the parse tree and any noun phrases for which coreference with the relative pronoun is syntactically legal (or, in some cases, illegal) are passed to a semantic component which determines the antecedent using inference or preference rules (see (Correa, 1988), (Hobbs, 1986), (Ingria, & Stallard, 1989), (Lappin, & McCord, 1990)).",

        "Unfortunately, extending the technique for use with unrestricted texts may be difficult.",
        "The UMass/MUC-3 parser would clearly need additional mechanisms to handle the ensuing part of speech and 8Interestingly, in work on the automated classification of nouns, (Hindle, 1990) also noted problems with \"empty\" words that depend on their complements for meaning.",

        "In addition, although our simple semantic feature set seems adequate for the current relative pronoun disambiguation task, it is doubtful that a single semantic feature set can be used across all domains and for all disambiguation tasks .9 In related work on pronoun disambiguation, Dagan and Itai (1991) successfully use statistical cooccurrence patterns to choose among the syntactically valid pronoun referents posed by the parser.",
        "Their approach is similar in that the statistical database depends on parser output.",
        "However, it differs in a variety of ways.",
        "First, human intervention is required not to specify the correct pronoun antecedent, but to check that the complete parse tree supplied by the parser for each training example is correct and to rule out potential examples that are inappropriate for their approach.",
        "More importantly, their method requires very large corpora of data.",
        "Our technique, on the other hand, requires few training examples because each training instance is not word-based, but created from higher-level parser output.1° Therefore, unlike other corpus-based techniques, our approach is practical for use with small to medium-sized corpora in relatively narrow domains.",
        "((Dagan & Itai, 1991) mention the use of semantic feature-based cooccurrences as one way to make use of a smaller corpus.)",
        "In addition, because human intervention is required only to specify the antecedent during the training phase, creating disambiguation heuristics for a new domain requires little effort.",
        "Any NLP system that uses semantic features for describing nouns and has minimal syntactic parsing capabilities can generate the required training instances.",
        "The parser need only recognize noun phrases, verbs, and prepositional phrases because the disambiguation heuristics, not the parser, are responsible for recognizing the conjunctions and appositives that comprise a relative pronoun antecedent.",
        "Moreover, the success of the approach for structurally complex antecedents suggests that the technique may provide a general approach for the 9 In recent work on the disambiguation of structurally, but not semantically, restricted phrases, however, a set of 16 predefined semantic categories sufficed (Ravin, 1990).",
