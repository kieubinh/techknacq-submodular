        "This can be seen in the emergence of new theories of language, such as Situation Theory [Barwise 83] and Discourse Representation Theory [Kamp 84].",
        "While these theories provide an excellent theoretical framework for natural language understanding, the practical treatment of context dependency within the language can also be improved by enhancing underlying component technologies, such as knowledge based systems.",
        "In particular, alternate approaches to symbolic manipulation provided by connec-tionist models [Rumelhart 86] have emerged.",
        "Connectionist approaches enable the extraction of processing knowledge from examples, instead of building knowledge bases manually.",
        "The model described here represents the unification of the connectionist approach and conventional symbolic manipulation; its most valuable feature is the use of word associations using neural network technology.",

        "By only typing sentences by phonetic expressions of Japanese (kana), the kana-kanji converter automatically converts kana into meaningful expressions(kanji).",

        "In using word co-occurrence restrictions, it is necessary to collect a large amount of co-occurrence phenomena, a practically impossible task.",

        "The link between nodes is a weighted link and represents the strength of association between words.",
        "The network is a Hopfield-type network[Hopfield 84]; links are bidirectional and a network is one layered.",
        "When the user chooses a word from homonym candidates, a certain value is inputted to the node corresponding to the chosen word and the node will be activated.",
        "The activation level of nodes connected to the activated node will be then activated.",
        "In this manner, the activation spreads over the net",
        "work through the links and the active part of the network can be considered as the associative words in that context.",
        "In kana-kanji conversion, the converter decides the preference of word order for homonyms in the given context by comparing the node activation level of each node of homonyms.",
        "An example of the method is shown in Figure 1.",
        "Assume the network is already built from certain documents.",
        "A user is inputting a text whose topic is related to Computer hardware.",
        "In the example, words like clock Er 7 and signal (fg-g-) already appear in the previous context, so their activation levels are relatively high.",
        "When the word DOUKI e5-is inputted in kana and the conversion starts, the activation level of synchronization (PWA) is higher than that of other candidates due to its relationship to clock or signal.",
        "The input douki is then correctly converted into synchronization (POW).",
