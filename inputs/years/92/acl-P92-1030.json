        "Work on discourse structure, e.g., [Reichman, 1985; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Allen, 1987], has so far taken a rather coarse, high-level view of discourse, mostly treating sentences or sentence-like entities (\"utterance units,\" \"contributions,\" etc.)",
        "as the lowest-level discourse elements.",
        "To the extent that sentences are analyzed at all, they are simply viewed as carriers of certain features relevant to supra-sentential discourse structure: cue words, tense, time adverbials, aspectual class, intonational cues, and others.",
        "These features are presumed to be extractable in some straightforward fashion and provide the inputs to a higher-level discourse segment analyzer.",
        "However, sentences (or their logical forms) are not in general \"flat,\" with a single level of structure and features, but may contain multiple levels of clausal and adverbial embedding.",
        "This substructure can give rise to arbitrarily complex relations among the contributions made by the parts, such as temporal and discourse relations among subordinate clausal constituents and events or states of affairs they evoke.",
        "It is therefore essential, in a comprehensive analysis of discourse structure, that these intra-sentential relations be systematically brought to light and integrated with larger-scale discourse structures.",
        "Our particular interest is in tense, aspect and other indicators of temporal structure.",
        "We are developing a uniform, compositional approach to interpretation in which a parse tree leads directly (in rule-to-rule fashion) to a preliminary, indexical logical form, and this LF is deindexed by processing it in the current context (a well-defined structure).",
        "Deindexing simultaneously transforms the LF and the context: context-dependent constituents of the LF, such as operators past, pres and pen f and adverbs like today or earlier, are replaced by explicit relations among quantified episodes; (anaphora are also deindexed, but this is not discussed here); and new structural components and episode tokens (and other information) are added to the context.",
        "This dual transformation is accomplished by simple recursive equivalences and equalities.",
        "The relevant context structures are called tense trees; these are what we propose as the \"fine structure\" of discourse, or at least as a key component of that fine structure.",
        "In this paper, we first review Reichenbach's influential work on tense and aspect.",
        "Then we describe temporal deindexing using tense trees, and extensions of the mechanism to handle discourse involving shifts in temporal perspective."

        "Researchers concerned with higher-level discourse structure, e.g., Webber [1987; 1988], Passonneau [1988] and Song and Cohen [1991], have almost invariably relied on some Reichenbach [19471-like conception of tense.",
        "The syntactic part of this conception is that there are nine tenses in English, namely simple past, present and future tense, past, present and future perfect tense, and posterior past, present and future tensel (plus progressive variants).",
        "The semantic part of the conception is that each tense specifies temporal relations among exactly three times particular to a tensed clause, namely the event time (E), the reference time (R) and the speech time (S).",
        "On this conception, information in discourse is a matter of \"extracting\" one of the nine Re-ichenbachian tenses from each sentence, asserting the",
        "appropriate relations among E, R and S, and appropriately relating these times to previously introduced times, taking account of discourse structure cues implicit in tense shifts.",
        "It is easy to understand the appeal of this approach when one's concern is with higher-level structure.",
        "By viewing sentences as essentially flat, carrying tense as a top-level feature with nine possible values and evoking a triplet of related times, one can get on with the higher-level processing with minimum fuss.",
        "But while there is much that is right and insightful about Reichenbach's conception, it seems to us unsatisfactory from a modern perspective.",
        "One basic problem concerns embedded clauses.",
        "Consider, for instance, the following passage.",
        "(1) John will find this note when he gets home.",
        "(2) He will think.)",
        "Mary has left(b).",
        "Reichenbach's analysis of (2) gives us Eb < S, Rb < R., E0, where ti <t2 means t1 is before t2, as below.",
        "That is, John will think that Mary's leaving took place some time before the speaker uttered sentence (2).",
        "This is incorrect; it is not even likely that John would know about the utterance of (2).",
        "In actuality, (2) only implies that John will think Mary's leaving took place some time before the time of his thinking, i.e., S < R., E. and Fib < Rb, R, as shown below.",
        "Thus, Reichenbach's system fails to take into account the local context created by syntactic embedding.",
        "Attempts have been made to refine Reichenbach's theory (e.g., [Hornstein, 1977; Smith, 1978; Nerbonne, 1986]), but we think the lumping together of tense and aspect, and the assignment of E, R, S triples to all clauses, are out of step with modern syntax and semantics, providing a poor basis for a systematic, compositional account of temporal relations within clauses and between clauses.",
        "In particular, we contend that English past, present, future and perfect are separate morphemes making separate contributions to syntactic structure and meaning.",
        "Note that perfect have, like most verbs, can occur untensed (\"She is likely to have left by now\").",
        "Therefore, if the meaning of other tensed verbs such as walks or became is regarded as composite, with the tense morpheme supplying a \"present\" or \"past\" component of the meaning, the same ought to be said about tensed forms of have.",
        "The modals will and would do not have untensed forms.",
        "Nevertheless, considerations of syntactic and semantic uniformity suggest that they too have composite meanings, present or past tense being one part and \"future modality\" the other.",
        "This unifies the analyses of the modals in sentences like \"He knows he will see her again\" and \"He knew he would see her again,\" and makes them entirely parallel to paraphrases in terms of going to, viz., \"He knows he is going to see her again\" and \"He knew he was going to see her again.\"",
        "We take these latter \"posterior tense\" forms to be patently hierarchical (e.g., is going to see her has 4 levels of VP structure, counting to as an auxiliary verb) and hence semantically composite on any compositional account.",
        "Moreover, going to can both subordinate, and be subordinated by, perfect have, as in \"He is going to have left by then.\"",
        "This leads to additional \"complex tenses\" missing from Reichenbach's list.",
        "We therefore offer a compositional account in which operators corresponding to past (past), present (pres), future (futr) and perfect (per!)",
        "contribute separately and uniformly to the meanings of their operands, i.e., formulas at the level of LF.",
        "Thus, for instance, the temporal relations implicit in \"John will have left\" are obtained not by extracting a \"future perfect\" and asserting relations among E, R and S, but rather by successively taking account of the meanings of the nested pres, futr and pen f operators in the LF of the sentence.",
        "As it happens, each of those operators implicitly introduces exactly one episode, yielding a Reichenbach-like result in this case.",
        "(But note: a simple present sentence like \"John is tired\" would introduce only one episode concurrent with the speech time, not two, as in Reichenbach's analysis.)",
        "Even more importantly for present purposes, each of pres, past, futr and pen f is treated uniformly in deindexing and context change.",
        "More specifically, they drive the generation and traversal of tense trees in deindexing."

        "This includes certain relations implicit in the ordering of clauses and sentences.",
        "As has been frequently observed, for a sequence of sentences within the same discourse segment, the temporal reference of a sentence is almost invariably connected to that of the previous sentence in some fashion.",

        "wOur approach to plausible inference in episodic logic in general, and to such default inferences in particular, is probabilistic (see [Schubert and Hwang, 1989; Hwang, 1992]).",

        "Even though {b-e} would normally be considered a sub-segment of the main discourse {a, f}, both the temporal relations within each segment and the relations between segments (i.e., that the substory temporally precedes the main one) are automatically captured by our rules.",
        "For instance, eland en are recognized as successive episodes, both preceded at some time in the past by e3, es, e7, and e9, in that order.",
        "This is not to say that our tense tree mechanism obviates the need for larger-scale discourse structures.",
        "As has been pointed out by Webber [1987;1988] and others, many subnarratives introduced by a past perfect sentence may continue in simple past.",
        "The following is one of Webber's examples:",
        "(8) a. I wasleo at Mary's house yesterday.",
        "b.",
        "We talked{e,} about her sister Jane.",

        "Note the shift to simple past in d, though as Webber points out, past perfect could have been used.",
        "The abandonment of the past perfect in favor of simple past signals the temporary abandonment of a perspective anchored in the main narrative - thus bringing readers \"closer\" to the scene (a zoom-in effect).",
        "In such cases, the tense tree mechanism, unaided by a notion of higher-level discourse segment structure, would derive incorrect temporal relations such as [es orients es] or te6 right-after es].",
        "We now show possible deindexing rules for perspective shifts, assuming for now that such shifts are independently identifiable, so that they can be incorporated into the indexical LFs.",
        "new-pers is a sentence operator initiating a perspective shift for its operand, and prey-pers is a sentence (with otherwise no content) which gets back to the previous perspective.",
        "RecentT is the episode most recently stored in the subtree immediately embedded by the focal node of T. New-pers: (new-pers (1))T 4-* [.-T A [Recent/.",
        "orients RecentT,]] where T' = (I) • ()--T)",
        "When new-pers is encountered, a new tree is created and embedded at the focal node, the focus is moved to the root node of the new tree, and the next sentence is processed in that context.",
        "In contrast with other operators, new-pers causes an overall focus shift to the new tree, rather than returning the focus to the original root.",
        "Note that the predication [RecentT orients Recentv] connects an episode of the new sentence with an episode of the previous sentence.",
        "prev-pers produces a trivial True, but it returns the focus to the embedding tree, simultaneously blocking the link between the embedding and the embedded tree (as emphasized by use of 4-e- instead of 4 – ).",
        "We now illustrate how tense trees get modified over perspective changes, using (8) as example.",
        "We repeat (8d,e) below, augmenting them with perspective changes, and show snapshots of the tense trees at the points marked.",
        "In the trees, ul, ..., us are utterance episodes for sentences a, ..., e, respectively.",
        "Notice the blocked links to the embedded tree in T3 and T4.",
        "Also, note that RecentT, = e4 and Recent/.2 = e5.",
        "So, by New-pers, we get [e4 orients e5], which can be later particularized to [e5 during e4].",
        "It is fairly obvious that the placement of new-pers and prev-pers operators is fully determined by discourse segment boundaries (though not in general coinciding with them).",
        "So, as long as the higher-level discourse segment structure is known, our perspective rules are easily applied.",
        "In that sense, the higher-level structure supplements the \"fine structure\" in a crucial way.",
        "However, this leaves us with a serious problem: deindexing and the context change it induces is supposed to be independent of \"plausible inferencing\"; in fact,",
        "it is intended to set the stage for the latter.",
        "Yet the determination of higher-level discourse structure – and hence of perspective shifts – is unquestionably a matter of plausible inference.",
        "For example, if past perfect is followed by past, this could signal either a new perspective within the current segment (see 8c,d), or the closing of the current subsegment with no perspective shift (see 7e,f).",
        "If past is followed by past, we may have either a continuation of the current perspective and segment (see 9a,b below), or a perspective shift with opening of a new segment (see 9b,c), or closing of the current segment, with resumption of the previous perspective (see 9c,d).",

        "Only plausible inference can resolve these ambiguities.",
        "This inference process will interact with resolution of anaphora and introduction of new individuals, identification of spatial and temporal frames, the presence of modal/cognition/ perception verbs, and most of all will depend on world knowledge.",
        "In (9), for instance, one may have to rely on the knowledge that one normally would not buy broken things, or that one does not buy things one already owns.",
        "As approaches to this general difficulty, we are thinking of the following two strategies: (A) Make a best initial guess about presence or absence of new-pers/ prey-pres, based on surface (syntactic) cues and then use failure-driven backtracking if the resulting interpretation is incoherent.",
        "A serious disadvantage would be lack of integration with other forms of disambiguation.",

        "Subsequent processing would resemble anaphora disambiguation.",
        "In the course of further interpreting the deindexed LF, plausible inference would particularize the schematic orienting relation to a temporal (or causal, etc.)",
        "relation involving just two episodes.",
        "The result would then be used to make certain structural changes to the tense tree (after LF deindexing).",
        "For instance, suppose such a schematic orienting relation is computed for a simple past sentence following a past perfect sentence (like 8c,d).",
        "Suppose further that the most coherent interpretation of the second sentence (i.e., 8d) is one that disambiguates the orienting relation as a simple temporal inclusion relation between the successively reported events.",
        "One might then move the event token for the second event (reported in simple past) from its position at the past node to the rightmost position at the past perfect node, just as if the second event had been reported in the past perfect.",
        "(One might in addition record a perspective shift, if this is still considered useful.)",
        "In other words, we would \"repair\" the distortion of the tense tree brought about by the speaker's \"lazy\" use of simple past in place of past perfect.",
        "Then we would continue as before.",
        "In both strategies we have assumed a general coherence-seeking plausible inference process.",
        "While it is clear that the attainment of coherence entails delineation of discourse segment structure and of all relevant temporal relations, it remains unclear in which direction the information flows.",
        "Are there independent principles of discourse and temporal structure operating above the level of syntax and LF, guiding the achievement of full understanding, or are higher-level discourse and temporal relations a mere byproduct of full understanding?",
        "Webber [1987] has proposed independent temporal focusing principles similar to those in [Grosz and Sidner, 1986] for discourse.",
        "These are not deterministic, and Song and Cohen [1991] sought to add heuristic constraints as a step toward determinism.",
        "For instance, one constraint is based on the presumed incoherence of simple present followed by past perfect or posterior past.",
        "But there are counterexamples; e.g., \"Mary is angry about the accident.",
        "The other driver had been drinking.\"",
        "Thus, we take the question about independent structural principles above the level of syntax and LF to be still open."
