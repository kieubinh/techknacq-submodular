        "Many natural language sentences have more than one possible reading with regard to quantifier scope.",
        "The• most widely used methods for scope determination generate all possible readings of a sentence with regard to quantifier scope by applying all quantifiers which occur in the sentence in all combinatorically possible sequences.",
        "These methods do not make use of the inner structure and meaning of a quantifier.",
        "At best, quantifiers are constrained by external conditions in order to eliminate some scope relations.",
        "The best known methods are: determination of scope in LF in GB (May 1985), Cooper Storage (Cooper 1983, Keller 1988) and the algorithm of Hobbs and Shieber (Hobbs/Shieber 1987).",
        "These methods assign, for instance, six possible readings to a sentence with three quantifiers.",
        "Using these methods, a sentence must be disambiguated in order to receive a semantic representation.",
        "This means that a scope-ambiguous sentence necessarily has several semantic representations, since the formalisms for the representation do not allow for scope-ambiguity.",
        "It is hard to imagine that human beings disambiguate scope-ambiguous sentences in the same way.",
        "The generation of all possible combinations of sequences of quantifiers and the assignment of these sequences to various readings seems to be cognitively inadequate.",
        "The problem becomes even more complicated when natural language quantifiers can be interpreted distributively as well as collectively, which can also lead to further readings.",
        "Let us take the following sentence from Kempson/Cormack (1981) as an example: Two examiners marked six scripts.",
        "The two quantifying noun phrases can in this case be interpreted either distributively or collectively.",
        "The quantifier two examiners can have wide scope over the quantifier six scripts, or vice versa, which all in all can lead to various readings.",
        "Kempson and Cormack assign four possible readings to this sentence,",
        "Davies (1989) even eight.",
        "(A detailed discussion will follow.)",
        "No one, however, will make the claim that people will first assign all possible representations with regard to the scope of the quantifiers and their distribution, and will then eliminate certain interpretations according to the context; but this is today's standard procedure in linguistics.",
        "In many cases, it is also almost impossible to determine a preferred reading.",
        "The difficulties that people have when they are forced to disambiguate such sentences (to explicate all possible readings) point to the fact that people only assign an under-determined scope-ambiguous representation in the first place.",
        "Such a representation of the example sentence would only contain the information that we are dealing with a marking-relation between examiners and scripts, and that we are always dealing with two examiners and six scripts.",
        "This representation does not contain any information about scope.",
        "On the basis of this representation one may in a given context derive a representation with a determined scope.",
        "But it may also be the case that this information is sufficient in order to understand the sentence if no scope-defining information is given in the context, since in many cases human beings do not disambiguate such sentences at all.",
        "They use underdetermined, scopeless interpretations, because their knowledge often need not be so precise.",
        "If a disambiguation is carried out, then this process is done in a very natural way on the basis of context and world knowledge.",
        "This points to the assumption that scope determination by human beings is performed on a semantic level and is deduced on the basis of acquired knowledge.",
        "I will present a formalism which works in a similar way.",
        "This formalism will also show that it is not necessary to work with many sequences of quantifiers in order to determine the various readings of a sentence with regard to quantifier scope.",
        "Within this formalism it is possible to represent an ambiguous sentence with an ambiguous representation which need not be disambiguated, but can be disambiguated at a later stage.",
        "The readings can either be specified more clearly by giving additional conditions, or they can be deduced from the basic ambiguous reading by inference.",
        "Here, the inner structure and the meaning of quantifiers play an important role.",
        "The process of disambiguation can only be performed when additional information that restricts the number of possible readings is available.",
        "As an example of such information, I will treat anaphoric relations.",
        "Intuitively speaking, the difference between assigning an undertermined representation to an ambiguous sentence and assigning a disjunction of all possible readings to this sentence corresponds to the difference between the following statements*: \"Peter owns between 150 and 200 books.\" and \"Peter owns 150 or 151 or 152 or ... or 200 books.\" It goes without saying that both statements are equivalent, since we can understand \"150 or 151 or ... or 200\" as a precise specification of \"between 150 and 200\".",
        "Nevertheless, there are procedural differences in processing the two pieces of information; and there are cognitive differences for human beings, since we would never explicitly utter the second sentence.",
        "If we could represent \"between 150 and 200\" directly by a simple formula and not by giving a disjunction of 51 elements, then we may certainly gain great procedural and representational advantages.",
        "The deduction of readings in semantics does not of course exclude a consideration of syntactic restrictions.",

        "In the formalism, a verb is represented by a relation whose domain is defined by the arguments of verbs.",
        "Determiners constitute restrictions on the domains of the relation.",
        "These restrictions correspond to the role of determiners in Barwise's and Cooper's theory of generalized quantifiers (Barwise and Cooper 1981).",
        "This means for the following sentence: (1.1) Every boy saw a movie.",
        "that there is a relation of seeing between boys and movies.",
        "In the formal notation of second-order logic we can describe this piece of information as follows:",
        "X2 is a second-order variable over the domain of the binary predicates; and Saw, Boy, and Movie are second-order constants which represent a general relation of seeing, the set of all boys, and the set of all movies, respectively.",
        "We will abbreviate the above formula by the following set-theoretical formula:",
        "(1.1.b) 3saw (saw g Boy x Movie) In this formula, we view saw as a sorted variable of the sort of the binary seeing-relations.",

        "Part of the certain knowledge that does not determine scope in the case of sentence (1.1) is also the information that all boys are involved in the relation, which is easily describable as: Dom saw=Boy.",
        "We obtain this information from the denotation of the determiner every.",
        "In this way we have arrived at the scope-ambiguous representation of (1.1): (1.1.c) 3saw (saw c Boy x Movie & Dom saw=Boy) It may be that the information presented in (1.1.c) is sufficient for the interpretation of sentence (1.1).",
        "A precise determination of quantifier scope need not be important at all, since it may be irrelevant whether each boy saw a different movie (which corresponds to the wide scope of the universal quantifier) or whether all boys saw the same movie (which corresponds to the wide scope of the existential quantifier).",
        "Classic procedures will in this case immediately generate two readings with definite scope relations, whose notations in predicate logic are given below.",
        "We can also obtain these representations in our formalism by simply adding new conditions to (1.1.c), which force the disambigivation of (1.1.c) with regard to quantifier scope.",
        "To obtain reading (1.2.b), we must come to know that there is only one movie, which can be fonnaly writen by I Range saw 1=1, where I .",
        "I denotes the cardinality function.",
        "To obtain reading (1.2.a) from (1.1.c), we do not need any new information, since the two formulas are equivalent.",
        "This situation is due to the fact that (1.2.b) implies (1.2.a), which means that (1.2.b) is a special case of (1.2.a).",
        "This relation can be easly seen by comparing the resulting formulas, which correspond to readings (1.2.a) and (1.2.b):",
        "So, we have (1.3.b) => (1.3.a).",
        "As I have stated above, however, it is not very useful to disambiguate representation (1.1.c) immediately.",
        "It makes more sense to leave representation (1.1.c) unchanged for further processing, since it may be that in the development a new condition may appear which determines the scope.",
        "For instance, we can obtain the additional condition in (1.3.b), when sentence (1.1) is followed by a sentence containing a pronoun refering to a movie, as in sentence (1.4).",
        "(1.4) It was \"Gone with the Wind\".",
        "Since it refers to a movie, the image of the saw-relation (a subset of the set of movies) can contain only one element.",
        "Thus, the resolution of the reference results in an extension of representation (1.1.c) by the condition I Range saw 1 = 1.",
        "Therefore, we get in this case only one reading (1.3.b) as a representation of sentence (1.1), which corresponds to wide scope of the existential quantifier.",
        "Thus in the context of (1.4) we have disambiguated sentence (1.1) with regard to quantifier scope without having first generated all possible readings (in our case these were (1.2.a) and (1.2.b)).",
        "A classical scope determining system can only choose one of the readings (1.2.a) and (1.2.b).",

        "Syntactic theories alone are of no help here for finding the correct discourse referent for them in sentence (1.1), since there is no number agreement between them and a movie.",
        "The plural noun them, however, refers to all movies the boys have seen.",
        "This causes great problems for standard anaphora theories and plural theories, since there is no explicit object of reference to which them could refer (cf. Eschenbach et al.",
        "1990; Link 1986).",
        "Thus, the usual procedure would be to construe a complex reference object as the sum of all movies the boys have seen.",
        "With my representation, we do not need such procedures because the discourse referents are always available, namely as domains of the relations.",
        "In the context of (1.1) and (1.5), the pronoun them (just as it in (1.4)) refers to the image of the relation saw, which additionally serves the purpose of determining the quantifier scope.",
        "Here, just as in the preceding cases, the representation (1.1.c) has to be seen as the \"starting representation\" of (1.1).",
        "The information that them is a plural noun is represented by the condition I Range saw I > 1, which in turn leads to the following representation: (1.6) 3saw (saw c Boy x Movie & Dom saw=Boy & I Range saw I >1) The representation (1.6) is not ambiguous with regard to quantifier scope.",
        "The universal quantifier has wide scope over the whole sentence, due to the condition I Range saw I > 1.",
        "The reading presented in (1.6) is a further specification of (1.3.a), which at the same time excludes reading (1.3.b).",
        "Thus (1.6) contains more information that formula (1.2.a), which is equivalent to (1.3.a).",

        "different requires that the relation be injective.",
        "Therefore, the formula (1.1.c) is extended by the condition 'saw is 1-1'.",
