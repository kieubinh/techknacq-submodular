        "Figure 2 shows the overall design of the UNITRAN machine translation system (Dorr, 1990a, 1990b).",

        "We impose this system of features on top of the current lexical-semantic framework.",

        "Thus, it has been suggested that al acts more as a corn-plementizer than as a \"pure\" adverbial connective such as cuando; this would explain the realization of the adjunct not as a tensed adverbial clause, but as an infinitival subordinate clause.",

        "In this latter case, only the word destroy will be selected if the interlingua includes a component that will be realized as a durative adverbial phrase.",
        "Once the aspectual features have guided the lexical selection of the verbs, we are able to use these selections to guide the aspectual realizations that will be used in the surface form.",
        "For example, if we have chosen the word obliterate we would want to realize the verb in the simple past or present (e.g., obliterated or obliterate) rather than in the progressive (e.g., was obliterating or is obliterating).",
        "Thus, the aspectual features (and coercion functions) are used to choose lexical items, and the choice of lexical items is used to realize aspectual features.",
        "The coercion functions are crucial for this two-way channel to operate properly.",
        "In particular, we must take care not to blindly forbid non-atomic verbs from being realized in the progressive since point activities, which are atomic (e.g., tap), are frequently realized in the progressive (e.g., he was tapping the table).",
        "In such cases the progressive morpheme is being used as an iterator of several identical atomic events as defined in the functions shown in figure 4.",
        "Thus, we allow \"coercible\" verbs",

        "A preliminary analysis of the sentences in the corpus reveals that progressive verbs are generally preceded by verbs such as be, like, hate, go, stop, start, etc.",
        "These",
        "verbs fall under a lexical-semantic category identified by Jackendoff (1983, 1990) as the circumstantial category.",
        "Based on this observation, the following hypothesis has been made:",
        "Circumstantial verbs subsume stative verbs, but they also include verbs in other categories.",
        "In terms of the lexical-semantic primitives proposed by Jackendoff (1983, 1990), the circumstantial verbs found in a subset of the corpus are categorized as shown in figure 7.",
        "An intriguing result of this categorization is that the circumstantial verbs provide a systematic partitioning of Dowty's aspectual categories (i.e., states, activities, and achievements) into primitives of Jackendoff's system (i.e., BE, STAY, and GO).",
        "Thus, the analysis of the corpora has provided a crucial link between the primitives of Jackendoff's LCS representation and the features of the aspectual scheme described earlier.",
        "If this is the case, then the framework has proven to be well-suited to the task of automatic construction of conceptual structures from corpora.",
        "Assuming this partitioning is correct and complete, Hypothesis 1 can be refined as follows: Hypothesis V: The only types of verbs that are allowed to precede progressive verbs are states, achievements, and activities.",
        "If this hypothesis is valid, the program is in a better position to identify stative verbs because it corresponds to a test that requires positive evidence rather than negative evidence.",
        "The hypothesis can be described by adding the following line to figure 5: Because there is a YES in the column headed by STA, verbs satisfying this test are potentially stative.",
        "Thus, once a verb X is found that satisfies this test, we apply the (heuristic) algorithm shown in figure 8 to determine",
        "Another hypothesis that has been adopted pertains to the distribution of progressives with respect to the verb go:",
        "This hypothesis was adopted after it was discovered that constructions such as go running, go skiing, go swimming, etc.",
        "appeared in the corpus, but not constructions such as go eating, go writing, etc.",

        "We have examined the question of cross-linguistic applicability showing that the integration of aspect with lexical-semantics is especially critical in machine translation when there are a large number of temporal connectives and verbal selection/realization possibilities that may be generated from a lexical semantic representation.",
        "Furthermore, we have illustrated that the selection/realization processes may be parameterized, by means of selection charts and coercion functions, so that the processes may operate uniformly across more than one language.",
        "Finally, we have discussed the application of the theoretical foundations to the automatic acquisition of aspectual representations from corpora in order to augment the lexical-semantic representations that have already been created for a large number of verbs."
