        "1990, and Weischedel et al.",
        "1991) incorporate RA into their parsing systems, yet none rely on it solely, integrating it instead with disambiguation preferences derived from word/constituent/concept co-occurrence based.",
        "On its own, RA performs rather well, given its simplicity, but it is far from adequate: Whitte-more et al.",
        "evaluate RA's performance on PP attachment using a corpus derived from computer-mediated dialog.",
        "They find that RA makes correct predictions 55% of the time.",
        "Weischedel et al., using a corpus of news stories, report a 75% success rate on the general case of attachment using a strategy Closest Attachment which is essentially RA.",
        "In the work cited above, RA plays a relatively minor role, as compared with co-occurrence based preferences.",

        "On the other hand (2) violates RA with impunity.",
        "What is it that makes RA operate so strongly in 1 but disappear in 2?",
