        "In this paper, I present work in progress on an extension of Combinatory Categorial Grammars, CCGs, (Steedman 1985) to handle languages with freer word order than English, specifically Turkish.",
        "The approach I develop takes advantage of CCGs' ability to combine the syntactic as well as the semantic representations of adjacent elements in a sentence in an incremental manner.",
        "The linguistic claim behind my approach is that free word order in Turkish is a direct result of its grammar and lexical categories; this approach is not compatible with a linguistic theory involving movement operations and traces.",
        "A rich system of case markings identifies the predicate-argument structure of a Turkish sentence, while the word order serves a pragmatic function.",
        "The pragmatic functions of certain positions in the sentence roughly consist of a sentence-initial position for the topic, an immediately pre-verbal position for the focus, and post-verbal positions for backgrounded information (Erguvanli 1984).",
        "The most common word order in simple transitive sentences is SOY (Subject-Object-Verb).",
        "However, all of the permutations of the sentence seen below are grammatical in the proper discourse situations.",

        "Elements with overt case marking generally can scramble freely, even out of embedded clauses.",
        "This suggest a CCG approach where case-marked elements are functions which can combine with one another and with verbs in any order.",
        "*I thank Young-Suk Lee, Michael Niv, Jong Park, Mark Steedman, and Michael White for their valuable advice.",

        "Karttunen (1986) has proposed a Categorial Grammar formalism to handle free word order in Finnish, in which noun phrases are functors that apply to the verbal basic elements.",
        "Our approach treats case-marked noun phrases as functors as well; however, we allow verbs to maintain their status as functors in order to handle object-incorporation and the combining of nested verbs.",
        "In addition, CCGs, unlike Karttunen's grammar, allow the operations of composition and type raising which have been useful in handling a variety of linguistic phenomena including long distance dependencies and nonconstituent coordination (Steedman 1985) and will play an essential role in this analysis."

      "heading": "AN OVERVIEW OF CCGs",
      "text": [
        "In CCGs, grammatical categories are of two types: curried functors and basic categories to which the functors can apply.",
        "A category such as X/ Y represents a function looking for an argument of category Y on its right and resulting in the category X.",
        "A basic category such as X serves as a shorthand for a set of syntactic and semantic features.",
        "A short set of combinatory rules serve to combine these categories while preserving a transparent relation between syntax and semantics.",
        "The application rules allow functors to combine with their arguments.",
        "Forward Application (>):",
        "In addition, CCGs include composition rules to combine together two functors syntactically and semantically.",
        "If these two functors have the semantic interpretation F and G, the result of their composition has the interpretation AxF(C.r.",
        ").",
        "In this analysis, we represent both verbs and case-marked noun phrases as functors.",
        "In Karttunen's analysis (1986), although a verb is a basic element rather than a functor, its arguments are specified as subcate-gorization features of its basic element category.",
        "We choose to directly represent a verb's subcategorization in its functor category.",
        "An advantage of this approach is that at the end of a parse, we do not need an extra process to check if all the arguments of a verb have been found; this falls out of the combination rules.",
        "Also, certain verbs need to act as active functors in order to combine with objects without case marking.",
        "Following a suggestion of Mark Steedman, I define the verb to be an uncurried function which specifies a set of arguments that it can combine with in any order.",
        "For instance, a transitive verb looking for a nominative case noun phrase and an accusative case noun phrase has the category SI {Nn, Na}.",
        "The slash I in this function is undetermined in direction; direction is a feature which can be specified for each of the arguments, notated as an arrow above the argument, e.g. SI{ 71 }.",
        "Since Turkish is not strictly verb final, most verbs will not specify the direction features of their arguments.",
        "The use of uncurried notation allows great freedom in word order among the arguments of a verb.",
        "However, we will want to use the curried notation for some functors to enforce a certain ordering among the functors' arguments.",
        "For example, object nouns or clauses without case-marking cannot scramble at all and must remain in the immediately pre-verbal position.",
        "Thus, verbs which can take a so called incorporated object will also have a curried functor category such as SI{Nn, Nd}1{ â€“ n } forcing the verb to first apply to a noun without case-marking to its immediate left before combining with the rest of its arguments."

        "The interaction between case-marking and the ability to scramble in Turkish supports the theory that case-marked nouns act as functors.",
        "Following Steedman (1985), order-preserving type-raising rules are used to convert nouns in the grammar into functors over the verbs.",

N + case (v1{...}) I {v I{Ncase, ...}} The first rule indicates that a noun in the presence of a case morpheme becomes a functor looking for a verb on its right; this verb is also a functor looking for the original noun with the appropriate case on its left.",
        "After the noun functor combines with the appropriate verb, the result is a functor which is looking for the remaining arguments of the verb.",
        "v is actually a variable for a verb phrase at any level, e.g. the verb of the matrix clause or the verb of an embedded clause.",
        "The notation ... is also a variable which can unify with one or more elements of a set.",
        "The second type-raising rule indicates that a case-marked noun is looking for a verb on its left.",
        "Our CCG formalism can model a strictly verb-final language by restricting the noun phrases of that language to the first type-raising rule.",
        "Since most, but not all, case-marked nouns in Turkish can occur behind the verb, certain pragmatic and semantic properties of a Turkish noun determine whether it can type-raise using either rule or is restricted to only the first rule."

        "To account for these clauses, we can assign the head of the restricted adjunct clause a curried functor category such as XIXI{argurnents...} rather than X II X, arguments...}.",
        "The curried category forces the adjunct head to combine with all of its arguments in the adjunct clause before combining with the constituent it modifies.",
        "This blocks long distance scrambling out of that adjunct clause.",
        "As mentioned before, another use for curried functions is with object nouns or clauses without case marking which are forced to remain in the immediately pre-verbal position.",
        "A matrix verb can have a category such as SI {Nn}I{S2} to allow it to combine with a subordinate clause without case-marking (82) to its immediate left.",
        "However, to restrict a type-raised Nn from interposing in between the matrix verb and the subordinate clause, we must restrict type raised noun phrases and verbs from composing together.",
