        "Elementary logic (i.e. first-order logic) can be used as a logical representation language for texts, but the notion of a information state (a set of possibilities – namely first-order models) is not available from the object language (belongs to the meta language).",
        "This means that texts with other texts as parts (e.g. propositional attitudes with embedded sentences) cannot be treated directly.",
        "Traditional intensional logics (i.e. modal logic) allow (via modal operators) access to the information states from the object language, but the access is limited and interference with (extensional) notions like (standard) identity, variables etc.",
        "is introduced.",
        "This does not mean that the ideas present in intensional logics will not work (possibly improved by adding a notion of partiality), but rather that often a formalisation in the simple type theory (with sorts for entities and indices making information states first class citizens – like individuals) is more comprehensible, flexible and logically well-behaved."

        "The formalisation is judged adequate since the model theory of elementary logic is in correspondence with intuitions (when some logical maturity is gained and some logical innocence is lost) – moreover the proof theory gives a reasonable notion of entailment for the \"toy\" examples.",

        "We argue that information states are to be taken serious in logic-based approaches to NLP.",
        "Furthermore, we think that information states can be regarded as sets of possibilities (structural aspects can be added, but should not be taken as stand-alone).",
        "Information states are at the meta-level only (1) when elementary logic is used.",
        "Information states are still mainly at the meta-level when intensional logics (e.g. modal logic) are used, but some ma(2) nipulations are available at the object level.",

        "The point is not that elementary or the various intensional logics are wrong – on the contrary they include many important ideas – but for the purpose of understanding, integrating and implementing a formalisation one is better off with a simple type theory (stronger type theories are possible, of course)."
