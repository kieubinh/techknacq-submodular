        "Two of the main problems in machine translation (MT) are ambiguity and lexical gaps Ambiguity occurs when a word in the source language (SL) has more that one translation into the target language (TL).",
        "Lexical gaps occur when a word in one language can not be translated directly into another language.",
        "This latter problem is viewed by some as the key translation problem, (Kameyama et al., 1991).",
        "A case in point is the translation of prepositional phrases (PP).",
        "The following entry for the translations into Spanish of the preposition along demonstrates this (entry taken from (Garcia-Pelayo, 1988)).",
        "along: por (by), a lo largo de (to the length of), segim (according to) Both problems occur here: there are three different translations for the same English preposition, and the second of these is a phrase used to describe a sense of along which is not encoded as one word in Spanish."

        "It is argued in (Talmy, 1985) that languages differ in the type of information they systematically encode in lexical units.",
        "That is, languages exhibit distinct lexical-ization patterns.",
        "For instance, in a sentence where both the direction and manner of motion are expressed, English will encode motion and manner in the same verb, whereas in Spanish a distinct lexicalization of these two meaning components will be favoured (Ibid.",

        "Capturing lexicalization patterns of this sort can help us make certain generalizations about lexical gaps and ambiguities in MT.",
        "In the rest of this paper two lexicalization patterns for English locative prepositional phrases (PP) will be presented.",

        "In this case the features encoded by the English and Spanish PP's are the same.",
        "In the second sentence the English preposition encodes the path followed by the runner and the location of this path with respect to the bridge; in Spanish such a combination needs to be expressed by the two prepositions por and debajo de.",
        "In the third example the English preposition expresses the destination of the running and the location of that destination with respect to the bridge; this has to be expressed by the two Spanish prepositions hasta and debajo de.",
        "Other English prepositions which allow either two or three of these readings in locative expressions are shown in the table below.",
        "location path 'along P' destination 'to P' behind detris de por detras de hasta detras de below debajo de por debajo de hasta debajo de inside dentro de por dentro de hasta dentro de outside fuera de por fuera de hasta fuera de under debajo de por debajo de hasta debajo de between entre por entre - near cerca de hasta cerca de From the table the following generalization can be made: whatever the translation P of the locative sense of an English preposition is, its path incorporating sense is translated as por P and its destination incorporating sense is translated as hasta P. In short, certain English prepositions are ambiguous between encoding location, path + location or destination + location.",
        "This is not the case in Spanish.",
        "When translating from English such ambiguities can not be preserved very naturally.",
        "In particular, whenever it is necessary to preserve them (e.g. for legal documents), a disjunction of each individual sense must be used in the TL sentence.",

        "By formulating regularities in this way consistency and compactness in the bilingual lexicon, and therefore in the transfer module, are achieved.",
