        "For a very long time, it has been considered that the only way of automatically extracting similar groups of words from a text collection for which no semantic information exists is to use document co-occurrence data.",
        "But, with robust syntactic parsers that are becoming more frequently available, syntactically recognizable phenomena about word usage can be confidently noted in large collections of texts.",
        "We present here a new system called SEXTANT which uses these parsers and the finer-grained contexts they produce to judge word similarity."

        "Many machine-based approaches to term similarity, such as found in TRUMP (Jacobs and Zernick 1988) and FERRET (Mauldin 1991), can be characterized as knowledge-rich in that they presuppose that known lexical items possess Conceptual Dependence(CD)like descriptions.",
        "Such an approach necessitates a great amount of manual encoding of semantic information and suffers from the drawbacks of cost (in terms of initial coding, coherence checking, maintenance after modifications, and costs derivable from a host of other software engineering concern); of domain dependence (a semantic structure developed for one domain would not be applicable to another.",
        "For example, sugar would have very different semantic relations in a medical domain than in a commodities exchange domain); and of rigidity (even within well-established domain, new subdomains spring up, e.g. AIDS.",
        "Can hand-coded systems keep up with new discoveries and new relations with an acceptable latency?)",
        "In the Information Retrieval community.",
        "researchers have consistently considered that \"the linguistic apparatus required for effective domain-independent analysis is not yet at hand,\" and have concentrated on counting document co-occurrence statistics (Peat and Willet 1991), based on the idea that words appearing in the same document must share some semantic similarity.",
        "But document co-occurrence suffers from two problems: granularity (every word in the document is considered potentially related to every other word, no matter what the distance between them) and co-occurrence (for two words to be seen as similar they must physically appear in the same document.",
        "As an illustration, consider the words tumor and tumour.",
        "These words certainly share the same contexts, but would never appear in the same document.)",
        "In general different words used to describe similar concepts might not be used in the same document, and are missed by these methods.",
        "Recently, a middle ground between these two approaches has begun to be broken.",
        "Researchers such as (Evans et at.",
        "1991) and (Church and Hanks 1990) have applied robust grammars and statistical techniques over large corpora to extract interesting noun phrases and subject-verb, verb-object pairs.",
        "(Hearst 1992) has shown that certain lexical-syntactic templates can reliably extract hyponym relations froM text.",
        "(Ruge 1991) shows that modifier-head relations in noun phrases extracted from a large corpus provide a useful context for extracting similar words.",
        "The common thread of all these techniques is that they require no hand-coded domain knowledge, but they examine more cleanly defined contexts than simple document co-occurrence methods.",
        "Similarly, our SEXTANT 1 uses fine-grained syntactically derived contexts, but derives its measures of similarity from consider-'Semantic EXtraction from Text via Analyzed Networks of Terms",
        "ing not the co-occurrence of two words in the same context, but rather the overlapping of all the contexts associated with words over an entire corpus.",
        "Calculation of the amount of shared weighted contexts produces a similarity measure between two words."

        "SEXTANT can be run on any English text, without any pre-coding of domain knowledge or manual editing of the text.",
        "The input text passes through the following steps: (I) Morphological analysis.",
        "Each word is morphologically analyzed and looked up in a 100,000 word dictionary to find its possible parts of speech.",
        "(II) Grammatical Disambiguation.",
        "A stochastic parser assigns one grammatical category to each word in the text.",

        "(Grefenstette 1992a) (V) Context Isolation.",
        "The modifying words attached to each word in the text are isolated for all nouns.",
        "Thus the context of each noun is given by all the words with which it is associated throughout the corpus.",
        "(VI) Similarity matching.",
        "Contexts are compared by using similarity measures developed in the Social Sciences, such as a weighted Jaccard measure.",

        "After grammatical ambiguities are removed by the stochastic parser, the phrase is divided into noun phrases(NP) and verb phrases(VP), giving,",
        "Once each sentence in the text is divided into phrases, intra and inter-phrase structural relations are extracted.",
        "First noun phrases are scanned from left to right(NPLR), hooking up articles, adjectives and modifier nouns to their head nouns.",
        "Then, noun phrases are scanned right to left(NPRL), connecting nouns over prepositions.",
        "Then, starting from verb phrases, phrases are scanned before the verb phrase for an unconnected head which becomes the subject(VPRL), and likewise to the right of the verb for objects(VPLR), producing for the example:",
        "Next SEXTANT extracts a user specified set of relations that are considered as each word's context for similarity calculations.",
        "For example, one set of relations extracted by SEXTANT for the above sentence can be",
        "In this example, the word time is found modified by the words induction, prolong-DOBJ and administration, while administration is only considered by this set of relations to be modified by antigen.",
        "Over the whole corpus of 160,000 words, one can consider what modifies administration.",

        "At this point SEXTANT compares all the other words in the corpus, using a user-specified similarity measure such the Jaccard measure, to find which words are most similar to which others.",

        "As can be seen, the sense of administration as in the \"administration of drugs and medicines\" is clearly extracted here, since administration in this corpus is most similarly used as other words such as injection and therapy having to do with dispensing drugs and medicines.",
        "One of the interesting aspects of this approach, contrary to the coarse-grained document co-occurrence approach, is that administration and injection need never appear in the same document for them to be recognized as semantically similar.",
        "In the case of this corpus, administration and injection were considered similar because they shared the following modifiers: acid follow-DOBJ growth prior produce-IOBJ dose extract increase-SUBJ intravenous treat-IOBJ associate-SUBJ associate-DOBJ rapid cause-SUBJ antigen adrenalectomy aortic hormone subside-IOBJ alter-IOBJ folic-acid amd tolate It is hard to select any one word which would indicate that these two words were similar, but the fact that they do share so many words, and more so than other words, indicates that these words share close semantic characteristics in this corpus.",
        "When the same procedure is run over a corpus of library science abstracts, administration is recognized as closest to administration graduate, office, campus, education, director, ...",

        "While finding similar words in a corpus without any domain knowledge is interesting in itself, such a tool is practically useful in a number of areas.",
        "A lexicographer building a domain-specific dictionary would find such a tool invaluable, given a large corpus of representative text for that domain.",
        "Similarly, a Knowledge Engineer creating a natural language interface to an expert system could use this system to cull similar terminology in a field.",
        "We have shown elsewhere (Grefen.stette 1992b), in an Information Retrieval setting, that expanding queries using the closest terms to query terms derived by SEXTANT can improve recall and precision.",
        "We find that one of the most interesting results from a linguistic point of view, is the possibility automatically creating corpus defined thesauri, as can be seen above in the differences between relations extracted from medical and from information science corpora.",
        "In conclusion, we feel that this fine grained approach to context extraction from large corpora, and similarity calculation employing those contexts, even using imperfect syntactic analysis tools, shows much promise for the future."
