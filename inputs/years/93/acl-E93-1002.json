        "Research in psycholinguistics (e.g., Garrett 1988, Levelt 1989) has revealed that the process of converting a preverbal, conceptual content into overt speech is performed by a number of autonomous sub-processes specialized for different tasks within the overall process: the pre-linguistic conceptualization component (the Con-ceptualizer, in Levelt's terms) plans a content to be expressed and delivers a corresponding conceptual representation to the linguistic formulation component (the Formulator), which in turn selects the appropriate items (lemmas and lexemes) from the system's lexical data base and, guided by the syntactic and phonological specifications of the lexical items, produces abstract syntac",

        "The output of the Formulator is taken up by the articulation component (the Articulator), whose task it is to produce a physical speech signal.",
        "These components are considered to be autonomous modules, whose modes of operation are each governed by their own sets of principles and restrictions.",
        "Furthermore, the system as a whole is constrained by there being a unidirectional flow of information, i.e., there is no feedback between sub-processes.1 Finally, it is widely accepted that human language production proceeds in an incremental, piecemeal fashion (Kempen & Hoenkamp 1987): Rather than having to wait for complete input structures, components are able to process fragmentary input (\"increments\").",
        "As soon as a particular component has passed the results on to its successor component, it is ready for processing the next input increment.",
        "Thus, a given increment is processed sequentially by different components, whereas components may operate in parallel on different increments.",
        "Theoretical linguists of various persuasions converge on the idea that a large amount of grammatical information that former theories of grammar handled by extensive rule systems ought to be captured by detailed grammatical specifications of lexical items instead.",

        "The initial account has since been modified repeatedly; we simply mention T. Kiss' proposal for German,4 according to which the passive rule is split into two parts, a rule of Subject Demotion and a Subject Condition, which roughly corresponds to a rule of Object Promotion.",
        "Rather than merely stipulating lexical rules such as Subject Demotion and Object Promotion, the SYNPHONICS account traces the effects these rules are intended to capture to properties of the argument structures of the passive participle and the passive auxiliary.",
        "The morphological operation of passive participle formation gives rise to what might be regarded as an \"ergativization\" of the verb, i.e., the verb's external argument (in the sense of Williams 1983) is exempt from any syntactic principle that refers to subcategorized-for arguments.",
        "(Technically, this is realized by transferring the argument, which is marked by a special externality feature, from the verb's SUBCAT list to a blocked-argument [BLOCKED_ARG] list.6) The passive auxiliary is treated as an argument-attraction verb (cf. Hinrichs & Nakazawa 1991): It subcategorizes for a passive participle and attracts the arguments that the participle subcategorizes for as its own subcategorized-for arguments.",
        "Argument attraction is a mechanism that affects only the argument structure of the governed verb, but does not affect the primary link between semantic roles and arguments.",

        "The two types exemplify different ways in which the relevant cognitive modules - the Conceptualizer and the Formulator - are synchronized in order to jointly perform the task of producing an utterance.",
        "The first case can be traced to a condition concerning the content of the conceptual structure CS that the Conceptualizer delivers to the Formulator.",
        "CS may include a situation-type concept (e.g., an event-type concept) that is marked for an agentive thematic role,",
        "without at the same time including the corresponding agentive RefO.",
        "In terms of its underlying cognitive function, this is an extreme case of what has been described as \"agent backgrounding\" in the typological literature (e.g., Foley & van Valin 1985 and Keenan 1985).",
        "There are various motivations for agent backgrounding; the most notable ones are the following: there is a particularly salient or easily inferable agent (e.g., Frank Rijkaard was sent off for knocking down his opponent); the agent is unknown (e.g., My car has been stolen); the situation-type predicate alone is focused, with a corresponding defocusing of the agent (e.g., German impersonal passives of the sort Heute abend wird hier getanzt ['there will be a dance here tonight'; literally: \"tonight is here danced\"]).",
        "The passive formation device allows the Formulator to follow the Conceptualizer's decision to dispense with the agent RefO.",
        "Thus, the two modules' principles of information processing tally with each other.",
        "More concretely, we assume that the production process involves the following crucial steps: The Conceptualizer delivers a situation type increment whose agent role remains unspecified (or has as yet not been specified).",
        "The Lemma Selector chooses an item that matches the corresponding semantic representation.",
        "Since this is a situational relation lacking its first argument, the participle form of the lemma, whose category is adjectival, is selected.",
        "The Functional Inspector completes the cat-egorial requirements of the situation type increment, which actually calls for a verbal category, by initiating a call to the appropriate auxiliary (i.e., werden).",
        "The complex form gives rise to a verbal projection whose external argument appears on the BLOCKED_ARG list and therefore is not subject to the Subcategorization Principle.",
        "The corresponding parameter is existentially bound in the semantics.",
        "Thus, the verbal projection satisfies the grammatical licensing conditions for constructions with non-subcategorized-for external arguments.",
        "The second case can be traced to a processing strategy that the Formulator employs when it has to react to the Conceptualizer's selection of a particular RefO as the most prominent referential CS constituent, especially under the constraints of rapid utterance production.",
        "In general, as soon as one process component delivers an informational increment to its successor component, the latter strives for further processing the increment without delay.",
        "As was claimed above, a certain Refs may be the first increment that the Conceptualizer passes to the Formulator due to its being the most prominent conceptual unit in the CS selected for verbalization.",
        "Now, a prominent RefO argument may often be made available to the Formulator although its embedding information, such as information about its thematic role in an event type, is unspecified or at least underdetermined.",
        "In particular, the RefO may be passed to the Formulator prior to the situation-type concept to which it is an argument.",
        "In such cases, the Formulator follows the strategy to assign to the syntactic phrase that verbalizes the RefO the most prominent available position in the current utterance segment - i.e., in general, the structural subject position without waiting for information about the RefO's thematic role.?",
        "However, if it turns out subsequently that the phrase, due to information about the thematic role of the corresponding RefO available later on, does not show the regular argument properties of subjects, principles guiding the Lemma Selection process force the formation of a passive sentence.",
        "In this case, the production process involves the following crucial steps: The RefO increment is passed from the Conceptualizer to the Formulator prior to the situation type increment.",
        "Following the above mentioned integration heuristic, the Integrator inserts the phrase corresponding to the RefO into the most prominent syntactic position, where it receives the nominative case by the structural Case Principle.",
        "No specific information about the RefO's thematic role has been used so far.",
        "At some stage in the process, however, such information must become available to the Formulator.",
        "We assume that this occurs when the situation type increment enters the Formulator.",
        "Lemma Selection is restricted not only by the corresponding SR, but also by information linked to constituents already represented in the temporary utterance fragment constructed so far.",
        "In the present case, the Formulator is equipped with additional embedding information.",
        "It may turn out that the RefO whose realizing phrase has already been integrated in the most prominent position has the standard properties of an internal argument, for example, because it is the theme 7 Abstracting from time factors, the subject position can, in more general terms, be filled without paying attention to the thematic role the RefO in question holds in a situation.",
        "This is essentially suggested by experimental studies using a picture-description task, where the presentation of the depiction of an isolated object accompanies the presentation of the depiction of the entire scene involving the object (see, e.g., Turner & Rommetveit 1968).",
        "The additional presentation of the patient object, which raises its prominence in memory, often sets off the test subjects on the passive voice.",
        "See also the study reported in Tannenbaum & Williams (1968), in which drawing the speaker's attention to either the agent or the patient in a situation by means of verbal cues, thereby manipulating the speaker's memory access, also affected the choice of verbal voice.",
