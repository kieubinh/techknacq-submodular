        "It is well known that this mapping is difficult because in general, not all graphemes are realised in the phonetic transcription, and the same grapheme may correspond to different phonetic symbols, depending on context.",
        "It is traditionally assumed that various sources of linguistic knowledge and their interaction should be formalised in order to be able to convert words into their phonemic representations with reasonable accuracy.",
        "Although different researchers propose different knowledge structures, consensus seems to be that at least morphological and phonotactic knowledge should be incorporated in order to be able to find morphological and syllable structure.",
        "These structures are deemed necessary to define the proper domains for phonological and phonetic rules.",
        "As a typical architecture for grapheme-to-phoneme conversion in Dutch, consider the modules in [Daelemans, 1988] shown in Figure 1.",
        "It contains most of the traditional datastructures and processing components proposed by computational linguists.",
        "A problem with this approach is that the knowledge needed is highly language-dependent and requires a significant amount of linguistic engineering.",
        "We argue that using data-oriented learning techniques on a corpus of transcribed words (information.",
        "which is readily available in many machine-readable dictionaries), the same and even better performance can be achieved, without explicit modeling of linguistic knowledge.",
        "The advantages of such an approach are that the technique is reusable for different sets of data (e.g. different languages or sublanguages), and that it is automatic (no explicit linguistic engineering is needed to handcraft the rules and knowledge structures necessary for implementing the target mapping).",
        "In this paper we present two instances of this approach in the domain of Grapheme-to-Phoneme conversion.",
        "A first model implements a variant of instance-based learning, in which a similarity metric (weighed by using a metric based on information entropy) and a database of prototypical exemplars are",

        "In a second model, grapheme-to-phoneme mappings are looked up in a compressed text-to-speech lexicon (table lookup) enriched with default mappings.",
        "The most surprising result of our research is that the simplest method (based on tables and defaults) yields the best generalisation results, suggesting that previous knowledge-based approaches to the problem were overkill.",

        "If it does not match with any graphemic pattern stored in that table, the single grapheme pattern is extended to a 0-1-1 pattern.",

        "It is important to see that generalisation in this approach arises from two different mechanisms: (i) the fact that spellings of different words contain identical grapheme substrings, and (ii) the default tables which reflect probabilities of mappings in the training set.",

        "In [Golding and Rosenbloom, 1991], the interaction of rule-based reasoning and case-based reasoning in the task of pronouncing surnames is studied.",

        "If a compelling analogy is found, it overrides the rule output.",
        "In this approach, the (hand-crafted) rules are interpreted as implementing the defaults, and the cases the pockets of exceptions.",
        "Our table-method works along a different dimension: both default mappings and pockets of exceptions are represented in both the table and the default mapping (which as we suggested earlier, we have replaced in the current version by case-based reasoning).",
        "Certain mappings are present in the table (which can be interpreted as an automatically acquired rule set), and uncertain cases are handled by the case-base (or default mapping).",
        "Future research should make clearer how these two uses of case-based reasoning are related and whether the strengths of both can be combined."

        "In computational linguistics, one of the common-sense beliefs is that the performance of a system solving a linguistic problem improves with the amount of linguistic knowledge and sophistication incorporated into it.",

        "We have reason to believe that this also applies to other linguistic categorisation problems where superficial input features and local context solve most ambiguities (we have positive results on stress assignment, [Gillis et al., 1992; Daelemans et al., 1993], and part of speech tagging).",
        "The data-oriented algorithms described are simple and domain-independent, and introduce a new kind of reusability into computational linguistics: reusability of the acquisition method (on different data sets) rather than reusability of (hand-coded) knowledge in different applications or formalisms.",
