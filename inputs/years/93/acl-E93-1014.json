        "In many NLP-systems, for example, the semantic representation reflects the syntactic constituent structure of the string.",
        "One could also think of processing by correspondence (as proposed by [Kaplan et al., 1989]), using different sources of information to guide the task.",

        "Some linguistic phenomena are not analysed adequately from a truth conditional perspective either.",
        "The phenomenon described in this paper, and exemplified in (3), touches on the notion of restrictive modification versus non-restrictive modification.",
        "I will demonstrate in what way the analysis of these cases in DRT-semantics is not adequate.",
        "It fails to assign different representations to discourses that do differ in truth conditions.",

        "In many logic-based discourse theories, the notion of constituent unit has largely disappeared (disregarding quantificational structures for the moment).",
        "These theories do, however, often respect the order in which constituents appear in the surface string, acknowledging that the left-to-right order of a string is of importance.",
        "This is not reflected in the discourse representation, though.",
        "In this paper, I have shown in what way exactly this left-to-right order influences the truth conditions.",
        "When a discourse proceeds, the values to be assigned to the reference markers in the discourse are gradually constrained.",
        "If this is the case, then it makes no difference in which order we constrain the interpretation: the result will be the same.",
        "However, some linguistic markers fix the interpretation of a discourse marker at a certain point.",
        "It has been shown that in these cases, the order of constraints is to be preserved in order to capture the right truth conditions.",
        "In the proposal, unique constituents are analysed in such a way that they impose an asymmetric relation upon the conjoined conditions of DRS-formulae.",
        "As such, they add more structure to the discourse representation structures."
