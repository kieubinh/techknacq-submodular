        "L(M)I--r iff r is the root of a deduction tree whose leaves are all axioms.",
        "It remains to note that there are only finitely many deduction trees for a given sequent: a leaf can be grown in at most a finite number of different ways, and the added daughters have always a diminished complexity (complexity measured as number of occurrences of connectives).",
