        "The line If a farmer owns a donkey he beats it (1) from Geach [6] is often cited as one of the success stories of the so-called \"dynamic\" approach to natural language semantics (by which is meant Kamp [12], Heim [9], Barwise [1], and Groenendijk and Stokhof [7], among others).",
        "But add the note It will kick back (2) and the picture turns sour: processing (1) may leave no beaten donkey active.",
        "Accordingly, providing a referent for the pronoun it in (2) would appear to call for some non-compositional surgery (that may upset many a squeamish linguist).",
        "The present paper offers, as a preventive, a \"dynamic\" form of implication applied to (1).",
        "Based on a \"constructive\" conception of discourse analysis, an overhaul of Groenendijk and Stokhof [71's Dynamic Predicate Logic (DPL) is suggested, although can also be introduced less destructively so as to extend DPI conservatively.",
        "Thus, the reader who prefers the old \"static\" interpretation of (1) can still make that choice, and declare the continuation (2) to be \"semantically ill-formed.\" On the other hand, Groenendijk and Stokhof [7] themselves concede that \"at least in certain contexts, we need alternative externally dynamic interpretations of universal quantification, implication and negation; a both internally and externally dynamic treatment of disjunction.\" A proposal for such connectives is made below, extending the dynamic interpretation in a manner analogous to the extension of classical logic by constructive logic (with its richer collection of primitive connectives), through a certain conjunctive notion of parallelism.",
        "To put the problem in a somewhat general perspective, let us step back a bit and note that in assigning a natural language utterance a meaning, it is convenient to isolate an intermediate notion of (say) a formula.",
        "By taking for granted a translation of the utterance to a formula, certain complexities in natural language can be abstracted away, and semantics can be understood rigorously as a map from formulas to meanings.",
        "Characteristic of the dynamic approach mentioned above is the identification of the meaning of a formula A with a binary relation on states (or contexts) describing transitions A induces, rather than with a set of states validating A.",
        "In the present paper, formulas are given by first-order formulas, and the target binary relations given by programs.",
        "To provide an account of anaphora in natural language, DPL translates first-order formulas A to programs ADPL from (quantified) dynamic logic (see, for example, Harel [8]) as follows",
        "and accordingly inherit some properties of negation), our treatment of (2) will be based on a dynamic (rather than static) form of implication.",
        "Dynamic forms of negation universal quantification and disjunction will also be proposed, but first we focus on implication."

        "The semantics [A]] assigned to a first-order formula A is that given to the program ADPL i.e., a binary relation on states.",

        "from X to the universe WI of M. Atomic programs come in two flavors: tests A?",
        "where A is a formula in the signature of M with free variables from X, and random assignments x :=?",
        "where x E X.",

        "so that closing the notion of a state under a partial function space construct becomes sufficient.",

        "(The collapsing is \"justified\" by the associativity of conjunction.)",
        "Observe that, in either case, DPL's negation can be derived = A _L (whence j is also definable fromand &).",
        "The first proposal, (P1), yields a dizzying tower of higher order functions, in comparison to which, the second proposal is considerably simpler.",
        "Behind the step from (3) to either proposal is the idea that implication can spawn processes running in parallel.",
        "(Buried in (3) is the possibility of the input state s branching off to a multiplicity of states t'.)",
        "The parallelism here is \"conjunctive\" in that a family of parallel processes proceeds along happily so long as every member of the family is well; all is lost as soon as one fails.2 More precisely, observe that, under (P2), a natural clause for 4A]lt, where s is a set of valuations and A is an atomic formula, is3 if 3 a function f : s +onto t such that (Vs' E s)f (s') .",
        "ness function tracing processes back to their \"roots.\" (Forgetting that spawning record would seem to be akin to forgetting the intermediate state in a sequential composition p; p'.)",
        "Furthermore, for applications to natural language discourse, forgetfulness would appear quite innocuous if the information content of a state increases in the course of interpreting discourse (so that all past states have no more information content than has the current state).",
        "And it is quite natural in discourse analysis to assume that information does grow.",
        "Consider the following claim in an early paper (Karttunen [13]) preoccupied with a problem (viz., that of presuppositions) that may appear peripheral to (1) or (2), but is nonetheless fundamental to the \"constructive\" outlook on which is based There are definitions of pragmatic presupposition ... which suggest that there is something amiss in a discourse that does not proceed in [an] ideal orderly fashion.",
        "... All things considered, this is an unreasonable view.",
        "... People do make leaps and shortcuts by using sentences whose presuppositions are not satisfied in the conversational context.",
        "This is the rule rather than the exception, and we should not base our notion of presupposition on the false premiss that it does not or should not happen.",
        "But granting that ordinary discourse is not always fully explicit in the above sense, I think we can maintain that a sentence is always taken to be an increment to a con text that satisfies its presuppositions.",
        "[p. 191, italics added] To bring out an important dimension of \"increment to a context\", and at the same time get around the destruction of information in DPI by a random assignment, we will modify the translation -DPI- (mapping first-order formulas into programs) slightly into a translation ., over which (P2) will be worked out (though the reader should afterwards have no difficulty carrying out the similar extension to DPI).",
        "The modification is based (following Fernando [4], and, further back, Barwise [1]) on (i) a switch from valuations defined on all variables to valuations defined on only finitely many variables, and on (ii) the use of guarded assignments x := * (in place of random assignments), given by",
        "which has the effect of assigning a value to x precisely when initially x is unbound (in which case the test x = x?",

        "Establishing not A is (intuitively) different from testing (as in DPI) that A cannot be established.7 A negation reflecting the former is described next, avoiding an appeal to a modal notion (hidden in by writing 12 instead of ([pil..)?).",
        "4 Working out the idea formally Starting over and proceeding a bit more rigorously now, given a first-order signature L, throw in, for every nary predicate symbol R E L, a fresh nary predicate symbol R and extend the map to these symbols by setting R = R. Then, interpret ft in an L-structure M as the complement of R =_ Rm So, without loss of generality, assume that we are working with a signature L equipped with such a map and let M be an L-model obeying the cornplementarity condition above (readily expressible in the first-order language).",

        "The advantage of the proposal(s) above is the treatment of universal variables across sentential variables, based on an extension of dynamic logic with an implication connective (defined by (4), if A and B are understood as programs).",

        "(But now what is the domain of such a function?)",
        "The shift in point of view here is essentially the \"ingenious little trick\" that Muskens [16] (p. 418) traces back to Janssen [111 of swapping rows with columns.",
        "We should be careful to note, however, that the preceding analysis of variables was carried out relative to a fixed state s a state s that is to be supplied as an argument to the partial binary functions globally representing the variables.",
        "Finally, A. Visser and J. van Eijck have suggested that a comparison with type-theoretic and game theoretical semantics (e.g., Ranta [20] and Hintikka and Kulas 1.10.1) is in order.",

        "But what about constructiveness?",
        "7 Between construction and truth Having passed somewhat hastily from (P1) to (P2), the reader is entitled to ask why the present author has bothered mentioning realizability (alluding somewhat fashionably or unfashionably to \"constructiveness\") and has said nothing about (classical) modal logic-style formalizations (e.g., Van Eijck and De Vries [3]), building say on concurrent dynamic logic (Peleg [19]).",
        "A short answer is that the connection with so-called and/or computations came to the author only after trying to understand the interpretation of implication in Kleene [14] (interpreting implication as a program construct being nowhere suggested in Peleg [19], which instead introduces a \"conjunction\" n on programs).",
        "A more serious answer would bring up his attitude towards the more interesting question does all talk about so-called dynamic semantics come to modal logic?",
        "The crazy appeal dynamic semantics exerts on the author is the claim that a formula (normally conceived statically) is a program (i.e., something dynamic); showing how a program can be understood statically is less exciting.",
        "Some may, of course, find the possibility of \"going static\" as well as \"going dynamic\" comforting (if not pleasing).",
        "But if reducing dynamic semantics to static truth conditions is to complete that circle, then formulas must first be translated to programs.",
        "And that step ought not to be taken completely for granted (or else why bother talking about \"dynamic semantics\").",
        "Understanding a computer program in a precise (say \"mathematical\") sense is, in principle, to be expected insofar as the states through which the computer program evolves can be examined.",
        "If a program can be implemented in a machine, then it has a well-defined operational semantics that, moreover, is subject (in some sense or another) to Church's thesis.",
        "In that sense, understanding a computer program relative to a mathematical world of eternal truths and static formulas is not too problematic.",
        "Not too problematic, that is, when compared to natural language, for which nothing like Church's thesis has gained acceptance.",
        "To say that natural language is a programming language is outrageous ( perhaps deliberately so ), and those of us laboring under this slogan must admit that we do not know how to translate an English sentence into a FORTRAN program (whatever that may mean).",
        "Nor, allowing for certain abstractions, formulas into programs.",
        "Furthermore, a favorite toy translation, DPL, goes beyond ordinary computability (and FORTRAN) when interpreted over the natural numbers.",
        "(The culprit is Not that the idea of a program must necessarily be understood in the strict sense of ordinary recursion theory.",
        "But some sensitivity to matters relating to computation (\"broadly construed\") is surely in order when speaking of programs.",
        "It was the uncomputable character of DPL's negation and implication that, in fact, drove the present work.",
        "Strong negation is, from this standpoint, a mild improvement, but it would appear that the situation for implication has only been made more complicated.",
        "This complication can be seen, however, as only a first step towards getting a handle on the computational character of the programs used in interpreting formulas dynamically.",
        "Whether more effective forms of realizability (incorporating, as was",
        "originally conceived, some notion of construction or proof into the witnessing by functions) can shed any helpful light on the idea of dynamic semantics is an open question.",
        "That realizability should, crazily enough, have anything to say whatsoever about a linguistic problem might hearten those of us inclined to investigate the matter.",
        "(Of course, one might take the easy way out, and simply restrict to finite models.)",
        "Making certain features explicit that are typically buried in classical logic (such as the witness to the V3-clause in is a characteristic practice of constructive mathematics that just might prove fruitful in natural language semantics.",
        "A feature that would seem particularly relevant to the intuition that discourse interpretation amounts to the construction of a context is information growth.",
        "The extension of the domain of a finite valuation is an important aspect of that growth (as shown in Fernando [4], appealing to Henkin witnesses, back-and-forth constructions, ...).",
        "The custom in dynamic logic of reducing a finite valuation to the set of its total extensions (relative to which a static notion of truth is then defined) would appear to run roughshod over this feature a feature carefully employed above to draw a distinction between establishing and testing a formula (mentioned back at the end of section 3).",
        "But returning to the dynamic implication introduced above, observe that beyond the loss of structure (and information) in the step from (P1) to (P2), it is possible within (P2) (or, for that matter, within (P1)) to approximate by more modest extensions.",
        "There is, for instance, the translation ,, (not to be confused with which (in general) abstracts away structure with each application.",
        "The interpretation of implication can be simplified further by noting that or can be recovered as r I, and thus the static implication D of DPI can be derived from Reflecting on these simplifications, it is natural to ask what structure can dynamic semantics afford to forget?",
        "Is there more structure lurking behind construction than concerns truth?",
        "With the benefit of the discussion above about the dual (establishing/testing) nature of asserting a proposition or perhaps even without being subjected to all that babble , surely we can agree that Storytelling requires more imagination than verifying facts.",
        "'The idea that information grows during the run of a typical computer program is, by comparison, not so clear.",
        "One difference is that whereas guarded assignments would seem sufficient for natural language applications, a typical computer program will repeatedly assign different values to the same variable.",
