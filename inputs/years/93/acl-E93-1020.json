        "It is possible to follow: (la) Emily climbed Ben Nevis in July.",
        "with (lb) Fiona climbed Snowdon then.",
        "This is interpreted to mean that each climb took place at some time within the July in question.",
        "Notice, however, that if we remove 'in July' from (la) to give: (lc) Emily climbed Ben Nevis.",
        "the sequence (1c4b) becomes harder to interpret and sounds rather odd.",
        "The difference is, of course, that we have removed 'in July' and there is no longer an explicit reference to a \"time\".",
        "We will call such an explicitly mentioned time an explicit temporal referent (ETR).",
        "Thus, sentence-final 'then' appears, 'We are not concerned here with the rather marginal reading, available to some speakers, where what is conveyed by (1c,lb) is that Fiona's climb follows Emily's.",
        "This corresponds to the \"updating\" reading normally associated with sentence-initial 'then'.",
        "on the basis of this and other examples, to require explicit mention of a time.",
        "Being able to infer a time from the description of an event is clearly not enough.",
        "We would expect to be able to infer readily from (lc) that there was a time at which Emily's climb took place.",
        "However, it appears that we cannot use sentence-final 'then' here to refer back to such an inferred time.",
        "In order to make sense of the sequence (lc,lb) without the ETR, it seems we have to be able to see the two events as connected in some way.",
        "Consider:",
        "(1c) Emily climbed Ben Nevis.",
        "(1d) She achieved her ambition then.",
        "which sounds fine, and: (2a) The children went to Wales.",
        "(2b) Fiona climbed Snowdon then.",
        "which is also perfectly acceptable.",
        "Note that in both these cases the second event is readily seen as connected to the first – by the kind of discourse relation that has often been called elaboration.2",
        "Now consider: (3a) John went to France.",
        "(3b) Bill Clinton became president then.",
        "This sequence sounds odd, presumably because it is difficult to see any connection between the events described in (3a) and (3b).",
        "Consider also:",
        "(4a) John took the children to Aviemore.",
        "(4b) Mary wrote her paper then.",
        "which sounds odd if we do not know who Mary is,",
        "2See, for example, (Mann and Thompson, 1987).",
        "but sounds fine if we are told that John and Mary are the parents and John took the children off to Aviemore to give Mary peace and quiet to write her paper.",
        "In other words, the sequence is acceptable if we can envisage a connection between the events.",
        "On the basis of these examples, it appears that sentence-final 'then' either requires an ETR, or there must be some kind of connection, such as an elaboration relation, between the two events.",
        "The picture is still incomplete, however.",
        "The examples considered so far have been accomplishments or achievements.3 If the second sentence of the sequence is a lexical stative or a progressive4, sentence-final 'then' becomes acceptable even when the first sentence contains no ETR and there is no obvious connection between the eventualities.5 For example, (lc,le) and (1c,10 are both perfectly acceptable.",
        "(1c) Emily climbed Ben Nevis.",
        "(le) Fiona was a girl then.",
        "(10 Fiona was climbing Snowdon then.",
        "A detailed analysis of such sequences, which was carried out in (Glasbey, forthcoming) and (Glasbey, msl), reveals the importance of the notion of discourse backgrounding.",
        "Provided that the sequence can be interpreted in such a way that the second eventuality is presented as backgrounded with respect to the first, sentence-final 'then' is acceptable and the sequence (1c,le), for example, conveys that Emily's climb is temporally included in the state of Fiona's being a girl.",
        "A similar notion in the literature is that of the temporal overlap often conveyed when a stative (or progressive) follows a non-stative; see, for example, (Hinrichs, 1986).",
        "We will show in Section 2 how the notion of discourse backgrounding can be formalized in our theoretical framework.",
        "We have seen, too, that sentence-final 'then', in the absence of an ETR, is acceptable in cases where the second eventuality can be seen as an elaboration of the first.",
        "This means that we have so far identified three uses of sentence-final 'then':",
        "1.",
        "The ETR use.",
        "2.",
        "The elaboration use.",
        "3.",
        "The background use.",
        "It would simplify matters if we could group (2) and (3) together – perhaps by saying that backgrounding is another way of expressing a connection between two events.",
        "In our formal analysis, to be described shortly, which uses the situation theory/discourse representation theory (ST/DRT) framework of (Barwise and",
        "Cooper, forthcoming), we model eventualities as situations.",
        "We express the connection between eventualities by means of the situation-theoretic relation part-of (or 4), from (Barwise, 1989).",
        "Part-of is a relations which holds between situations.",
        "In order for sentence-final 'then' to be acceptable in the absence of an ETR, the second eventuality must be part-of the first.",
        "This intuitively covers the elaboration case, in that it makes sense to think, for example, of Fiona's climbing Snowdon as being part of the children's trip to Wales in (2a,2b).",
        "But how does it work in the backgrounding case?",
        "We will explain in Section 2, when we have introduced some notation, how the part-of analysis can be used to cover this case too.",
        "If we take the part-of analysis to cover both the backgrounding and elaboration cases, we can now say that there are two distinct uses of sentence-final `then'.",
        "The first involves reference back to a previously introduced ETR and is only possible if such an explicit referent is present.",
        "The second does not refer to an explicit time, but rather conveys that the second eventuality is part-of the first.",
        "This may be the case if the second sentence is stative or progressive.",
        "Of course, progressives have often been analysed as stative in the literature (for example, by Vlach (1981)).",
        "Part of the motivation given for the progressive-as-stative analysis concerns facts about temporal overlap and updating.",
        "We prefer to say that an event described in the progressive is interpreted as backgrounded with respect to a previous (non-progressive) event in the discourse.?",
        "We thus keep separate the notions of stativity and backgrounding, which enables us to explore the relationship between the two concepts.8 We adopt Smith's two-component theory of aspect (Smith, 1991) and regard progressive aspect as conveying an internal perspective or viewpoint on the described event.",
        "The part-of relation between eventualities may also hold if the second eventuality can be read as an elaboration of the first.",
        "Of course, world knowledge will often be required to decide this.",
        "Part-of is therefore a relation between two eventualities which.",
        "covers both the background and the elaboration discourse relations.",
        "Thus we see that sentence-final 'then' can, if conditions are right, give rise to two readings.",
        "This is shown in sequences where the conditions for ETR `then' and those for part-of 'then' are both fulfilled.",
        "For example: 81n our formal treatment we will in fact treat 4 as a type, but this is a technical detail.",
        "We will continue to refer to the '4 relation' rather than the '4 type', as the former conveys a clearer meaning.",
        "(la) Emily climbed Ben Nevis in July.",
        "(1f) Fiona was climbing Snowdon then.",
        "(1a,1f) can either mean that Fiona's climb took place in July, or that it temporally included Emily's climb.",
        "World knowledge or context may sometimes favour one reading or the other.",
        "This analysis of sentence-final 'then' has important consequences for theories of temporal reference.",
        "It shows that, whatever theoretical framework is employed, it is necessary to distinguish in some way between temporal discourse referents which are introduced into the discourse via explicit mention of a time, and those which are introduced via the inference of a time from the mention of an event or state.",

        "It parses single sentences and constructs syntactic and semantic representations expressed in situation-theoretic terms.",

        "To enable us to do the former, we have built aspectual composition into the grammar using a theoretical approach based upon (Krifka, 1991) and described below.",
        "In order to process discourse, we have employed the technique known as 'threading', used by Johnson and Klein (1986), whereby discourse referents are carried from left to right among the constituents of a sentence, and from one sentence to the next.",

        "These authors use a box notation for situation-theoretic objects such as infons, situations and propositions, based upon the graphical notation of DRT (Kamp and Reyle, forthcoming).",

        "R is the resource situation supporting information about the naming of individuals.12 A proposition containing parameters is known as a parametric proposition.",
        "It is possible to abstract (simultaneously) over one or more parameters of a parametric proposition to give a type of the form shown in Figure 2.",
        "Once a parameter has been abstracted over, it effectively \"disappears\" and is no longer present in the type.",

        "Although there is no explicit mention of a \"time\" in (1c), the representation for this sentence (Figure 3) contains a parameter T corresponding to what we call the the \"occurrence time\" of the eventuality.",
        "This is the total temporal extent of the eventuality.",
        "Although inclusion of the occurrence time is not strictly necessary in the representation for a single sentence with no ETR, it will be needed when we come to process discourse.",

        "The idea is that if S2 <I S1, then any infon which is supported by S2 is also supported by Si.",
        "In other words, S2 adds further information to S1, causing it to be more fully specified.",
        "Here we exploit the partiality of situation theory.",
        "Situations may be only partially specified: if we say that S1 supports o, this does not tell us anything about what other information S1 does or does not support.",
        "It is thus possible for a later utterance to add further information about S1 and thereby specify it more fully.",
        "If the first utterance tells us that Si supports the infon v, and the second tells us that S2 supports the infon r and also that S2 <I S1, then we know that S1 supports both a and r. This is straightforward enough for the elaboration case.",
        "We need to consider carefully what it means in a backgrounding case such as (la,le).",
        "According to our theoretical analysis, if an eventuality is backgrounded then it does not introduce an occurrence-time of its own.",
        "Instead, the backgrounded eventuality is of the same duration as that of the preceding event – it \"takes on\" the time of that event.21 Thus, in the representation of (lc,le) in Figure 7, the backgrounded S2 has the same temporal extent as the event S1.",
        "This amounts to claiming that (le) describes only the part of the state that coincides with the preceding event.",
        "Of course we know that the state of Fiona's being a girl began before and continues after Emily's climb – there is a relationship of temporal inclusion between the \"total duration\" of the state and the event.",
        "But we are saying that those parts of the state that are before and after the event are not described but are inferred from our world knowledge about the duration of such states.",
        "Stative verbs are \"natural backgrounders\" in that they describe eventualities without making reference to the beginning and end points of the eventuality.",
        "They naturally describe a situation which can readily be seen as a temporal \"slice\" of a more prolonged situation.",
        "For this reason, in the lexical entries for stative verbs in our grammar, there is no mention of the occurrence-time of the state.",
        "Progressives usually behave in a similar way.",
        "When an event described with progressive viewpoint follows one with simple (perfective) viewpoint, the relation between them is normally one of backgrounding.",
        "The effect of progressive viewpoint is to present the event from an internal perspective.",
        "An event described with internal perspective is no longer temporally bounded – it does not have an occurrence-time of its own.",
        "Instead, its duration is that of the preceding event, just as in the stative case.",
        "If we define two instances of the part-of relation:",
        "• 4 bg for the backgrounding case • <I el for the elaboration case we can thus say:",
        "S2 <I bg S1 T2 = Ti where T1, T2 are the temporal durations of S1 and S2 respectively.",

        "Thus, for the general <I relation: S2 4 S1 – + T2 C T1 21Evidence for this comes from an analysis of 'at the time' and 'at the same time'.",
        "See (Glasbey, ms2) for details.",
        "In this case, an ETR is present and the second sentence has progressive aspect.",
        "This means that the conditions for both ETR 'then' and part-of 'then' are met.Our grammar will thus cause two representations to be generated for (1a,lf), corresponding to the two readings that we identified in Section 1."
