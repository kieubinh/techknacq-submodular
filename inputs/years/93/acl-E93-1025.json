        "The stranded auxiliary in the second clause indicates the deletion of a verb phrase, the meaning of which is to be determined from another clause, in this case, the first clause.",
        "Following Dalrymple, et al.",
        "[1991], we term the clause that the VP is copied from the source clause, and the clause which contains the elided VP the target clause.",
        "As is well established in the literature, referential elements1 in the source clause VP may give rise to strict/sloppy ambiguities 1 For present purposes, we will use the term referential elements as synonymous with pronouns.",
        "In Section 5 we discuss how this class may be extended to include implicit arguments as well.",
        "in the target clause; for example in sentence (1) the target clause may receive one of two readings, namely one in which Bill likes John's mother (the strict reading), and one in which Bill likes his own mother (the sloppy reading).",
        "In this paper we address the distribution of strict and sloppy readings in VP-ellipsis and other anaphoric phenomena.",
        "In Section 2 we discuss problems with past approaches, as well as support our decision to treat ellipsis resolution as a primarily semantic process.",
        "In Section 3 we give a representation for events that exhibits what we term role linking between referential elements and their referents, and describe an algorithm for ellipsis resolution that uses this representation.",
        "Section 4 demonstrates how use of this representation and algorithm results in the correct analysis of several problematic cases of ellipsis without appeal to additional constraints.",
        "In Section 5 we argue that the strict/sloppy distinction is not a property of ellipsis alone, but is instead inherent in what we term the discourse copying process.",
        "Several discourse copying phenomena at the event and NP level are shown to be accounted for by our algorithm.",
        "We conclude in Section 6."

        "[1991], we distinguish between identity-of-relations analyses (e.g., [Gawron and Peters, 1990; Klein, 1987; Sag, 1976; Williams, 1977]) and non-identity analyses [Dalrymple et al., 19911.",
        "Identity-of-relations analyses treat source clauses as having ambiguous derivations, with target clauses receiving one such derivation.",

        "Bill does not realize that Bill is a fool, even though Bill's wife realizes Bill is a fool.",
        "Example (8) contains two cases of ellipsis; the reading in (9) results from the second clause receiving a sloppy interpretation from the first and the third clause receiving a strict interpretation from the second.",
        "An identity-of-relations analysis, however, specifically predicts that the reading given in (9) does not exist.",

        "Dalrymple, et al.",
        "[1991] (henceforth DSP) give an account of ellipsis resolution based on an equational analysis utilizing higher-order unification.",
        "Unlike identity-of-relations accounts, no unmotivated ambiguity is predicated to exist for VPs with pronouns, instead the ambiguity exists in the resolution process.",
        "As a result, reading (9) for sentence (8) is correctly predicted to exist.",

        "Applying relation (12) to Bill yields the strict reading in (14); applying relation (13) yields the sloppy reading given in (15): (14) P(Bill) = likes(Bill , mother _o f (J ohn)) (15) P(Bill) = likes(Bill , mother _of (Bill)) While the DSP account is comprehensive, some flaws remain.",
        "First, they claim that their analysis covers cases of stripping as well as ellipsis.",
        "Consider the case of stripping in example (16):",
        "(16) John likes his mother, and Mary's too.",
        "This sentence has only the following reading: (17) John likes John's mother, and John likes Mary's mother.",
        "The representation for the source clause in DSP's system is given by:",
        "(18) likes(John, mother _o f (John))",
        "After deriving two possible properties P, either of the two readings given in (19) and (20) may be derived:",
        "However, only reading (19) actually exists for sentence (16), so DSP's system overgenerates in this case.",
        "We return to this example in Section 4.3.",
        "Second, to account for missing reading examples and the 5-reading sentence, DSP postulate an unspecified \"suitable definition of generalized antecedent linking\", and need to impose an additional constraint on property derivation requiring that when an element is abstracted over, so must its generalized antecedent.",
        "These examples are discussed in Sections 4.4 and 4.5.",
