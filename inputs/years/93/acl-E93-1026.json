        "An alternation is a pattern in which a number of words share the same relationship between a pair of senses.",
        "The kinds of alternations to be captured are ones where the different senses specify different relationships between syntactic complements and semantic arguments, as in the relation between bake in \"John is baking the cake\" and \"John is bak-ing\", or between melt in \"the chocolate melted\" and *1 would like to thank Gerald Gazdar and Roger Evans for their many valuable comments, and SERC for the grant under which the work was undertaken.",
        "\"Mary melted the chocolate\" .1 Given that compactness and non-redundancy are a desideratum of theoretical descriptions, the different usage-types for bake and wipe should not require us to introduce different primitives into the lexicon.",
        "Moreover, as the alternations are shared with other verbs, they should be described at some general node in a hierarchically organised lexicon, and inherited.",
        "DATR is a formal language in which the such relationships and generalisations can be simply stated.",
        "Much has been written about verb alternations and their syntactic corollaries.",
        "Here we do not add to the evidence or construct new theory, but simply formalise other people's accounts: those of [Atkins et al., 1986] and [Levin and Rappoport Ho-vav, 1991].",
        "The first investigates the range of alternations between transitive and intransitive forms of verbs.",
        "The second, titled Wiping the Slate Clean, explores the relations between meaning and subcate-gorisation possibilities for 'wipe' verbs, 'clean' verbs, and related groupings.",
        "The language used is DATR,_ a default inheritance formalism designed for lexical representation.",
        "We follow Levin and Rappoport Ho-vav in taking a distinct subcategorisation frame as defining a distinct word sense, and also in working with commonsense verb classes such as 'cooking verbs', since classes such as this serve to predict the alternations a verb participates in with some accuracy.",
        "An important constraint is that the lexical entries are of a kind specified by a grammar formalism, so can be used for parsing and semantic interpretation.",
        "The formalism chosen in this paper is HPSG [Pollard 1 The morphosyntactic distinctions between, for example, bake and is baking are not addressed here.",
        "Extensive DATR treatments of morphology are provided in various papers in [Evans and Gazdar, 1990].",
        "and Sag, 1987].",
        "Below we present detailed formal accounts for alternations involving cooking verbs and physical-process verbs.",
        "After motivating the DATR treatment and considering related work, we describe how verb entries appear in HPSG, then represent alternations as mappings between HPSG lexical entries, then introduce the main constructs of DATR and define a translation from HPSG notation to DATR.",
        "Finally we build a DATR inheritance network which represents the alternate verb forms by inference, without the lexicographer having to explicitly say anything about them.",
        "The analysis presented in this paper is a part of a larger lexicon fragment which describes a further five alternations relating seven verb classes and formalises much of the structure described in both articles.",

      "text": [
        "As clexicalism' – the doctrine that the bulk of the information about the behaviour of words should be located in the lexicon – has become popular in computational and theoretical linguistics, so formalisms for expressing lexical information have been developed.",
        "The syntax, semantics and morphology of most words is shared with that of many others, so the first desideratum for any such formalism is to provide a mechanism for stating information just once, in such a way that it is defined for large numbers of words.",
        "Inheritance networks serve this purpose.",
        "If words are arranged into a taxonomy or some other form of network, then a fact which applies to a class of words can be stated at a nonterminal node in the network and inherited by the words to which it applies.",
        "Work in knowledge representation has addressed questions of different kinds of network, and the kinds of machinery needed to retrieve inherited information, in detail (see, e.g., [Brachman and Levesque, 1985]).",
        "The next requirement is that exceptions and sub-regularities can be expressed.",
        "It must be possible to describe concisely the situation where a word or class of words are members of some superclass, and share the regular characteristics of the superclass in most respects, but have different values for some feature or cluster of features.",
        "Several lexical representation formalisms addressing these desiderata have been proposed, e.g. DATR [Evans and Gazdar 1989a, 1989b, 1990]; LRL [Copestake, 1992]; [Russell et al.",
        "1991].",
        "The work described here uses DATR.",
        "DATR has certain desirable formal and computational properties.",
        "It is a formal language with a declarative semantics.",
        "Retrieving values for queries involves no search.",
        "Multiple inheritance specifications are always orthogonal, so a word may inherit from more than one place, but any fact about that word has the place it is to be inherited from uniquely specified.",
        "The problem of different ancestors providing contradictory values, often associated with multiple default inheritance, is thereby avoided, yet the kinds of generalisation most often associated with the lexicon can still be simply stated.",
        "To date it has been used to express syntactic, morphological, phonological and a limited amount of semantic lexical information [Evans and Gazdar, 1990; Cahill and Evans, 1990; Gibbon, 1990; Cahill, 1993].",

        "and Levin and Rappoport Hovav; see also [Levin, 1991]) and formal accounts of alternations (see particularly [Dowty, 1979]).",
        "Recent work which aims to bring these three threads together in relation to the lexical representation of nouns includes [Briscoe et al., 1990; Pustejovsky, 1991; Copestake and Briscoe, 1991; Kilgarriff, 1993 forthcoming; Kilgarriff and Gazdar, 1993 forthcoming].",
        "(The latter two are companion papers to this, also using DATR in similar ways.)",
        "A paper addressing verbs is [Sanfilippo and Poznanski, 1992].",
        "This covers some of the same alternations as this",
        "paper, and has similar goals.",
        "The formalism it uses is LRL, the typed default unification formalism of [Copestake, 1992].",
        "Unlike DATR, this is both a lexical representation language and a grammar formalism.",
        "Whereas, in this paper, we represent the lexicon in DATR and then construct HPSG lexical entries, Sanfilippo and Poznanski need deal with only one formalism.",
        "This has a prima facie advantage but also a cost: the formalism must do two jobs.",
        "DATR is designed specifically for one, and offers more flexibility in the representation of exceptions and subregularities.",
        "In LRL, multiple default inheritance is restricted to the cases where there is no clash, with the condition enforced by a checking procedure, in contrast to DATR where the orthogonal nature of inheritance required by the syntax means that the problem does not arise.",
        "Also, LRL default inheritance must operate within the constraints of a type hierarchy, and the formalism requires two kinds of inheritance, default and non-default.",
        "In DATR, inheritance is not constrained by a type hierarchy, and inheritance, default or otherwise, invokes a single mechanism.",
        "The alternations to be addressed in detail here are the ones relating the transitive, which we treat as the base form, to the ergative (\"The cake baked\") and to the unspecified object (\"John baked\").",
        "Fig.",
        "2 shows a simplified version of the HPSG lexical entry for transitive bake, in attribute-value matrix (AVM) notation.",
        "NP abbreviations and angle-bracket list notation, where a comma separates list elements and there is no separator between the conjuncts of a feature-structure within a list, is as in [Pollard and Sag, 1987].",
        "The boxed variables indicate the roles the semantic arguments play in the syntactic structure.",
        "For ergative bake, the same BAKE relation holds as in the base form, but now between an unspecified BAKER and a BAKED which is the subject of the sentence.",
        "The unspecified role filler is not 'bound' to a complement (i.e. any item on the SUBCAT list) but is existentially quantified (EX-Q).",
        "The ergative form is intransitive so has only one item on its SUBCAT list and the SEM of that item unifies with the BAKED, so the AVM for ergative bake will be as in",
        "baking\", the subject is matched to the BAKER and it is the BAKED which is unspecified, so existentially quantified, as in Fig. 4.",
        "For bake and other cooking verbs, we are able to represent the extended senses directly in terms of the same predicate that applied in the base sense.",
        "We now move on to a case where this does not hold.",
        "For melt, the intransitive (\"The ice melted\") is basic and the transitive (\"Maria melted the ice\") is extended, and it is not possible to define the extended sense directly in terms of the base.",
        "The transitive can be paraphrased using cause, \"Maria caused the ice to melt\" and we call the alternation 'causative'.",
        "It is clearly closely related to the ergative, and it would be possible to treat the transitive form as basic, with the ergative alternation applying.",
        "That route has not been followed for two reasons.",
        "Firstly, melt is a member of a class of physical-process verbs, also including evaporate, freeze, dissolve, sublime and coalesce.",
        "They all clearly have intransitive senses.",
        "They all might, in the right setting, be used transitively, but in cases such as coalesce the transitive is not a standard use and it would patently be inappropriate for it to be treated as a base form.",
        "If we are to stand by the intuition that these verbs form a class, and all participate in the same alternation, then all must have an intransitive base form.",
        "Secondly, transitive melt introduces an aspect of meaning, call it CAUSE, which is not in any sense present in the intransitive.",
        "For bake, CAUSE is already a component of the meaning, whether or not the verb is being used ergatively.",
        "A default entailment of CAUSE is that its first argument, the CAUSER, has proto-agent properties [Dowty, 1991].",
        "If intransitive melt were treated like ergative bake,",
        "CAUSE would be a component of the meaning of intransitive melt.",
        "Its semantics would have an existentially quantified MELTER argument, which would be a CAUSER and which we would expect to have agent-like properties.",
        "In ergative uses of bake, the baking scenario still includes an agent who is doing the baking and fills the BAKER role, even though they are not mentioned.",
        "(We concern ourselves here only with cooking bake, not \"The stones baked in the sun\" and other usage-types where bake is behaving as a physical process verb.)",
        "In \"The ice melted\" there is usually no agent involved.",
        "While it might always be possible to assign a filler to the MELTER slot, perhaps \"the hot temperature\" or \"the warm climate\", they do not fit readily into the agent, CAUSER role.",
        "So we do not treat causatives as ergatives.",
        "A standard analysis of causatives after [Dowty, 1979] as presented by [Chierchia and McConnell-Ginet, 1990, chapter 8], is",

        "So then these entries were translated into DATR, and arranged into a taxonomy so an alternation only needed expressing once, at a non-terminal node from which the verbs to which it applied would inherit.",
        "Information about syntax, semantics, and patterns of polysemy was concisely expressed in a manner both theoretically and computationally appealing.",
        "The lexicon fragment described in detail is part of a larger fragment which also formalises the relations holding between transitives and intransitives of 'care' verbs such as wash, where the intransitive means the same as the reflexive; between transitive, intransitive, and two ditransitive forms of the `clear' verbs (\"clear the desk\"; \"the skies cleared\"; \"clear the desk of papers\"; \"clear the papers off the desk\"); and between transitive and ditransitive forms of 'wipe' verbs (\"wipe the shelf\"; \"wipe the dust off the shelf\").",

        "The paper aims to present both a study of lexical structure and an approach to practical lexicography.",
        "On the latter score, the ideal to which the paper contributes sees the lexicographer only ever needing to explicitly enter information that is idiosyncratic to a word and inheritance specifications, as everything that is predictable about a word's behaviour will be inferred.",
        "Maintaining consistency in the lexical representation, and updating and revising it, will also be quicker if a generalisation is located just at one place in the lexicon rather than at every word to which it applies.",
        "Transitivity alternations defy classification as either syntactic or semantic phenomena.",

        "The generalisations are associated with semantic classes of verbs, and have both syntactic and semantic consequences.",
        "The verb taxonomy of Fig. 1 may be used for conveying specifically linguistic information, as explored in this paper, but also potentially forms part of an encyclopedic knowledge base, with knowledge about any type of cooking held at the COOKING-VB node and knowledge specifically about frying and baking at the Fry and Bake nodes.",
        "It might be argued that this is to confuse two different kinds of information, but, as illustrated in this paper and argued in [Kilgarriff, 1992], the lexicon of English holds both the syntax and semantics of lexical items.",
        "The approach offered here indicates how linguistic and encyclopedic generalisations may be attached to the same taxonomic structure.",
        "[Boguraev and Levin, 1990] show that an expressively adequate model for the lexicon must incorporate productive rules so that novel but rulebound uses of words can be captured.",
        "Thus \"the her",
        "ring soused\" is interpretable by any English speaker who has come across soused herring, but intransitive souse will not be added by any lexicographer to any dictionary: it is most unlikely that any corpus will provide any evidence for the form, and if it did, it would be of insufficient frequency to justify explicit treatment.",
        "The ergative form of souse must therefore be in the lexicon implicitly.",
        "Its availability to speakers and hearers of English can be inferred from knowledge of the kind of verb which souse is and the kinds of processes, or alternations, that verbs of that class can undergo.",
        "The DATR analysis demonstrates how such implicit availability of verb forms can be formalised."

        "A further question that the question of productivity invites is this: how are we to represent which verbs undergo which alternations?",
        "First, we might wish to develop devices within DATR or a related formalism for identifying which alternations apply where, and two such mechanisms are presented in [Kilgarriff, 1992].",
        "But as we look closer, and consider the difficulty of placing many verbs in a semantic class, or the role of metaphor, analogy, and simple familiarity in determining which alternations are applicable in a given context of language-use, so the idea of a yes/no answer to questions of the form, \"does this verb undergo this alternation?\" loses plausibility.",
        "This reasoning applies also to verb classes.",
        "The analysis offers an account of verb behaviour which is premised on verb classes, but their only justification has been by appeal to commonsense and an ill-defined notion of their ability to predict which alternations a verb participates in.",
        "Nothing has been said about how the classes might be identified, or how decisions regarding where a verb should be placed might be made.",
        "The questions, \"what class does a verb belong to?\", \"what are the relative frequencies of the different patterns it occurs in?\", and \"is this pattern grammatical?\" are intimately connected.",
        "Alternation behaviour is a major source of evidence as to how a verb should be classified, and grammaticality judgements are premised upon the patterns a competent speaker has frequently encountered in their experience of the language.",
        "The further development of computational lexical semantics of the kind described in this paper requires foundational work on the relation of corpus-based statistical findings to formal knowledge representation."
