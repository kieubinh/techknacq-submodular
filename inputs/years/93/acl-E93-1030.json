        "HCRC is supported by the Economic and Social Research Council.",
        "from syntax, so there can be no explanation of why even though (1) has the same tense structure as (2), they are interpreted differently: no order is inferred between the events in (lb-d) while there is temporal progression in (2b-d).",
        "Alexis was a very good girl by the time she went to bed yesterday.",
        "She had helped her mum with the housework.",
        "She had practised her piano.",
        "She had done all her homework.",
        "We all felt very good about it.",
        "Max arrived at the summit at midday.",
        "He had got up at 5:30am, had prepared his lunch, and had passed base camp before 7am.",
        "Intuitively, the order of events in (2b-d) is inferred from causal knowledge about the typical orders between the events and by the temporal information conveyed by the list structure.",
        "In contrast, there is no knowledge that enables such an inference in (lb-d).",
        "An explanation in these terms requires us to solve the Interaction Problem: The analysis of the pluperfect must interact in precise and systematic ways with the reader's causal knowledge, pragmatic maxims and the discourse type to yield appropriate temporal structures.",
        "Kamp's syntactic-based account fails to specify such interactions.",
        "The second problem is that, in line with the Reichenbachian approach, the semantics of tense appeals only to temporal relations.",
        "But consider texts",
        "(3) to (5).",

        "He had entered the room.",
        "(5) Max poured himself a cup of coffee.",
        "He had entered the room feeling depressed, but now he felt much better.",
        "Texts (3) and (4) attempt to describe similar temporal relations, and yet only (3) is acceptable.",
        "Similarly, (4) and (5) describe similar temporal relations between the first event mentioned and the second, but only (5) is acceptable.",
        "One can view (3) to (5) as a manifestation of contextual relevance; a similar view is proposed in Caenepeel and Sandstrom (1992).",
        "One event being in the consequent state of the other is sufficient for simple past tensed text to satisfy the Contextual Relevance Constraint (cf. (3)), but it won't do for the pluperfect in (4), although the additional information in (5) ameliorates (4)'s incoherence.",
        "We can thus think of the pluperfect as a discourse marker that indicates that the range of possible connections that would make the clause 'contextually relevant' is restricted (relative to the possibilities for the simple past).",
        "This yields the Relevance Problem: The analysis of the pluperfect must take Contextual Relevance into account.",
        "Kamp (1991a) fails to explain the incoherence of (4) because the Reichenbachian analysis doesn't solve this problem: to solve it, a Reichenbachian semantics of tense would have to be extended so that it considers causal and rhetorical connections, as well as temporal relations.",
        "A third problem with the Reichenbachian account of tense is that the purely temporal specification fails to explain why the pluperfect clause can initiate a perspective shift such as those that occur in free indirect style, where the control over the proposition shifts from the author to a character in the text (Leech and Short 1981, Quirk et al.",
        "1985).",
        "For example, consider text (6), taken from Nakhimovsky (1988):",
        "(6) a.",

        "b.",
        "It was Mme Dupont.",
        "c. Her husband had eaten too many oysters for lunch.",
        "d. The doctor recommended a change in lifestyle (6c) initiates free indirect style: Control over the proposition in (6c) is shifted from the author to Mme Dupont, because in contrast to (6b), (6c) reports Mme Dupont's perceptions (of what was said over the phone).",
        "The pluperfect plays a crucial role in creating free indirect style in (6), for replacing it with the simple past would mean that the author's perspective is maintained: (6) c'.",
        "Her husband ate too many oysters for lunch.",
        "This yields the Perspective Problem: The semantic framework used must be able to represent perspective, such as those that occur in indirect speech.",
        "Although Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) is a rich semantic framework in which perspective can be represented, the analysis of tense in DRT presented in (Kamp 1991a) fails to exploit this.",
        "All purely Reichenbachian treatments of tense fail to capture shifts in perspective, because they don't take into account the information status of the clauses concerned.",
        "In order to solve the Interaction, Relevance and Perspective Problems, we will formalise the discourse role of the pluperfect using two tools: a semantically-based theory of discourse structure called SDRT, and a formal theory of discourse attachment called DICE.",
        "Using these tools, we model both the pluperfect's semantic and pragmatic contributions to discourse.",
        "In contrast to Kamp (1991a), we will examine the role that the reader's background knowledge plays in interpreting the pluperfect tense, and provide analyses of the above texts.",
        "The reason we devote attention to a formal account is because we assume that the reader's various knowledge resources on occasion yield conflicting conclusions about discourse structure (cf. Hobbs 1985, Lascarides and Asher 1991), and resolving the conflicts is arbitrary unless supported by an underlying logical consequence relation."

        "Here, we assume the reader's knowledge base (KB) contains: the SDRS for the text so far; the logical form of the current sentence; an assumption that that logical form must attach at an open site (i.e., the text is coherent); all defeasible and indefeasible world and pragmatic knowledge; and the laws of logic.",
