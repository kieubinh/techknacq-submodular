        "First, then, consider the following actual sequence of states and events: in the UK in November 1992, some right-wing Tory backbench MPs were objecting to government policy over the treaty of Maastricht, and threatened to vote against it; the Prime Minister, a Mr John Major, offered them a variety of concessions to win them back, in what the press termed a \"charm offensive\"; the MPs responded by voting with the government.",
        "Call this course of events El.",
        "We can combine descriptions of the main eventualities in several ways, to reflect the right temporal structure, but only some of these seem pragmatically appropriate: consider in particular these possible descriptions of El involving the connectives before, after and when: (1)The backbenchers were in revolt.",

        "There are at least two apparent anomalies, which require explanation.",
        "First, one might expect that (2a) and (2b) would be temporally equivalent, both describing Ei; why, then, does (2b) apparently lead to discourse incoherence?",
        "Secondly, it has been argued that A when B permits many possible temporal relationships between the eventualities denoted by A and B (cf. Moens and Steedman 1988); it's for this reason that (2c) can be interpreted as denoting El;",
        "but given this permissiveness, why is (2d) not as acceptable as (2e)?",
        "3 The basic explanation: temporal presuppositions The basic explanation for the inappropriateness of (2b) and (2d) is actually quite simple.",
        "Sentences containing temporal connectives are presuppositional: the temporal clause introduces an eventuality that must be presupposed to have occurred, for the sentence as a whole to have a truth-value (cf. Heinamaki 1972; Kartunnen 1973).",
        "If the presupposed eventuality is not already in the reader's model of the discourse context, she must add it: a process known as accommodation (cf. Lewis 1979).",
        "Our view is that the discourse behaviour of temporal connectives is to be explained as follows.",
        "In the discourse context where we are describing El, and have uttered (1), the way presuppositions are accommodated depends on the reader's background knowledge; our inappropriate discourses are precisely those where accommodation ultimately leads to discourse incoherence.",
        "In particular, the presupposed eventuality from they were pacified cannot be accommodated in the previous context provided by (1), and must therefore be given further treatment.",
        "A presuppositional explanation stands in contrast to the classical accounts of temporal structure built upon Kamp's (1981) Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) (cf. Partee 1984; Hinrichs 1986).",
        "On both these accounts, subordinate clauses, such as those introduced by temporal connectives, update the current reference time, and the main clause is then interpreted with respect to that reference time.",
        "However, no constraint is placed on the relationship between the current reference time, and the new reference time supplied by the subordinate clause.",
        "And so no anomaly will be detected in (2b): a relation of temporal progression between (1)'s reference time and the new reference time for they were pacified will be added to the DRS.",
        "Thus, the incoherence of (2b) in the discourse context supplied by (1) remains unexplained.",
        "This is only to be expected, since the construction of discourse representation structures is syntax-driven, and does not attempt to capture the interactions with world knowledge which seem relevant here.",
        "So, although it promises to go further, the basic presuppositional explanation raises deeper questions.",
        "Why can't they were pacified be accommodated into the discourse context provided by (I)?",
        "What knowledge is it that leads to failure in this case, but success when we try to accommodate Major launched a charm offensive?",
        "Intuitively, the reader's background knowledge affects accommodation: world knowledge (wR) and pragmatic maxims can make accommodation impossible.'",
        "So to make 'Background knowledge is also essential to the expla the basic explanation precise, we need a formal theory of how such knowledge constrains accommodation.",
        "_Van der Sandt and Geurts (1991) provide a formal mechanism for presupposition accommodation in DRT, but they provide only informal heuristics that stipulate how background knowledge might affect the process.",
        "We extend their ideas, by providing a formal specification of those heuristics.",
        "We embed their account of accommodation in DICE (Discourse and Commonsense Entailment) (Lascarides and Asher 1991, 1993; Lascarides et at 1992).",
        "DICE permits us to model the interactions between linguistic knowledge (1,R) and WK which lead to the assignment of discourse coherence relations between propositions introduced by text segments, and temporal-causal relations between the eventualities they denote.",
        "The primary proposal is that the accommodation of presuppositions from temporal subordinate clauses be modelled as discourse attachment, so that accommodation is properly constrained by the reader's background knowledge.",
        "Let us call this basic idea accommodation by discourse attachment (ADA).",
        "Although we contrasted presuppositional accounts with classical DRT approaches, there are clear instances where a temporal subordinate clause has no special rhetorical role in a discourse, but acts instead as a temporal adverb.",
        "Such instances are less problematic for classical approaches than cases like (1,2b), but at the same time would pose problems for an account of temporal connectives that relied exclusively on ADA.",
        "Consider texts (3,4a) and (3,4b), modified from Hamann (1989:83-84): (3)I'm not a useless driver.",
        "(4)a. I could drive before you were born.",
        "b.",
        "?You were born after I could drive.",
        "(3,4a) and (3,4b) are temporally equivalent, but only the former is discourse coherent.",
        "If ADA were the whole story, then (3,4a) would be analysed as incoherent, since no rhetorical connection can be located between the speaker's driving ability and the hearer's birth.",
        "But (3,4a) is coherent, because the reference to birth is simply functioning as an adverbial, locating the starting point of driving in the distant past.",
        "We will therefore suggest that the primary proposal, where accommodation involves discourse attachment, must leave room for the possibility that presupposed eventualities can be directly added to a discourse context, without any discourse relations being involved.",
        "Let us call this latter idea accommodation by temporal addition (ATA).",
        "Our treatment of temporal connectives combines ADA and ATA; it thus effectively deals with temporal subordinate clauses by bringing together the presuppositional account nation of the presuppositions of the counterfactual uses of before, first observed by Heinimiki (1972:139).",
        "We have no space to discuss these here, unfortunately.",
        "and the classical DRT account.",
        "We now briefly review the two basic ingredients of the account: A mechanism for presupposition accommodation, and a theory of discourse attachment.",
        "4 A mechanism for presupposition accommodation Van der Sandt and Geurts (1991) assume that presuppositions are anaphora with semantic content.",
        "They distinguish cases in which presuppositions are 'cancelled' from those in which they are 'realised'.",
        "The cancelling of presuppositions is explained away as binding of anaphora.",
        "In other words, cancellation occurs when there is an appropriate antecedent in the reader's model of the discourse context that can be identified with the presuppositional material in the clause currently being processed.",
        "For example, in sentence (5), the presupposition normally associated with his wifewhich is that John has a wifeis cancelled by the conditional clause If John is married, which produces an antecedent in the reader's model of the context to which his wife can be bound.",
        "(5) 'If John is married, then his wife will be",
        "happy.",
        "The realising of presuppositions is handled through accommodation.",
        "Suppose there is no appropriate antecedent in the reader's model of the discourse context to which the presuppositional material can be bound.",
        "In that case, the reader attempts to add the material to the discourse context, subject to certain constraints; for example, that the result of the addition must be logically consistent.",
        "Sentences containing presuppositions are represented as a sentence DRS (or SEDRS) which is a triple containing: a set of discourse markers; a set of DRS conditions; and a (possibly empty) set of SEDRSS.",
        "The latter set demarcates those parts of the sentence that are presupposed, and that must therefore be bound or accommodated to the preceding discourse context; the former sets are those parts of the sentence that aren't presupposed.",
        "Binding is achieved through identifying the presupposed discourse referents with those already in the context.",
        "Accommodation is achieved through adding the presuppositional material to part of the discourse context; this process is subject to certain informal heuristic constraints.",
        "Van der Sandt and Geurts provide a definition of subordination involving SEDRSS which extends that of traditional DRT.",
        "A hierarchical structure is thus defined, and an order of priority for dealing with presuppositions can then be specified.",
        "The order is: try binding at a lower level; binding at a higher level; accommodating at a higher level; accommodating at a lower level.",
        "5 A mechanism for discourse attachment As mentioned before, we wish to enrich van der Sandt and Geurts' process of accommodation by using a general theory of discourse attachment; by doing this we provide a formal specification of the constraints on accommodation imposed by the reader's background knowledge.",
        "The general theory of discourse attachment we will use is DICE.",
        "DICE rests on a semantically-based theory of discourse structure called Segmented DRT (SDRT) (cf. Asher 1993).",
        "SDRT starts with traditional pass (cf. Kamp 1981), but goes on to assume with Grosz and Sidner (1986) that candidate discourses possess hierarchical structure, with units linked by discourse relations modelled after those proposed by Hobbs (1985) (cf. also Mann and Thompson 1987, Scha and Polanyi 1988).",
        "The resultant representations are called segmented DRss (or smss).",
        "Here, we use five discourse relations: Narration, Background, Result, Explanation and Elaboration.",
        "The latter two are subordinating relations, and the proposition introduced by the current sentence can attach only to the previous constituent of the SDRS for the text so far, or constituents it elaborates or explains.",
        "SDRT defines those parts of an SDRS that are available for attachment with new information via a discourse relation.",
        "DICE is a logical theory of discourse attachment, which explains how to infer which discourse relation to use.",
        "DICE specifies rules that represent the reader's background knowledge, and these interact via the nonmonotonic logic Commonsense Entailment (CE) proposed by Asher and Morreau (1991), to determine the discourse relations between propositions introduced in a text, and the temporal relations between the eventualities they describe.",
        "We here indicate some plausible rules and the inference patterns validated by CE, and demonstrate how they are involved in discourse attachment.",
        "The rules that capture WK and LK allow us to reason about the value of the update function (r, a ,f3), meaning \"the representation 7 of the text so far (of which a is already a part) is to be updated with the representation [3 of the current clause via a discourse relation with a\".",
        "Let ea be a term referring to the main eventuality described by the clause a; and let revolt(b, ea) mean that this eventuality is a backbencher revolt.",
        "As usual, we represent the de feasible connective as a conditional >.",
        "The following schemas are some rules for calculating implicatures:z Narration: (7, a, /3) > Narration(a,M Axiom on Narration: Narration(a,13)ea -{ ep",
        "To see how the rules work, consider (6) and (7).",
        "(6)The backbenchers were in revolt.",
        "Major launched a charm offensive.",
        "(7)?The backbenchers were in revolt.",
        "They were pacified.",
        "In interpreting (6) we try to attach the second sentence to the first (so (a, a, )3) holds, where a and flare respectively the logical forms of the first and second clauses).",
        "Two of our defeasible laws apply: Narration and States Overlap.",
        "They conflict, but States Overlap is more specific.",
        "So by the Penguin Principle, overlap(ea , ep) is inferred.",
        "So Background, which also conflicts with Narration, applies.",
        "By the Penguin Principle again, Background(a, 13) is inferred, since Background is more specific.",
        "4 Thus (6) is discourse coherent, in the precise sense that 13 can be attached to a with a discourse relation; we have also found that the state of revolt overlapped with the event of Mr Major's charm offensive.",
        "Now consider (7).",
        "The appropriate knowledge base in the analysis of (7) satisfies States Overlap, the Revolt Law and Narration.",
        "The first two of these conflict, but their antecedents aren't logically related.",
        "For note that unlike the Charm Law, the Revolt Law does not require the clauses concerned to be discourse connected somehow: being pacified and being in revolt don't normally overlap, regardless of whether they are connected or not.",
        "Because there is conflict among defeasible rules with unrelated antecedents, a Nixon Diamond crystallises.",
        "Consequently, no temporal or discourse relation can be inferred, and so no representation of (7) is constructed, leading to discourse incoherence.",
        "6 The proposal: accommodation by discourse attachment The basic explanation of the defectiveness of (2b,d) relied on the idea that temporal clauses are presupposed; even though (2b) may be taken to refer to the same temporal structure E1 as (2a), it is pragmatically inappropriate.",
        "In making this explanation more precise, we wish to characterise presupposition accommodation as a process of discourse attachment; and failure to accommodate thus involves failure to attach, or, in other words, (local) discourse incoherence.",
        "In the (1,2) examples, failure to attach at a particular site can be fatal, as we will see shortly.",
        "More precisely: (i) Subordinate temporal clauses are presupposed.",
        "(ii) If binding the presupposition fails, then it must be accommodated.",
        "(iii) If accommodation is necessary, then it is assumed in the first instance that the proposition introduced by the subordinate clause plays a rhetorical function in the dis-4Although the double application of the Penguin Principle, as in (6), is not valid in general, Lascarides and Asher (1993) show that for the particular type of case considered here, CE validates it.",
        "course, and so accommodation proceeds via discourse attachment.",
        "The presupposition must be attached to the discourse structure by a discourse relation, before the DRS of which it is a sub-part is attached.",
        "(iv) In that case, the presupposition can be discourse related to: either prior discourse or the DRS corresponding to its matrix clause.",
        "(v) If, on the other hand, accommodation via discourse attachment fails, then the assumption that the subordinate clause plays a rhetorical role is defeated, and accommodation is attempted via the addition of the presupposed event to the discourse context.",
        "(vi) If the presupposition is successfully dealt with, an attempt is then made to discourse-relate the resulting constituents of the discourse, using the reader's background knowledge.5 So, presuppositions can lead to incoherence in at least four ways.",
        "First, binding may be successful, but the resultant constituents of the discourse may fail to attach together (as in (3,4b)).",
        "Secondly, binding may fail, while ADA is successful, and then the resultant constituents of the discourse may fail to attach together (as in (1,2b)).",
        "Thirdly, binding and ADA may fail, while ATA is successfulas in (3,4a)but then, in contrast to (3,4a), the resultant constituents may fail to attach together.",
        "Finally, binding and both types of accommodation may fail.",
        "To reflect this process of interpreting temporal connectives in a discourse context, we propose that discourse attachment be split into four stages, of which the third has three main parts:",
        "1.",
        "We build the sentence DRS (or SEDRS) for the sentence containing the temporal connective.",
        "2.",
        "We then calculate the temporal implicatures for the SEDRS, that arise from the temporal connective used, if there are any.",
        "3.",
        "We then handle the presupposition: (a) We attempt to bind.",
        "If that fails, (b) we attempt accommodation, by attempting discourse attachment between available smtss and the third subpart of the SEDRS (which corresponds to the presupposed clause).",
        "If the presupposition is bound or accommodated by discourse attachment, we go to (4).",
        "But if (b) fails, then (c) we attempt accommodation by adding the third sub-part of the SEDRS to an available SDRS, and if this is possible, we go to (4).",
        "If (c) fails, then we fail on the grounds of incoherence.",
        "4.",
        "Attempt discourse attachment between the current DRS and available SDRSs.",
        "If attachment succeeds, go to (1) with the next sentence.",
        "If not, fail on the grounds of incoherence.",

        "7 Temporal information from connectives First of all, we register Hamann's (1989:76) observation that before and after operate on points by placing in the SEDRS the relevant precedence conditions on the points of time at which the eventualities are asserted to hold.",
        "We fold states into this picture by introducing a default 'inceptive' reading for temporal connectives; conn here varies over before and after; an eventuality is incstate if it's inceptive.",
        "That is, incstate(e6) is true only if the time discourse referent t introduced in the DRS b is the time where e6 starts.",
        "In words, b before/after 7 normally entails that b and 7 are to be interpreted inceptively, if either of them are stative.",
        "It is suggested that when clauses, by contrast, do not implicate inceptiveness; indeed they do not have any special temporal implicatures (cf. Moens and Steedman 1988).",
        "However, it can be argued that when does have a causal implicature: it serves to restrict the kinds of contingency relationships that can hold between eventualities; in particular, it defeasibly cuts off one possibility: No Cause: when(a, 13) > -,cause(ea,ep)"

        "Conceptual Immediacy:",
        "In words, Conceptual Immediacy states that if the constituent 0 is to be attached to a, where # contains Result(-y, (5) (and so el, causes eo), then the start of ea (i.e., ibd(e a)) and the end of ea (i.e., f bd(e a)), cannot come inbetween e7 and e. Conceptual Immediacy has an impact on the analysis of (2b), because it applies in the attachment of e to a, together with the laws we have already mentioned.",
        "Here, Conceptual Immediacy means that normally, the point where the revolt starts or finishes cannot come in between the charm offensive and the pacification.",
        "States Overlap means that normally, the revolt overlaps with the event structure described in e. So States Overlap and Conceptual Immediacy together say that normally, the revolt starts before the charm offensive, and continues until at least after the pacification has started.",

        "Under this analysis, (2b) is coherent in isolation, but incoherent in the context of (1).",

        "This means that the charming didn't cause the pacification; apart from anything else, this implicature renders (2d) an inappropriate vehicle for a speaker who wished to describe the course of events E1 we have been discussing.",
