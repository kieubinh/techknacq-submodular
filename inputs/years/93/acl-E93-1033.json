      "text": [
        "When agents participate in a dialogue, they bring to it different beliefs and goals.",
        "These differences can lead them to make different assumptions about one another's actions, construct different interpretations of discourse objects, or produce utterances that are either too specific or too vague for others to interpret as intended.",
        "As a result, agents may fail to understand some part of the dialogue or unknowingly diverge in their understanding of it – making a breakdown in communication likely.",
        "One strategy an agent might use to address the problem of breakdowns is to try to circumvent them, for example, by trying to identify and correct apparent confusions about objects or concepts mentioned in the discourse [Goodman, 1985; McCoy, 1985; Calistri-Yeh, 1991; Eller and Carberry, 1992].",
        "The work reported here takes a different, but complementary, approach: it models how an agent can use what she or he knows about the discourse to recognize whether either participant has misunderstood some previous utterance to repair the misunderstanding.",
        "This strategy handles cases that the preventive approaches cannot anticipate.",
        "It is also more general, because our system can generate repairs on the basis of the relatively few types of manifestations of misunderstanding, rather than the much broader (and hence more difficult to anticipate) range of sources.",
        "In this paper, we shall describe an abductive account of interpreting speech acts and recognizing misunderstandings (we discuss the generation of repairs of misunderstandings in McRoy and Hirst, 1992).",
        "This account is part of a unified theory of speech act production, interpretation, and repair [McRoy, 1993].",
        "According to the theory, speakers use their beliefs about the discourse context and which speech acts are expected to follow from a given speech act in order to select one that accomplishes their goals and then to produce an utterance that performs the chosen speech act.",
        "Interpretation and repair attempt to retrace this selection process abductively – when a hearer attempts to interpret an observed utterance, he tries to identify the goals, expectations, or misunderstandings that might have led the to produce it.",
        "Previous plan-based approaches [Allen, 1979; Allen, 1983; Litman, 1985; Carberry, 1985] have had difficulty constraining this inference – from only a germ of content, potentially a tremendous number of goals could be inferred.",
        "A key assumption of our approach, which follows from insights provided by Conversation Analysis [Garfinkel, 1967; Schegloff and Sacks, 1973], is that participants can rely primarily on expectations derived from social conventions about language use.",
        "These expectations enable participants to determine whether the conversation is proceeding smoothly: if nothing unusual is detected, then understanding is presumed to occur.",
        "Conversely, when a hearer finds",
        "that a speaker's utterance is inconsistent with his expectations, he may change his interpretation of an earlier turn and generate a repair [Fox, 1987; Suchman, 1987].",
        "Our approach differs from standard CA accounts in that it treats Gricean intentions [Grice, 1957] as part of these conventions and uses them to constrain an agent's expectations; the work thus represents a synthesis of intentional and structural accounts.",
        "Recognizing misunderstanding is like abduction because hearers must explain why, given their knowledge of how differences in understanding are manifested, a speaker might have said what she did.",
        "Attributions of misunderstanding are assumptions that might be abduced in constructing such an explanation.",
        "Recognizing misunderstanding also resembles a diagnosis in which utterances play the role of \"symptoms\" and misunderstandings are \"faults\".",
        "Previous work on diagnosis has shown abduction to be a useful characterization [Ahuja and Reggia, 1986; Poole, 1986].",
        "An alternative approach to diagnosing discourse misunderstandings is to reason deductively from a speaker's utterances to his or her goals on the basis of (default) prior beliefs and then rely on belief revision to retract inconsistent interpretations [Cawsey, 1991]; however, this approach has a number of disadvantages.",
        "First, any set of rules of this form will be unable to specify all the conditions (such as insincerity) that might also influence the agent's interpretation; a reasoner will need also to assume that there are no \"abnormalities\" relevant to the participants or the speech event [Poole, 1989].",
        "This approach also ignores the many other possible interpretations that participants might achieve through negotiation, independent of their actual beliefs.",
        "For example, an agent's response to a yes – no question might treat it as a question, a request, a warning, a test, an insult, a challenge, or just a vacuous statement intended to keep the conversation going.",
        "If conversational participants can negotiate such ambiguities, then utterances are at most a reason for attributing a certain goal to an agent.",
        "That is, they are a symptom, not a cause.",
        "Any deductive account would thus be counter-intuitive, and very likely false as well.",
        "2 The abductive framework We have chosen to develop the proposed account of dialogue using the Prioritized Theorist framework [Poole et al., 1987; Brewka, 1989; van Arragon, 1990].",
        "Theorist typifies what is known as a \"proofbased approach\" to abduction because it relies on a theorem prover to collect the assumptions that would be needed to prove a given set of observations and to verify their consistency.",
        "This framework was selected because of its first-order syntax and its support for both default and abductive reasoning.",
        "Within Theorist, we represent linguistic knowledge and the discourse context, and also model how speakers reason about their actions and misunderstandings.",
        "We have used Poole's implementation of Theorist, extended to incorporate preferences among defaults as suggested by Van Arragon [1990].",
        "Poole's Theorist implements a full first-order clausal theorem prover in Prolog.",
        "It extends Prolog with a true negation symbol and the contrapositive forms of each clause.",
        "Thus, a Theorist clause ct 3 Q is interpreted as {# a, – 'a -,#}.",
        "A Prioritized Theorist reasoner can also assume any default d that the programmer has designated as a potential hypothesis, unless it can prove – id from some fact or overriding hypothesis.",
        "The reasoning algorithm uses model elimination [Loveland, 1978; Stickel, 1989; Umrigar and Pitchumani, 1985] as its proof strategy.",
        "Like Pro-log, it is a resolution-based procedure that chains backward from goals to subgoals, using rules of the form goal 4 subgoali A • • • A subgoal,,, to reduce the goals to their subgoals.",
        "However, unlike Prolog, it records each subgoal that occurs in the proof tree leading to the current one and checks this list before searching the knowledge base for a relevant clause; this permits it to reason by cases."
