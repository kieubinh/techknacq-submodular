        "The most well-known characteristic of Non-linear Phonology is that it shifted its attention from the theory of rules (like in [Chomsky and Halle, 19681) to the theory of representations.",
        "During the last decade phonologists have developed a theory of representations that is sufficiently rich and adequate to describe a wide range of facts from the phonologies of various languages.",
        "It is a fairly recent development that these representations are being studied also from a purely formal point of view.",
        "There has been done some work on autosegmental structure (for instance [Coleman and Local, 1991; Bird, 1990; Bird and Klein, 1990]) and also some work on metrical trees (like [Coleman, 1990; Coleman, 19921 in unification phonology and [Wheeler, 1981; Moortgat and Morrill, 1991] in categorial logics).",
        "As far as I know, apart from the pioneering work by [Halle and Vergnaud, 1987], hitherto no attention has been paid to the formal aspects of the most popular framework of metrical phonology nowadays, the bracketed grids framework.",
        "Yet a lot of questions have to be answered with regard to bracketed grids.",
        "First of all, some authors (for instance [Van der Hu1st, 19911) have expressed the intuition that bracketed grids and tree structures (e.g. the [sw] labeled trees of [Hayes, 1981] and related work) are equivalent.",
        "In this paper, I study this intuition in some formal detail and show that it is wrong.",
        "Secondly, one can wonder what the exact relation is between higher-order metrical structure (foot, word) and subsyllabic structure.",
        "In this paper I will show that apart from a few empirically unimportant details, bracketed grids are equivalent to the kind of subsyllabic structure that is advocated by [Kaye, et al., 1985], [1990]'."

        "HV have a major part of their book devoted to the formalism themselves, but there are numerous problems with this formalization.",
        "I will mention two of them.",
        "First, their formalization is not flexible enough to capture all instances of (bracketed) grid theory as it is actually used in the literature of the last few years.",
        "They merely give a sketch of the specific implementation of bracketed grid theory as it is used in the rest of their book.",
        "Modern work like [Kager, 1989] or [Hayes, 1991] cannot be described within 11n this paper, I will use HV as an abbreviation for [Halle and Vergnaud, 1987] and KLV as an abbreviation for [Kaye, et al., 1985], [1990].",
        "this framework.",
        "Secondly, their way of formalizing bracketing grids has very much a 'derivational' flavour.",
        "They are more interested in how grids can be built than in what they look like.",
        "Although looking at the derivational aspects is an interesting and worthwile enterprise in itself, it makes their formalism less suitable for a comparison with metrical trees.",
        "A grid in the linguistic literature is a set of lines, each line defining a certain subgroup of the stress bearing elements.",
        "Thus, in 1 (HV's (85)), the asterisks ('stars') on line 0 represent the syllables of the word formaldehyde, the stars on line 1 secondary stress and line 2 represents the syllable with primary stress:"

        "At least we can see from these definitions that the x-slot line in KLV's theory behaves like a normal metrical line.",
        "Yet there is one extra condition defined on this line; this is called interconstituent government.",
        "Because of the restrictions in (15), KLV notice that this type of government only concerns the following contexts.",
        "(Square brackets denote domains for interconstituent government, normal brackets for constituent government):",
        "As we noted above, KLV do not accept any constituents on the higher line.",
        "One of their reasons was their stipulation that all constituents are left-headed.",
        "There are independent reasons to abandon this restriction.",
        "[Charette, 1991] argues for a prosodic analysis of French schwa/[e] alternations.",
        "In order to do this, she has to build metrical as w] labeled) trees representing feet on top of the nuclei.",
        "She gives the 9 In [Van Oostendorp, 19924 I sketch a way of translating `interconstituent government' to a bracketed grid theory of the syllable.",
        "following crucial example [Charette, 19911 (p.180, example (11c)): (22) W S Here we have a clear case of a right-headed phonological constituent, namely the foot.",
        "Furthermore, we see that the nuclei are projected from the (0 R)* line to a line where they are the single elements.",
        "If we change the top N's in this picture into ti's we have something like a metrical syllable line.",
        "If we incorporate these two innovations into our theory, we can translate th structure in 22 into a perfectly normal grid, in fact into a complete linguistic grid:",
        "Concludingly, we can say that, although KLV's syllable representations are somewhat different from linguistic grids, two minor adjustments can make them isomorphic: in stead of (0 R)* we assume (R)(0 R)* , i.e. there can be onsetless syllables (KLV themselves note that most of the (0 R)* stipulation can be made to follow from independent stipulations like interconstituent government).",
        "This follows a forteriori for the (R)(0 R)* stipulation.",
        "in stead of 22 we assume VRi : [Ri E --+ }] A R,_,Iot =- The first conjunct of this definition is simply my translation of Kager's ([19891) Binary Constituency Hypothesis 12 and the second conjunct does the same as the original definition of KLV: it gives the correct choice of government for the subsyllabic line.",
        "As far as I can see, none of these modifications alters the empirical scope of KLV's theory in any important way.",
        "I conclude that for all practical purposes, KLV's representation of the syllable equals my definition of a linguistic grid."

        "The basic ideas underlying each of these frameworks are government/dependency on the one hand and the division of a structure into lines on the other.",
        "The similarity between the frameworks is obscured mainly by the immense differences in notation; but we have shown that the algebraic systems underlying these formalisms is basically the same.",

        "It remains to be shown whether there are any major formal differences between the bracketed grids that are presented in this paper and the `X-bar-structures-cum-lines' as they are represented in [Levin, 1985] and [Hermans, 1990]."
