        "While this technique exhibits some inefficiencies characteristic of a depth–first search, it has several significant advantages.",
        "First, it does not rely on a specific semantic representation, and requires only that the semantics be compositional and representable in Prolog.",
        "Thus the generating procedure is independent of the particular grammar.",

        "Had we chosen to generate x before s:walksYmary9\\x, we would have entered a potentially infinite recursion, since x unifies with every category in the lexicon.",
