        "In the past decade, the field of knowledge representation (KR) has seen impressive growth of sophistication in the representation of uncertain quantitative knowledge about physical properties in common-sense reasoning and qualitative physics.",
        "The input to most of these systems is entered by hand, but some of them, especially those with commonsense domains involving spatial and temporal knowledge, are amenable to interaction by means of a natural language interface.",
        "Linguistic access to knowledge about properties such as durations, rates of change, distances, the sizes of the symmetry axes of objects, and so on, is provided by dimensional adjectives (e.g. long-short in the spatial and temporal senses, fast-slow, near-far, tall-short).",
        "In this paper, I will investigate two aspects of their semantics that have an impact on the quality of a KR system with an NL interface.",
        "One aspect is the complexity of reasoning entailed by their semantic interpretations.",

        "sizes that are typical for object categories, should allow us to derive the following sentences (among others) from (1): (2) a.",

        "e. The oven is high (for an oven).",
        "The inferences from (1) to (2) are rather simple, but reasoning can become very complicated if a large number of parameters and constraints must be accounted for.",

        "It is appealing from the viewpoint of theoretical linguistics to regard each of the morphosyntactic categories (positive, etc.)",
        "as lexical items with their own semantics, and to assume that the semantics of each sentence in (3) is a compositional function of the semantics of the morphosyntactic category and the semantics of the adjective stem.",
        "Compositional meaning representations may also be computationally more advantageous, since they can be computed very efficiently from syntactic representations (e.g. in unification-based formalisms).",
        "Most formal theories of the meanings of adjectives attempt to fulfill this criterion of compositionality, but as we will see, they differ on a more far-reaching criterion: whether the meaning of the differential comparative (6 cm shorter than) and the equative with factor term (three times as long as) is a compositional function of the meanings the difference and factor terms (6 cm and three times) and the meanings of the simple comparative and equative, respectively.",
        "Although compositionality is generally regarded as a virtue in and of itself, some authors ([Pinkal, 1990], [Klein, 1991]) have objected to compositional treatments of difference and factor terms on the grounds that they introduce an excessive amount of mathematical structure into our linguistic models.",
        "In section 3, I will compare semantic representations that do and do not foresee a compositional treatment of difference and factor terms by analyzing the complexity of reasoning that they entail.",
        "In particular, I will investigate the complexity of constraint propagation in a system where the meaning representations appear as constraints.",
        "In this paradigm, uncertain quantitative knowledge is accounted for with real-valued intervals, a popular choice in KR systems, and constraint propagation is performed by the Waltz algorithm (which gets its name from David Waltz [1975]).",
        "Ernest Davis [1987] shows in his detailed analysis that the Waltz algorithm is one of the best choices for this task, for reasons that I will explain in section 3.1 It turns out that the constraint propagation with the Waltz algorithm under the compositional approach is more complex; thus, we apparently face a tradeoff between compositionality and complexity.",
        "I argue in section 4 that this is indeed a tradeoff, since the non-compositional formation of meaning representations may be expensive, and the increased complexity of the compositional approach may be manageable, especially if certain assumptions can be made about the domain of physical properties being represented.",
        "2 Compositionality in the Semantics of Adjectives",
        "There is a vast amount of linguistic data on which a formal semantics of adjectives can be evaluated, such as the interaction of comparative and equative complements with scope-bearing operators: quantifiers, logical connectives, modal operators and negative polarity items (e.g. John is taller than I will ever be).",
        "A good theory must also account for the phenomenon of markedness, i.e. the semantic asymmetry of the antonyms (see [Lyons, 1977, Sect.",
        "9.1]).",
        "However, I will ignore these issues in order to focus on the matter of compositionality.",
        "Thus I classify the existing theories of adjective meaning very coarsely as 'compositional' or 'non-compositional'.",
        "Note that these labels indicate only whether or not the treatment of difference and factor terms is compositional (in other respects, all of the theories mentioned below are compositional).",

        "The reasoning paradigm to be investigated is constraint propagation (sometimes called constraint satisfaction) over real-valued intervals.",
        "Intervals are intended to account for uncertainty in quantitative knowledge.",
        "For example, the measurement of a parameter at 20 units on some scale with a possible measurement error of ±0.5 units is represented as [19.5, 20.5], to be interpreted as meaning that the unknown measurement value in question lies somewhere in the set {x119.5 < x < 20.5}.",
        "Additional knowledge about the relations that hold between parameters constrains their possible values to smaller sets (hence the term 'constraints' for the propositions in a knowledge base expressing such relations).",

        "The second question can only be answered empirically, by testing whether the heuristic tends to terminate the algorithm too soon (i.e. whether it terminates refinement of systems that might have terminated normally in a short time).",
        "Empirical investigations of these questions are reported in [Simmons, 1993], and described briefly here.",
        "To investigate the first question, the algorithm was run on a number of large, consistent constraint systems with admissible solutions in which the three types of constraints shown in Table 3 appeared in approximately equal numbers.",
        "On each run, the constraints in the initial queue were permuted randomly to suppress the possible effects of ordering.",
        "None of these runs required more time to termination than is predicted by the O(pS) result for systems containing just unit linear inequalities or just product constraints.",
        "To investigate the second question, I attempted to build consistent constraint systems with admissible solutions that are terminated by Davis' heuristic sooner than they would have been normally.",
        "It turns out that the algorithm runs to completion on almost all systems that were tested long before any constraint is taken off the queue p times, although there are systems for which refinement is terminated too soon on this heuristic.",
        "If the limit is increased by a constant factor, e.g. if assimilation is stopped after some constraint is processed 2p times, then the risk of early termination is greatly reduced.",
        "In all, the empirical results on the open questions mentioned above have been encouraging.",
        "It is an admitted weakness of these tests, however, that they were performed on systems built by hand, not on constraint systems that occur \"naturally\" as part of an NL interface to a KR, system."

        "The results of the previous section yield Tables 4 and 5 as the complexity of reasoning with the Waltz algorithm under the non-compositional and compositional approaches, respectively.",
        "These results depend in part on the fact that there is a maximum number of parameters in each constraint in the linguistic application.",
        "Measurements are modelled as predicate constraints, i.e. they simply impose interval bounds on some parameter.",
        "Intervals are also assumed to model the range of measurement values for the physical property that is typical for members of a category (e.g. the typical width of refridgera-tors), thus accounting for the norm used in the interpretation of positives.",
        "An important property of such \"norm intervals\" is that they may not be refined, at least not too much.",
        "This may be achieved by adding constraints imposing absolute upper and lower bounds on their ranges (cf. [Simmons, 1992]).",
        "Although the worst-case time complexity in all cases turns out to be the same, the compositional approach is more complex for two reasons.",
        "First, the system is prone to enter infinite loops under the compositional approach if the starting state is inconsistent, or if the solution is inadmissible.",
        "Consistency cannot generally be guaranteed in the linguistic application under consideration, since the sentences in",
        "a text may contain errors.",
        "Second, reasoning under the compositional approach is incomplete in all but the trivial case of measurements, whereas the non-compositional approach guarantees at least assimilation completeness for a subset of the parameters in the system.",
        "This means that under the compositional approach, the reasoner does not refine some intervals as tightly as it could have under the non-compositional approach.",
        "These results may be taken as grounds for rejecting the compositional approach to the semantics of dimensional adjectives in the design of an NL interface to a KR system for quantitative knowledge.",
        "However, I do not believe that the compositional approach is contraindicated for all conceivable systems.",
        "In addition to the general theoretical appeal of compositional semantics, the compositional formation of meaning representations may be computationally more attractive in some cases (e.g. in unification-based formalisms).",
        "Thus if the non-compositional formation of semantic representations turns out to be too expensive, it may defeat the computational advantage gained in the reasoning process.",
        "This is especially true if the weaknesses of the compositional approach do not turn out to be highly relevant in the specific application.",
        "For example, if the domain of physical properties being represented is such that a set of constraints requiring some parameter to be set to [0, 0] or [oo, oo] is unlikely to be encountered, and hence the solution is likely to be admissible, then the risk of infinite loops is reduced.",
        "Moreover, if Davis' heuristic for terminating infinite loops turns out to be reliable (which might be determinable by experimentation within the specific application), then inconsistencies need not be very damaging.",
        "The incompleteness of reasoning under the compositional approach is unacceptable for an application if it is crucial that the inferred intervals contain precisely those values that are warranted by the constraints and the initial labelling.",
        "If a superset of those values can be accepted, however, then the compositional approach can be taken.",
        "Both approaches suffer a lack of what Davis calls query completeness: if the value of a term T is to be determined during the querying stage (i.e. after assimilation),",
        "the system may return a superset of the values for T that are warranted by the constraints.",
        "Thus an engineer building an NL interface to a system for reasoning about uncertain quantitative knowledge of physical properties must make a number of design decisions: • How important are difference and factor terms in the linguistic material to be processed?",
        "If difference and factor terms are so marginal that they may not occur at all, then the non-compositional approach is probably the better choice, due to its guarantee of termination and assimilation completeness.",
        "• Does the compositional generation of lexical semantic representations have a significant advantage (computational or otherwise) over the non-compositional approach?",
        "• Is it possible or likely for the measurement of some physical property to be exactly zero?",
        "While there is probably no natural application in which the magnitude of some property can be infinitely large, there are different philosophies about the treatment of zero.",
        "In a system of temporal reasoning, for example, saying that some event has zero duration may be a way of saying that the event does not exist.",
        "But another policy might be to insist that no physical property is represented if it is not exhibited to a positive degree.",
        "If this assumption can be made, then the intervals [0, 0] and [oo, oo] are truly inadmissible, and hence one weakness of the compositional approach is diminished.",
        "• Is it important that the precise range of permissible measurement values be inferred for each parameter, or can a superset of those values be useful?",
        "If a superset of the possible values is acceptable, then the compositional approach can be chosen.",
        "Otherwise, the non-compositional approach must be taken.",
        "By weighing the various answers to these questions, an engineer can stake out a position on the tradeoff and design a system with the power and efficiency most appropriate to his or her needs."

        "First we need some terminology defined in [Davis, 1987, Appendix B] (recall the definition of refinement operators in section 3.2 above).",
        "For a refinement operator R, let OUT(R) be the bound affected by R, and let ARGS(R) be the set of bounds other than OUT(R) that enter into the computation of OUT(R).",

        "In other words, some argument of Ri has been set most recently in the series by Rj.",
        "We say that Ri depends on R1 if either i = j or Ri depends on Rk and R1 is an immediate predecessor of Rk.",
        "Thus the dependence relation is the transitive and reflexive closure of the immediate precedence relation.",
        "We say that Ri depends on bound B if for some Rj, Ri depends on Rj and B E ARGS(R,, ).",
        "The series of refinements R. = (R1, ... , 110 is self-dependent if depends on OUT(R,,), its own output bound.",
        "In other words, a series is self-dependent if the last bound affected by the series is also an argument to the first refinement in a chain of refinements in the precedence relation, as illustrated below.",
        "Davis shows that such self-dependencies are potential infinite loops: Theorem 2 Any infinite sequence of active refinements contains an active, self-dependent subsequence ([Davis, 1987, Lemma B.15 B.",
        "In [Simmons, 1993], it is shown that if any self-dependent sequence R is active on the labelling of a system of product constraints, then a certain subsequence RI of 7Z will be active infinitely many times.",
        "Moreover, on the m-th execution of each refinement Ri in R', there is a term 17', where each 1 > Tr-1 > 1, such that OUT(Ri) is multiplied by: (7)-1, if OUT(Ri) is an upper bound 7, if OUT(Ri) is a lower bound It follows that upper bounds are refined so as to become arbitrarily small (asymptotically approaching zero), and that lower bounds become arbitrarily large, up to infinity.",
        "Thus if there is any constraint C1 in the system that imposes a lowest value greater than zero on an",
        "upper bound that is affected by a refinement operator in V, that bound will be refined often enough until it becomes inconsistent with C1.",
        "Similarly, if any constraint C„ imposes a largest finite value on a lower bound that is affected by a refinement in R.', then that bound will be refined until it becomes inconsistent with C..",
        "In both cases, the system is inconsistent.",
        "If there are no such constraints, then it is consistent for upper bounds affected by 7V to be asymptotically close to zero and for lower bounds affected by /\"Z' to be arbitrarily large.",
        "This can only be consistent if, in the case of upper bounds, the solution assigns [0, 0] to the parameter in question, and in the case of lower bounds, the solution assigns [oo, oo] to its parameter.",
        "Hence, the solution is inadmissible.",
        "But according to Davis' result (Theorem 2), infinite loops must contain an active, self-dependent subsequence such as 1:4.",
        "It follows that if a system of product constraints is consistent and its solution is admissible, then the Waltz algorithm finds its solution in finite time.",
