        "A large-scale description has been written within the Constraint Grammar (CG) framework.",
        "CG parsing consists of the following sequential modules:",
        "• Preprocessing and morphological analysis • Disambiguation of morphological (e.g. part-of-speech) ambiguities • Mapping of syntactic functions onto morphological categories • Disambiguation of syntactic functions",
        "Here we shall be concerned only with disambiguation of morphological ambiguities – this module, along with the TWOL-style morphological description ENGTWOL, is the most mature part of the ENGCG system.",
        "The morphological description is based on [Quirk et al., 19851.",
        "For each word, a base form, a part of speech as well as inflectional and also derivational tags are provided, e.g.",
        "Ambiguities due to part of speech and minor categories are common in English – on an average, the ENGTWOL analyser furnishes each word with two readings.",
        "The task of the morphological disambigua-tor is certainly a nontrivial one.",
        "The disambiguator uses a handwritten constraint grammar.",
        "Here, we will not go into the technicalities of the CG rule formalism; suffice it to say that each constraint – presently some 1,300 in all – expresses a partial paraphrase of some thirty more general grammar statements, typically in the form of negative restrictions.",
        "– For instance, a constraint might reject verb readings in an ambiguous morphological analysis as contextually illegitimate if the immediately preceding word is an unambiguous determiner.",
        "This can be regarded as a roundabout partial statement about the form of a noun phrase: a determiner is followed by a premodifier or a noun phrase head, so all morphological readings that cannot act as nominal heads or premodifiers are to be discarded.",
        "Here is the disambiguated representation of the sentence:",
        "Overall, the morphological disambiguator has a very attractive performance.",
        "While the best known competitors – typically based on statistical methods (see e.g. [Garside et al., 1987; Church, 1988]) – make a misprediction about part of speech in up to 5% of all words, the ENGCG disambiguator makes a false prediction only in up to 0.3% of all cases [Voutilainen, 1993].",
        "So far, ENGCG has been used in a (\"see\" (\"see\"",
        "large-scale information management system (an ESPRIT II project called SIMPR: Structured Information Management: Processing and Retrieval).",
        "Currently ENGCG is also used for tagging the Bank of English, a 200-million word corpus established by the COBUILD team in Birmingham, England; the tagged corpus will become accessible to the research community.",
        "What makes ENGCG interesting for the present discussion is the fact that the constraints are essentially partial expressions of the distribution of functional-syntactic categories.",
        "In other words, the generalisations underlying the disambiguation constraints pertain to a higher level of description than is explicitly coded in the input representation.",
        "The high number and also the complexity of most of the constraints mainly results from the fact that direct reference to functional categories is not possible in the constraint grammar because syntactic functions are systematically introduced only after morphological disambiguation has become disacti-vated.",
        "Also explicit information about sentence-internal clause boundaries is missing, so a constraint, usually about clause-internal relations, has to ascertain that the words and features referred to are in the same clause – again in a roundabout and usually partial fashion.",
        "Indeed, it is argued in [Voutilainen, 1993] that if direct reference to all appropriate categories were possible, most or all of part-of-speech disambiguation would be a mere side-effect of genuine functional-syntactic analysis.",
        "In other words, it seems that the availability of a more expressive grammatical representation would make part-of-speech analysis easier, even though the amount of ambiguity would increase at the outset.",
        "The ENGCG disambiguator avoids risky predictions; some 3-6% of all words remain partly ambiguous after part-of-speech disambiguation.",
        "Also most of these remaining ambiguities appear structurally resolvable.",
        "The reason why these ambiguities are not resolved by the ENGCG disambiguator is that the expression of the pertinent grammar rules as constraints, without direct reference to syntactic-function labels and clause boundaries, becomes prohibitively difficult.",
        "Our hypothesis is that also most of the remaining part-of-speech ambiguities could be resolved if also clause boundary and syntactic descriptors were present in the input, even though this would imply more ambiguity at the outset of parsing."

        "• All three types of structural ambiguity – morphological, clause boundary, and syntactic – are presented in parallel.",
        "No separate, potentially sequentially applied subgrammars for morphological disambiguation, clause boundary determination, or syntax proper, are needed – one uniform rule component will suffice for expressing the various aspects of the grammar.",
        "In this setting, therefore, a genuine test of the justification of three separate types of grammar is feasible: for instance, it is possible to test, whether morphological disambiguation is reducible to essentially syntactic-functional grammar.",
        "• The internal representation of the sentence is more distinctive.",
        "The FS parser represents each sentence reading separately, whereas the CG parser only distinguishes between alternative word readings.",
        "Therefore the FS rules need not concern themselves with more than one unambiguous, though potentially unacceptable, sentence reading at a time, and this improves parsing accuracy.",
        "• The rule formalism is more expressive and flexible than in CG; for instance, the full power of regular expressions is available.",
        "The most useful kind of rule appears to be the implication rule; consider the following (somewhat simplified) rule about the distribution of the subject in a finite clause:",
        "It reads: 'A finite clause subject (a constant defined as a regular expression elsewhere in the grammar) occurs before a finite verb chain in the same clause (`..'), or it occurs between a finite auxiliary and a nonfinite main verb in the same clause, and the sentence ends in a question mark.'",
        " – If a sentence reading contains a sequence of tags that is accepted by the regular expression Subject and that is not legitimated by the contexts, the sentence reading is discarded; otherwise it survives the evaluation, perhaps to be discarded by some other grammar rule.",
        "Implication rules express distributions in a straightforward, positive fashion, and usually they are very compact: several dozens of CG rules that express bits and pieces of the same grammatical phenomenon can usually be expressed with one or two transparent finite-state rules.",
        "• The CG syntax was somewhat shallow.",

        "The objective was to see, whether those morphological ambiguities that are too hard for the ENGCG disambiguator to resolve can be resolved if a more expressive grammatical description (and a more powerful parsing formalism) is used.",
        "Writing a text-generic comprehensive parsing grammar of a maturity comparable to the ENGCG description would have taken too much time to be practical for this pilot test.",
        "While most of the grammar rules were about relatively frequently occurring constructions, e.g. about the structure of the finite verb chain or of prepositional phrases, some of the rules were obviously 'inspired' by the test text: the test grammar is more comprehensive on the structural phenomena of the test text than on texts in general.",
        "However, all proposed rules were carefully tested against various corpora, e.g. a manually tagged collection of some 2,000 sentences taken from [Quirk et al., 1985], as well as large untagged corpora, in order to ascertain the generality of the proposed rules.",
        "Thus the resulting grammar was 'optimised' in the sense that all syntactic structures of the text were described in the grammar, but not in the sense that the rules would have been true of the test text only.",

        "Out of the 1,400 words, 43 remained ambiguous due to morphological category, and no misanalyses were made.",

        "A more detailed classification can be achieved by consulting the morphological codes in the same morphological reading, so from the combination DET @>N we may deduce that the is a determiner of a nominal in the right-hand context; from the combination A @>N we may deduce that fat is an adjectival premodifier of a nominal, and so forth.",
        "The notation avoids introducing structurally unresolvable distinctions.",
        "Consider the analysis of fat.",

        "On structural criteria, it is",
        "impossible to determine, for instance, whether fat modifies the coordinated daughters as well in the fat butcher's wife and daughters.",
        "Our notation keeps also this kind of ambiguity covert, which helps to keep the amount of ambiguity within reasonable limits.",
        "In our description, the syntactic function is carried by the coordinates rather than by the coordinator – hence the object function tags on both wife and daughters rather than on and.",
        "An alternative convention would be the functional labelling of the conjunction.",
        "The difference appears to be merely notational.",
        "A distinction is made between finite and non-finite constructions.",

        "For instance, the grammarian might wish to state that a finite clause contains maximally one potentially coordinated subject.",
        "Now if potential subjects in non-finite clauses could not be treated separately, it would be more difficult to express the grammar statement as a rule because extra checks for the existence of subjects of non-finite constructions would have to be incorporated in the rule as well, at a considerable cost to transparency and perhaps also to generality.",
        "Witness the following sample analysis:",
        "Apparently, there are two simplex subjects in the same clause; what makes them acceptable is that they have different verbal regents: Henry is a subject in a finite clause, with dislikes as the main verb, while her occurs in a non-finite clausal construction, with leaving as the main verb.",
        "With regard to the description of so early in the above sentence, the present description makes no commitments as to whether the adverbial attaches to dislikes or leaving – in the notational system, there is no separate tag for adverbials in non-finite constructions.",

        "Consider the following sample.",
        "Here What makes them acceptable acts as a subject in a finite clause, and that they have different verbal regents acts as a subject complement.",
        "– Clauses in a dependent role are always subordinate clauses that typically have a more fixed word order than main clauses.",
        "Thus clause-function tags like SC@ can also be used in fixing clause-internal structure.",
        "Another advantage of the introduction of clause-function tags is that restricting the distribution of clauses becomes more straightforward.",
        "If, for instance, a clause is described as a postmodifying clause, then it has to follow something to postmodify; if a clause is described as a subject, then it should also have a predicate, and so on.",
        "More generally: previous grammars contained some rules explicitly about clause boundary markers, for instance:",
        "In contrast, the grammar currently under development contains no rules of this type.",
        "Clause boundary determination is likely to be reducible to functional syntax, much as is the case with morphological disambiguation.",
        "This new uniformity in the grammar is a consequence of the enrichment of the description with the functional account of clauses.",
        "Also less frequent of 'basic' word orders can be conveniently accounted for with the present descriptive apparatus.",
        "For instance, in the following sentence there is a 'deferred' preposition; here the complement is to the left of the preposition.",
        "Here @>>P for What indicates that a deferred preposition is to be found in the right-hand context, and the morphological feature <Deferred> indicates that about has no complement in the right-hand context: either the complement is to the left, as above, or it is missing altogether, as in This PEON @SUBJ 00 is ✓ 0MV C the DET 0>N MAINCO house N @SC 0/ she PRON @SUBJ was ✓ 0AUX",
        "Ellipsis and coordination often co-occur.",
        "For instance, if finite clauses are coordinated, the verb is often left out from the non-first coordinates:",
        "Here, and Tolstoy her greatest novelist is granted a clause status, as indicated by the presence of the iterative clause boundary marker `@/'.",
        "Note that clausal constructions without a main verb do not get a function tag because at present the clause function tag is attached to the main verb.",
        "If the ellipsis co-occurs with coordination, then the presence of the coordinator in the beginning of the elliptical construction (i.e. to the right of the iterative clause boundary marker `©/') may be a sufficient clue to the function tag: it is to the left, in the first coordinate.",
        "Verbless constructions also occur in simplex constructions.",
        "Consider the following real-text example:",
        "In the analysis of if necessary, there is a subject complement tag for necessary.",
        "Subject complements typically occur in clauses; clauses in general are assigned a syntactic function in our description; here, however, no such analysis is given due to the lack of a main verb.",
        "Nevertheless, in this type of verbless construction there is a lexical marker in the beginning: a subordinating conjunction or a WH word, and from this we can imply that the verbless construction functions as an adverbial.",
        "An alternative strategy for dealing with the functional analysis of verbless constructions would be the assignment of clause-function tags also to nominal and adverbial heads.",
        "This would increase the amount of ambiguity at the outset, but on the other hand this new ambiguity would be easily controllable: a clausal construction serves only one function at a time in our description, and this restriction can be easily formalised in the finite-state grammar formalism.",
        "Next, let us consider the description of prepositional phrases.",
        "In general, the present grammar tries to distinguish here between the adverbial function (@ADVL) and the postmodifier function (@N<).",
        "In the following somewhat contrived sentence, the distinction is straightforward to make in some cases.",
        "The phrase with difficulty is an unambiguous adverbial because it is directly preceded by a verb, which do not take postmodifiers.",
        "Likewise, with a telescope and of honor are unambiguously postmodifiers: the former because postnominal prepositional phrases without a verb in the left-hand context are postmodifiers; the latter because a postnominal of-phrase is always a postmodifier unless the left-hand",
        "context contains a member of a limited class of verbs like 'consist' and 'accuse' which take an of-phrase as a complement.",
        "On the contrary, with the binoculars is a problem case: generally postnominal prepositional phrases with a verb in the left-hand context are ambiguous due to the postmodifier and adverbial functions.",
        "Furthermore, several such ambiguous prepositional phrases can occur in a clause at once, so in combination they can produce quite many grammatically acceptable analyses for a sentence.",
        "To avoid this uncomfortable situation, an underspecific tag has been introduced: a prepositional phrase is described unambiguously as @ADVL/N< if it occurs in a context legitimate for adverbials and postmodifiers i.e., all other functions of prepositional phrases are disallowed in this context (with the exception of of-phrases).",
        "In all other contexts @AD VL/N< is disallowed.",
        "This solution may appear clumsy, e.g. a new tag is introduced for the purpose, but its advantage is that description can take full benefit of the unambiguous `easy' cases without paying the penalty of unmanageable ambiguity as a price for the extra information.",
        " – Overall, this kind of practise may be useful in the treatment of certain other ambiguities as well.",
        "In this section we have examined the new tag scheme and how it responds to our two main requirements: the requirement of structural resolvability (cf. our treatment of premodifiers and prepositional phrases) and expressiveness of surface-syntactic relations (witness e.g. the manner in which the application of the Uniqueness principle as well as the description of clause distributions was made easier by extending the description).",
        "It goes without saying that even the present annotation will leave some ambiguities structurally unresolvable.",

        "Although the present system contains a powerful mechanism for expressing heuristic rules that can be used for ranking alternative analyses, the satisfactory treatment of ambiguities like this one seems to require some further adjustment of the tag scheme, e.g. further underspecification – something like our description of attachment ambiguities of prepositional phrases.",
        "5 Ambiguity resolution with a finite-state parser In a parsing system where all potential analyses are provided in the input to the parser, there is bound to be a considerable amount of ambiguity as the description becomes more distinctive.",
        "Consider the following sentence, 39 words in length: A pressure lubrication system is employed, the pump, driven from the distributor shaft extension, drawing oil from the sump through a strainer and distributing it through the cartridge oil filter to a main gallery in the cylinder block casting.",
        "If only part-of-speech ambiguities are presented, there are 10 million sentence readings.",
        "If each boundary between each word or punctuation mark is made four-ways ambiguous due to the word and clause boundary readings, the overall number of sentence readings gets as high as 1032 readings.",
        "If all syntactic ambiguities are added, the sentence representation contains 1066 sentence readings.",
        "Regarded in isolation, each word in the sentence is 1-70 ways ambiguous.",
        "If we try to enumerate all 1066 readings and discard them one by one, the work is far too huge to be done.",
        "But we do not have to do it that way.",
        "Next we show that in fact the number of readings does not alone predict parsing complexity.",
        "We show that if we adopt a powerful rule formalism and an accurate grammar, which is also effectively applied, a lot of ambiguity can be resolved in a very short time.",
        "We have seen above that very accurate analysis of running text can be achieved with a knowledge-based approach.",
        "Characteristic of such a system is the possibility to refer to grammatical categories at various levels of description within an arbitrarily long sentence context.",
        " – Regarding the viability of essentially statistical systems, the current experience is that employing a window of more than two or three words requires excessively hard computing.",
        "Another problem is that even acquiring collocation matrices based on e.g. four-grams or five-grams requires tagged corpora much larger than the current manually validated tagged ones are.",
        "Also, mispredic-tions, which are a very common problem for statistical analysers, tend to bring in the accumulation effect: more mispredictions are likely to occur at later stages of analysis.",
        "Therefore we do not have any reason to use unsure probabilistic information as long as we can use our more reliable linguistic knowledge.",
        "Our rules can be considered as constraints that discard some illegitimate readings.",
        "When we apply",
        "rules one by one, the number of these readings decreases, and, if possible, in the end we have only one reading left.",
        "In addition to the ordinary 'absolute' rules, the grammar can also contain separate 'heuristic' rules, which can be used for ranking remaining multiple readings.",
        "We represent sentences as finite state automata.",
        "This makes it possible to store all relevant sentence readings in a compact way.",
        "We also compile each grammar rule into a finite state automaton.",
        "Each rule automaton can be regarded as a constraint that accepts some readings and rejects some.",
        "For example, consider the subject rule presented in Section 3.",
        "We can apply a rule like that on the sentence and, as a result, get an automaton that accepts all the sentence readings that are correct according to the rule.",
        "After this, our 1066–ways ambiguous sentence has, say, only some 1046 readings left.",
        "This means that in some fractions of a second,- the number of readings is reduced into a 1/1000000000000000000000th part.",
        "All of these remaining readings are accepted by the applied rule.",
        "Next, we can apply another rule, and so on.",
        "The following rules will not probably reduce as many ambiguities as the first one, but they will reduce the ambiguity to some 'acceptable' level quite fast.",
        "This means that we cannot consider some sentences as un-parsable just because they may initially contain a lot of ambiguity (say, 10100 readings).",
        "The real method we use is not as trivial as this, actually.",
        "The method presented above can rather be regarded as a declarative approach to applying the rules than as a description of a practical parser.",
        "A recent version of the parser combines several methods.",
        "First, it decreases the amount of ambiguity with some groups of carefully selected rules, as we described above.",
        "Then all other rules are applied together.",
        "This method seems [Tapanainen, 1992] to provide a faster parser than more straightforward methods.",
        "Let us consider the different methods.",
        "In the first one we intersect a rule automaton with a sentence automaton and then we take another rule automaton that we intersect with the previous intermediate result, and so, on until all (relevant) rules have been applied.",
        "This method takes much time as we can see in the following table.",
        "The second method is like the first one but the rule automata have been ordered before processing: the most efficient rules are applied first.",
        "This ordering seems to make parsing faster.",
        "In the third method we process all rules together and the fourth method is the one that is suggested above.",
        "The last method is like the fourth one but also extra information is used to direct the parsing.",
        "It seems to be quite sufficient for parsing.",
        "Before parsing commences, we can also use two methods for reducing the number of rule automata.",
        "Firstly, because the rules are represented as automata, a set of them can be easily combined using intersection of automata during the rule compilation phase.",
        "Secondly, typically not all rules are needed in parsing because the rule may be about some category that is not even present in the sentence.",
        "We have a quick method for selecting rules in runtime.",
        "These optimization techniques improve parsing times considerably.",

        "It seems to us that it is the nature of the grammar rules, rather than the amount of the ambiguity itself, that determines the hardness of ambiguity resolution.",
        "It is quite easy to write a grammar that is extremely hard to apply even for simple sentence with a small amount of ambiguity.",
        "Therefore parsing problems that come up from using more or less incomplete grammars do not necessarily tell us about parsing text with a comprehensive grammar.",
        "Parsing problems due to ambiguity seem to dissolve if we have access to a more expressive grammatical representation; witness our experiences with morphological disambiguation using the two approaches discussed above.",
        "We do not need to hesitate to use features that we consider useful in our grammatical description.",
        "The amount of ambiguity itself is not what enables or disables parsing.",
        "More important is that we have an effective grammar and parser that interact with each other in a sensible way, i.e. we should not try to kill mosquitos with artillery or to move mountains",
        "with a spoon.",
        "The ambiguity that is introduced has to be relevant for the grammar, not unmotivated or structurally unresolvable ambiguity, but ambiguity that provides us with information we need to resolve other ambiguities."
