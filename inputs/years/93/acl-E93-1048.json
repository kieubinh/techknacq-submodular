        "arguments and modifiers, numerous researchers have proposed accounts of this, the problem of ASPEC-TUAL COMPOSITION.",
        "Of course, the ultimate aims of these studies have never been to determine the aspectual class of an expression per se – clearly a theory-internal notion – but rather to predict the outcomes of certain aspect-related syntactic and semantic tests (cf. Dowty, 1979, Verkuyl, 1989).",
        "Likewise, the present paper focuses on these empirical issues, in particular the compatibility of a given expression with for and in-adverbials and the resulting existential and downward entailments.",
        "As an example of this temporal adverbial test, consider (1) below:",
        "(1) (a) John drank beer {for * (b) John drank a pint of beer ten minutes.",
        "In example (1) we may observe that the appropriate temporal adverbial is determined by the object of the verb drink – at least as long as we exclude from consideration iterative, partitive, and other non-basic readings (cf. Moens and Steedman, 1988).",
        "Central to previous approaches to aspectual composition have been attempts to explain the puzzling parallels between count noun phrases and telic sentences on the one hand, which have inherently \"delimited\" extents, and mass nouns, bare plurals, and atelic sentences on the other, which do not.",
        "In connection with this intuitive notion of delimitedness, it has often been observed that mass terms (e.g. beer) and bare plurals (e.g. margaritas) are similar to atelic expressions (e.g. John drink beer / margaritas), insofar as they share the property of REFERENTIAL HOMOGENEITY (reviewed below).",
        "This sets",
        "them apart from count noun phrases (eg.",
        "a pint of beer) and telic expressions (e.g. John drink a pint of beer), which do not generally do so.",
        "Observations such as these led Dowty (1979), Hin-richs (1985) and Krifka (1989, 1992) to incorporate various tests for referential homogeneity into their logical forms in order to account for the temporal adverbial variations.",
        "I argue against this move here by showing that it engenders a problem which I shall call THE ACCIDENTAL REFERENTIAL HOMOGENEITY PROBLEM (defined below).",

        "The account is argued to be superior not only on empirical grounds, insofar as it dissolves this particular problem, but also on computational grounds, insofar as it justifies employing a feature-based approach.",

        "REFERENTIAL HOMOGENEITY is the conjunction of the properties of REFERENTIAL DIVISIVENESS and REFERENTIAL CUMULATIVITY.",
        "An expression refers divisively if whenever it applies to a given entity, it also applies to all subentities of that entity, down to a certain limit in size.",
        "For example, if there is a material entity to which beer applies, then beer also applies to all its (macroscopic) subparts; the same is clearly not true of a pint of beer.",
        "Cumulativity works in the other direction: an expression refers cumulatively if whenever it applies to two entities, it also applies to their collection.",
        "Here again, if we collect two entities to which beer applies then we get something to which beer also applies; in contrast, if we collect two entities to which a pint of beer applies, we get an entity to which two pints of beer applies instead.",
        "Similarly, we may observe that the atelic expression John drink beer refers homogeneously to situational entities (eventualities), unlike the telic expression John drink a pint of beer.",
        "With these properties in mind, THE ACCIDENTAL REFERENTIAL HOMOGENEITY PROBLEM may be stated as follows: some expressions which on intuitive and syntactic grounds should be in the heterogeneous class \"happen\" to refer homogeneously (cf. Schubert and Pelletier 1989).",
        "This problem has been noted in passing by Mittwoch (1982), Moens (1987), and Krifka (1989), but to my knowledge has not been systematically addressed by those focusing on the semantics of aspect.",
        "The easiest examples to construct involve lexical or quantificational vagueness, though more insidious examples exist involving self-similar objects.",
        "For instance, consider Mittwoch's example below:",
        "(2) John wrote something in ten minutes which it took me half an hour to translate.",
        "The problem here is that the expression John write something refers homogeneously, but nevertheless combines with an in-adverbial – if there is an event of John writing something, then all the subevents of that event (down to a certain limit in size) will also be events of John writing something (albeit not the same thing), and thus the expression refers divisively; similar considerations show that it refers cumulatively as well.",
        "To take another example, consider the following sentence:",
        "(3) John typed a sequence of characters in thirty seconds (which it took me two minutes to write by hand).",
        "In (3) the problem is that subsequences of characters are also sequences of characters (albeit different ones), and thus the expression John type a sequence of characters happens to refer homogeneously too.",
        "Since the indicated expressions in (2) and (3) turn out referentially homogeneous rather than heterogeneous, their compatibility with in-adverbials (and not for-adverbials) is problematic for the theories of Dowty, Hinrichs and Krifka.1 Now, as an alternative to the present approach, one might want to consider basing an account of this problem on differing scope possibilities for the expressions which \"accidentally\" and \"truly\" refer homogeneously – that is, to somehow allow for different subquantities of beer but not different subsequences of characters.",
        "A serious problem for any such approach, however, is the existence of readings where the temporal adverbial has wide scope, as in (4): 'Showing this in detail is beyond the scope of the present paper.",
        "For a more detailed exposition of this problem as it relates to Krifka's theory, see White (1993).",
        "(4) Amazingly, John replied to every new email message in under two hours.",
        "The availability of such wide scope readings does not seem compatible with the idea of requiring the quantified phrase to outscope the temporal adverbial, which would seem to be necessary in order to (always) correctly predict the appropriate temporal adverbial by means of a referential homogeneity test.",
        "Beyond the empirical problems engendered by referential homogeneity tests, there appear to be significant computational ones as well.",
        "From the generation standpoint, it seems quite unreasonable to test whether any or all subevents of an event to be described happen to meet the same description before choosing a temporal adverbial to convey duration.",
        "Likewise, from the standpoint of interpretation, if one is to make use of aspectual information in processing successive sentences in discourse (as in the theories of Hinrichs, 1986, Moens and Steedman, 1988, and Lascarides and Asher, 1991, for example), there is equally little time for performing such tests.2"

        "Briefly, the system takes a set of landmark locations (which are assumed to remain constant) and an input string from which it derives all possible logical forms for the given sentences; it then extracts a set of constraint equations from the derived logical forms and solves them according to a best-value metric.",

        "According to this metric, an event such as Guy running to the bar takes a default amount of time according to the distance and the median rate; however, an event of Guy running to the bar in n minutes may take less time if this duration is less than the default at least up to the point where the specified duration requires exceeding the given maximum running rate, thus making the constraint equations unsatisfiable.",
        "Likewise, an event of Guy running along the river (towards the bar, say) for n minutes will yield a default distance according to the amount of time and the median rate; this distance may vary according to more demanding distance requirements imposed by succeeding sentences, again up to a certain point.",
