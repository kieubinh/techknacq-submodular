        "Automatic sense disambiguation has been recognised by the research community as very important for a number of natural language processing applications like information retrieval, machine translation, or speech recognition.",
        "This paper describes experiments with an algorithm for lexical sense disambiguation, that is, predicting which of many possible senses of a word is intended in a given sentence.",
        "The definitions of senses of a given word are those used in LDOCE, the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English [Procter et at., 1978].",
        "The algorithm first assigns a set of meanings or senses drawn from LDOCE to each word in the given sentence, and then chooses the combination of word-senses (one for each word in the sentence), yielding the maximum semantic overlap.",
        "The metric of semantic overlap is based on the fact that LDOCE sense definitions are made in terms of the Longman Defining Vocabulary, effectively a (large) set of semantic primitives.",
        "Since the problem of finding the word-sense-chain with maximum overlap can be viewed as a specialised example of the class of constraint-based optimisation problems for which Constraint Handling In Prolog (CHIP) was designed, we have chosen to implement our algorithm in CHIP."

        "LDOCE's important feature is that its definitions (and examples) are written in a controlled vocabulary of 2187 words.",
        "A definition is therefore always written in simpler terms than the word it describes.",
        "These 2187 words effectively constitute semantic primitives, and any particular word-sense is defined by a set of these primitives.",
        "Several researchers have been experimented with lexical disambiguation using MRDs, including [Lesk, 1986; Wilks et al., 1989; McDonald et al., 1990; Veronis and Ide, 1990; Guthrie et al., 1991; Guthrie et al., 1992].",
        "Lesk's technique decides the correct sense of a word by counting the overlap between a dictionary sense definition (of the word to be disambiguated) and the definitions of the nearby words in the phrase.",
        "Performance (using brief experimentation) was reported 50-70% and the results *This work was supported by the Greek Employment Manpower Organisation (OAED), Ministry of Labour, as part of an 1991-93 scholarship scheme.",
        "were roughly comparable between Webster's 7th Collegiate, Collins English Dictionary and Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary of Current English.",
        "Methods based on co-occurence statistics have been used by [Wilks et al., 1989; McDonald et al., 1990; Guthrie et al., 1991].",
        "By co-occurence is meant the preference two words appear together in the same context.",
        "[Wilks et al., 1989] computed lexical neighbourhoods for all the words of the controlled vocabulary of LDOCE.",
        "This neighbourhood information is used for partitioning the words according to the senses they correspond to in order to make a classification of the senses.",
        "Their results for using occurences of the word bank were about 53% for the classification of each instance into one of the thirteen sense definitions of LDOCE and 85-90% into one of the more general coarse meanings.",
        "Neighbourhoods were used by [McDonald et al., 1990] for expanding the word sense definitions.",
        "The union of neighbourhoods is then intersected with the local context and the largest overlap gives the most likely sense.",
        "A similar technique is used by [Guthrie et al., 1991] except that they define neighbourhoods according to subject categories (i.e engineering, economic etc.)",
        "based on the subject code markings of the on-line version of LDOCE.",
        "Closer to the work we describe in this paper is [Guthrie et al., 1992]'s. They try to deal with large-scale text data disambiguation problems.",
        "Their method is based on the idea that the correct meaning of a complete phrase should be extracted by concurrent evaluation of sets of senses for the words to be disambiguated.",
        "They count the overlap between sense definitions of the words of the sentence as they appear in the on-line version of LDOCE.",
        "The problem is that the number of sense combinations increases rapidly if the sentence contains ambiguous words having a considerable number of sense definitions in LDOCE (say that word A has X different senses in LDOCE, B has Y and C has Z, then the number of possible sense combinations of the phrase ABC is X*Y*Z, e.g if X=Y=Z=10 sense definitions for each word then we have 1000 possible sense combinations).",
        "Simulated annealing is used by [Guthrie et al., 1992] to reduce the search space and find an optimal (or near-optimal) solution without generating and evaluating all possible solutions, or pruning the search space and testing a well-defined subspace of reasonable candidate solutions.",
        "The success of their algorithm is reported 47% at sense level and 72% at homograph level using 50 example sentences",
        "from LDOCE."

        "In addition, classes of built-in predicates over finite domain variables exist for: (1) arithmetic and symbolic constraints (basic constraints for domain variables), (2) choice predicates (help making choices), (3) higher order predicates (providing optimisation methods for combinatorial problems using depth-first and branch and bound strategies) and (4) extra-logical predicates (for help in debugging processes).",

        "It is typical in work of this kind that researchers use human choices for the words or sentences to disambiguate and the senses they will attempt to recognise [Guthrie, 1993].",
        "In most of the cases [Hearst, 1991; McDonald et al., 1990; Guthrie et al., 1991; Guthrie et al., 1992], the number of test sentences is rather small (less than 50) so that no exact comparison between different methods can be done.",
        "Our tests included a set of 20 sentences, from sentences cited in an NLP textbook [Harris, 1985] (used to illustrate non-MRD-based semantic disambiguation techniques) example sentences cited in [Guthrie et al., 1992; Lesk, 1986; Hearst, 1991] (for comparison between different lexical disambiguation routines) and examples taken from LDOCE (to assess the algorithm's performance with example sentences of particular senses in the dictionary-this might also be a way of testing the consistency of the relationship between different senses and their corresponding examples of a word in LDOCE).",

        "This indicates that if the algorithm was combined with a word-tagger such as CLAWS [Atwell, 1983; Leech, 1983], and lexical senses were constrained to those allowed by the word-tags predicted by CLAWS, the success rate could rise to 66%.",

        "We could try producing a much larger testbed for further comparative evaluations; but it is not clear how large this would have to be to become authoritative as an application-independent metric.",
        "Future enhancements to the approach incorporating the automatic use of the on-line subject codes and cross reference and subcategorisation systems of LDOCE can provide better results.",
        "Concerning CHIP, it provides a platform from which we can build in order to deal with large scale disambiguation; this could be used as an alternative to numerical optimisation techniques.",
        "The approach will involve the modelling of the problem in a combinatorial form so that constraint satisfaction logic programming [Van Hentenryck, 1989] can apply.",
        "For each sense of a word we can specify a set of constraints such as its subject code(s), or part-of-speech information or both.",
        "Forward checkable (or lookahead) rules can be introduced to decrease the number of possible senses of other words in advance (say, for example, that the 'economic' sense for the word 'bank' has been chosen, then only the 'economic' or 'neutral' senses of the 'arrange', 'overdraft' and 'account' will be taken into account).",
        "This suggests a dramatic reduction on the search space; CHIP offers all the necessary arithmetic and symbolic facilities for the implementation.",
        "Our experiments will be based on the use the machine version of LDOCE to verify the utility of this dictionary for the specific kind of applications we have in mind: the development methods and techniques that can assist large scale speech and handwriting recognition systems using semantic knowledge from already available resources (MRDs and corpora) [Atwell et al., 1992].",
