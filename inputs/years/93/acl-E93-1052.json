        "An alternative approach will be proposed; it is based on the idea that the arguments of a verb which is governed by an auxiliary or clitic climbing trigger verb can be raised to become arguments of the governor by a mechanism that achieves an effect similar to functional composition as developed within the tradition of Categorial Grammar.",

        "There are arguments similar to the ones proposed by [Miller, 1992a] for French showing that Italian clitics exhibit many properties that make them very similar to inflectional affixes; the arguments are mainly based on [Zwicky and Pullum, 1983].",
        "The coordination criteria proposed by [Miller, 1992b] can also be used to support this position.",
        "Italian clitics exhibit a high degree of selection with respect to their host; they can only attach to verbs.",
        "They present arbitrary gaps in their combination, since not all the combinations are allowed, behaving therefore like affixes; in particular, it is not possible to have a first or second person accusative clitic together with a dative one.",
        "Italian clitics also exhibit morphophonological idiosyncrasies: vowel deletion occurs when clitics like lo and la occur in front of a vowel initial stem.",
        "This applies also to mi, ti, ci, vi, li and si; but mainly in *Supported by a grant from the Center for Language Studies (CLS).",
        "spoken language.",
        "Certain changes also occur when more than one clitic is present, namely the final i of a clitic is changed into e if it is followed by another clitic which begins with 1 or n. Sequencing of identical clitics is not permitted in Italian, therefore certain changes occur as in the combination of two si or of two vi where one becomes ci.",
        "Furthermore, if the third person dative feminine clitic le precedes a clitic beginning with 1 or n-, the masculine dative form gli is used instead of the feminine one.",
        "Other evidence for the affixal status of clitics comes from coordination.",
        "Italian clitics cannot have wide scope over coordination of verbs; the following is not possible:",
        "(1) * Maria lo comprera' e leggera' Maria cl.",
        "(acc) will buy and will read",
        "`Maria will buy and read it' The clitic should be repeated in front of each verb behaving like an affix according to the coordination criterium developed by [Miller, 1992b].",
        "Italian clitics are rigidly ordered in a flat clitic cluster, adhering to the following ordering:",
        "(2) Clitics order in Italian",
        "mi < [3 per.dat.]",
        "< vi < ti < ci < si refl.",
        "< [3 per.acc] < si imp.",
        "< me Rigid ordering of elements has often been related to the status of morphological affix.",
        "The data presented above show evidence in favour of an analysis of Italian pronominal clitics as inflectional affixes;' this will be the assumption underlying both of the analyses which will be presented in the following sections.",
        "As already mentioned above, Italian clitics cluster around the verb; they precede it if the verb is finite and follow it if the verb is non-finite or an imperative.",
        "If there is an auxiliary, the clitic doesn't attach to the verb that subcategorizes for it, but cliticizes to the auxiliary as in:",
        "(3) Maria 1' ha mangiato Maria cl.",
        "(acc) has eaten",
        "`Maria has eaten it' 'Italian claim can appear both in proclitic and in en-clitic position; it could be argued that this alternation is not typical of affixes.",
        "Data from Afar, Swazi and Arabic show that in these languages there are dual position affixes.",
        "If in the main clause there is a restructuring verb [Rizzi, 1982], namely a verb which belongs to one of the following classes: modals, temporal aspectu-als, pure motion verbs, the clitic can attach to the main verb, but it can also attach to the verb in the embedded sentence:",

        "(acc) wants to buy",
        "`Maria wants to buy it' b. Maria vuole comprarlo Maria wants to buy cl.",
        "(acc) `Maria wants to buy it' If there is more than one verb that belongs to one of the classes mentioned above, the clitic can attach to the lower verb or climb to the middle position or all the way up.",
        "Since clitic climbing is triggered by the restructuring verbs, the following will be ungrammatical because the main verb does not belong to this class: (5) * Maria lo decide di leggere Maria cl.",
        "(acc) decides to read `Maria decides to read it' As for their distribution, Italian clitics are in complementary distribution with full phrases as complements of a lexical head; so a sentence like the following will not be grammatical:2",

        "Furthermore, the information that the clitic will appear at some point in the tree must be encoded if a verb that triggers clitic climbing is present.",
        "A lexical rule can be used for this purpose;4 it will operate on the subcategorization list, removing the slot related to the relevant full complement and adding a nonlocal feature OC (object clitic) which encodes case and agreement information of the clitic.",

        "However, the mechanism as it has been sketched so far will overgenerate allowing clitic climbing also with verbs that do not trigger it; a sentence like (5) will be accepted.",

        "to make the right predictions, namely the percolation of the feature must be stopped if there is a verb that doesn't trigger clitic climbing and must be allowed if there is a verb that triggers clitic climbing.",
        "It seems therefore that this approach doesn't naturally capture the fact that clitic climbing is triggered only by a specific class of verbs since constraints need to be imposed to obtain this result.",

        "An account in terms of template morphology as in [Simpson and Withgott, 1986] could handle the rigid ordering of the clitics and the restrictions in combination.",
        "As discussed above, clitics and full complements are in complementary distribution in Italian: the clitic should fill the relevant slot in the subcategorization requirements so that no full complement can occur.",
        "On the assumption that clitics behave like inflectional affixes and not as syntactically independent elements, it is necessary to have a way to remove the subcategorization slot related to the full complement if a clitic is present.",
        "The Valence principle, which is the principle of the grammar responsible for checking off subcategorization requirements that have been satisfied, cannot be used in this case since the clitic doesn't have the status of a syntactic element.5 A lexical rule (LRCL1) can be used instead; namely given a verb that subcategorizes for a certain argument, the argument is removed from the subcategorization list but the equivalent clitic must be present, attached to the verb as proposed by [Miller and Sag, 1993] for French.",
        "The lexical rule triggers the presence of the clitic as verb inflection and acts as an interface to morphology.",
        "It should look roughly as follows:",

        "When clitics are involved in nonlocal dependencies, namely when the clitic attaches to a head which doesn't subcategorize for it, the argument raising comes into play in addition to LRCL1.",
        "This analysis will look at two cases where this situation arises: the case where an auxiliary verb is present and the case where a restructuring verb is present.",
        "In this treatment, auxiliaries and verbs that trigger clitic climbing subcategorize for a non-finite VP complement and for the complements of the VP; the construction of a partial VP must therefore be allowed.6 5 The analysis is carried out within the framework of Chapter 9 of [Pollard and Sag, 1993] which incorporates innovations due to Borsley [Borsley, 1987; Borsley, 1989].",
        "The analysis makes use of valence features which encode the subcategorization requirements of the sign.",

        "(Compare [Pollard, 1990]).",
        "Schema 2 describes phrases consisting of a lexical head daughter and any number of complement daughters.",

        "Sentence (12) will be correctly ruled out.",
        "The combination of a clitic with a past participle cannot be ruled out in general in Italian, since the following sentence is grammatical: (13) Vistolo, fu facile decidere Seenpast.part cl., was easy to decide `Having seen him, it was easy to decide' It is only when the past participle combines with the auxiliary that the clitic must attach to the latter.",
        "As for semantic role assignment, it proceeds in a very straightforward way.",

        "If a clitic is present, it will be assigned semantic role and case through the link created via structure sharing.",
