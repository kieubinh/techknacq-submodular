        "We present in this paper a morphological analyzer and generator for French that contains a dictionary of 700,000 inflected words called DELAF', and a full two-level system aimed at the analysis of new derivatives.",
        "Hence, this tool recognizes and generates both correct inflected forms of French simple words (DELAF lookup procedure) and new derivatives and their inflected forms (two-level analysis).",
        "Moreover, a clear distinction is made between dictionary lookup processes and new words analyses in order to clearly identify the analyses that involve heuristic rules.",
        "We tested this tool upon a French corpus of 1,300,000 words with significant results (Clemenceau D. 1992).",
        "With regards to efficiency, since this tool is compiled into a unique transducer, it provides a very fast lookup procedure (1,100 words per second) at a low memory cost (around 1.3 Mb in RAM).",
        "2 Description of the analyzer We first built the transducer representing all the entries of DELAF along with their inflectionnal code.",
        "Each entry defines a partial function, as in:",
        "which corresponds to the first person plural in the present tense of the verb inculper (to charge someone).",
        "The union of these 700,000 partial functions leads to the transducer DELAF stored in 1Mb with a lookup procedure of 1,100 words per second.",
        "The 70 two-level rules that describe the way characters are changed when prefixes or suffixes are added to words are themselves transducers (Karttunen et al., 1992).",
        "The two following two-level rules generate the two surface forms canculper and co-inculper when adding the prefix co to the verb inculper: i:I <#.",
        "c o -:0 * i:i G c o * These 70 transducers have been merged into the transducer Rules by performing an intersection.",
        "The two transducers above have been merged with four different DAGs, Pref, Suf, DEGAS and DELAF A, representing respectively a list of prefixes, a list of suffixes, the list of canonical forms (infmitive form of a verb for instance) and the whole list of the 700,000 inflected forms appearing in DELAF through the following formula: 1DELAF stands for Electronic Dictionary of Inflected Forms of the LADL (Courtois, 1990).",

        "• DELAF A) n Rules) o (Id(Pref • DELAF)]2",
        "This operation leads to the transducer of 1.3Mb with a lookup procedure of 1,100 words per second, a sample of which is given in the following figure:"
