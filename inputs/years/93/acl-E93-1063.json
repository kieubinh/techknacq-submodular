        "The main aim of the ET-10/75 project, 'Collocations and the Lexicalisation of Semantic Operations'', is to evaluate the use of Mel'euk's analysis of collocations in terms of lexical functions2 , as an interlingua device in a machine translation system.",
        "In this poster we only point out the main design issues involved in encoding the essential parts of this analysis in an HPSG-style framework.",
        "Other aspects of the project, such as the definition of collocations, or the evaluation of the analysis as such, will not be dealt with.",
        "The linguistic analysis of collocations (as far as it is dealt with in this poster) involves two major issues.",

        "Examples of the collocational structures we have in mind are strong criticism (as an adjective-noun combination) and give a demonstration (as a verb-noun combination).",
        "The essential characteristics we want to account for in our analysis are the following.",
        "• The collocational cooccurrence restriction.",
        "• The dependence of the meaning of the collocate on the combination.",
        "• The relation between the 'collocate occurrence' of a word and its free occurrence.",
        "Following Mel'euk, the restricted choice of the particular adjective or verb is represented in the dictionary by means of lexical functions.",
        "The dictionary entry for criticism contains a section in which its 'collocates' are listed, indexed by a lexical function.",
        "In this case, we would find:.",
        "Magn(criticism) = strong.",
        "This points out that you can use strong when you want to express Magn(criticism).",
        "In our interpretation of these lexical functions, we take them to be general semantic operations, representing the major semantic contribution of the collocate.",
        "So we say that strong means Magn (= very, intense ...) in the context of criticism.",
        "As far as translation is concerned, we no longer need a transfer rule mapping 'strong criticism' on 'We would hereby like to acknowledge the financial support by the Commission of the European Community, Association Suissetra (Geneva) and Oxford University Press.",
        "2See for instance [MePtuk and Zolkovsky, 1988].",
        "`scherpe kritiek' (lit.",
        "sharp criticism) because if both are analyzed as the interlingual Magn, we can leave the correct choice of adjective to the monolingual components.",
        "The HPSG grammars we are using, closely resemble the proposals in [Pollard and Sag, 1987].",
        "As far as the coding of the lexical functions is concerned, we have simply interpreted these as relation names."

        "Besides the use of a Mel'eukian analysis and the choice of an HPSG-style grammar, one of the design criteria that has guided the representation is to be `minimally redundant'.",
        "This has led to the following solution.",
        "• The collocate is only specified by a partial lexical entry, which is a generalization of its 'freeoccurring' counterpart (its meaning is left unspecified, for instance).",
        "• In the lexicon, it is specified on the base which collocates it selects for a particular lexical function.",
        "The remainder of the collocation specific information about the collocate is specified here as well.",
        "The following is part of the entry for criticism to illustrate the latter issue.",
        "The COL field provides the information that to express Magn(criticism), it can combine with strong.",
