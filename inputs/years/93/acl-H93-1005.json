        "Most features are common to the two maps, but not all, and the participants were informed of this.",
        "One map had a route drawn in, the other did not.",
        "The task was for the participant without the route to draw one on the basis of discussion with the participant with the route."

        "Using an elaboration of a design developed over a number of years (see e.g. Brown, Anderson et al.",
        "1983), we recorded 128 two-person conversations (each talker in four conversations), employing 64 talkers (32 male, 32 female), almost all born and raised in the Glasgow area, speaking with an educated West of Scotland accent.",
        "High quality recordings were made using Shure SM10A close-talking microphones, one talker per channel on stereo DAT (Sony DTC1000ES).",
        "The experimental design is quite detailed and complex, allowing a number of different phonemic, syntactico-semantic and pragmatic contrasts to be explored in a controlled way.",
        "In particular, maps and feature names were designed to allow for controlled exploration of phonological reductions of various kinds in a number of different referential contexts, and to provide a range of different stimuli to referent negotiation, based on matches and mismatches between the two maps.",
        "Among the independent variables in the design were:",
        "• Eye-contact – in half the conversations, the participants could see one another's faces, in half, they could not.",
        "• Familiarity – in half the conversations, the talkers were acquaintances, in half, strangers.",
        "• Task role – Each talker participated in four conversations, two as Instruction Giver (the one with the route) and two as Instruction Follower (the one trying to draw it)",

        "Subjects accommodated easily to the task and experimental setting, and produced evidently unselfconscious and fluent speech.",

        "The total corpus runs about 18 hours of speech, yielding 150,000 word tokens drawn from 2,000 word form types.",
        "Word lists containing all the feature names were also elicited from all speakers, along with a number of 'accent di-agnosis' utterances.",
        "The acoustic quality of the recordings is good but not outstanding – in particular, stereo separation is not perfect, in that it is often possible to detect the voice of one talker very faintly on the other talker's channel.",
        "A very modest amount of rumble and other non-specific background noise is occasionally detectable."

        "Although the full complexity of overlapped regions has not been reflected in the transcriptions, such regions are clearly set off from the rest of the transcripts.",
        "Transcripts are connected to the acoustic sampled data by sample numbers marked every few turns.",
        "Text Encoding Initiative-compliant SGML markup is used, both within transcripts to indicate turn boundaries and for other meta-textual purposes, and also in separate corpus header and transcript header files, but this was done in a manner designed to make accessing the transcripts as plain text very easy.",
        "We also used a very lightweight non-TEI markup for textual annotations, to mark such things as abandoned words, letter names, filled pauses and editorial uncertainties.",
        "A brief extract from a transcript is given below as Figure 1, illustrating various aspects of the transcription, including the tags u for utterance, s f o for speech file offset, bo for begin overlap and eo for end overlap, as well as the 1e microtag for a letter name.",
        "<u who=G n=3> <sfo samp=107715> <bo id=o75a> About half an inch above it, we've got an {lelx} marking start.",

        "Recorded collections of natural conversation are not new – not only do many linguists have a drawer full of tapes of dinner table or staff room talk, but also more systematic and extensive collection efforts have been carried out on several occasions as part of major reference corpora building projects.",
        "But with no exceptions we are aware of, all such material is of highly varying acoustic quality, and is rarely if ever suitable for extensive computational processing.",
        "On the other hand, to date the large development corpora collected and used to such good effect by the speech recognition community, although of a very high standard acoustically, have been exclusively monologue, and until very recently exclusively scripted.",
        "Thus the Map Task corpus occupies a hitherto vacant position in corpus design space – it is natural, unscripted dialogue recorded to a standard suitable for digital processing.",
        "We hope the widespread availability of such a resource will help to stimulate a change in the way phonology, morphology, syntax and semantics are pursued parallel to the change which has already occurred in phonetics, that is, a change from theory development",
        "dependent on small amounts of data, often constructed by the theorist, to theory development dependent on, indeed immersed within, a large amount of naturally occurring data.",

        "The duration and/or (excerpted) intelligibility of different tokens of a word uttered by the same speaker have been shown to depend on the availability of information outwith the word's acoustic shape which might help listeners to recognize it.",
        "In the context of extended discourse, this means word tokens are less intelligible when they refer to Given entities.",
        "On the face of it, the tendency to produce degraded tokens where they are redundant seems wonderfully cooperative, in the Gricean sense of the term: when there is previous relevant material, intelligibility is reduced.",
        "The less intelligible repeated tokens are in fact helpful to listeners, for they make better prompts to earlier discourse material, either because they signal listeners to associate the word's meaning with some entity already established in a discourse model (Fowler and Housum, 1987) or because such stored information must be called into play for successful on-line word recognition (Bard et al., 1991).",
        "The difficulty is that degraded tokens are not restricted to contexts in which the listener can recover the conditioning information.",
        "Using the Map Task corpus, we have begun to investigate how far speakers' adjustment of intelligibility is egocentrically rather than cooperatively based, that is, how far the speaker's own relevant knowledge provides his/her model for what the listener knows.",
        "We have found the expected loss of intelligibility for excerpted second mentions as against both first mentions and citation forms.",
        "Interestingly, we found that the co-referential repetition effect found for monologue holds in dialogue: it doesn't matter who utters the word first.",
        "When it comes to the second mention of an entity either speaker may reduce intelligibility.",
        "This suggests that dialogue participants maintain a common record of textually evoked given entities.",
        "It would also appear that once an entity is textually evoked there is no further effect of visual information.",
        "That is, it doesn't matter whether the listener or speaker can see the object they're referring to.",
        "Also relevant is a significant intelligibility loss we found in mentions which are only `second' for the speaker, because the relevant feature was first mentioned not in the current conversation, but in a previous conversation with a different listener.",
        "Thus on the basis of our investigations to date it would appear, somewhat surprisingly, that speakers reduce articulatory effort on a purely egocentric basis, without regard to listeners' ability to share the contextual conditioning this implies."
