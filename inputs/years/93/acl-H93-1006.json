        "For best performance, natural language processing systems must be able to extract as much information as possible from their inputs, even inputs which cannot be fully processed.",
        "In order to do this, systems must be equipped with robust processing mechanisms.",
        "In addition, cases also occur in which the system has the ability to process an input, given sufficient time, but it is not desirable to allow unlimited amounts of processing time.",
        "In this paper we describe an approach to robust processing which is domain-independent in its general architecture, but which can be easily customized to particular domains by simply listing key words and/or key concepts.",
        "The approach uses the extensive grammar already available to the system for standard processing but augments it with a special BNF rule, called \"backup\", which is able to prune the wordstream while it searches for key concepts.",
        "Backup can be triggered either by a failure of normal parsing or by timing out.",
        "This approach has been implemented in two distinct domains.",
        "In one of these domains, when sufficient time is allotted to attain maximal performance, backup results in an 18% improvement in score.",
        "We describe the general approach, discuss how differences in the data in each domain lead to slightly different implementations, and discuss our results."

      "heading": "2. Approach",
      "text": [
        "The approach to robust processing which is described in this paper is implemented in the PUNDIT natural language processing system developed at Paramax Systems Corporation [6, 1].",
        "PUNDIT includes a domain-independent, top-down parser [7] which is the primary component involved in robust processing.",
        "The key feature of robust processing in PUNDIT is that the parser is allowed to skip over words when it is unable to find a parse using every word.",
        "Skipping is an appropriate strategy for the data in the two domains we are working with, because parsing failures tend to be due to extraneous material such as interpolated irrelevant comments and false starts.",
        "Another possible strategy, relaxation of constraints as suggested by [19], is less appropriate for the data we have examined, since few parsing failures are due to violation of grammatical constraints.",
        "Skipping over words has also been implemented in the robust parsing strategies of Seneff [15] and Strzalkowski [18]; our approach differs from these in that in addition to skipping, it provides a simple way of taking domain-specific knowledge into account in the skipping process.",
        "That is, when an analysis is not possible using every word, the system begins searching through the wordstream for keywords (or words denoting key concepts), which are simply listed in a file.",
        "The use of keywords permits the system to make use of the domain-specific knowledge that certain words or concepts are important in the domain.",
        "In fact, in a mature domain, the list of keywords and concepts can be automatically generated from the system's semantic interpretation rules.",
        "Because the backup mechanism is implemented by adding a single new BNF rule into the normal grammar, robust processing has been implemented in PUNDIT without losing the advantages of the broad-coverage syntactic grammar already in the system.",
        "This is in contrast to approaches like the template matcher discussed in [8] or the frame combiner discussed in [16] which are completely separate mechanisms from the standard linguistic processing components.",
        "In addition to inputs for which the system cannot find a parse using the standard algorithm, there are also cases where a complete analysis would be too costly in terms of time.",
        "The system can also invoke backup in these cases, using a variation of the timeout mechanism described in [17].",
        "The timeout mechanism in [17] allocates an absolute amount of time per sentence; in contrast, PUNDIT'S timeout allocates time as a function of the number of words in the input sentence so as not to penalize relatively longer sentences.",
        "Previous approaches to robust processing have typically either focused solely on data from one domain [8, 16, 15, 4] or have implemented a domain-independent approach [17].",
        "Both of these alternatives have disadvantages.",
        "Approaches which have been tested on only a single domain cannot be guaranteed to be extensible to other domains.",
        "Entirely new approaches may be required when the system is ported to another domain.",
        "On the other hand, the performance of domain-independent approaches may suffer in domain-specific applications because they are not able to use domain-specific knowledge to constrain the processing.",
        "Our approach differs from previous approaches in that, while the basic architecture is domain-independent, the approach also allows domain-specific knowledge to assist in the processing.",
        "We demonstrate the general applicability of the architecture by describing implementations in two distinct domains.",
        "Although the basic mechanism is the same in each domain, we also discuss differences in the implementation which follow from basic differences in the kind of data which must be processed."

        "If this input can be understood, possible applications will range from intelligent indexing for archival purposes to real-time monitoring for safety and planning purposes.",
        "Utterances in the ATC domain tend to be short sequences of relatively independent commands.",
        "The range of possible commands is well-bounded, and controllers are trained to avoid expressing these commands in different phrasings.",
        "As a consequence, it is possible to separate utterances into their constituent commands with high reliability, and similarly, to resume processing at the next command if processing of the present command fails for any reason.",

        "Disfluen-cies are more prevalent in this domain, since the speakers are not trained users.",
        "Another feature distinguishing ATIS from ATC is that ATIS utterances, no matter how discursive they appear, normally constitute a single request.",
        "Therefore parse fragments created by the backup mechanism seldom correspond to individual commands as they do in the ATC domain; instead, a single request may give rise to several fragments which must be integrated during semantic and pragmatic processing' .",
        "In both domains, since the input is spoken, there is the additional possibility of errors introduced by the speech recognition component.",
        "While the techniques discussed in this paper have obvious applicability to recovery from such errors, in what follows we will assume perfection on the part of the recognizer, and that all errors and disfluencies originate with the speaker.",

        "input word string in order to succeed.",
        "In any grammar, our approach to robust parsing is implemented by adding one additional disjunct at the end of the center rule.",
        "We call this disjunct \"backup\".",
        "The BNF rule for backup has the following form:",
        "• If positioned at a keyword, reset the time allotment if necessary, then retry the other center options, relaxing the requirement to consume the entire word string.",

        "If no keyword is found, fail.",
        "The backup rule is entered either if normal parsing fails (i.e., none of the other disjuncts of the center rule produce a parse consuming the whole word string), or if timeout occurs.",
        "Users specify an amount of time in the form of a number (possibly fractional) of seconds per word, so that longer inputs are given more time.",
        "Once time has expired, no rule will execute except the backup rule, which will reallot time based on the length of the remaining word string, and then proceed as described above.",
        "The opportunity for introducing domain knowledge to influence the behavior of the backup rule comes in the specification of the keywords.",
        "To discuss what we have done in the two domains we experimented with, we first need to introduce the PUNDIT knowledge base.",
        "This is simply a mapping of word tokens to a hierarchical set of concepts [10].",
        "Synonyms usually denote the same concept., The \"is-a\" relation is defined over the hierarchy, so that a concorde is-a jet is-a plane, a propeller_plane also is-a plane, etc.",
        "The keywords used by backup can be specified as word tokens or as concepts.",
        "In the latter case, the concept is taken to refer to any word token that maps to the concept or any descendant of the concept in the knowledge base.",
