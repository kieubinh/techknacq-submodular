        "The Semantic Linker represents an important departure from previous proposals, both our own [1] and others [2], in that it casts fragment combination as a general search problem, rather than as a problem of task model template matching (as in [4]) or as an extension to the existing parsing algorithm (as in [3]).",
        "Rather than reconstruct a parse tree, the goal of the search is to combine all the fragments into the most minimal and plausible connected graph, in which the links are not syntactic descendancy, but logical binary relations from the domain, such as \"AIRLINE-OF\", \"ORIG-OF\" etc.",
        "States in the search space are partial connections of the fragments: in other words, a set of links.",
        "There a two types of \"move\" to reach a new state from an existing one.",
        "One adds a new link between fragments, and the other \"hallucinates\" an object to bridge two fragments that could not otherwise be linked (corresponding roughly to a notion of ellipsis).",
        "A success terminal state is one in which all the fragments have been linked.",
        "States have features associated with their constituent links and a system of weights on the features determines a score that is used to guide the search.",
        "The advantages of this formulation are its domain-independence, flexiblity, extensibility, and ability to make use of statistical data.",
        "In particular:",
        "• No assumption need be made about constraining task models • The state space can be searched in any order • New features are straightforward to add • Probabilities of relations determined from (parseable) corpora can be used • Weights on features are potentially derivable by automatic training",

        "We first give some nece-sary background on semantic interpretation in the DELPHI system, and on the generation and interpretation of fragmentary sub-parses in it.",
        "Next, we show how this framework is used to generate all possible connections between pairs of different fragment objects, and how probabilities and other features are assigned to these connections.",
        "We then show how we efficiently search the space of combinations of such links in order to find the minimal and plausible set of connections, and how such link combinations are turned into final interpretations.",

        "This was done because of the signifigant penalty attached to a wrong answer in this evaluation.",
        "If there is more than one success state, the Linker picks the the subset of them with the highest score.",
