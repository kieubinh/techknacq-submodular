        "In the fall of 1989, our group first demonstrated VOYAGER, a system that can engage in verbal dialogues with users about a geographical region within Cambridge, Massachusetts [2].",
        "The system can provide users with information about distances, travel times, or directions between objects located within this area (e.g., restaurants, hotels, post offices, subway stops), as well as information such as addresses or telephone numbers of the objects themselves.",
        "While VOYAGER is constrained both in its capabilities and domain of knowledge, it contains all the essential components of a spoken-language system, including discourse maintenance and language generation.",
        "The VOYAGER application provided us with our first experience with the development of spoken language systems, helped us understand the issues related to this endeavor, and provided a framework for our subsequent system development efforts [3, 4].",
        "Over the past few years; we have become increasingly interested in developing multilingual spoken language systems.",
        "There are several ongoing international spoken language translation projects whose goal is to enable humans to communicate with each other in their native tongues [5, 6].",
        "Our objective, however, is somewhat different.",
        "Specifically, we are interested in developing multilingual human-computer interfaces, such that the information stored in the database can be accessed and received in multiple spoken languages.",
        "We believe that there is great utility in having such systems, since information is fast becoming globally accessible.",
        "Furthermore, we suspect that this type of multilingual system may be easier to develop than speech translation systems, since the system only needs to anticipate the diversity of one side of the conversation, i.e., the human side.",
        "During the past year, we have begun to develop a multilingual version of VOYAGER.",
        "This paper will describe our work in extending VOYAGER'S capability from English to Japanese.",
        "Since VOYAGER was originally designed only for English, a number of changes were necessary to accommodate multiple languages.",
        "In the next section, we describe our approach to developing multilingual systems, and the modifications made to the original system.",
        "A discussion of the specific implementation of the various components for Japanese will follow.",
        "Finally, performance evaluation of the Japanese VOYAGER system will be presented, followed by a brief description of future plans."

        "The semantic frame is passed to the system manager which uses it, along with contextual information stored in the discourse component, to access information stored in the database, and provide a response [2].",
        "The VOYAGER application uses an object-oriented database, although we have also accessed data in SQL and other configurations [3].",
        "Responses to the user consist of displays, text, and synthetic speech.",
        "The latter two are derived via a language generation component which generates noun-phrases from the internal semantic representation and embeds them into context-dependent messages.",
        "In order to develop a multilingual capability for our spoken language systems, we have adopted the approach that each component in the system be as language transparent as possible.",
        "In the VOYAGER system for instance, the system manager, discourse component, and the database are all structured so as to be independent of the input or output language.",
        "Where language-dependent information is required we have attempted to isolate it in the form of external tables or rules, as illustrated in Figure 1 for both the language understanding and generation components.",
        "As will be described in more detail in the next section, we trained a version of the basic SUMMIT system for both Japanese and English, using data recorded from native speakers for each language.",
        "The current user interface is very similar to that of the original VOYAGER system, except that a separate recording icon is used for each language.",
        "For text-to-speech synthesis we use a DECtalk system for English, and an NEC text-to-speech system for Japanese.",
        "If we are to attain a multilingual capability within a single system framework, the task of porting to a new language should involve only adapting existing tables or models, without requiring any modification of the indi-SO vidual components.",
        "By incrementally porting the system to new languages we hope to slowly generalize the architecture of each component to achieve this result.",

        "Once data were available we were able to port the speech recognition and language understanding components.",

        "We started with translations from available English sentences, but these alone are not nearly adequate for closure on coverage of actual data.",
        "Although in theory a grammar developer can use his/her innate knowledge of the language to write appropriate grammar rules, in practice such an approach falls far short of complete coverage of actual user utterances.",
        "For data collection from Japanese subjects we recorded data from 40 native speakers, recruited from the general MIT community.",
        "In a manner similar to data collection techniques used for the ATIS domain [3], subjects were asked to solve four problem scenarios.",
        "At the end of the session subjects were also allowed to ask random questions of the system.",

        "Major tasks in porting SUMMIT to Japanese include acoustic-phonetic, lexical-phonological and language modeling.",
        "In an earlier paper, we described these components and reported on a speaker-dependent evaluation [10].",
        "Will briefly summarize our previous work, and describe all subsequent developments, including improved language modeling and speaker-independent training.",
        "Phonetic Modeling In the current version, we use a context-independent mixture (up to 16) diagonal Gaussian model to represent each label in the lexical network [7].",
        "Starting from seed models, the phonetic models are iteratively trained using a segmental K-means-like procedure whereby the forced alignments of the previous iteration are used to train the current iteration.",
        "In the English version, the seed models were trained from the manually-aligned phonetic transcriptions of the TIMIT corpus [11].",
        "Rather than obtaining aligned phonetic transcriptions for a Japanese corpus, we found that we could achieve reasonable initial alignments by seeding our Japanese phonetic models from their phonetically most similar English counterparts.",
        "Based on an inspection of the alignments, we confirmed that the resulting Japanese models were converging to the intended labels after a few training iterations.",
        "Phonological Modeling Words in the lexicon must be mapped from the abstract phonemic representation to the possible acoustic realizations, taking into account contextual variations.",
        "We have adopted the procedure of modeling some of these variations through a set of phonological transformation rules, some of which are unique to Japanese.",
        "One of the typical phonological effects that we must account for in Japanese is the different phonetic realizations of the so-called mora (syllabic) phonemes /Q/ and /N/.",
        "For example, the phoneme /Q/ is regarded to occupy one higher-level temporal unit (mora) and is realized as a lengthening of the closure interval before stop consonants.",
        "When it is followed by fricatives, it may be realized instead as a lengthening of the following frication.",
        "Another major phonological phenomenon is the devoicing of /i/ and /u/, which typically occurs when they are preceded and followed by voiceless consonants.",
        "In the English version of SUMMIT, phonological transformation rules have been used to generate alternative pronunciations based on low-level phonological effects such as flapping, palatalization, and gemination.",
        "For the Japanese version, we have been able to use the same framework for the conversion of mora phonemes into different phonetic realizations as well as describing lower-level phonological effects such as gemination and devocalization.",
        "A set of approximately 60 phonological rules has been developed to account for the possible acoustic realizations of word sequences.",
        "These rules produce a total of 56 distinct acoustic labels in the resulting lexical network.",
        "Language Modeling Language modeling is an important aspect of speech recognition since it can dramatically reduce the difficulty of a task.",
        "Many speech recognition systems developed for English, particularly those developed for spontaneous speech, employ n-gram language models which capture local word constraints in an utterance [4, 12].",
        "On the other hand, most speech recognition systems for Japanese speech currently employ only small and rather constrained context-free grammars",
        "which may not be well suited to spontaneous speech [13].",
        "Compared to English, the choice of lexical units for Japanese speech recognition is less clear.",
        "In particular, Japanese orthography does not have spacing between words, making it difficult to have a common agreement on where word boundaries are in a sentence, especially in the case of certain function word sequences.",
        "The choice of units impacts both the compactness of the lexical representation and the effectiveness of local grammatical constraints.",
        "If we choose units that are too large, the lexicon will need many redundant entries to capture the linguistic variation.",
        "On the other hand, choosing smaller units weakens the constraint available from local language models such as statistical bigrams.",
        "We have addressed this to some degree by carefully choosing a set of morphological units along with left and right adjacency categories for these units.",
        "For example, lexical entries are fully separated into root and inflectional suffixes, except for words with irregular inflections, thus providing a system flexible enough to cope with various expressions in spontaneous speech.",
        "In order to develop sufficiently general grammatical constraints to be used for continuous speech recognition, we developed a category bigram grammar, where the classes are defined by morphological categories.",
        "As illustrated in Figure 2, each lexical entry is given a left and right morphological adjacency category.",
        "The probability of the word wi given word wi is defined to be",
        "where 1(w) and r(w) are the categories of word w as viewed from the left and right respectively, and L(l) is the number of distinct words in a category 1.",
        "By this definition, all words within a category are assumed to be equally probable.",
        "L(1(wi)) As we and others have done previously [4, 12], the category bigram probability is smoothed by interpolating the bigram estimate with the prior probabilities of each category:",

        "Japanese was in many respects easier than English – we found that it was unnecessary to mark any syntactic or semantic features, and Japanese, unlike European languages, appears not to make use of constituent movement.",
        "The only difficulty with Japanese was that parse trees tend to be left-recursive, which can cause infinite-loop problems in a top-down parser.",
        "Noun phrase modifiers are positioned to the left of the modified object, and, furthermore, the preposition indicating the relationship follows the modifier.",
        "Thus a top-down depth-first parser can keep seeking a noun modifier as the next constituent, at the end of an infinite series of recursive modifiers.",

        "Only two words in this sentence need to be provided, as shown in the table.",

        "The semantic frame for our example sentence is shown in Figure 4.",

        "Likewise, Japanese versions of this question produce a semantic frame that is essentially identical to the one produced for English.",
        "We had anticipated that the very different order of constituents between Japanese and English might make it hard to produce an equivalent semantic frame from a Japanese sentence to that produced by an English sentence with the same meaning.",
        "This did not turn out to be the case.",
        "Except for the additional special functions to handle post-positional particles, along with a few other minor adaptations, we were able to use the same functional procedures for converting Japanese parse trees to semantic frames as those used for English.",
        "By carefully choosing grammar rules with correspondences to their English equivalents, we were able to exploit the same protocol for producing a semantic frame, thus feeding into the main system with a common interlingual representation.",
        "We feel that the success of this approach is largely attributable to the fact that we have intentionally designed our semantic interpretation procedure to operate at the level of independent parse tree nodes, rather than to be explicitly associated with grammar rules or with complex patterns found in the parse tree."
