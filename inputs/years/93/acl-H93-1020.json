        "Tied-mixture (or semi-continuous) distributions have rapidly become an important tool for acoustic modeling in speech recognition since their introduction by Huang and Jack [1] and Bellegarda and Nahamoo [2], finding widespread use in a number of high-performance recognition systems.",
        "Tied mixtures have a number of advantageous properties that have contributed to their success.",
        "Like discrete, \"non-parametric\" distributions, tied mixtures can model a wide range of distributions including those with an \"irregular shape,\" while retaining the smoothed form characteristic of simpler parametric models.",
        "Additionally, because the component distributions of the mixtures are shared, the number of free parameters is reduced, and tied-mixtures have been found to produce robust estimates with relatively small amounts of training data.",
        "Under the general heading of tied mixtures, there are a number of possible choices of parameterization that lead to systems with different characteristics.",
        "This paper outlines these choices and provides a set of controlled experiments assessing trade-offs in speaker-independent recognition on the Resource Management corpus in the context of the stochastic segment model (SSM).",

        "A central problem in the statistical approach to speech recognition is finding a good model for the probability of acoustic observations conditioned on the state in hidden-Markov models (HMM), or for the case of the SSM, conditioned on a region of the model.",
        "Some of the options that have been investigated include discrete distributions based on vector quantization, as well as Gaussian, Gaussian mixture and tied-Gaussian mixture distributions.",
        "In tied-mixture modeling, distributions are modeled as a mixture of continuous densities, but unlike ordinary, non-tied mixtures, rather than estimating the component Gaussian densities separately, each mixture is constrained to share the same component densities with only the weights differing.",
        "The probability density of observation vector x conditioned on being in state i is thus",
        "Note that the component Gaussian densities, Pk(x) N(pk, Ek), are not indexed by the state, i.",
        "In this light, tied mixtures can be seen as a particular example of the general technique of tying to reduce the number of model parameters that must be trained [3].",
        "\"Tied mixtures\" and \"semi-continuous HMMs\" are used in the literature to refer to HMM distributions of the form given in Equation (1).",
        "The term \"semi-continuous HMMs\" was coined by Huang and Jack, who first proposed their use in continuous speech recognition [1].",
        "The \"semi-continuous\" terminology highlights the relationship of this method to discrete and continuous density HMMs, where the mixture component means are analogous to the vector quantization codewords of a discrete HMM and the weights to the discrete observation probabilities, but, as in continuous density HMMs, actual quantization with its attendant distortion is avoided.",
        "Bellegarda and Nahamoo independently developed the same technique which they termed \"tied mixtures\" [2].",
        "For simplicity, we use only one name in this paper, and choose the term tied mixtures, to highlight the relationship to other types of mixture distributions and because our work is based on the SSM, not the HMM.",
        "Since its introduction, a number of variants of the tied mixture model have been explored.",
        "First, different assumptions can be made about feature correlation within",
        "individual mixture components.",
        "Separate sets of tied mixtures have been used for various input features including cepstra, derivatives of cepstra, and power and its derivative, where each of these feature sets have been treated as independent observation streams.",
        "Within an observation stream, different assumptions about feature correlation have been explored, with some researchers currently favoring diagonal covariance matrices [4, 5] and others adopting full covariance matrices [6, 7].",
        "Second, the issue of parameter initialization can be important, since the training algorithm is an iterative hill-climbing technique that guarantees convergence only to a local optimum.",
        "Many researchers initialize their systems with parameters estimated from data subsets determined by K-means clustering, e.g. [6], although Paul describes a different, bootstrapping initialization [4].",
        "Often a large number of mixture components are used and, since the parameters can be overtrained, contradictory results are reported on the benefits of parameter re-estimation.",
        "For example, while many researchers find it useful to reestimate all parameters of the mixture models in training, BBN reports no benefit for updating means and covariances after the initialization from clustered data [7].",
        "Another variation, embodied in the CMU senone models [8], involves tying mixture weights over classes of context-dependent models.",
        "Their approach to finding regions of mixture weight tying involves clustering discrete observation distributions and mapping these clustered distributions to the mixture weights for the associated triphone contexts.",
        "In addition to the work described above, there are related methods that have informed the research concerning tied mixtures.",
        "First, mixture modeling does not require the use of Gaussian distributions.",
        "Good results have also been obtained using mixtures of Laplacian distributions [9, 10], and presumably other component densities would perform well too.",
        "Ney [11] has found strong similarities between radial basis functions and mixture densities using Gaussians with diagonal covariances.",
        "Recent work at BBN has explored the use of elliptical basis functions which share many properties with tied mixtures of full-covariance Gaussians [12].",
        "Second, the positive results achieved by several researchers using non-tied mixture systems [13] raise the question of whether tied-mixtures have significant performance advantages over untied mixtures when there is adequate training data.",
        "It is possible to strike a compromise and use limited tying: for instance the context models of a phone can all use the same tied distributions (e.g. [14, 15]).",
        "Of course, the best choice of model depends on the nature of the observation vectors and the amount of training data.",
        "In addition, it is likely that the amount of tying in a system can be adjusted across a continuum to fit the particular task and amount of training data.",
        "However, an assessment of modeling trade-offs for speaker-independent recognition is useful for providing insight into the various choices, and also because the various results in the literature are difficult to compare due to differing experimental paradigms."

        "Each region is described by a tied Gaussian mixture distribution, and the frames are assumed conditionally independent given the length-dependent warping.",
        "The conditional independence assumption allows robust estimation of the model's statistics and reduces the computation of determining a segment's probability, but the potential of the segment model is not fully utilized.",

        "Thus, many of the experiments reported here translate to HMM systems.",

        "Additionally, for a given phonetic segmentation, the assignment of observations to regions of the model is uniquely determined.",
        "SSM training is similar to HMM \"Viterbi training\", in which training data is segmented using the most likely state sequence and model parameters are updated using this segmentation.",
        "Although it is possible to define an SSM training algorithm equivalent to the Baum-Welch algorithm for HMMs, the computation is prohibitive for the SSM because of the large effective state space.",
        "The use of a constrained segmentation greatly simplifies parameter estimation in the tied mixture case, since there is only one unobserved component, the mixture mode.",

        "This method reduces the number of model updates in training in proportion to the number of context types used, although the computation of observation probabilities conditioned on the mixture component densities, remains the same.",
        "In recognition with marginal models, it is still necessary to combine the different context types, and we use the same hand-picked weights as before for this purpose.",
        "We compared the two training methods and found that performance on an independent test set was essentially the same for both methods (marginal training produced 2 fewer errors on the Feb89 test set) and the marginal trainer required 20 to 35% less time, depending on the model size and machine memory."

        "At the highest level, tied mixture training is inherently a sequential process, since each pass requires the parameter estimates from the previous pass.",
        "However, the bulk of the training computation involves estimating counts over a database, and these counts are all independent of each other.",
        "We can therefore speed training by letting machines estimate the counts for different parts of the database in parallel and combine and normalize their results at the end of each pass.",
        "To implement this approach we use a simple \"bakery\" algorithm to assign tasks: as each machine becomes free, it reads and increments the value of a counter from a common location indicating the sentences in the database it should work on next.",
        "This approach provides load balancing, allowing us to make efficient use of machines that may differ in speed.",
        "Because of the coarse grain of parallelism (one task typically consists of processing 10 sentences), we can use the relatively simple mechanism of file locking for synchronization and mutual exclusion, with no noticeable efficiency penalty.",
        "Finally, one processor is distinguished as the \"master\" processor and is assigned to perform the collation and normalization of counts at the end of each pass.",
