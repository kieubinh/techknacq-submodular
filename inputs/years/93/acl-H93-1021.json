        "Given consistent statistical evidence, a unique ME solution is guaranteed to exist, and an iterative algorithm exists which is guaranteed to converge to it.",
        "Among the advantages of this approach are its simplicity, its generality, and its incremental nature.",
        "Among its disadvantages are its computational requirements.",
        "We describe a succession of ME models, culminating in our current Maximum Likelihood / Maximum Entropy (ML/ME) model.",

        "Until recently, the most successful language model (given enough training data) was the trigram [1], where the probability of a word is estimated based solely on the two words preceding it.",
        "The trigram model is simple yet powerful [2].",
        "However, since it does not use anything but the very immediate history, it is incapable of adapting to the style or topic of the document, and is therefore considered a static model.",
        "In contrast, a dynamic or adaptive model is one that changes its estimates as a result of \"seeing\" some of the text.",
        "An adaptive model may, for example, rely on the history of the current document in estimating the probability of a word.",
        "Adaptive models are superior to static ones in that they are able to improve their performance after seeing some of the data.",
        "This is particularly useful in two situations.",
        "First, when a large heterogeneous language source is composed of smaller, more homogeneous segments, such as newspaper articles.",
        "An adaptive model trained on the heterogeneous source will be able to hone in on the particular \"sublanguage\" used in each of the articles.",
        "Secondly, when a model trained on data from one domain is used in another domain.",
        "Again, an adaptive model will be able to adjust to the new language, thus improving its performance.",
        "The most successful adaptive LM to date is described in [3].",
        "A cache of the last few hundred words is maintained, and is used *This work is now continued by Ron Rosenfeld at Carnegie Mellon University.",
        "to derive a \"cache trigram\".",
        "The latter is then interpolated with the static trigram.",
        "This results in a 23% reduction in perplexity, and a 5%-24% reduction in the error rate of a speech recognizer.",
        "In what follows, we describe our efforts at improving our adaptive statistical language models by capitalizing on the information present in the document history."
