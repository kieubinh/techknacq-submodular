        "The phra.ses that are recognized are names, the noun group, or the noun phrase up through the head noun, the verb group, or the verb together with its auxilliaries and any trapped adverbs, and various particles, including prepositions, conjunctions, relative pronouns, the word \"ago\", and the word \"that\" which is treated specially because of the ambiguities it gives rise to.",
