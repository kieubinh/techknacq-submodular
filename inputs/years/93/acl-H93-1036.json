        "The PANGLOSS project is a three-site collaborative effort to build a large-scale knowledge-based machine translation system.",
        "Key components of PANGLOSS include New Mexico State University's ULTRA parser [Farwell and Wilks, 1991], Carnegie Mellon's interlingua representation format [Nirenburg and Defrise, 1991], and USC/ISI's PENMAN English generation system [Penman, 1989].",
        "Another key component currently under construction at ISI is the PANGLOSS ontology, a large-scale conceptual network intended to support semantic processing in other PANGLOSS modules.",
        "This network will contain 50,000 nodes representing commonly encountered objects, entities, qualities, and relations.",
        "The upper (more abstract) region of the ontology is called the Ontology Base (OB) and contains approximately 400 items that represent generalizations essential for the various PANGLOSS modules' linguistic processing during translation.",
        "The middle region of the ontology, approximately 50,000 items, provides a framework for a generic world model, containing items representing many English word senses.",
        "The lower (more specific) regions of the ontology provide anchor points for different application domains.",
        "Both the middle and domain model regions of the ontology house the open-class terms of the MT interlingua.",
        "They also contain specific information used to screen unlikely semantic and anaphoric interpretations.",
        "The Ontology Base is a synthesis of USC/ISI's PENMAN Upper Model [Bateman, 1990] and CMU's ON-TOS concept hierarchy [Carlson and Nirenburg, 1990].",
        "Both of these high-level ontologies were built by hand, and they were merged manually.",
        "Theoretical motivations behind the OB and its current status are described in [Hovy and Knight, 1993].",
        "The problem we focus on in this paper is the construction of the large middle region of the ontology.",
        "Because large-scale knowledge resources are difficult to build by hand, we are pursuing primarily automatic methods applied in several stages.",
        "During the first stage we created several tens of thousands of nodes, organized them into sub/superclass taxonomies, and subordinated those taxonomies to the 400-node Ontology Base.",
        "This work we describe below.",
        "Later stages will address the insertion of additional semantic information such as restrictions on actors in events, domain/range constraints on relations, and so forth.",
        "For the major node creation and taxonomization stage, we have primarily used two on line sources of information: (1) the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE)[Group, 1978], and (2) the lexical database WordNet [Miller, 1990]."

      "heading": "4.1. Definition Match",
      "text": [
        "The Definition Match algorithm is based on the idea that two word senses should be matched if their two definitions share words.",
        "For example, there are two noun definitions of \"batter\" in LDOCE:",
        "• (batter_2_0) \"mixture of flour, eggs, and milk, beaten together and used in cooking\" • (batter_3_0) \"a person who bats, esp in baseball compare BATSMAN\" and two definitions in WordNet: • (BATTER-1) \"ballplayer who bats\" • (BATTER-2) \"a flour mixture thin enough to pour or drop from a spoon\"",
        "The Definition Match Algorithm will match (batter_2_0) with (BATTER-2) because their definitions share words like \"flour\" and \"mixture.\"",
        "Similarly (batter_3_0) and (BATTER-1) both contain the word \"bats,\" so they are also matched together.",
        "Not all senses in WordNet have definitions, but most have synonyms and superordinates.",
        "For this reason, the algorithm looks not only at WordNet definitions, but also at locally related words and senses.",
        "For example, if",
        "synonyms of WordNet sense x appear in the definition of LDOCE sense y, then this is evidence that x and y should be matched.",

        "In constructing the SIM matrix the algorithm comes up with a similarity measure between each of the n •rn possible pairs of LDOCE and WordNet senses.",
        "This measure, SIM[i, j], is a number from 0 to 1, with 1 being as good a match as possible.",
        "Thus, every matching pair proposed by the algorithm comes with a confidence factor.",
        "Empirical results are as follows.",
        "We ran the algorithm over all nouns in both LDOCE and WordNet.",
        "We judged the correctness of its proposed matches, keeping records of the confidence levels and the degree of ambiguity present.",
        "For low-ambiguity words (words with exactly two senses in LDOCE and two in WordNet), the results are:",
        "For high-ambiguity words (more than five senses in LDOCE and WordNet), the results are: 1.00 if x is a synonym or superordinate of sense j in WordNet 0.80 if x is contained in the definition of sense j or the definition of its superordinate 0.60 if x is a sibling or super-superordinate of sense j in WordNet 0.01 otherwise",
        "Accuracy here is worse, but increases sharply when we only consider high confidence matches.",
        "The algorithm's performance is quite reasonable, given that 45% of WordNet senses have no definitions and that many existing definitions are brief and contain misspellings.",
        "Still, there are several improvements to be made – e.g., modify the \"greedy\" strategy in which matches are extracted from SIM matrix, weigh rare words in definitions more highly than common ones, and/or score senses with long definitions lower than ones with short definitions.",
        "These improvements yield only slightly better results, however, because most failures are simply due to the fact that matching sense definitions have no words in common.",
        "For example, \"seal\" has 5 noun senses in LDOCE, one of which is: (seal_1_1) \"any of several types of large fish-eating animals living mostly on cool seacoasts and floating ice, with broad flat limbs (FLIPPERS) suitable for swimming\" WordNet has 7 definitions of \"seal,\" one of which is: (SEAL-7) \"any of numerous marine mammals that come on shore to breed; chiefly of cold regions\" The Definition Match algorithm cannot see any similarity between (seal_1_1) and (SEAL-7), so it does not match them.",

        "LDOCE has two fairly flat hierarchies.",
        "The semantic code hierarchy is induced by a set of 33 semantic codes drawn up by Longman lexicographers.",
        "Each sense is marked with one of these codes, e.g., \"H\" for human \"P\" for plant, \"J\" for movable object.",
        "The other hierarchy is the genus sense hierarchy.",
        "Researchers at New Mexico State University have built an automatic algorithm [Bruce and Guthrie, 1992] for locating and disambiguating genus terms (head nouns) in sense definitions.",
        "For example, (bat_1_1) is defined as \"any of the several types of specially shaped wooden stick used for ...\" The genus term for (bat_1_1) is (stick_1_1).",
        "As another example, the genus sense of (aisle_0_1) is (passage_0_7).",
        "The genus sense and the semantic code hierarchies were extracted automatically from LDOCE.",
        "The semantic code hierarchy is fairly robust, but since the genus sense hierarchy was generated heuristically, it is only 80% correct.",
        "The idea of the Hierarchy Match algorithm is that once two senses are matched, it is a good idea to look at their respective ancestors and descendants for further matches.",
        "For example, once (animal_1_2) and ANIMAL1 are matched, we can look into the respective animal-subhierarchies.",
        "We find that the word \"seal\" is locally unambiguous – only one sense of \"seal\" refers to an animal (in both LDOCE and WordNet).",
        "So we feel confident to match those seal-animal senses.",
        "As another example, suppose we know that (swan_dive_0_0) is the same concept as (SWAN-DIVE-1).",
        "We can then match their superordinates (dive_2_1) and (DIVE-3) with high confidence; we need not consider other senses of \"dive.\"",

        "Place these matches on a list called M2.",
        "We created 15 of these, mostly high-level matches like (person_0_1, PERSON-2) and (plant_2_1, PLANT-3).",
        "This step is not strictly necessary, but provides guidance to the algorithm.",
        "2.",

        "(b) Move all matches from M2 to a list called M3.",
        "(c) For each match on Ml, look upward in the two hierarchies from the matched senses.",
        "Whenever a word appears in both hierarchies, match the corresponding senses, and place the match on M2.",
        "(d) Move all matches from M1 to M2.",
        "taxonomized adjective and verb senses (see Section 6) semantic support is still very limited.",
        "The algorithm operate in phases, shifting matches from M1 to M2 to M3, placing newly-generated matches on M1 and M2.",
        "Once M1 and M2 are exhausted, M3 contains the final list of matches proposed by the algorithm.",
        "Again, we can measure the success of the algorithm along two dimensions, coverage and correctness:",
        "In the end, the algorithm produced 11,128 matches at 96% accuracy.",
        "We expected 100% accuracy, but the algorithm was foiled at several places by errors in one or another of the hierarchies.",
        "For example, (savings_bank_0_0) is mistakenly a subclass of riverbank (bank_1_1) in the LDOCE genus hierarchy, rather than (bank_1_4), the money-bank.",
        "\"Savings bank\" senses are matched in step 1(a), so step 2(c) erroneously goes on to match the riverbank of LDOCE with the money-bank of WordNet.",
        "Fortunately, the Definition and Hierarchy Match algorithms complement one another, and there are several ways to combine them.",
        "Our practical experience has been to run the Hierarchy Match algorithm to completion, remove the matched senses from the databases, then run the Definition Match algorithm.",
        "The Definition Match algorithm's performance improves slightly after hierarchy matching removes some word senses.",
        "Once the high confidence definition matches have.been verified, we use them as fuel for another run of the Hierarchy Match algorithm.",
