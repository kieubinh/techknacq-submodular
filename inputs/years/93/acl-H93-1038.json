        "It is desirable, therefore, to seek ways of both speeding up the process of translating texts and making it less expensive.",
        "In this paper we describe an environment that facilitates the integration of automatic machine translation (MT) and machine-aided translation (MAT).",
        "This environment, called the Translator's Workstation (Tws)[5], has been developed in the framework of the PANGLOSS machine translation project.' The main goal of this project is to develop a system that will, from the very beginning, produce high-quality output.",
        "This can only be attained currently by keeping the human being in the translation loop.",
        "The main measure of progress in the development of the Pan-gloss system is the gradual increase in the level of automation.",
        "PANGLOSS MARK I translates from Spanish into English, although additional source languages are planned.",

        "station provides the user interface and the integration platform.",
        "It is similar in spirit to systems such as the Translator's Workbench [3].",
        "The processing in PANGLOSS goes as follows:",
        "1. an input passage is broken into sentences; 2. a fully-automated translation of each full sentence is attempted; if it fails, then 3. a fully-automated translation of smaller chunks of text is attempted (currently, these are noun phrases); 4. the material that does not get covered by noun phrases is treated in a \"word-for-word\" mode, whereby translation suggestions for each word (or phrase) are sought in the system's MT lexicons, an online bilingual dictionary, and a set of user-supplied glossaries; 5.",
        "The resulting list of translated noun phrases and trans",
        "lation suggestions for words and phrases is displayed in a special editor window, where the human user finalizes the translation.",
        "This entire process can be viewed as helping a human translator, by doing parts of the job automatically and making the rest less time-consuming.",
        "We have designed and implemented an intelligent post-editing environment, the CMAT (Component Machine-Aided Translation) editor."

        "Keystrokes and mouse actions were automatically counted by the interface.",

        "A few days later, subjects repeated the procedure, reversing the use or non-use of the CMAT editor.",
        "Since practice effects should be more uniform in a simple editing task than in translation (the task is much less intellectually challenging), we felt that texts could be reused if practice effects are taken into account in analysis.",
        "Subjects were instructed to produce a \"close paraphrase\" of the example translation, since any two translators will produce slightly different correct translations of the same text.",
