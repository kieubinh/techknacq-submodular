        "Despite the long history of machine translation projects, and the well-known effects that evaluations such as the ALPAC Report (Pierce et al., 1966) have had on that history, optimal MT evaluation methodologies remain elusive.",
        "This is perhaps due in part to the subjectivity inherent in judging the quality of any translation output (human or machine).",
        "The difficulty also lies in the heterogeneity of MT language pairs, computational approaches, and intended end-use.",
        "The DARPA machine translation initiative is faced with all of these issues in evaluation, and so requires a suite of evaluation methodologies which minimize subjectivity and transcend the heterogeneity problems.",
        "At the same time, the initiative seeks to formulate this suite in such a way that it is economical to administer and portable to other MT development initiatives.",
        "This paper describes an evaluation of three research MT systems along with benchmark human and external MT outputs.",
        "Two sets of evaluations were performed, one using a relatively complex suite of methodologies, and the other using a simpler set on the same data.",
        "The test procedure is described, along The authors would like to express their gratitude to Michael Naber for his assistance in compiling, expressing and interpreting data.",
