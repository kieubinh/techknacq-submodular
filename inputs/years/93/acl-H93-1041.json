        "a semantic parser was developed to achieve semantic analysis, should more careful analysis fail.",
        "The JANUS [1, 2] framework as it is presented here also allows us to experiment with components of a speech translation system, in an effort to achieve both robustness and high-quality translation.",

        "Since we have not made any significant attempts at improving performance on the synthesis end (DEC-talk and synthesizers produced by NEC and AEG-Daimler are used for English, Japanese and German output, respectively), our discussion will focus on the recognition and translation parts."
