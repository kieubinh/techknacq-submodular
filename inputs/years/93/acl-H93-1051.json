        "The three corpus-based statistical sense resolution methods studied here attempt to infer the correct sense of a polyse-mous word by using knowledge about patterns of word co-occurrences.",
        "The techniques were based on Bayesian decision theory, neural networks, and content vectors as used in information retrieval.",
        "To understand these methods better, we posed a very specific problem: given a set of contexts, each containing the noun line in a known sense, construct a classifier that selects the correct sense of line for new contexts.",
        "To see how the degree of polysemy affects performance, results from three and six-sense tasks are compared.",
        "The results demonstrate that each of the techniques is able to distinguish six senses of line with an accuracy greater than 70%.",
        "Furthermore, the response patterns of the classifiers are, for the most part, statistically indistinguishable from one another.",
        "Comparison of the two tasks suggests that the degree of difficulty involved in resolving individual senses is a greater performance factor than the degree of polysemy."

        "The goal of this study is to systematically explore the effects of such variables as the number of senses per word and the number of training examples per sense on corpus-based statistical sense resolution methods.",
        "To enable us to study the effects of the number of word senses, we selected the highly polysemous noun line, which has 25 senses in WordNet.1 Automatic sense resolution systems need to resolve highly polysemous words.",
        "As Zipf [2] pointed out in 1945, frequently occurring words tend to be polysemous.",
        "The words encountered in a given text will have far greater polysemy than one would assume by simply taking the overall percentage of polysemous words in the language.",
        "Even though 86% of the nouns in WordNet have a single sense, the mean number of WordNet senses per word for the one hundred most frequently occurring nouns in the Brown Corpus is 5.15, with only eight words having a single sense."

        "Sentences containing [Ll]ine(s)' were extracted and manually assigned a single sense from WordNet.",
        "Sentences containing proper names such as 'Japan Air Lines' were removed from the set of sentences.",
        "Sentences containing collocations that have a single sense in WordNet, such as product line and line of products, were also excluded since the collocations are not ambiguous.",
        "Typically, experiments have used a fixed number of words or characters on either side of the target as the context.",
        "In this experiment, we used linguistic units sentences – instead.",
        "Since the target word is often used anaphorically to refer back to the previous sentence, we chose to use two-sentence contexts: the sentence containing line and the preceding sentence.",
        "However, if the sentence containing line is the first sentence in the article, then the context consists of one sentence.",
        "If the preceding sentence also contains line in the same sense, then an additional preceding sentence is added to the context, creating contexts three or more sentences long.",
        "The average size of the training and testing contexts is 44.5 words.",
        "The sense resolution task used the following six senses of the noun line:",
        "1. a product: 'a new line of workstations' 2. a formation of people or things: 'stand in line' 3. spoken or written text: 'a line from Shakespeare' 4. a thin, flexible object; cord: 'a nylon line' 5. an abstract division: 'a line between good and evil' 6. a telephone connection: 'the line went dead'",

        "The main component of the model, a token, was defined as any character string: a word, number, symbol, punctuation or any combination.",
        "The entire token is significant, so inflected forms of a base word (wait vs. waiting) and mixed case strings (Bush vs. bush) are distinct tokens.",
        "Associated with each token is a set of saliences, one for each sense, calculated from the training data.",
        "The salience of a token for a given sense is Pr(tokenisense)1Pr(token).",
        "The weight of a token for a given sense is the log of its salience.",
        "To select the sense of the target word in a (test) context, the classifier computes the sum of the tokens' weights over all tokens in the context for each sense, and selects the sense with the largest sum.",
        "In the case of author identification, Mosteller and Wallace built their models using high frequency function words.",

        "In particular, many tokens in the test contexts do not appear in any training context, or appear only once or twice.",
        "In the former case, the MLE is zero, obviously smaller than the true probability; in the latter case, the MLE is much larger than the true probability.",

        "The similarity between two texts is computed as a function of the vectors representing the two texts.",

        "al.",
        "have found much larger window sizes are better for the Bayesian classifier, presumably because so much information (e.g., word order and syntax) is thrown away.",
        "For the sense resolution problem, each sense is represented by a single vector constructed from the training contexts for that sense.",
        "A vector in the space defined by the training contexts is also constructed for each test context.",
        "To select a sense for a test context, the inner product between its vector and each of the sense vectors is computed, and the sense whose inner product is the largest is chosen.",
        "The components of the vectors are weighted to reflect the relative importance of the concepts in the text.",
        "The weighting method was designed to favor concepts that occur frequently in exactly one sense.",
        "The weight of a concept c is computed as follows: number of times c occurs in sense s ns Esenses ns difference between the two largest (if difference is 0, d is set to 1)",
        "For example, if a concept occurs 6 times in the training contexts of sense 1, and zero times in the other five sets of contexts, then its weights in the six vectors are (6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0).",
        "However, a concept that appears 10, 4, 7, 0, 1, and 2 times in the respective senses, has weights of (1.25, .5, .88, 0, .04, .17), reflecting the fact that it is not as good an indicator for any sense.",
        "This weighting method is the most effective among several variants that were tried.",
        "We also experimented with keeping all words in the content vectors, but performance degraded, probably because the weighting function does not handle very high frequency words well.",

        "The words on the list seem, for the most part, indicative of the target sense.",

        "For example, whereas the Bayesian method is sensitive to proper nouns, the neural network appears to have no such preference.",
        "To test the hypothesis that the methods have different response patterns, we performed the X2 test for correlated proportions.",
        "This test measures how consistently the methods treat individual test contexts by determining whether the classifiers are making the same classification errors in each of the senses.",
        "For each sense, the test compares the off-diagonal elements of a matrix whose columns contain the responses of one classifier and the rows show a second classifier's responses in the same test set.",
        "This process constructs a square matrix whose diagonal elements contain the number of test contexts on which the two methods agree.",
        "The results of the X2 test for a three-sense resolution task (product, formation and tezt),5 indicate that the response pattern of the content vector classifier is very significantly different from the patterns of both the Bayesian and neural network classifiers, but the Bayesian response pattern is significantly different from the neural network pattern for only the product sense.",
        "In the six-sense disambiguation task, the X2 results indicate that the Bayesian and neural network classifiers' response patterns are not significantly different for any sense.",
        "The neural network and Bayesian classifiers' response patterns are significantly different from the content vector classifier only in the formation and text senses.",
        "Therefore, with the addition of three senses, the classifiers' response patterns appear to be converging.",
        "The pilot two-sense distinction task (between product and formation) yielded over 90% correct answers.",
        "In the three-sense distinction task, the three classifiers had a",
        "mean of 76% correct,6 yielding a sharp degradation with the addition of a third sense.",

        "Although the addition of three new senses to the task caused consistent degradation, the degradation is relatively slight.",
        "Hence, we conclude that some senses are harder to resolve than others, and it appears that overall accuracy is a function of the difficulty of the sense rather than being strictly a function of the number of senses.",

        "If this is the case, any technique that uses only word counts will not be significantly more accurate than the techniques tested here.",
        "Although the degree of polysemy does affect the difficulty of the sense resolution task, a greater factor of performance is the difficulty of resolving individual senses.",
        "Using hindsight, it is obvious that the test sense is hard for these statistical methods to learn because one can talk or write about anything.",
        "In effect, all words between a pair of quotation marks are noise (unless line is within the quotes).",
        "In the three-sense task, the Bayesian classifier did best on the text sense, perhaps because it had open and closed quotes as important tokens.",
        "This advantage was lost in the six-sense task because quotation marks also appear in the contexts of the phone sense.",
        "It is not immediately obvious why the formation sense should be hard.",
        "From inspection of the contexts, it appears that the crucial information is close to the word, and context that is more than a few words away is noise.",
        "These corpus-based statistical techniques use an impoverished representation of the training contexts: simple counts of tokens appearing within two sentences.",
        "We believe significant increases in resolution accuracy will not be possible unless other information, such as word order or syntactic information, is incorporated into the techniques."
