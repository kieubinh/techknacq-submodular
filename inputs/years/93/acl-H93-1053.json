        "A linguistic scale is a set of words, of the same grammatical category, which can be ordered by their semantic strength or degree of informativeness [1].",
        "For example, \"lukewarm,\" \"warm\", \"hot\" fall along a single adjectival scale since they indicate a variation in the intensity of temperature of the modified noun.",
        "Linguistic properties of scales derive both from conventional logical entailment on the linear ordering of their elements and from Gricean scalar implicature [1].",
        "Despite these properties and their potential usefulness in both understanding and generating natural language text, dictionary entries are largely incomplete for adjectives in this regard.",
        "Yet, if systems are to use the information encoded in adjectival scales for generation or interpretation (e.g. for selecting an adjective with a particular degree of semantic strength, or for handling negation), they must have access to the sets of words comprising a scale.",
        "While linguists have presented various tests for accepting or rejecting a particular scalar relationship between any two adjectives (e.g., [2], [3]), the common problem with these methods is that they are designed to be applied by a human who incorporates the two adjectives in specific sentential frames (e.g. \"X is warm, even hot\") and assesses the semantic validity of the resulting sentences.",
        "Such tests cannot be used computationally to identify scales in a domain, since the specific sentences do not occur frequently enough in a corpus to produce an adequate description of the adjectival scales in the domain [4].",
        "As scales vary across domains, the task of compiling such information is compounded.",
        "In this paper we describe a technique for automatically grouping adjectives according to their meaning based on a given text corpus, so that all adjectives placed in one group describe different values of the same property.",
        "Our method is based on statistical techniques, augmented with linguistic information derived from the corpus, and is completely domain independent.",
        "It demonstrates how high-level semantic knowledge can be computed from large amounts of low-level knowledge (essentially plain text, part-of-speech rules, and optionally syntactic relations).",
        "While our current system does not distinguish between scalar and non-scalar adjectives, it is a first step in the automatic identification of adjectival scales, since the scales can be subsequently ordered and the non-scalar adjectives filtered on the basis of independent tests, done in part automatically and in part by hand in a post-editing phase.",
        "The result is a semi-automated system for the compilation of adjectival scales.",
        "In the following sections, we first describe our algorithm in detail, present the results obtained, and finally provide a formal evaluation of the results."

        "Our algorithm is based on two sources of linguistic data: data that help establish that two adjectives are related, and data that indicate that two adjectives are unrelated.",
        "We extract adjective-noun pairs that occur in a modification relation in order to identify the distribution of nouns an adjective modifies and, ultimately, determine which adjectives it is related to.",
        "This is based on the expectation that adjectives describing the same property tend to modify the same set of nouns.",
        "For example, temperature is normally defined for physical objects and we can expect to find that adjectives conveying different values of temperature will all modify physical objects.",
        "Therefore, our algorithm finds the distribution of nouns that each adjective modifies and categorizes adjectives as similar if they have similar distributions.",
        "Second, we use adjective-adjective pairs occurring as premodifiers within the same NP as a strong indication that the two adjectives do not belong in the same group.",
        "There are three cases:",
        "would be self-contradictory, as in the scalar sequence hot cold or the non-scalar red black.",
        "2.",
        "For non-antithetical scalar adjectives which both modify the head noun, the NP would violate the Gricean maxim of Manner [1] since the same information is conveyed by the strongest of the two adjectives (e.g. hot warm).",
        "3.",
        "Finally, if one adjective modifies the other, the modifying adjective has to qualify the modified one in a different dimension.",
        "For example, in light blue shirt, blue is a value of the property color, while light indicates the shade*",
        "The use of linguistic data, in addition to statistical measures, is a unique property of our work and significantly improves the accuracy of our results.",
        "One other published model for grouping semantically related words [5], is based on a statistical model of bigrams and trigrams and produces word groups using no linguistic knowledge, but no evaluation of the results is performed.",
        "Our method works in three stages.",
        "First, we extract linguistic data from the parsed corpus in the form of syntactically related word pairs; in the second stage, we compute a measure of similarity between any two adjectives based on the information gathered in stage one; and in the last stage, we cluster the adjectives into groups according to the similarity measure, so that adjectives with a high degree of similarity fall in the same cluster (and, consequently, adjectives with a low degree of similarity fall in different clusters)."

        "This ensures that these adjectives will never be placed in the same cluster; recall that they were determined to be definitively dissimilar based on linguistic data.",
        "The algorithm uses the exchange method [10] since the more commonly used K-means method [9] is not applicable; the K-means method, like all centroid methods, requires the measure d between the clustered objects to be a distance; this means, among other conditions, that for any three objects x, y, and z the triangle inequality applies.",

        "We selected adjectives that have one modified noun in common (problem) to ensure some semantic relatedness, and we included only adjectives that occurred frequently so that our similarity measure would be meaningful.",
        "The partition produced by the system for 9 clusters appears in Figure 2.",
        "Since the number of clusters is not determined by the system, we present the partition with a similar number of clusters as humans used for the same set of adjectives (the average number of clusters in the human-made models was 8.56).",

        "Finally, note that even in group 4 which is the weakest group produced, there is a positive semantic correlation between the adjectives new and unexpected.",
        "To summarize, the system seems to be able to identify many of the existent semantic relationships among the adjectives, while its mistakes are limited to creating singleton groups containing adjectives that are related to other adjectives in the test set (e.g., missing the semantic associations between new-old and potential-real) and \"recognizing\" a non-significant relationship between real and new-unexpected in group 4.",
        "We produced good results with relatively little data; the accuracy of the results can be improved if a larger, homogeneous corpus is used to provide the raw data.",

        "We have noticed that adjectives with a higher degree of semantic content (e.g. international or severe) appear to form more stable associations than relatively semantically empty adjectives (e.g. little or real).",
        "This observation can be used to actually filter out the adjectives which are too general to be meaningfully clustered in groups.",
        "To evaluate the performance of our system we compared its output to a model solution for the problem designed by humans.",

        "For each pair of adjectives, we asked if they fell in the same cluster (\"yes\") or not (\"no\").",
        "Since human judges did not always agree, we used fractional values for the correctness of each answer instead of 0 (\"incorrect\") and 1 (\"correct\").",
        "We used multiple human models for the same set of adjectives and defined the correctness of each answer as the relative frequency of the association between the two adjectives among the human models.",
        "We then sum these correctness values; in the case of perfect agreement between the models, or of only one model, the measures reduce to their original definition.",
        "Then, the contingency table model [12], widely used in Information Retrieval, is applicable.",
        "Referring to the classification of the yes-no answers in Table 1, the following measures are defined :",

        "decision-theoretic advantages [12], it appears to be more consistent across evaluations of partitions with different numbers of clusters.",
        "This has also been reported by other researchers in different evaluation problems [14].",
        "3.",
        "For comparison, we evaluated each human model against all the other models, using the above evaluation method; the results ranged from 38 to 72% for recall, 1 to 12% for fallout, 38 to 81% for precision, and, covering a remarkably short range, 49 to 59% for the F-measure, indicating that the performance of the system is not far behind human performance.",
        "Finally, before interpreting the scores produced by our evaluation module, we need to understand how they vary as the partition gets better or worse, and what are the limits of their values.",
        "Because of the multiple models used, perfect scores are not attainable.",
        "Also, because each pair of adjectives in a cluster is considered an observed association, the relationship between the number of associations produced by a cluster and the number of adjectives in the cluster is not linear (a cluster with k adjectives will produce (0 =0 (k2) associations).",
        "This leads to lower values of recall, since moving a single adjective out of a cluster with k elements in the model will cause the system to miss k-1 associations.",
        "In general, defining a scoring mechanism that compares one partition to another is a hard problem.",
        "To quantify these observations, we performed a Monte Carlo analysis [15] for the evaluation metrics, by repeatedly creating random partitions of the sample adjectives and evaluating the results.",
        "Then we estimated a (smoothed) probability density function for each metric from the resulting histograms; part of the results obtained are shown in Figure 3 for F-measure and fallout using 9 clusters.",
        "We observed that the system's performance (indicated by a square in the diagrams) was significantly better than what we would expect under the null hypothesis of random performance; the probability of getting a better partition than the system's is extremely small for all metrics (no occurrence in 20,000 trials) except for fallout, for which a random system may be better 4.9% of the time.",
        "The estimated density functions also show that the metrics are severely constrained by the structure imposed by the clustering as they tend to peak at some point and then fall rapidly."
