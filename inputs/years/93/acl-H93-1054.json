        "The problem of syntactic ambiguity is a pervasive one.",
        "As Church and Patil [2] point out, the class of \"every way ambigu-ous\" constructions – those for which the number of analyses is the number of binary trees over the terminal elements includes such frequent constructions as prepositional phrases, coordination, and nominal compounds.",
        "They suggest that until it has more useful constraints for resolving ambiguities, a parser can do little better than to efficiently record all the possible attachments and move on.",
        "In general, it may be that such constraints can only be supplied by analysis of the context, domain-dependent knowledge, or other complex inferential processes.",
        "However, we will suggest that in many cases, syntactic ambiguity can be resolved with the help of an extremely limited form of semantic knowledge, closely tied to the lexical items in the sentence.",
        "We focus on two relationships: selectional preference and semantic similarity.",
        "From one perspective, the proposals here can be viewed as an attempt to provide new formalizations for familiar but seldom carefully defined linguistic notions; elsewhere we demonstrate the utility of this approach in linguistic explanation [11].",
        "From another perspective, the work reported here can be viewed as an attempt to generalize statistical natural language techniques based on lexical associations, using knowledge-based rather than distributionally derived word classes."

        "Although selectional preference is traditionally formalized in terms of feature agreement using notations like [+Animate], such formalizations often fail to specify the set of allowable features, or to capture the gradedness of qualitative differences such as those in (2).",
        "As an alternative, we have proposed the following formalization of selectional preference [11]: Definition.",
        "The selectional preference of w for C is the relative entropy (Kullback-Leibler distance) between the prior distribution Pr(C) and the posterior distribution Pr(C w).",
        "Here w is a word with selectional properties, C ranges over semantic classes, and co-occurrences are counted with respect to a particular argument – e.g. verbs and direct objects, nominal modifiers and the head noun they modify, and so forth.",
        "Intuitively, this definition works by comparing the distribution of argument classes without knowing what the word is (e.g., the a priori likelihood of classes in direct object position), to the distribution with respect to the word.",
        "If these distributions are very different, as measured by relative entropy, then the word has a strong influence on what can or cannot appear in that argument position, and we say that it has a strong selectional preference for that argument.",

        "The selectional association of w with c is the contribution c makes to the selectional preference of w. The selectional association A(tv w2) of two words is taken to be the maximum of A( w , c) over all classes c to which w2 belongs.",

        "For example, (nickel) and (dime) are both immediately subsumed by (coin), whereas the most specific superclass that (nickel) and (mortgage) share is (possession).",
        "The difficulty, of course, is how to determine which superclass is \"most specific.\" Simply counting IS-A links in the taxonomy can be misleading, since a single link can represent a fine-grained distinction in one part of the taxonomy (e.g. (zebra) IS-A (equine)) and a very large distinction elsewhere (e.g. (carcinogen) IS-A (substance)).",
        "Rather than counting links, we use the information content of a class to measure its specificity (i.e., – log Pr(c)); this permits us to define noun similarity as follows: Definition.",
