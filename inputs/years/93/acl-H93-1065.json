        "This paper describes a system for prediction of segmental duration from text.",
        "In most text-to-speech synthesizer architectures, a duration prediction system is embedded in a sequence of modules, where it is preceded by modules that compute various linguistic features' from text.",
        "For example, the word \"unit\" might be represented as a sequence of five feature vectors: (< Ail , word - initial, monosyllabic, • • • , >) • • • (< It I burst, word - final, monosyllabic, • • , >).",
        "In automatic speech recognition, a (hypothesized) phone is usually annotated only in terms of the preceding and following phones.",
        "If some form of lexical access is performed, more complete contextual feature vectors can be computed.",
        "Broadly speaking, construction of duration prediction systems has been approached in two ways.",
        "One is to use general-purpose statistical methods such as CART2 or neural nets.",
        "In CART, for example, a tree is constructed by making binary splits on factors that minimize the variance of the durations in the two subsets defined by the split [2].",
        "These methods are called \"general purpose\" because they can be used across a variety of substantive domains.",
        "There also exists an older tradition exemplified by Klatt [3, 4, 5] and others [6, 7, 8, 9] where duration is computed with duration models, i.e., simple arithmetic models specifically designed for segmental duration.",
        "For example, in Klatt's",
        "model the duration for feature vector f E F is given by DUR(f ) =",
        "Here, fi is the j-th component3 of the vector f, the second subscript (j) in Si ,j likewise refers to this component, and the first subscript (i) refers to the fact that the model consists of two product terms numbered 1 and 2.",
        "The parameters si j are called factor scales.",
        "For example, 81,1 (stressed) = 1.40.",
        "All current duration models have in common that they (1) use factor scales, and (2) combine the effects of multiple factors using only the addition and multiplication operations.",
        "The general class of models defined by these two characteristics, sums-of-products models, has been found to have useful mathematical and statistical properties [10].",
        "Briefly, here is how these two standard approaches compare with ours.",
        "We share with general-purpose statistical methods the emphasis on formal data analysis methods, and with the older tradition the usage of sums-of-products models.",
        "Our approach differs in the following respects.",
        "First, although we concur with the modeling tradition that segmental duration data – and in particular the types of interactions one often finds in these data – can be accurately described by sums-of-products models, this class of models is extremely large so that one has to put considerable effort in searching for the most appropriate model .4 The few models that this tradition has generated make up a vanishingly small portion of a vast space of possibilities, and because they have not been systematically tested against these other possibilities [11] we should consider the search for better models completely open.",
        "Second, in contrast with the general-purpose methods approach, the process by which we construct our prediction system is not a one-step procedure but is a multi-step process with an important role being played by various forms of exploratory data analysis."

      "heading": "2.1. Interactions between contextual factors",
      "text": [
        "A first reason for duration prediction being difficult is that segmental duration is affected by many interacting factors.",
        "In a recent study, we found eight factors to have large effects on vowel duration [12], and if one were to search the literature for all factors that at least one study found to have statistically significant effects the result would be a list of two dozen or more factors [13, 14, 15].",
        "nants in two stress conditions: unstressed/stressed and stressed/unstressed.",
        "These factors interact in the quantitative sense that the magnitude of an effect (in ms or in percent) is affected by other factors.",
        "Table 1 shows durations of intervocalic consonants in two contexts defined by syllabic stress: preceding vowel unstressed / following vowel stressed (/f/ in \"before\"); and: preceding vowel stressed / following vowel unstressed (/f/ in \"buffer\"; /t/ is usually flapped in this context).",
        "The Table shows that the effects of stress are much larger for some consonants than for others: a consonant x stress interaction.",
        "Other examples of interactions include postvocalic consonant x phrasal position _and syllabic stress x pitch accent [12].",
        "These interactions imply that segmental duration can be described neither by the additive model [9] (because the differences vary) nor by the multiplicative model [7] (because the percentages vary).5 In contrast, the Klatt model was specif-5In the additive model DUR(f) = 31,1 (fi) + • • • • sn,n(f.); in the multiplicative model DUR(f) = si,i (ft) X • • • x st,n(f.).",
        "ically constructed to describe certain interactions, in particular the postvocalic consonant x phrasal position interaction.",
        "However, in an effort to use the Klatt model for text-to-speech synthesis it became clear that this model needed significant modifications to describe interactions involving other factors [5].",
        "Recent tests further confirmed systematic violations of the model [11].",
        "Thus, the existence of large interactions is undeniable, but current sums-of-products models have not succeeded in capturing these interactions.",
        "General-purpose prediction systems such as CART, of course, can handle arbitrarily intricate interactions [16]."

      "heading": "2.2. Lopsided sparsity",
      "text": [
        "Because there are many factors – several of which have more than two values – the feature space is quite large.",
        "The statistical distribution of the feature vectors exhibits an unpleasant property that we shall call \"lopsided sparsity\".",

        "of contextual vectors for various sample sizes.",
        "Table 2 illustrates the concept.",
        "We analyzed 797,524 sentences, names, and addresses (total word token count: 5,868,172; total segment count 22,249,882) by computing for each segment the feature vector characterizing those aspects of the context that we found to be relevant for segmental duration.",
        "This characterization is relatively coarse and leaves out many distinctions (such as – for vowel duration – the place of articulation of post-vocalic consonants).",
        "Nevertheless, the total feature vector type count was 17,547.",
        "Of these 17,547 types, about 10 percent occurred only once in the entire data base and 40 percent occurred less than once in a million.",
        "Two aspects of the table are of interest.",
        "The second column shows that once sample size exceeds 5,000 the type count increases linearly with the logarithm of the sample size, with no signs of deceleration.",
        "In other words, although the linguistic space is certainly much smaller than the feature space, it is unknown whether its size is 20,000, 30,000, or significantly",
        "larger than that.",
        "The third column shows that even in samples as small as 320 segments (the equivalent of a small paragraph) one can be certain to encounter feature vectors that occur only once in a million segment tokens.",
        "It is often suspected that general-purpose prediction systems can have serious problems with frequency imbalance in the training set, in particular when many feature vectors are outright missing.",
        "Experiments performed with CART confirmed this suspicion.",
        "In a three-factor, 36-element feature space, with artificial durations generated by the Klatt model, we found that removing 66 percent of the feature vectors from the training set produced a CART tree that performed quite poorly on test data.",
        "Similarly, neural nets can have the property that decision boundaries are sensitive to relative frequencies of feature vectors in the training sample (e.g., [17]), thereby leading to poor performance on infrequent vectors.",
        "The key reason for these difficulties is that the ability to accurately predict durations for feature vectors for which the training set provides few or no data points is a form of interpolation, which in turn requires assumptions about the general form of the mapping from the feature space onto durations (the response surface).",
        "Precisely because they are general-purpose, these methods make minimal assumptions about the response surface, which in practice often means that the duration assigned to a missing feature vector is left to chance.",
        "For example, in CART an infinitesimal disturbance can have a major impact on the tree branching pattern.",
        "Even when this has little effect on the fit of the tree to the training data, it can have large effects on which duration is assigned to a missing feature vector.",
        "In subsection 2.4, we will argue that the response surface for segmental duration can be described particularly well by sums-of-products models, so that these models are able to generate accurate durations for (near-) missing feature vectors.",
        "It should be noted that for certain applications, in particular automatic speech recognition, poor performance on infrequent feature vectors need not be critical because lexical access can make up for errors.",
        "Current implementations of text-to-speech synthesis systems, however, do not have error correction mechanisms.",

        "A final complicating aspect of segmental duration is that, given the same input text, the same speaker (speaking at the same speed, and with the same speaking instructions) produces durations that are quite variable.",

        "This means that one needs either multiple observations for each feature vector so that statistically stable mean values can be computed, or data analysis techniques that are relatively insensitive to statistical noise.",

        "7).",
        "Taken together these results make it quite plausible that when data exhibit the types of ordinal patterns often observed in segmental duration, some sums-of-products model will fit the data.",
        "To really make the case for the importance of ordinal patterns, we must make the further key assumption that the ordinal patterns of the response surface discovered in the training data base can be found in the language in general (restricted to the same speaker and speaking mode).",
        "This is based on the belief that the structure discovered in the data is the result of stable properties of the speech production apparatus.",
        "For example, the non-reversal of the syllabic stress factor can be linked to the supposition that stressed syllables are pronounced with more subglottal pressure, increased tension of the vocal chords, and larger articulatory excursions than unstressed syllables.",
