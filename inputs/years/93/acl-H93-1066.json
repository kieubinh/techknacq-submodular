        "Disfluencies in spontaneous speech pose serious problems for spoken language systems.",
        "First, a speaker may produce a partial word or FRAGMENT, a string of phonemes that does not form the complete word intended by the speaker.",
        "Some fragments may coincidentally match words actually in the lexicon, as in (1); others will be identified with the acoustically closest lexicon item(s), as in (2).1",

        "(2) Actual string: What is the fare fro – on American Airlines fourteen forty three",
        "Recognized string: With fare four American Airlines fourteen forty three Even if all words in a disfluent segment are correctly recognized, failure to detect the location of a disfluency may lead to interpretation errors during subsequent processing, as in (3):",
        "(3) ...Delta leaving Boston seventeen twenty one arriving Fort Worth twenty two twenty one forty and flight number...",
        "Here, 'twenty two twenty one forty' must somehow be interpreted as a flight arrival time; the system must choose on some basis among '21:40', '22:21', and '22:40'.",
        "Although studies of large speech corpora have found that approximately 10% of spontaneous utterances contain disflu-encies involving self-correction, or REPAIRS [2, 3], little is known about how to integrate repair processing with real-time speech recognition and with incremental syntactic and semantic analysis of partial utterances in spoken language systems.",
        "In particular, the speech signal itself has been relatively unexplored as a source of processing cues that may facilitate the detection and correction of repairs.",
        "In this paper, we present results from a pilot study examining the acoustic and prosodic characteristics of all repairs (146) occurring in 1,453 utterances from the DARPA Air Travel Information System (ATIS) database.",

      "text": [
        "While self-correction has long been a topic of psycholinguistic study, computational work in this area has been sparse.",
        "Early work in computational linguistics included repairs as one type of ill-formed input and proposed solutions based upon extensions to existing text parsing techniques such as augmented transition networks (ATNs), network-based semantic grammars, case frame grammars, pattern matching and deterministic parsing [5, 6, 2, 7, 8].",
        "Recently, Shriberg et al.",
        "1992 and Bear et a1.1992 [3, 9] have proposed a two-stage method for processing repairs that integrates lexical, syntactic, semantic, and acoustic information.",
        "In the first stage, lexical pattern matching rules are used to retrieve candidate repair utterances.",
        "In the second stage, syntactic, semantic, and acoustic information is used to filter the true repairs from the false positives.",
        "By these methods, [9] report identifying 309 repairs in the 406 utterances in their 10,718 utterance corpus which contained `nontrivial' repairs and incorrectly hypothesizing repairs in 191 fluent utterances, which represents recall of 76% with precision of 62%.",
        "Of the 62% containing self-repairs, [9] report finding the appropriate correction for 57%.",
        "matching approaches suffer from several limitations.",
        "First, the assumption that correct text transcriptions will be available from existing speech recognizers is problematic, since current systems rely primarily upon language models and lexicons derived from fluent speech to decide among competing acoustic hypotheses.",
        "These systems usually treat disfluencies in training and recognition as noise; moreover, they have no way of modeling word fragments, even though these occur in the majority of repairs.",
        "Second, detection and correction strategies are defined in terms of ad hoc patterns; it is not clear how one repair type is related to another or how the set of existing patterns should be augmented to improve performance.",
        "Third, from a computational point of view, it seems preferable that spoken language systems detect a repair as early as possible, to permit early pruning of the hypothesis space, rather than carrying along competing hypotheses, as in \"text-first\" approaches.",
        "Fourth, utterances containing overlapping repairs such as (4) (noted in [2, p. 123]) cannot be handled by simple surface structure manipulations.",
        "(4) I think that it you get– it's more strict in Catholic schools.",
        "Finally, on a cognitive level, there is recent psycholinguistic evidence that humans detect repairs in the vicinity of the interruption point, well before the end of the repair utterance [10, 11, 12].",
        "An exception to \"text-first\" approaches is Hindle 1983 [2].",
        "Hindle decouples repair detection from repair correction.",
        "His correction strategies rely upon an inventory of three repair types that are defined in relation to independently formulated linguistic principles.",
        "Importantly, Hindle allows non-surface-based transformations as correction strategies.",
        "A related property is that the correction of a single repair may be achieved by sequential application of several correction rules.",
        "Hindle classifies repairs as 1) full sentence restarts, in which an entire utterance is re-initiated; 2) constituent repairs, in which one syntactic constituent is replaced by another;2 and 3) surface level repairs, in which identical strings appear adjacent to each other.",
        "Correction strategies for each repair type are defined in terms of extensions to a deterministic parser.",
        "The application of a correction routine is triggered by an hypothesized acoustic/phonetic EDIT SIGNAL, \"a markedly abrupt cut-off of the speech signal\" (Hindle 1983 [2, p. 123], cf. Labov 1966 [4]), which is assumed to mark the interruption of fluent speech.",
        "Hindle's methods achieved a success rate of 97% on a transcribed corpus of 1,500 sentences in which the edit signal was 2 This is consistent with Levelt 1983's [13] observation that the material to be replaced and the correcting material in a repair often share structural properties akin to those shared by coordinated constituents.",

        "As Hindle [2] noted, if the processing of disfluencies were not rule-governed, it would be difficult to reconcile the infrequent intrusion of disfluencies on human speech comprehension, especially for language learners, with their frequent rate of occurrence in spontaneous speech.",

        "To obtain objective measures of relative prominence, we compared absolute f0 and energy in the sonorant center of the last accented lexical item in the reparandum with that of the first accented item in the repair interval.6 We found a small but reliable increase in f0 from the end of the reparandum to the beginning of the repair (mean=5.2 Hz, p<.001, tstat=3.16, df=131).",

        "we compared the f0 and amplitude changes from reparandum to repair with those observed for fluent pauses, we found no significant differences between the two populations.",

        "While we find small but significant changes in two correlates of intonational prominence from the reparandum to the repair, the distributions of change in f0 and energy for our data are unimodal; when we separate repairs in our corpus into Levelt and Cutler's error repairs and appropriateness repairs, statistical analysis does not support Levelt and Cutler's claim that only the former group is intonationally 'marked'.",
        "Previous studies of disfluency have paid considerable attention to the vicinity of the IS but little to the repair offset.",
        "Yet, locating the repair offset (the end of the correcting material) is crucial for the delimitation of segments over which correction strategies operate.",
        "One simple hypothesis we tested is that repair interval offsets are intonationally marked by minor or major prosodic phrase boundaries.",
        "We found that the repair offset co-occurs with minor phrase boundaries for 49% of TI set repairs.",
        "To see whether these boundaries were distinct from those in fluent speech, we compared the phrasing of repair utterances with phrasing predicted for the corresponding `correct' version of the utterance.",
        "To predict phrasing, we used a procedure reported by Wang & Hirschberg 1992 [21] that uses statistical modeling techniques to predict phrasing from a large corpus of labeled ATIS speech; we used a prediction tree that achieves 88.4% accuracy on the ATIS TI corpus.",
        "For the TI set, we found that, for 40% of all repairs, an actual boundary occurs at the repair offset where one is predicted; and for 33% of all repairs, no actual boundary occurs where none is predicted.",

        "In addition to these difference observed at the repair offset, we also found more general differences from predicted phrasing over the entire repair interval, which we hypothesize may be partly understood as follows: Two strong predictors of prosodic phrasing in fluent speech are syntactic constituency [22, 23, 24], especially the relative inviolability of noun phrases [21], and the length of prosodic phrases [23, 25].",
        "On the one hand, we found occurrences of phrase boundaries at repair offsets which occurred within larger NPs, as in (6), where it is precisely the noun modifier – not the entire noun phrase – which is corrected.7",
        "(6) Show me all n– round-trip I flights I from Pittsburgh I to Atlanta.",
        "We speculate that, by marking off the modifier intonationally, a speaker may signal that operations relating just this phrase to earlier portions of the utterance can achieve the proper correction of the disfluency.",
        "We also found cases of 'lengthened' intonational phrases in repair intervals, as illustrated in the single-phrase reparandum in (7), where the corresponding fluent version of the reparandum is predicted to contain four phrases.",
        "(7) What airport is it I is located I what is the name of the airport located in San Francisco Again, we hypothesize that the role played by this unusually long phrase is the same as that of early phrase boundaries in NPs discussed above.",
        "In both cases, the phrase boundary delimits a meaningful unit for subsequent correction strategies.",
        "For example, we might understand the multiple repairs in (7) as follows: First the speaker attempts a VP repair, with the repair phrase delimited by a single prosodic phrase 'is lo-cated'.",
        "Then the initially repaired utterance 'What airport is located' is itself repaired, with the reparadum again delimited by a single prosodic phrase, 'What is the name of the airport located in San Francisco'.",
        "While a larger corpus must be examined in order to fully characterize the relationship between prosodic boundaries at repair offsets and those in fluent speech, we believe that the differences we have observed are promising.",
