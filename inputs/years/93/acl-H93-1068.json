        "Any two successive words may vary as to their syntactic or semantic cohesiveness.",
        "The latter is likely to be stronger if the two words are part of the same linguistic constituent; conversely, the occurrence of a constituent boundary between words decreases their degree of cohesiveness.",
        "For example, in the sentence \"(the man) (is sitting) (in the chair)\", any two words separated by round brackets are structurally farther apart than those within a pair of brackets.",
        "Speakers are capable of making the juncture between constituents audible by prosodic means: they may produce appropriate cues in terms of pause, pitch and duration parameters.",
        "Listeners, on the other hand, can make use of these cues to segment the incoming flow of speech into word sequences that may be treated as a whole, which facilitates the comprehension process.",
        "In certain cases, prosodic demarcation may help in resolving structural ambiguity, for instance in utterances of the type \"The girl saw the man with the telescope\", in which the prepositional phrase specifies either the verb or its direct object [1, 2].",
        "But in utterances containing no surface syntactic homonymy, too, prosodic boundaries may delineate coherent word groups and lend support to the listener's hypotheses about syntactic-semantic structure as, for instance, in \"the beautiful girl / with brown eyes / told her story / to the psychiatrist\" [3].",
        "This paper presents results of research that, starting from the observation that listeners do provide prosodic boundary cues, addresses two main questions:",
        "(a) Can listeners assign a value of Perceived Boundary Strength (PBS) to word boundaries?",
        "(b) If so, what is the relationship between PBS and different (combinations of) suprasegmental features?",
        "The answer to these questions may lead to a better model of what prosodic resources a speaker can draw on to highlight the syntactic-semantic structure of an utterance.",
        "Such insight may, in turn, contribute to improved prosody in speech synthesis, by making it sound more natural and –more importantly– by making it linguistically more transparent and therefore easier to comprehend.",
        "This research may also shed light on how a listener makes use of the demarcative information encoded in prosodic features.",
        "In that respect, it has relevance for (knowledge-based) automatic speech recognition, where the inclusion of prosodic information may support the syntactic-semantic parse of the input, especially if the latter contains structural ambiguities.",
        "This line of research is in agreement with the growing interest in the communicative function of prosody, which may contain information not only about utterance-internal phrasing, as already suggested above [4], but also about the topical organization of discourse in monologues and dialogues [5] or about speaker-dependent features such as emotional state [6]."

      "heading": "4. CONCLUSIONS",
      "text": [
        "Our experimental investigation has brought to light that speakers and listeners alike are aware of the role pitch and pause can play in utterance-internal phrasing.",
        "These prosodic parameters can effectively highlight how the utterance is to be chunked into coherent word groups.",
        "As is often the case with prosody, there is no obligation on the speaker's side to actually use pitch or pause for a communicative purpose, such as boundary marking.",
        "In fact, we have seen (in Table 1) that our professional speaker produces more numerous prosodic cues and that all three speakers differ in the relative frequency of use of pitch or pause devices.",
        "But, whenever listeners are offered particular (combinations of) prosodic cues, they agree well on how to interpret them in terms of PBS (see Figure 2).",
        "Thus, there seems to be prosodic freedom on the speaker's side, while the listener cannot help but pay attention to melodic or temporal cues whenever they are present.",
        "Apparently, a certain amount of gradience is involved in the marking of constituent boundaries: the strength of a prosodic boundary reflects to some extent the depth of the syntactic-semantic juncture at a given point in the utterance.",
        "It is not unlikely that the inclusion of additional prosodic parameters, such as local variations in speech rhythm (in particular preboundary lengthening), will add detail to the emerging picture of syntax-to-prosody correspondence.",
        "But pitch and pause alone already show sufficiently clear relations to the linguistic structure of the utterance, that their capacity to reveal this structure can be exploited tentatively in text-to-speech conversion and in automatic speech recognition.",
        "Finally, the gradience that can be observed in the PBS values of Figure 2, shows that listeners can do better than merely distinguishing between presence or absence of a boundary.",
        "On the basis of our limited set of data, it is not possible to determine exactly how many categories listeners can discriminate reliably.",
        "This will be partly determined by the number and the nature of the phonetic cues, and need not be limited to a maximum of three (no boundary, minor boundary, major boundary).",
        "Indeed, Figure 2 suggests that it is not unreasonable to assume that listeners can handle five PBS categories.",
        "Interestingly, such a five-level distinction is used in the TOBI labelling scheme [9].",
        "However, an important difference between the two approaches is that the TOBI scheme obliges labelers to explicitly assess the nature of the phonetic cues, while PBS values are the result of a purely intuitive judgment."
