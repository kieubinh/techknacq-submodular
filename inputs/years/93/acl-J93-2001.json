        "As the use of computer-based text corpora has become increasingly important for research in natural language processing, lexicography, and descriptive linguistics, issues relating to corpus design have also assumed central importance.",
        "Two main considerations are important here: 1) the size of the corpus (including the length and number of text samples), and 2) the range of text categories (or registers) that samples are selected from.'",
        "Within social science, these considerations are associated with the two main kinds of error that can threaten 'external validity' (the extent to which it is possible to generalize from a sample to a larger target population): 'random error' and 'bias error.'",
        "Random error occurs when a sample is not large enough to accurately estimate the true population; bias error occurs when the selection of a sample is systematically",
        "* Department of English, Northern Arizona University, P. 0.",
        "Box 6032, Flagstaff, AZ 86011-6032; biber@nauvax.bitnet.",
        "1 Corpus designs can differ along several other parameters, including: 1. bounded/static versus unbounded/dynamic; 2. richly encoded versus minimally encoded (e.g., grammatical tagging, phonological/prosodic encoding, tagging of social characteristics (of participants) and situational characteristics); 3. complete texts versus samples from texts; 4. selection of texts: convenience versus purposeful versus random within strata versus proportional random.",
        "Recent debates concerning the design of general purpose corpora have often divided into two opposing camps emphasizing one or the other source of error: those advocating large corpora versus those advocating \"balanced\" corpora (i.e., including a wide range of registers).",
        "For example, the ACL Data Collection Initiative (DCI) and the Linguistic Data Consortium are focusing on the rapid collection and dissemination of very large corpora, with relatively little attention to the range of registers; older corpora, such as the Brown Corpus and LOB Corpus, are small by present-day standards but are explicitly structured to 'represent a wide range of styles and varieties' (Francis and Ktt'era 1964 [cf. Johansson, Leech, and Goodluck 1978]).",
        "Projects such as the COBUILD Corpus, Longman/Lancaster Corpus, and British National Corpus (BNC) combine both emphases to varying extents.",
        "Although all of these corpora could be considered \"representative\" of at least some varieties of English, it is important to address the question of whether the varieties represented match the intended uses of a corpus.",
        "For example, studies of a single sublanguage are legitimately based on corpora representing only that variety, such as journal articles on lipoprotein kinetics (Sager 1986), Navy telegraphic messages (Fitzpatrick et al.",
        "1986), weather reports (Lehrberger 1982), and aviation maintenance manuals (Kittredge 1982).",
        "One of the main issues addressed here, though, is whether general language studies must be based on a corpus that is register-diversified as well as large.",
        "Some proponents of very large corpora have suggested that size can compensate for a lack of diversity â€“ that if a corpus is large enough, it will represent the range of linguistic patterns in a language, even though it represents only a restricted range of registers.",
        "Given this assumption, linguistic analyses of any very large corpus could be generalized to the entire language.",
        "In contrast, I argue here that analyses must be based on a diversified corpus representing a wide range of registers in order to be appropriately generalized to the language as a whole, as in a dictionary or grammar of English, or a general purpose tagging program for English.2 In fact, global generalizations are often not accurate at all, because there is no adequate overall linguistic characterization of the entire language; rather, there are marked linguistic differences across registers (or sublanguages; cf. Kittredge 1982).",
        "Thus a complete description of the language often entails a composite analysis of features as they function in various registers.",
        "Such analyses must be based on corpora representing the range of registers.",
        "In the following discussion, I first briefly illustrate the extent of cross-register differences from consideration of individual grammatical and lexical features.",
        "Section 2.1 focuses on the marked differences in the distribution of dependent clauses across registers.",
        "This section then shows that register differences are also important for probabilistic part-of-speech taggers and syntactic parsers, because the probabilities associated with grammatically ambiguous forms are often markedly different across registers.",
        "Section 2.2 focuses on adjectives marking 'certainty' to illustrate how lexical patterns are also distributed differently across registers.",
        "Section 3 makes this point more strongly by describing a multidimensional analysis of numerous linguistic features in a register-diversified corpus of English.",
        "The analysis shows that linguistic features from all levels function together as underly",
        "ing dimensions of variation, and that there are systematic and important linguistic differences among registers with respect to these dimensions.",
        "The extent of those differences clearly shows that linguistic analyses based on a restricted corpus cannot be generalized to the language as a whole.",
        "Section 4, then, shows how multidimensional analyses of register variation can be used to address additional computational issues.",
        "First, Section 4.1 discusses the application of the multidimensional model of English to predict the register category of texts automatically with a high degree of accuracy.",
        "The predictive power of the model at three levels of abstraction is tested.",
        "In Section 4.2, then, I turn to cross-linguistic patterns of register variation, illustrating how multidimensional analyses of register-diversified corpora in English, Nukulaelae Tuvaluan, Korean, and Somali enable register comparisons of a kind not otherwise possible, providing the background for more detailed investigations of particular subregisters or sublanguages."

        "One of the main uses of general text corpora has been to provide grammatical descriptions of particular linguistic features, such as nominal premodification structures, relative clauses, verb and particle combinations, and clefts and pseudoclefts (see the numerous entries in the bibliography of corpus-based studies compiled by Altenberg [1991]).",
        "Two findings repeatedly come out of this literature: first, individual linguistic features are distributed differently across registers, and second, the same (or similar) linguistic features can have different functions in different registers.",
        "The linguistic description of dependent clauses in English illustrates these patterns.",
        "Although these constructions are often treated as a single coherent system, the various types of structural dependency actually have quite different distributions and functions in English (cf. Biber 1988, 1992).",
        "For example, Table 1 shows that relative clauses are quite frequent in official documents and prepared speeches but quite rare in conversation.",
        "In contrast, causative adverbial subordination occurs most frequently in conversation and is quite rare in official documents and press reports.",
        "Finally, that complement clauses occur most frequently in prepared speeches, and with moderate frequencies in conversations and press reports, but they are rare in official documents.",
        "There is further variation within these structural categories.",
        "For example, most rel",
        "ative clauses in official documents have WH rather than that relative pronouns (7.7 out of 8.6 total), while the two types are evenly split in conversation (1.6 WH relative clauses versus 1.3 that relatives).",
        "Although causative adverbial clauses are generally more frequent in spoken registers, clauses headed by as/since occur almost exclusively in writing (although they are relatively rare in both modes); clauses headed by because are much more frequent in speech (Tottie 1986).",
        "Biber (1992) uses confirmatory factor analysis, building on corpus-based frequency counts of this type, to show that discourse complexity is itself a multidimensional construct; different types of structural elaboration reflect different discourse functions, and different registers are complex in different ways (in addition to being more or less complex).",
        "The analysis further identifies a fundamental distinction between the discourse complexities of written and spoken registers: written registers exhibit many complexity profiles, differing widely in both the extent and the kinds of complexity, while spoken registers manifest a single major pattern differing only in extent.",
        "tion 2.1.1 have important implications for probabilistic tagging and parsing techniques, which depend on accurate estimates of the relative likelihood of grammatical categories in particular contexts.",
        "Two kinds of probabilistic information are commonly used in part-of-speech taggers: 1) for ambiguous lexical items, the relative probability of each grammatical category (e.g., abstract as a noun, adjective, and verb); and 2) for groups of ambiguous words, the relative probability of various tag sequences (e.g., the likelihood of a noun being followed by a verb, adjective, or another noun).",
        "To investigate whether grammatically ambiguous words have different distributions across registers, I compiled two separate on-line dictionaries from the LOB Corpus: one based on the expository registers, and one from the fiction registers.",
        "Table 2 presents descriptive statistics from a comparison of these two dictionaries.",
        "The first observation is that many words occurred in only one of the dictionaries.",
        "This is not surprising in the case of exposition, since there were over twice as many lexical entries in the exposition dictionary.",
        "However, it is more surprising that there were over 6000 words that occurred only in fiction.",
        "These included many common words, such as cheek, kissed, grandpa, sofa, wallet, briefcase, intently, and impatiently.",
        "A comparison of the probabilities of words occurring in both dictionaries is even more revealing.",
        "One thousand ten words had probability differences greater than 50%, while another nine hundred eighty words had probability differences greater than 30%.",
        "These words represented many lexical types.",
        "For example, the first group of words listed on Table 2 are past participle forms.",
        "There is a strong likelihood that the -ed forms (i.e., admitted, observed, remembered, expected) will function as past tense verbs in fiction (probabilities of 77%, 91%, 89%, and 54%) but as passive verbs in exposition (probabilities of 67%, 45%, 72%, and 77%).",
        "The word observed shows a slightly different pattern in that it has a relatively high probability of occurring as an adjective in exposition (33%).",
        "In fiction, the -ed forms never occur as adjectives, apart from the 4% likelihood for remembered.",
        "Finally, the two true participles (known and given) are most likely to occur as perfect aspect verbs in fiction (65% and 77% likelihood), but they are similar to the -ed forms in typically occurring as passive verbs in exposition (65% and 71%).",
        "The words in the second group on Table 2 represent noun/verb/ adjective ambiguities.",

        "One issue of current relevance within computational linguistics is the automated prediction of register category, as a preliminary step to work in information retrieval, machine translation, and other kinds of text processing.",
        "Because the model of register variation summarized in the last section is multidimensional, with each dimension comprising a different set of linguistic features and representing a different set of relations among registers, it is well suited to this research question.",
        "One statistical procedure commonly used for classificatory purposes is discriminant analysis.",
        "This procedure computes the generalized squared distance between a text and each text category (or register), and the text is then automatically classified as belonging to the closest category.8 To illustrate, Figure 2 plots the five-dimensional profiles of three target registers (academic prose, fiction, and newspaper reportage) together with an unclassified text 6 Because registers can be specified at many different levels of generality, there is no \"correct\" set of register distinctions for a language; rather, I have argued elsewhere that registers should be seen as semi-continuous (rather than discrete) constructs varying along multiple situational parameters (Biber, in press, b).",
        "Further, since registers are defined situationally rather than on a linguistic basis, they are not equally coherent in their linguistic characteristics.",
        "Some registers have quite focused norms and therefore show little internal linguistic variation (e.g., science fiction).",
        "Registers such as popular magazine articles, on the other hand, include a wide range of purposes, and thus show extensive linguistic differences among the texts within the register (cf. the investigations in Biber 1988, Chapter 8; Biber 1990).",
        "7 The statistical procedure used to identify linguistically well-defined text types is called cluster analysis.",
        "This procedure identifies concentrations of texts such that the texts within each cluster, or text type, are maximally similar to one another in their linguistic characteristics, while the types are maximally distinct from one another.",
        "Biber (1989) identifies eight major text types in English, which are interpretively labeled: Intimate Interpersonal Interaction, Informational Interaction, \"Scientific\" Exposition, Learned Exposition, Imaginative Narrative, General Narrative Exposition, Situated Reportage, and Involved Persuasion.",
        "Biber (in press, c) compares the text type distinctions in English and Somali.",

        "Five-dimensional distance profile of unclassified text to three target registers.",
        "(which is in fact a social science academic article).9 With respect to Dimensions 1 and 4, the unclassified text is about equidistant to the mean scores for academic prose and newspaper reportage, but along Dimensions 2, 3, and 5, the unclassified text is much closer to the target means for academic prose.",
        "Generalizing over all five dimensions, this text has the smallest distance to academic prose and would be classified into that category.",
        "The predictive power of this five-dimensional model of variation was tested at three levels of abstraction.",
        "The first test was based on texts from three high-level register categories: newspaper articles (including press reportage, editorials, and reviews), academic prose (including humanities, social science, medicine, natural science, and engineering), and fiction.",
        "Table 9 presents the discriminant analysis results for these categories.",
        "The top part of the table presents the calibration results: the model was trained on 118 texts from these three categories and then used to classify the same",
        "texts.",
        "The rates for successful prediction are high in all three cases.",
        "This model was then tested on a new set of 124 'unknown texts; the rates for successful classification are still high (ranging from 68.89% to 84.62%), although not as high as in the calibration data.",
        "Academic prose and fiction are clearly distinguished, with no misclassifications between these two groups.",
        "Newspaper texts are less sharply distinguished from the other two categories: 28.89% of the newspaper texts are incorrectly classified as academic prose; 27.5% of the academic prose texts are incorrectly classified as newspaper texts; and 15.38% of the fiction texts are incorrectly classified as newspaper texts.",
        "Overall, though, the large majority of texts in these three categories are correctly classified by the five-dimensional model.",
        "Table 10 shows that roughly the same success rate can be achieved at a more specific level of prediction: distinguishing among press reportage, editorials, and reviews within newspapers.",
        "The calibration model shows success rates ranging from 69.23% to 87.5% for these three categories, and the test data are correctly predicted at comparable rates (ranging from 68.18% to 92.86%).",
        "Finally, Table 11 applies this technique at a much more specific level, attempting to discriminate among four kinds of press reportage that differ primarily in their content domains: political, sports, spot news, and financial reportage.",
        "In this case, only the",

        "Calibration results: Classification of the 43 newspaper texts used to derive the discriminant function",
        "calibration results are reported because of the small sample size.",
        "The results indicate, however, a high success rate (ranging from 61.54% to 85.71%), suggesting that this approach can be profitably used for prediction among closely related subregisters or sublanguages.",
        "The predictive power of this technique is only as robust as the underlying model of variation.",
        "In the present case, that model represents multiple dimensions of linguistic variation derived from analysis of a register-diversified corpus, and the results achieved are generally robust for the successful prediction of different kinds of text at quite different levels of abstraction."

        "Some of the provocative conclusions of that study are:",
        "â€¢ \"the written style of English and French tended to be more similar in specialized technical texts than in general language texts\" (1982, p. 108).",
        "â€¢ \"parallel sublanguages of English and French are much more similar structurally than are dissimilar sublanguages of the same language.",
        "Parallel sublanguages seem to correspond more closely when the domain of reference is a technical one\" (1982, p. 108).",
        "The multidimensional framework provides a complementary approach to these issues.",
        "From a linguistic perspective, dimensions are more readily compared cross-linguistically than individual features, since structurally similar features often serve quite different functional roles across languages.",
        "Similarly, cross-linguistic comparisons of individual registers are more readily interpretable when they are situated relative to the range of other registers in each language, since the 'same' registers can serve quite different functions across languages when considered relative to their respective register systems.",
        "To date, there have been multidimensional analyses of register variation in four languages: English (summarized in Section 3), Nukulaelae Tuvaluan (Besnier 1988), Korean (Kim and Biber in press), and Somali (Biber and Hared 1992, in press).",
        "In each case, the description is based on analysis of a diversified corpus representing a wide range of spoken and written registers.",
        "The cross-linguistic patterns of variation represented by these four languages, both synchronic and diachronic, are discussed in Biber (in press, c).",
        "To illustrate, the multidimensional analysis of English (discussed above; see Table 7) can be compared with the multidimensional patterns of variation in Somali, summarized in Table 12.",
        "Both languages represent many of the same functional considerations in their dimensional structure, including interactiveness, involvement, produc",
        "tion circumstances, informational focus, personal stance, and narrative purposes.",
        "There are also many similarities in the co-occurrence patterns among linguistic features.",
        "For example, first and second person pronouns, downtoners, stance features, contractions, and questions group together in both languages as markers of involvement; nouns and adjectives group together in both languages as markers of an informational focus; third person pronouns and past tense verbs group together in both languages as markers of narration.",
        "In other respects, though, the multidimensional structure of the two languages differ.",
        "For example, Somali has two dimensions marking different kinds of interaction plus a third dimension relating to production circumstances; all of these functions are combined into a single dimension in English (Dimension 1).",
        "Conversely, English Dimension 5 marks a passive, abstract style, which has no counterpart in Somali.",
        "One of the surprising findings from the comparison of all four languages (including Nukulaelae Tuvaluan and Korean) is the extent of the cross-linguistic similarities (see Biber, in press, c).",
        "Thus, all four languages have multiple dimensions reflecting oral/literate differences, interactiveness, production circumstances, and an informational focus; these dimensions are defined by similar kinds of linguistic features, and analogous registers have similar cross-linguistic characterizations along these dimensions.",
        "In addition, two functional domains that relate to purpose are marked in all four languages: personal stance (toward the content) and narration.",
        "These dimensions also have similar structural correlates across the languages.",
        "In contrast, there are fewer major differences among these languages in their patterns of register variation.",
        "Dimensions relating to argumentation/persuasion are found in only some languages, and there are other dimensions particular to a single language (such as abstract style in English, and honorification in Korean).",
        "Analogous registers show some differences cross-linguistically with respect to these latter dimensions plus the purpose-related dimensions mentioned above (e.g., marking personal stance or narration).",
        "Findings such as these are directly relevant to several of the issues raised in recent studies of sublanguages, since they can be used to specify the linguistic relations among sublanguages both within and across languages.",
        "In particular, these analyses support Kittredge's (1982) conclusion that parallel sublanguages across languages are more similar in their linguistic structure than are dissimilar sublanguages within the same language.",
