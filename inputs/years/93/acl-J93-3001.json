        "The Third Message Understanding Conference (MUC-3) represented a significant step for the message processing community and for computational linguistics as a whole.",
        "The conference brought together 15 systems that were tested on a naturally occurring corpus of newswire reports on terrorism in Latin America.",
        "The systems were evaluated on their ability to extract significant information from the newswire reports in the form of \"templates\" summarizing who did what to whom.",
        "We can enumerate the successes of the conference in many dimensions: the number of participating systems (15 systems, up from 8 at the previous Message Understanding Conference, MUCK-II), the scale of the application (100 times more text than the previous conference), the rigorous definition of the evaluation method (including automated and interactive scoring procedures), and the cooperative framework that enabled the participants to develop both the training data and the evaluation procedures.",
        "These are significant accomplishments in a field that has only recently begun to address system evaluation issues.",
        "The MUC-3 conference has already been described in a conference proceedings (Proceedings of the Third Message Understanding Conference (MUC-3), 1991) and in an AI",
        "Magazine article (Lehnert and Sundheim 1991).",
        "However, both of these reports were produced simultaneously with the system-building and evaluation activities of MUC3.",
        "It became clear that more time and additional analysis were needed to digest the findings of MUC-3 and to make them accessible to the broader computational linguistics community.",
        "This paper addresses these issues, providing an overview of the conference, the participating systems, the evaluation methodology, and system performance.",
        "We also present information on the statistical significance of the reported test results and an analysis of what we have learned, both about message understanding and about system evaluation.The authors participated extensively in the conference as consultants, but were not associated with a specific system undergoing formal evaluation."

        "The Third Message Understanding Conference evolved out of the two earlier message understanding conferences held in 1987 and 1989.",
        "Prior to 1987, formal evaluation of message processing (or text understanding) systems was virtually nonexistent.",
        "The dominant research paradigm was to build a natural language system and then to debug it on some set of examples.",
        "Sometimes the examples were made up for the purpose of debugging.",
        "In other cases, the system was debugged on a corpus of naturally occurring sentences.",
        "However, there was no notion of a \"blind test\" using previously unseen test data.",
        "The first Message Understanding Conference (MUCK) was held at the Naval Command, Control, and Ocean Surveillance Center RDT&E Division (NRaD)1 in May 1987.",
        "Organized by Beth Sundheim, its goal was a qualitative evaluation of the state of the art in message understanding.",
        "Six sites agreed to demonstrate running systems at the conference.",
        "A small set of training messages (ten tactical naval operations reports on ship sightings and engagements) was distributed, plus several hundred additional messages of various types, provided for general background.",
        "At the conference, each actively participating group demonstrated its system running on one of the twelve training messages.",
        "In addition, two previously unseen messages were distributed at the conference and all active participants were asked to get their systems running on these two new messages.",
        "The sites reported on what they needed to do to get their systems to handle the test messages.",
        "However there was no \"task\" associated with the messages and no quantitative evaluation procedure.",
        "A second conference, MUCK-Ill, was held in May 1989 at NRaD.",
        "Based on their experience at the first MUCK, participants requested that a specific task be provided, along with an evaluation procedure to determine whether a system's answers were right or wrong.",
        "The domain chosen for MUCK-II was another type of tactical naval operations message, also about ship sightings and engagements.",
        "The task consisted of filling in templates for incideni:s mentioned in each report.",
        "The template types included \"DETECT,\" \"ATTACK,\" and so on.",
        "For each template there was a set of slots describing the actors involved in the incident, as well as the time, date, outcome, and other related information.",
        "Eight sites submitted systems to be evaluated.",
        "There was a larger amount of training data provided (105 messages) and two rounds of test data (20 messages, run first \"blind\" and then with system fixes, followed, just before the conference, by an additional 5 messages for a second blind test).",
        "In addition to the test data, NRaD furnished a list of specialized naval terminology, a hierarchy of terms for the relevant portion of the naval domain, and extensive documentation on filling",
        "MUC-3 participants.",
        "templates.",
        "One portion of the evaluation that was not completely determined before the conference was a scoring procedure.",
        "Scoring guidelines were provided but sites scored their own runs by hand.",
        "This led to substantial variation in how answers were scored among sites, and resulted in a consensus that a more rigorous and objective scoring procedure was needed.",
        "Out of these experiences at the earlier message understanding conferences came MUC-3, held in May 1991.",
        "The major changes with MUC-3 were:",
        "1.",
        "A new, more general domain, namely Latin American terrorist activity, with text originating from foreign news sources.",
        "2.",
        "A tenfold increase in the number of training documents (1,300), and more than a hundredfold increase in number of words of text (approximately 400,000 words of text, with a vocabulary of 18,000 words).",
        "3.",
        "An automated, interactive scoring program and a rigorous definition of the scoring procedure, to promote bias-free, reproducible scores and to allow off-site testing.",
        "4.",
        "A broadening of the task to require distinguishing relevant from irrelevant messages."

        "Some excerpts of speeches appeared embedded in news reports.",
        "Interviews with single or multiple interviewers appeared as entire messages or as excerpts embedded in news reports.",
        "Infrequently, messages contained transcripts of news conferences with moderator, guests, and reporters speaking.",

        "Articles were sometimes split into message-length segments of approximately two pages each and were annotated to indicate continuation.",
        "The texts contained nonstandard constructions resulting from the translation of Spanish to English and also contained unflagged errors, including typographical errors, misspellings, omitted words, grammatical errors, and punctuation errors.",
        "In addition, the texts posed other challenges including the frequent use of",
        "Spanish names, untranslated words, and Spanish acronyms followed or preceded by the corresponding full phrase in English or Spanish.",
        "1.4.4 Nature of the Template Fills.",
        "The MUC-3 template fill task was complex not only because of the richness of the textual data but also because of the variety of information required to fill template slots and because of the interdependencies among the slot fillers.",
        "The templates contained 18 slots.",
        "The message-id and template-id slots identified the template.",
        "If the message did not contain information on terrorist events, it was considered irrelevant.",
        "In this case, only an empty template was generated with just the message-id slot filled.",
        "If the message was relevant, there could be one or more templates generated for the message.",
        "The possibility that a message contained more than one relevant incident made the MUC-3 task considerably more difficult than a task requiring only one template per message.",
        "To determine the relevance of an incident in a message, a system needed to determine the dates of any possible terrorist acts, discriminate between old and new information, discriminate between vague and specific descriptions, determine what country the perpetrators and/or targets belonged to, discriminate between terrorism and either general criminal activity or guerrilla warfare, and determine whether the incident was actual, attempted, or threatened as opposed to planned, denied, or hypothetical.",
        "To fill the slots in the template, the systems needed to isolate the incidents in each message and to extract information about the associated perpetrators and targets.",
        "Aspects of the terrorist action such as the date, location, instruments used, and the effects on the targets also had to be extracted.",
        "In order to extract the data and place it in the template correctly, systems had to resolve ambiguous information, infer information from vague references, categorize some of the information into predetermined classes of entities, put data into canonical form, and show links among certain data items.",
        "The template slots fell into formal categories depending on the nature of correct fillers.",
        "A slot filler could be a string directly extracted from the text (e.g., \"FASTFOOD RESTAURANT\"), a member of a finite set of fills (e.g., \"TERRORIST ACT\"), a numerical response (e.g., \"36\"), a specially formatted response such as a date or location (e.g., \"07 SEP 89\"), or a null value (e.g., \"-\" or \"*\") that indicated that no information was available or required for the incident.",
        "The slots that took fillers from a finite set could either take one filler for each template (message-id, incident-type, and incident-category slots), several fillers for each template with all of the fillers being different (instrument-type slot), or several fillers for each template with multiple instances of the same filler allowed (perpetrator-confidence, physical-target-type, human-target-type, foreign-nation, physical-target-effect, and human-target-effect slots).",
        "The latter slots required that their filler(s) be cross-referenced to the filler(s) of another slot to capture interdependencies.",
        "For example, in template 2 of Figure 5, the human-target-type \"LAW ENFORCEMENT\" is cross-referenced to the human-target-id \"POLICEMAN.\"",
        "There could be multiple instances of \"LAW ENFORCE-MENT\" in the human-target-type slot that refer to different human-target-ids.",
        "For each type of incident, there was a different set of slots that were allowed to be filled.",
        "For example, physical-target slots were not filled for MURDER incidents, since physical damage accompanying a murder was defined to be part of a separate ATTACK.",
        "The effect-on-human-target slot was required to be blank as well, since this information was redundant for the MURDER incident type.",
        "The template design for MUC-3 structured the template in such a way that the filling of the slots was a well-defined but complex problem.",
        "In addition to the features of template design mentioned above, optional templates and optional and alternative",
        " slot fillers were specified in the answer keys to capture borderline cases.",
        "The template design provided several interesting problems for the development of scoring algorithms, scoring guidelines, and answer keys.",
        "1.4.5 Generating Answer Keys.",
        "To evaluate system performance on the test sets, the systems' responses to the template fill task were compared with the responses in answer keys using a semi-automai ed scoring system developed for MUC-3.",
        "NRaD generated the answer keys for the MUC-3 test sets.",
        "However, the development messages also required answer keys for use as training material.",
        "Early in the evaluation schedule, NRaD completed the answer key for the first 100 development messages, and the participants completed the answer keys for the other 1,200 development messages.",
        "Participants were assigned blocks of 75 messages that overlapped partially with blocks from other sites.",
        "Sites had to agree on templates for those overlapping messages.",
        "The purpose of the overlapping blocks was to encourage uniformity of the answer keys for the development messages.",
        "In actuality, template design, the development of guidelines for filling templates, and the generation of development set answer keys were all interdependent activities.",
        "The answer keys for the development corpus had to be updated whenever there were changes in template design or in the guidelines for filling templates.",
        "During the generation of the official answer key, an attempt was made to measure the consistency of human template filling.",
        "Two evaluators at NRaD prepared answer keys for the official test set in the following manner.",
        "Each evaluator read the test messages and determined which templates were to be generated for the messages.",
        "The evaluators discussed the template-level decisions concerning relevancy of the violent incidents mentioned in the messages, came to an agreement as to how many templates were to be generated for each message, and then independently generated template fills for the relevant incidents.",
        "One of the evaluators made a final decision as to the contents of the official answer key based on the two independently produced sets of templates.The other evaluator's key was then scored against the official answer key and received scores of 87% recall and 91% precision as shown in the MATCHED/MISSING row of Figure 8.5 These scores reflect the degree to which well-trained evaluators agree.",
        "They also give some idea of what generous upper bounds on system performance might be.",
        "It should be noted that the evaluators took several days to complete the template-filling task for 100 test messages."

        " detection tasks in many ways, and these had to be taken into account in producing effectiveness measures for MUC-3.",
        "Consider a simplified version o f the MUC-3 task: a template consists of m slots, with slot i having ni possible fillers.",
        "Slot i can be filled with between 0 and n, of those fillers, and no filler can be repeated.",
        "The contingency model applies straightforwardly to this simplified case, since a filled--out template can be viewed as the result of n1 + n2 + • • • + n,, decisions to assign or not assign each of the legal slot fillers.",

        "The number, as well as the character, of decisions in MUC-3 also departed from this simple model.",
        "Several slots allowed an unbounded number of fillers, and thus a potentially unbounded number of decisions, whether or not decisions were viewed as binary.",
        "Our solution to this was I o assume that the number of Yes decisions made by the system was the number of fillers generated by the system, while the number of decisions for which Yes was correct was the number of fillers in the key, with optional fillers being counted only if attempted by a system.",
        "This gave us values for contingency table cells a, b, and c, but not d. Recall and precision, but not fallout, could be computed for slots with an unbounded number of fillers and/or fillers from an unbounded set of alternatives.",

        "The fact that there were a number of systems that were able to handle a task of this size and complexity is encouraging.",
        "Overall, the cluster of top-performing systems reported 40-50% recall, 55-65% precision, and 10-20% overgeneration.'",
        "This performance is certainly a milestone marking significant progress in message understanding technology.",
        "This level of progress raises the question of how soon such systems may be ready for use in real applications.",

        "How redundant are the messages?",
        "Does the system have to match human performance?",
        "Will humans post-edit the system output before use?",
        "We cannot answer these questions; however, looking at the MUC-3 results, we can make a few observations.",
        "First, the current systems do not allow any significant trade off between precision and recall.",
        "Several sites (BBN, NYU, U Mass) reported alternative systems that produced small changes in the precision–recall trade-off.",
        "However, most systems, particularly the linguistically based systems, did not have adjustable parameters that could be tightened or relaxed to produce different trade-offs.",
        "Also, recall appeared to be more of a limiting factor than precision for the MUC-3 systems.",
        "No system achieved more than 51% recall, and every system had higher precision than recall.",
        "Nonetheless, it is possible to imagine applications where this level of recall would prove sufficient.",
        "Precision, recall, and overgeneration are not the only useful measures of system performance.",
        "For real applications, a critical issue is the length of time it takes to make the application run in a new task domain.",
        "The median preparation time reported for the systems participating in MUC-3 was 10-11 person months.",
        "Of course, these figures included basic system development and tool development, which can be looked at as a one-time cost, shortening development times for future applications.",
        "Nonetheless, reduction of cost to port to a new application is an area that needs considerably more work.",
        "Although a number of systems reported effort in tool-building, few system developers spent time on automated knowledge acquisition or learning techniques.",
        "This is of some concern, because many systems reported that missing domain knowledge was a significant source of error.",
        "However, there were some exceptions.",
        "The Hughes system (3 person months of effort) drew heavily on automated learning and pattern classification techniques; however, its performance was substantially below that of the best systems (especially in precision).",
        "The BBN system also used some automated and semi-automated learning in several places.",
        "It is hard to quantify how important this was, but their precision and recall scores were competitive and their level of effort (6 person months) was lower than the other comparably performing systems.",
        "Finally, some systems did address the knowledge acquisition bottleneck for lexical knowledge, but not by learning techniques.",
        "NYU, for example, used a machine-readable dictionary; both GE and ITP reported using sizable domain-independent lexicons that required only minimal adaptation for new applications.",
        "The issue of processing speed, a problem for some systems during MUCK-II, appeared to be resolved for MUC-3.",
        "The time to process 100 messages ranged from over 300 minutes to only around 30 minutes.",
        "The median processing time for all the systems was about one minute per message.",
        "Some of this speed-up was obtained by using faster hardware.",
        "Some was obtained by faster algorithms, and some was obtained by the use of preprocessing techniques, including relevance filtering.",
        "In general, it is clear that processing speed is not a major obstacle for current message understanding systems, especially as the cost of machine cycles continues to drop.",
        "In conclusion, the progress of the field is encouraging.",
        "Systems were able to handle a large volume of text in a realistic domain and achieve reasonable precision with fairly low overgeneration.",
        "For certain applications, it may be necessary to achieve higher recall, even at the expense of precision.",
        "However, the major obstacle for message understanding systems is the cost of porting the system to new applications.",

        "First, there is a healthy diversity of approaches among the top-performing systems.",
        "These included a semantics-driven case frame system, several syntax-driven systems, and a system that used a hybrid control approach drawing heavily on semantic information.",
        "For the syntax-driven systems, only those systems that provided a robust parsing capability performed well.",
        "Among the top-performing systems, there were two successful approaches to robust parsing: use of partial parsing and use of heuristics added to a standard full-sentence parser that allowed recovery of parsed sub-strings.",
        " As always, acquisition of domain knowledge (lexical semantics and an adequate domain model) proved a major task.",
        "For many systems, the incompleteness of this domain knowledge was a significant source of error; extensions to the domain knowledge were likely to produce significant performance improvement.",
        "There was a range of approaches to the lexicon development and lexical semantics.",
        "At one end was the highly domain-specific knowledge engineering approach of the U Mass system.",
        "In the middle were systems like NYU, which used a machine-readable dictionary for syntactic information augmented by hand-coded semantics, or the BBN system, which did automatic part-of-speech tagging but required hand-coding of semantic rules (with some computer aids).",
        "An approach that seemed to work well was the use of a handcrafted but domain-independent, semantically rich lexicon (GE, ITP).",
        "The other end of the lexicon/ semantic knowledge spectrum was represented by the Hughes system, which \"learned\" its lexicon and semantics from the training corpus.",
        "This is appealing because it makes the approach highly portable.",
        "However, the approach was not among the higher-scoring systems.",
        "The proper treatment of discourse turned out to be important for the MUC-3 task, and many system developers identified this as an area needing substantially more work.",
        "Most systems had trouble distinguishing elaboration of previously mentioned events from the introduction of new events.",
        "Many systems lacked a systematic approach to the problem and relied on some simple heuristics (\"collapse two events if they are of the same type, with the same target, and occur on the same day\"), sometimes coupled with the use of keywords (\"meanwhile,\" \"in sum\") to help detect a change of topic.",
        "Preprocessing was a key feature in many of the MUC-3 systems.",
        "Relevance filtering, either statistically trained or knowledge-based, was successfully used by several systems to reduce processing load.",
        "The use of text categorization techniques from information retrieval was more successful in this role than when used as the sole method for filling templates.",
        "Systems also used other kinds of preprocessing, including special handling of Spanish names (BBN, SRI), regularization of special forms such as dates, organization names, and place names (many sites), reduction of syntactic complexity by bracketing out certain structures (GE), and flagging of discourse segment markers (GE, ITP).",

        "This is strong evidence that these systems will show improved performance if given more time for development.",
        "Other systems suffered from slow start-up, limited resources, or missing components that prevented them from achieving peak performance.",
        "Successive black-box evaluations may be required to show whether a system has \"topped out\" or whether routine bug fixes, new modules, and additional knowledge produce further performance improvements.",
        "This observation has led to a new proposal to measure system \"convergence\" (Hirschman 1991a).",
        "The proposal is to perform an initial evaluation using two test sets, S1 and S2.",

        "The improvement on test set S2 relative to the improvement on test set S1 would provide some measure of how well the system was converging – whether changes made to fix problems in one test set actually helped in another test set.",
        "Another lesson was that black-box evaluation is not effective for determining which techniques are responsible for good performance across systems.",
        "Performance trade-offs are very system-specific, and insights depend on a careful analysis of how the particular system failed.",
        "SRI provided such an analysis of errors for a subset of the test messages, and this gave some interesting insights into that particular system.",

      "text": [
        "In this paper, we have sketched the evaluation techniques that were applied to 15 text processing systems during MUC-3.",
        "In addition to the raw results, we have introduced a method of computing significance for the results across systems using approximate randomization.",
        "The results showed that the systems fell into a number of distinct clusters for both precision and recall.",
        "In many cases, the systems performing well in precision also performed well in recall.",
        "We can conclude that the evaluation methodology used in MUC-3 can indeed discriminate among systems and that there were significant differences in effectiveness among the systems fielded for MUC-3.",
        "We have also been able to draw several other conclusions.",
        "The first is that all systems performed worse in recall than in precision; furthermore, none of the linguistically based systems had adjustable parameters to increase recall at the expense of precision (although several systems could be run in several configurations to produce slight changes in overall precision and recall).",
        "Achievement of high recall scores (over 60%) is a problem for the current text-understanding systems.",
        "However, several systems have shown steady improvement with time, and their performance may show further improvement with continued development.",
        "Even some of the high-performing systems may not yet have reached peak performance.",
        "This raises the issue of portability – most systems spent approximately one person year preparing their systems to run for MUC-3.",
        "If porting takes 12 months of time for highly trained system developers, portability will be a serious stumbling block both to building real systems and to changing the evaluation paradigm.",
        "At the end of MUC-3, the participating system developers did not want to spend another year porting their system to yet another evaluation application.",
        "This underscores the need for serious research on portable systems.",
        "Generality of linguistic coverage is an important part both of system portability and overall system performance.",
        "In order to evaluate the linguistic coverage, we devised a successful method for isolating specific linguistic phenomena and measuring system performance on them within the black-box framework, even though specifics of the performance of systems varied and made these tests more difficult to interpret.",
        "Development of a suite of such tests with adequate linguistic coverage would provide insight into how the handling of certain common linguistic phenomena relates to overall system performance.",
        "This insight would be similar to that obtainable through glass-box testing, but the method of testing is still technically a black-box method because it looks only at the output given certain input.",
        " We had hoped to draw conclusions concerning the relative effectiveness of the various language processing techniques used by the participating systems.",
        "However, the results of MUC-3, even with their statistical significance now known, do not support the recommendation of one approach over another.",
        "We did notice, however, that pattern-matching and information retrieval techniques proved successful only when combined with linguistic techniques.",
        "Used in isolation, these techniques were not powerful enough to extract the wide range of information needed in the MUC-3 task.",
        "We also noted that robust processing techniques (filtering, skimming, robust or partial parsing) were important for good performance.",
        "Overall, we believe that the MUC conferences have made a major contribution to evaluation methodology.",
        "They have both benefited from and inspired other work on evaluation, as evidenced by the growing body of research on evaluation techniques for natural language understanding including two workshops on the subject: Palmer and Finin, 1990 and Neal and Walter, 1991.",
        "In glass-box evaluation, researchers have developed a parse evaluation methodology (Black et al.",
        "1991) that is now in use.",
        "There is active research in the evaluation of spoken language understanding: Hirschman et al., 1992 and Price et al., 1992.",
        "In addition, there is a new effort in evaluation of machine translation systems based on quality assessment measures and use of a multiple choice reading comprehension test.",
        "This work is beginning to provide the evaluation techniques that will enable the natural language community to assess its progress, to understand its results, and to focus future research towards robust, high-performance systems capable of handling real-world applications."
