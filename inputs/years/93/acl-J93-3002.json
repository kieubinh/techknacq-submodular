        "The problem of style is highly relevant to computational linguistics, but current systems deal only superficially, if at all, with subtle but significant nuances of language.",
        "Expressive effects, together with their associated meaning, contained in the style of a text are lost to analysis and absent from generation.",
        "We have developed an approach to the computational treatment of style that is intended to eventually incorporate three selected components – lexical, syntactic, and semantic.",
        "In this paper, we concentrate on certain aspects of syntactic style.",
        "We have designed and implemented a computational theory of goal-directed stylistics that can be used in various applications, including machine translation, second-language instruction, and natural language generation.",
        "We have constructed a vocabulary of style that contains both primitive and abstract elements of style.",
        "The primitive elements describe the stylistic effects of individual sentence components.",
        "These elements are combined into patterns that are described by a stylistic meta-language, the abstract elements, that define the concordant and discordant stylistic effects common to a group of sentences.",
        "Higher-level patterns are built from the abstract elements and associated with specific stylistic goals, such as clarity or concreteness.",
        "Thus, we have defined rules for a syntactic stylistic grammar at three interrelated levels of description: primitive elements, abstract elements, and stylistic goals.",
        "Grammars for both English and French have been constructed, using the same vocabulary and the same development methodology.",
        "Parsers that implement these grammars have also been built.",
        "The stylistic grammars codify aspects of language that were previously defined only descriptively.",
        "The theory is being applied to various problems in which the form of an utterance conveys an essential part of meaning and so must be precisely represented and understood."

        "Understanding a text requires more than just understanding its propositional content.",
        "It requires a sensitivity to the interaction of semantic content, emotional expression, and interpersonal and situational attitudes.",
        "This interaction is reflected in the style of the text.",
        "Style in language is not just surface appearance, a decorative veneer.",
        "Rather, it is an essential part of meaning, part of the author's communication to the reader.",
        "So to fully understand the nuances of a text, one must determine not only the propositional content, but also how its communicative effect is colored by the form, which reflects affective content.",
        "While propositional content provides the basic tone, the expressive",
        "form provides the tonal quality.",
        "Together, form and content create style, that which distinguishes both an individual text and a collective body of writing.",
        "Style is created through subtle variation, seemingly minor modulations of exactly what is said, the words used to say it, and the syntactic constructions employed, but the resulting effect on communication can be striking.",
        "Consider the following versions of the same text, Matthew 7:27:",
        "1.",
        "And descended the storm and came the floods and blew the winds and beat against that house and it fell and the fall of it was great.",
        "(Literal translation of the Hellenistic Greek.)",

        "And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.",
        "(Revised Standard Version, 1952.)",
        "3.",
        "The rain came down, the floods rose, the wind blew, and beat upon that house; down it fell with a great crash.",
        "(The New English Bible, 1970.)",
        "4.",
        "Rain came down, floods rose, gales blew and struck that house, and it fell; and what a fall it had!",
        "(The New Jerusalem Bible, 1985.)",
        "5.",
        "The rains fell, the torrents came, the winds blew and lashed against his house.",
        "It collapsed under all this and was completely ruined.",
        "(The New American Bible, 1973.)",
        "The first variation, a word-by-word translation from the Hellenistic Greek, is actually a good deal less striking than subsequent, widely accepted versions.",
        "The placement of the verbs before their subjects is quite normal and the closing is also quite usual.",
        "The sense of discord and resulting poetic effect is not as evident as it is in the second variation, from the Revised Standard Version, which is resoundingly poetic in the imitative form of the first five clauses, followed by the inverted form of the final clause.",
        "The text begins in strong concord and dissolves into discord, but not unpleasingly so.",
        "Discord, as we use the term in this paper, refers to a deviation from the norm, but such deviations can be used to good effect.",
        "As we will see, in language as in music, it is often through the construction of patterns of concord and discord, particular combinations of order and disorder that create an overall harmonious arrangement, that certain stylistic effects are achieved.",
        "In versions 3 and 4, the dramatic effect of the closing has been retained from the RSV translation but through different choices of words and structure.",
        "In 3, the last clause is inverted, but the translator has chosen to place more emphasis upon the fall itself (down it fell) than its magnitude (great).",
        "Example 4 ends on an intense note, achieved through the use of an exclamation (what a fall it had!",
        "), rather than an inversion of syntactic structure.",
        "And no single word expresses the degree of magnitude of the fall.",
        "In the final example, 5, the drama and intensity of the RSV has been lost with the removal of the dissolution from initial concord to final discord.",
        "In this case, the translator has opted for plainness and clarity, even at the expense of beauty.",
        "In English, example 1 sounds odd and disjointed; and examples 2, 3, and 4 are dramatic in a way that example 5 is not.",
        "But all have the same essential content.",
        "What then causes the differences in effect?",
        "What is being varied?",
        "There are at least four parameters that play a role in these stylistic variations: lexical, syntactic, thematic, and semantic aspects.",
        "Lexical aspects: Compare example 4 to the following constructed versions:1",
        "6.",
        "Rain descended, floods rose, gales raged and beat upon that dwelling, and it collapsed; and what a fall it had!",
        "7.",
        "Rain fell, the water level rose, winds blew and hit that house, and it fell; and what a fall it had!",
        "The differences between 4, 6, and 7 are primarily lexical.",
        "Example 6 uses rather elegant words, while 7 opts for a more commonplace vocabulary, and 4 lies somewhere between the two in lexical formality.",
        "Syntax: Comparing example 2 to example 5, we see that the former uses syntactic structures that create more dramatic effects: a short climactic sentence, and it fell, and a striking inversion, great was the fall of it, close the text on a powerful note.",
        "In contrast, 5 ends with a very ordinary, unremarkable, construction.",
        "Thematic aspects: Comparing example 2 to example 3, we observe that the two sentence structures bring different elements into focus: great was the fall of it, in contrast to down it fell with a great crash.",
        "In general, variations in thematic structure can create different stylistic effects.",
        "Semantics: The exact choice of what is said, or not said, also has stylistic consequences.",
        "Compare example 4 to the following two constructed versions:",
        "8.",
        "A serious storm, with rain and gales and floods, struck that house, which collapsed.",
        "9.",
        "Rain fell and fell and eventually caused a flood, which rose up to that house; also the winds kept blowing until eventually the combined forces",
        "of rain, flood, and wind were too great and caused so much structural damage that the house collapsed.",
        "These variations differ in their semantic content: example 4 merely reports the events, but 8 evaluates, a serious storm, while 9 emphasizes technical details, structural damage.",
        "These semantic differences are reflected in the texts; and stylistic differences result.",
        "Given that these four parameters – lexical choice, syntax, theme, and semantics – control stylistic variations, two questions arise:",
        "• How do we characterize each type of variation?",
        "• How does each variation contribute to an overall stylistic effect?",
        "In considering these questions in this paper, we will concentrate on variations of the syntactic parameter.",
        "We emphasize that our intent here is not any form of literary analysis or literary theory.",
        "Our main concern will be ordinary, everyday text.",
        "It is true that, in the Biblical texts above, we saw how different syntactic forms carry different stylistic import to the point that one form may be poetry while another is just dull, plodding prose.",
        "But style",
        "isn't just a matter of achieving poetry or not.",
        "Every text, large or small, interesting or dull, effective or not, has its own style.",
        "Nor are we talking about style in any of its normative senses: the common tenets dictating standard forms (e.g., Chicago 1982), or the textbook prescriptions for 'good' style: be clear, be simple, be precise (e.g., Strunk and White 1979).",
        "For people aim to convince, to persuade, to impress, and, even, sometimes to obscure, and standard textbooks tell us very little about such varied and subtle stylistic and pragmatic goals.",
        "Rather than a study of literary or normative style, our intent is to determine what gives any ordinary piece of text its stylistic 'feel.'",
        "The following examples will demonstrate what we have in mind.",
        "These texts are all from newspaper feature articles: 10.",
        "Silvia, a commanding woman in her 50's, a shrew falsely mellowed by religion, promptly organized prayer sessions on the lines of Tupperware meetings.2 11.",
        "The artist provides a dreamy background done in yellow and bistre brushstrokes to a blue gown with woodenly rigid folds or the profile of a brown angel painted so mineral hard and modeled so carefully that the incoherence of virtue does it injury.'",
        "12.",
        "Crazed with fear, he tried to purify her by dunking her in the ocean and holding her under the water; then in desperation he threw her on the still-smoking pyre.4 In a newspaper, we might have expected the writer and translator to have simply aimed for clarity.",
        "In fact, we find a variety of effects.",
        "The first text, 10, emphasizes a sense of harmony by repeating the same kind of structure, a nominal group, in the postmodification of Silvia.",
        "The second, 11, is more complex, and achieves a certain balance in the judicious use of conjunctions; but the result is so difficult to understand that it doesn't really make sense.",
        "Text 12 has a stark initial participle clause, crazed with fear, that emphasizes the intensity of the subject's emotional state.",
        "To account for the kinds of complex stylistic effects that occur even in everyday writing, we propose a goal-directed understanding of style.",
        "That is, an author's intent can vary with respect to a number of stylistic goals, such as clarity or obscurity, abstraction or concreteness, staticness or dynamism.",
        "Particular choices of words, syntactic structure, and semantic structure make a text more – or less – stylistically varied and effective.",
        "We believe that these choices, goals such as abstraction or concreteness, and the stylistic elements that are used to realize them can be recognized and represented in a formal notation.",
        "They are, in a word, codifiable.",
        "It is this codification that is at the heart of computational stylistics.'"

      "text": [
        "2.1.1 The Classical View.",
        "The study of style has an ancient history, for the concept first appeared in the fifth century B.C.",
        "Scholars of the time conceived the notion that the rhetorical form of a writer's text should reflect his thoughts and intentions.",
        "This was to be achieved through the appropriate choice and organization of words and syntactic structures in order to \"evoke the desired response\" (Corbett 1971).",
        "Content and form were recognized as inseparable, and as exerting a reciprocal influence upon each other.",
        "Beginning with Corax of Syracuse, rhetoricians developed methods for systematic instruction in the art of writing.",
        "The classical scholars, from Isocrates and Aristotle to Cicero and Quintilian, established standards of rhetoric that influenced curricula for centuries.",
        "The contribution of Aristotle was particularly notable.",
        "He countered Plato's argument that rhetoric was mere sophistry, deceitful reasoning, by providing a system of instruction that treated the theory and practice of style as a valid discipline, designed to appeal simultaneously to reason and emotion.",
        "This classical approach to style flourished into the Middle Ages, for it formed part of a standard university education.",
        "The teaching of formal rhetoric in schools and universities continued to play a significant role throughout the Renaissance and into the 18th century.",
        "However, in the 19th century, the teaching of rhetoric gave way to the teaching of composition, which came to be associated merely with a set of basic prescriptive rules.",
        "This approach was in direct contrast to the original classical theory that stressed the education of the whole person as a preparation for achieving style in writing (Corbett 1971).",
        "2.1.2 The Modern View.",
        "Today, the common view of style is still one of conformity to standard good taste and an avoidance of bad form.",
        "Textbooks (Fowler 1968; Strunk and White 1979; Kane 1983; Grevisse 1986) promote the idea that there is a universal and correct mode of expression.",
        "However, normative rules, while necessary in some degree so that communication is possible at all, may, if too inflexible, deaden the expression of a writer's individual voice.",
        "Universal rules of good style are best used, we suggest, simply as a guide to avoiding bad constructions and obstacles to clear writing, but not as a basis for a theory of stylistic effects in text.",
        "2.1.3 Our View.",
        "In computational applications, where we expect to deal with large amounts of similar types of text, the analysis of group style is of more interest than the idiosyncratic style of any one writer.",
        "Group style can be subdivided into two major types, each associated with a different view of stylistics: literary style and utilitarian",
        "(or functional) style.",
        "Utilitarian group styles are distinguished from the literary type by their association with a genre of text that has a particular function or purpose, such as medical textbooks or political newspaper writing.",
        "In such styles, the writer adjusts her language to what readers expect in a specific situation.",
        "The fact that functional group styles are somewhat more restrictive than literary group styles, as they are characteristic of a particular genre, suggests that the problem of codifying utilitarian style will be more tractable than the literary case.",
        "For this reason, we will focus on utilitarian texts in general, drawing most of our examples from newspaper and magazine journalism.",

      "text": [
        "Most of the research to date in computational stylistics has been the development of so-called style-checkers.",
        "The uNIx-based Writer's Workbench, Grammatik I and II, RightWriter, PC-Style, Punctuation and Style, Electric Webster, and CRITIQUE are examples (Raskin 1986).",
        "However, none of these systems is appropriate for our purposes.",
        "These programs enforce the basic virtues: be clear, be simple, be precise.",
        "They merely check for common grammatical errors such as number disagreement, pronoun case problems, unbalanced punctuation, split infinitives, excessive sentence length, and excessive sentence complexity.",
        "There is no systematic approach to constructing a vocabulary of style, no structured representation of stylistic rules.",
        "Stylistic knowledge may simply consist, as in the case of CRITIQUE, of an unstructured mass of rules (Jensen et al.",
        "1986, p. 190).",
        "These programs have no real understanding of the significance of stylistic parameters.",
        "The other main kind of computational research in stylistics has been statistical (e.g., Cluett 1976, 1990; Milic 1982; Biber 1988, 1989).",
        "With this approach, a count is made of the number of occurrences in a sample text of a stylistically significant feature, such as an initial prepositional phrase.",
        "A statistical analysis is done to compare the count and type of stylistic features with the corresponding parameters of texts written by authors working in the same or different genres.",
        "But the interpretation of the statistical results must be done by a human; the computer system has no real understanding of what the variations in style mean.",
        "Although virtually all computational research in stylistics takes a non-AI approach to the representation and use of stylistic knowledge, the usefulness and degree of sophistication of some of these programs should not be underestimated.",
        "The York Computer Inventory of Prose Style (Cluett 1976, 1990) has been undergoing development since 1970.",
        "The principal contribution of the project is its convincing demonstration that the richness and subtlety of literary style could in fact be correlated, to a perhaps surprising degree of accuracy, with a catalog of syntactic patterns.",
        "But the program that performs the stylistic analysis has no understanding of the meaning of its statistical results; it relies on human interpretation of the statistics computed.",
        "Nevertheless, the York project's findings are still very useful, as they have catalogued the syntactic features that produce particular stylistic effects.",
        "Thus, most current approaches in computational stylistics have not included formal stylistic rules, which are clearly a desirable prerequisite.",
        "We now review the extent to which such rules have been developed in theoretical stylistics and used in computational stylistics.",
        "The title of Vinay and Darbelnet's (1958) book, Stylistique comparee du francais et de",
        " l'anglais, is somewhat misleading, for their purpose was not just to deal with comparative stylistics in translation, but also to enumerate the more common rules and procedures in the overall translation process.",
        "But they did not construct a specific vocabulary for comparative stylistics and, in fact, virtually all of their 'stylistic' terms refer to basic syntactic constituents.",
        "Using their vocabulary of terms, Vinay and Darbelnet defined rules, expressed in ordinary natural language, that encoded knowledge about French–English comparative stylistics.",
        "The rules certainly fell short of the repertoire needed by a professional translator, but no one has yet improved upon their codification of comparative stylistics (Brian Fitch, personal communication).",
        "Their book is still used as a prescribed text in translation courses.",
        "Vinay and Darbelnet did not take an explicitly goal-directed approach, but their book does contain a great deal of information about the correlation of stylistic goals with particular lexical, syntactic, and semantic choices.",
        "Unfortunately, however, their rules proved to be too language-dependent for the framework that is proposed in this paper.",
        "But the success of a goal-directed codification, albeit an implicit one, supports the approach that we will take below.",
        "Crystal and Davy (1969) hypothesized the creation of a formal stylistic grammar, built upon a vocabulary of stylistic terms and intended to represent the sentence structures characteristic of a particular stylistic sublanguage.",
        "However, the grammar that they sketched contained virtually no terms other than purely syntactic ones and no correlations with stylistic goals; it was only a first step, although an ambitious one, toward a codification of the stylistic rules that define a sublanguage.",
        "What we have found especially useful to adapt from their work is the overall methodology, the approach to formalizing style, even the belief that style can be formalized.",
        "Kane's (1983) rhetoric and handbook of style represents the typical textbook that aims to teach the rules of classic good writing.",
        "Kane, too, did not take an explicitly goal-directed approach in his stylistic rules, but nevertheless gave numerous references to the stylistic goals associated with particular syntactic structures.",
        "The systematic construction of a stylistic vocabulary seems not to have been an explicit goal, but he used many terms unique to stylistics.",
        "However, his terminology was apparently augmented whenever the need arose to describe a new feature; there was no underlying structure, no formal representation of rules.",
        "The stylistic rules were expressed in ordinary English and achieved, as the author intended, good coverage of plain writing style.",
        "This body of rules was 'structured' to the extent that there were hierarchies of stylistic sentence types, but, in general, Kane's rules appear to be just an enumeration of stylistic tenets, not a deliberately constructed organization.",
        "Nevertheless, we have found it useful to draw upon these rules as justification for the syntactic coverage of our grammar.",
        "In computational stylistics, an application area of particular interest to us is machine translation (MT).",
        "In suggesting the applicability of computational stylistics to MT, Loffler-Laurian (1986) emphasized an important point: although corresponding group styles may exist across languages, the realization of the style can be different for each language.",
        "Tsutsumi (1990) presented a methodology for bridging stylistic gaps (stylistic differences) between the syntax of the source and target languages in MT.",
        "An important contribution of Tsutsumi's work is the recognition that computational stylistics is useful for the translation of pairs of languages that are not in the same language group.",
        "Hovy's (1988) PAULINE system was the first computational system that implemented goal-directed style.",
        "PAULINE was able to generate text that conformed to various stylistic and pragmatic constraints that it was given.",
        "The system was goal-directed, able to correlate such stylistic goals as formality, simplicity, and respect with the lexical",
        "and syntactic characteristics of the text produced.",
        "Hovy's method was based on the definition of rhetorical goals of style, such as formality, force, and partiality, that control broader pragmatic goals.",
        "For example, a low degree of formality combined with high degrees of force and partiality gives a 'no-nonsense' effect.",
        "To achieve a particular rhetorical goal, PAULINE examined the options at various points during the production of text and applied the appropriate strategies.",
        "For example, to achieve formality, the generator would perform the following actions: Organization of topics: Make long complex sentences by subordinating them in relative clauses or by conjoining two or more sentence topics.",
        "Organization of sentences: Make sentences seem weighty by including a number of adverbial clauses, by placing these clauses toward the beginning of a sentence, by building parallel clauses, by using the passive voice, by using more 'complex' tenses such as the perfect tenses, and by avoiding ellipsis.",
        "Choice of words and phrases: Select formal words and phrases.",

        "We will now develop a vocabulary of basic terms that will describe stylistically significant aspects of syntax.",
        "Our development is guided by much in classical rhetorical theory; often, our definitions will be extensions of those of the classical theory.",
        "We do this in two stages: first, we outline abstract properties of style suggested by classical rhetoric; second, we convert these properties into definitions of abstract elements that will be used in a grammar of style.",
        "Our starting point is the notion of stylistic norm, which is defined as the most commonly used structures in a given genre.",
        "This notion is intrinsic to the work of the majority of descriptive stylists such as Crystal and Davy (1969) and Cluett (1976, 1990).",
        "From this, we derive the notions of stylistic concord and discord as the fundamental principles of our formalization.",
        "Concord simply means conformity with the norm, and discord, deviation from the norm.",
        "Each genre has its own particular norm; for example, the style characteristic of scientific texts may seem disruptive if used in general newspaper writing.",
        "This view goes beyond the tenet of prescriptive rhetoric that the stylistic norm merely represents standard, 'good,' style, independent of the use of the text.",
        "Rather, we agree with Lanham (1974) that style should be viewed as the tailoring of a text to a specific audience and a specific situation; 'good' style can in fact be quite inappropriate.",
        "The concept of norm will be useful as a means of anchoring the development of our stylistic rules.",
        "It is simply the usual, the typical, the stable and concordant.",
        "Indeed, discord, deviation from the norm, will play an essential role in our formalization of style, for it is our contention that style arises from the construction of patterns of",
        "concord and discord, particular combinations of order and disorder that create an overall harmonious arrangement (Crystal and Davy 1969; Cluett 1976, 1990).",
        "3.2.1 The Divisions of the Vocabulary.",
        "As the first step in constructing a vocabulary of style for computational use, we will look at the descriptive terms that stylists have developed over many centuries of use.",
        "One of the most important rhetorical influences on sentence style that has been identified is syntactic parallelism, or coordination: the balancing of syntactically similar forms to achieve a harmonious stylistic effect, an idea dating back to the rhetorical schemes of balance (Corbett 1971, p. 463).",
        "But if parallelism or coordination plays an important role in style, so too does subordination: variations in the hierarchical structure of a sentence that can produce correspondingly different stylistic effects.",
        "One part of a sentence can dominate another.",
        "As with parallelism, the importance to style of syntactic hierarchy is also a well-established principle in classical rhetoric, evident in the schemes of parenthesis, apposition, and climax (Corbett 1971, pp.",
        "466, 468, 476).",
        "Thus, modulations in coordinate and subordinate structure are major factors in achieving stylistic expressiveness.",
        "A third major contributor to syntactic style is linear ordering: varying the order of components within a sentence to produce quite marked stylistic differences.",
        "The rhetorical terms of anastrophe and parenthesis (Corbett 1971, p. 466) attest to the stylistic importance of the ordering of sentence components.",
        "Thus, we can see that three factors influencing syntactic style are:",
        "• Balance: Parallelism of structure.",
        "• Dominance: Structural hierarchy.",
        "• Position: Linear ordering of structure.",
        "We will adapt these factors from theoretical stylistics as the divisions of our vocabulary of style.",
        "Now, we will classify commonly used stylistic terms into these three groups in order to identify and abstract the general properties of style characteristic of each group.",
        "3.2.2 Abstract Properties of Style.",
        "In the balance group, we classify the terms symmetric construction (Hendricks 1976), serial sentence (Kane 1983), parallel sentence (Kane 1983), balanced sentence (Kane 1983), and intersentence coordination (Crystal and Davy 1969).",
        "All of these terms suggest a stylistic imitation, the balancing of syntactically similar clauses.",
        "We also find evidence of stylistic parallelism below the clause level in the use of terms such as paired adjectives (Kane 1983), balanced phrases (Crystal and Davy 1969), and intrasentence coordination (Hendricks 1976).",
        "As well as identifying similar structures, stylists have recognized characteristic asymmetric constructions (Hendricks 1976) or syntactic counterpoint (Hendricks 1976).",
        "These types of structures are most often interrupted or convoluted sentences (Kane 1983).",
        "For inclusion in our vocabulary, we will choose the most representative terms in the balance group: intersentence coordination and intrasentence counterpoint.",
        "There are a variety of terms that can be classified into the dominance group.",
        "First, there are sentences that have one trivially dominant clause.",
        "These are the simple sentences (Kane 1983) that have only one main, or central, clause with no subordinate clauses.",
        "Next, there are many and varied types of sentences built up around a central, dominant clause.",
        "The complex sentence (Kane 1983) has a central clause and at least one dependent clause.",
        "The loose sentence (Kane 1983) has a central clause followed by",
        " a subordinate clause.",
        "The centered sentence (Kane 1983) has a central clause flanked by subordinate clauses.",
        "The cumulative sentence (Kane 1983) has a central clause accompanied by a series of appositive, modifying, or absolute constructions.",
        "Finally, there are more-complicated sentences with more than one dominant clause.",
        "The compound-complex sentence (Kane 1983) can be much more elaborate than a simple compound sentence, as it contains at least two independent clauses and at least one dependent clause.",
        "For inclusion in our vocabulary, we abstract from these three types of hierarchical terms to identify trivial single-clause dominance, complex single-clause dominance, and multiple-clause dominance.",
        "The position group appears to contain the largest number of terms, as any basic term can be qualified to an arbitrarily fine degree by the exact intrasentence position to which it refers.",
        "We will use only three qualifiers, associated with initial, medial, and final positions (Quirk et al.",
        "1985).",
        "At the sentence level, we can have any word or phrase in initial, medial, or final position.",
        "Within the sentence, there are almost infinite variations of position terms.",
        "A small sample includes postpositive adjectives, and pre-verbal, post-verbal, or post-clause adverbs (Crystal and Davy 1969), and complex premodification and postmodification (Crystal and Davy 1969).",
        "We will generalize from these many subtle variations and define terms that have either a concordant or discordant effect, at a particular position in a sentence, according to whether or not their usage is normal.",
        "From this grouping of terms into the three divisions of balance, dominance, and position, we have abstracted general properties of style that we want to describe in our vocabulary.",

        "But we also agree with Crystal and Davy that: It is perhaps worth emphasising right away that the first step in any stylistic analysis must be an intuitive one.",
        "The stylistician is on precisely the same footing as anyone else here: he notices a linguistic feature which he feels to be stylistically significant.",
        "The difference between his approach and that of the untrained observer is that he will have a clearer idea of what is likely to be significant, and will know what to do with his observations once they are made.",
        "This last point is the stylistician's main competence: he is able to interrelate his observations within the framework of some theory, and thus piece together any general pattern of linguistic variation which may exist.",
        "(Crystal and Davy 1969, p. 12) Thus, although we have built our grammar of style upon accepted theory, it is currently a prototype for the formal representation of stylistic knowledge, not yet developed as a tool for practical stylistic analysis.'",
        "For, like Crystal and Davy, our initial objective is to provide a methodology, a vocabulary and apparatus, that will allow others to integrate our approach with analytic procedures to construct useful formalizations of style: All we can do is systematically point to certain significant facts in the language being analysed, suggest some theoretical principles which will account for the occurrence of these facts, emphasise the need for further analysis to validate or refute these preliminary soundings, and illustrate a procedure which will allow people to do this.",

        "However, our stylistic terms have occasionally erred on the side of being too abstract.",
        "For example, an initial discord in a STYLISTIQUE analysis may correctly identify the presence of a discord in the sentence but, because the scope of the element can be so broad, STYLISTIQUE sometimes cannot distinguish between a true initial discord, which occurs at the start of a sentence, and a noninitial discord that seems to be 'initial' because it affects the whole sentence.",
