        "If Q is a wff or term of our language, then 'Q is a constant that denotes the expression Q.",
        "If a sentence P expresses the proposition Q, then an utterance of \"Mary believes that P\" expresses the proposition bel(mary, 'Q).",
        "The symbol \"bel\" is an ordinary predicate letter, not a special modal operator.",
        "The first argument of \"bel\" denotes an agent, and the second argument denotes a sentence.",
        "The argument of the quotation mark may itself contain quotation marks: we might represent \"John thinks Mary thinks the world is flat\" as 1 think(john, 'think(mary 'flat(world))).",
        "This analysis of attitude verbs can certainly account for some examples of opacity.",
        "Under this analysis, the sentence \"Lois thinks Superman was born on Krypton\" might express the proposition 2 think(lois, 'born(superman,krypton)) while \"Lois thinks Clark Kent was born on Krypton\" might express 3 think(lois, 'born(clark_kent,krypton)).",
        "The terms 'born(superman,krypton) and 'born(clark_kent,krypton) denote two different sentences, so it is quite possible that Lois has one sentence in her knowledge base and not the other.",
        "It is straightforward to introduce this kind of quotation into a first-order language.",
        "Suppose we are given a first-order language Lo.",
        "We define the first-order languages",
        "L1, L2, ... by induction as follows: the symbols of Li+i are all symbols of Li, together with a new constant 'Q for each term or wff Q in Li.",
        "Let L be the union of Lo, Ll, L2, • • • • Then L is a first-order language, and if Q is a term or wff of L, 'Q is a constant of L. Let M be a structure for L, and suppose that for each term or wff Q in L, the denotation of the constant 'Q in M is Q.",
        "Then we say that M is a quotation structure for M. These definitions do not take us outside of ordinary first-order logic – we have simply defined an interesting subset of the class of all first-order structures.",
        "Given a system of quotation, we can introduce a predicate called \"bel\" with three arguments: an agent, a sentence, and a time (I omit the time argument in this paper).",
        "If this predicate represents belief, we must introduce axioms that allow us to make the desired inferences about beliefs.",
        "Perception can create beliefs; inference creates new beliefs from old ones; an agent uses beliefs to choose actions; and so on.",
        "Various writers have developed theories of this kind, including the present author (Haas 1986).",

        "Quotation by itself creates no paradoxes, but if we introduce a predicate that represents truth or knowledge, it is easy to write plausible-looking axioms that are inconsistent.",
        "The literature on this topic is large; see Montague (1974), Kripke (1975), and Barwise and Etchemendy (1987).",
        "It was once thought that self-reference paradoxes are particularly troublesome for sentential theories, but des Rivieres and Levesque (1986) have corrected this error.",
        "Perlis (1988) has shown how we can take a language with quotation and consistently introduce a predicate with some (not all) of the properties we expect of a truth predicate.",

        "If we translate English sentences into a representation language, we must translate indexicals into expressions of the representation language.",

        "Crimmins and Perry firmly deny that a proposition is a sentence or an internal representation.",
        "Yet in order to account for opacity, they need to use notions, which are internal representations.",
        "Since internal representations play an essential role in their explanation of opacity, it is natural to ask if we can find a similar explanation within a sentential theory.",
        "If direct reference is right, the proposition that an utterance expresses cannot be a sentence.",
        "However, it might still be a lot like a sentence.",
        "Let us assume that a singular proposition is an ordered pair, containing a wff with free variables and an assignment of values to those variables.",
        "For example, an utterance of \"I am now in London\" might express a proposition consisting of the wff in(x,london,y) and a function that maps x to the speaker and y to the time of the utterance.",
        "I will write this singular proposition as ('in(x,london,y),f), where f is a function mapping x to the speaker and y to the time.",
        "This account of singular propositions is consistent with Kaplan's description: the referents of indexicals are constituents of the proposition, and propositions are \"structured entities looking something like the sentences which express them.\" Kaplan's description obviously gives us a lot of leeway; I am taking advantage of that leeway to make singular propositions as much like sentences as possible.",
        "I will show that by adopting this view of singular propositions, we can account for the opacity of indexicals within a sentential theory of attitudes.",
        "Suppose, as in Section 2.2 above, that Lois's beliefs contain two constants k and s that denote Superman/Kent, and these constants occur in beliefs (12-15), among others.",
        "When Kent says \"Lois thinks I am that man,\" he is expressing a singular proposition that refers directly to the terms k and s. This proposition says that k and s denote Superman/Kent, and that Lois believes the sentence k = s. The proposition is (P,f), where P is the wff 22 denote(z, x) A denote(w, y) A believe(lois,subst(' (x = y), ['x, 'y], [z, w])) and f is the function that maps x and y to Superman, z to k, and w to s. Note that the variables x and y have both quoted and unquoted occurrences in this wff.",
        "The unquoted occurrences refer directly to Superman, while the quoted occurrences are in the arguments of the function letter \"subst.\" These occurrences serve to indicate the places where the ground terms z and w, denoting Superman, occur in Lois's belief.",
        "This double use of the variables is a little confusing, but it will simplify the semantic interpretation rules for attitude verbs.",
        "When Kent makes the uninteresting assertion \"Lois thinks I am me,\" he expresses a different singular proposition.",
        "This proposition is (P, g), where P is wff (22) and g is a function that maps x and y to Kent, z to the constant k, and w also to the constant k. These two singular propositions contain the same wff – they differ only in the values they assign to the variables in that wff.",
        "The second proposition says that Lois believes the trivial sentence k = k. Since they describe different beliefs, it is quite possible that one is true and the other false – even if Kent and Superman are the same person.",
        "So this analysis can account for opaque indexicals.",
        "Suppose we accept direct reference and also maintain a sentential theory of attitudes.",
        "Then in \"Mary believes that P,\" the utterance of P expresses a singular proposition, while Mary's belief is a sentence.",
        "We must somehow construct this sentence from the singular proposition expressed by P. Our proposal for this construction is in two parts.",
        "First, we suggest that a singular proposition is a pair (Q,f), where Q is a wff and f is a function that maps the free variables of Q to their values.",
        "This is consistent with Kaplan's ideas about singular propositions, and it suggests an obvious way of constructing a sentence: we replace each free variable x in Q with a ground term that",
        " denotes the value f (x).",
        "To complete the construction, we must choose a ground term for each free variable of Q.",
        "Here we rely on Crimmins and Perry's notion of unarticulated constituents.",
        "We claim that the ground terms we need are constituents of the proposition expressed by \"Mary believes that P\" – even though they are not named or described by any words of the utterance.",
        "Given these ground terms, we take the proposition expressed by P and construct the sentence that Mary believes.",
        "In this way we can reconcile direct reference with a sentential theory of attitudes."

        "Since the algorithm's input is a set of representations, we need to find Mary's internal representation for the proposition expressed by the clause P. If the proposition expressed by a clause is a sentence of a representation language, our problem is already solved: Mary's representation of the proposition just is the proposition.",
        "Unfortunately, we have seen that this kind of theory cannot explain opaque indexicals.",
        "It seems that Mary's representation must be distinct from the proposition it represents, and if we are given the proposition it will take some reasoning to find the representation.",
        "If we are going to distinguish between a proposition and its internal representation, we would like a clear and simple picture of how they are related, and how we are to find the representation when the proposition is known.",
        "We have proposed that the proposition expressed by P is a pair, containing a wff and an assignment of values to the free variables of the wff.",
        "To find Mary's representation we must find the terms she uses to represent the values of the free variables, and substitute these terms for the corresponding variables in the wff.",

        "Andrew R. Haas Indexical Expressions in the Scope of Attitude Verbs and \"notions.\" If we need both internal representations and singular propositions, it is simpler to assume that they are closely similar objects – instead of radically different objects, as in Crimmins and Perry.",
        "The examples that motivate this work are unfortunately remote from the texts that computational linguists currently work on.",
        "In studying opacity we concentrate on cases where an agent uses two different representations without realizing that they refer to the same entity.",
        "Such cases are popular in fiction, but rare in applications like machine translation or question-answering from a database.",
        "So it will be some time before these ideas are helpful in the practice of computational linguistics.",
        "However, indexicals occur constantly in human speech, and opacity is a crucial issue in any theory of propositional attitudes.",
        "So if we are serious about a sentential theory of attitudes, it is important to be certain that such a theory can explain opaque indexicals."
