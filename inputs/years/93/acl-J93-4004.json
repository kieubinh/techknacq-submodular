        "While this may not present a problem for systems that generate one-shot explanations, it is a serious limitation in a system intended to participate in a dialogue where users can, and frequently do, ask follow-up questions.",
        "In this paper, we argue that to participate in explanation dialogues successfully, a generation system must represent and reason about the intended effect of individual parts of the text on the hearer, as well as how the parts relate to one another rhetorically.",

        "When we began our work on interactive explanations, we gathered samples of naturally occurring dialogues from several sources: transcripts of electronic dialogues between system users and operators collected by Robinson (1984), protocols of programmers interacting with a mock program enhancement advisor, and tape recordings of office-hour interactions between first-year computer science students and teaching assistants.",
        "A portion of a dialogue extracted from the office-hour interactions appears in Figure 1.",
        "In this dialogue, a student and a teaching assistant are discussing a programming assignment that involves writing a procedure to swap the values stored at two locations in the C programming language.",
        "The student is confused about how to write the procedure because he does not understand that C is a call-by-value language, and so he must pass the addresses of the two variables to be swapped.",
        "In the teacher's response in turn 8, she explains that in C one cannot change the value of a variable defined outside of a procedure.",
        "She justifies this by saying that C is call-by-value and then goes on to define this term.",
        "The student then asks \"What's call-by-value?\" (turn 9).",
        "To respond appropriately to this question, the teacher must realize that she has defined call-by-value in abstract terms as part of her previous explanation and that her first attempt was not fully understood.",
        "In this dialogue, the instructor recovers from this failure by giving a very specific example of how call-by-value works (turn 10).",
        "The teacher explains call-by-value differently the second time because she realizes that she has tried to explain this once before, and that the strategy she used the first time was not sufficient.",
        "Note that giving a very general description of a concept is a good first strategy.",
        "General definitions are an efficient way to convey knowledge because if the hearer understands a general definition, it covers a wide range of cases.",
        "Giving example(s) first would be a bad approach because this strategy requires the hearer to form the correct generalization from the example(s).",
        "Unless the examples are numerous enough and well chosen, this may be difficult to achieve (Klausmeier 1976).",
        "However, when a general description is not understood by itself, examples provide effective elaboration and may help the hearer assimilate the general description (Charney, Reder, and Wells 1988).",
        "In the sample dialogue, because the teacher knows that she has already given a general description in turn 8, she can give a very specific example in turn 10.",
        "Another characteristic of advisory dialogues is exemplified in this sample.",
        "Advice-seekers often ask questions such as \"Why?\" and \"How come?\".",

        "For the sake of this example, let us assume that the hearer is unable to identify the referent.",
        "In terms of building a system that can participate in such dialogues, there are two problems with the representation shown in Figure 11.",
        "First, as the user indicates that he or she cannot identify the Phillips screwdriver, it is clear that the portion of the text that failed is the part that attempts to uniquely identify the Phillips screwdriver, namely the text generated in the CIRCUMSTANCE satellite: It's in the top drawer of the toolbox.",
        "However, it is difficult for a system to determine that this is the portion of text that failed, since the only intention represented is that the system wants the hearer to know that the screwdriver being in the toolbox is a circumstance of the Phillips screwdriver.",
        "The system has no representation of why this bit of circumstantial information is being conveyed.",
        "Second, even if the system could identify this as the offending portion of the plan tree, it is very limited in terms of recovery strategies.",
        "In this case, the system's only recourse is to try to find different ways of achieving the subgoal (BEL USER (CIRCUMSTANCE-OF PHILLIPS ?CIRC) ), i.e., other operators that have this effect but post different subgoals, or by finding different pieces of information that satisfy the constraints on the operator of Figure 9, i.e., alternative bindings for the variable ?CIRC,",
        "Johanna D. Moore and Cecile L. Paris Planning Text for Advisory Dialogs which is currently bound to (IN-LOCATION PHILLIPS DRAWER-1).",
        "But it is likely that the location of the Phillips screwdriver is the only piece of circumstantial information relevant to identifying the screwdriver.' So presenting other circumstantial information that may be stored in the knowledge base (e.g., when it was purchased, or how long it has been in the toolbox) is almost certainly not relevant and should not be mentioned here.",
        "But how can the system tell what is relevant without knowing why circumstantial information is being presented?",
        "What is missing from the representation in Figure 11 is a critical piece of information indicating that the speaker is presenting the circumstantial information because she or he intends this information to allow the hearer to identify the tool.",
        "(We could denote this intention as (KNOW USER (REF PHILLIPS) )).",
        "One may argue that the system could recover by trying other operators that implement the ENABLEMENT relation.",
        "But again, there are two problems.",
        "First, there may not be any other such operators whose constraints are satisfied in this situation.",
        "That is, perhaps the only way to remove the cover without damaging it is to use a Phillips screwdriver.",
        "Second, even if there were other operators for implementing the ENABLEMENT relation, the system is not behaving intelligently.",
        "It will never be able to figure out that it can recover by telling the user some attributive information about the object it is trying to identify, e.g., The Phillips screwdriver has a yellow handle and a cone-shaped head.",
        "This is because such a text would be produced by an ELABORATION-OBJECT-ATTRIBUTE relation, not a CIRCUMSTANCE relation.",
        "Again, this problem arises because the representation lacks the crucial piece of intentional information: (KNOW USER (REF PHILLIPS)), as well as the information that once the Phillips screwdriver has been mentioned, the rhetorical continuations that can be used to help achieve the intention (KNOW USER (REF PHILLIPS)) are CIRCUMSTANCE, ELABORATION-OBJECT-ATTRIBUTE, CONTRAST (one could identify an object by contrasting it with an object known to the user), etc.",
        "The argument ultimately hinges on the observation that, in the case of the subject matter RST relations, the mapping between intentions and rhetorical relations is not a one-to-one mapping.",
        "In fact, the mapping is many-to-many.",
        "This is similar to the argument we made earlier with respect to schemata of rhetorical predicates.",

        "With respect to subject matter relations, we have just shown that an intention such as (KNOW USER (REF PHILLIPS)) may be achieved by a variety of different rhetorical relations.",
        "Similarly, a given subject matter relation may be used in service of several different intentions.",
        "For example, the CIRCUMSTANCE relation can be used when the speaker wants the hearer to identify the referent of a description (\"It's in the toolbox.\") or know a precondition for an action (\"You want flight 101.",
        "It leaves at 8:00 pm.\") In addition, the CIRCUMSTANCE relation is used when the speaker wants the hearer to know how entities are temporally or spatially related.",

        "That was in 1970.",
        "He left to go to graduate school.",
        "That would've been 1973.\") Contrast this with the presentational RST relations where the mapping between intention and rhetorical relation is a one-to-one mapping.",
        "For example, if the speaker's goal is to \"increase the hearer's desire to perform the action presented in the nucleus,\" then whatever text is used to achieve this goal, it stands in a MOTIVATION relation to the nucleus.",
        " Because of this dichotomy between the two classes of RST relations, we conclude that any approach to discourse structure that relies solely on rhetorical relations or predicates and does not explicitly encode information about intentions is inadequate for handling dialogues.",

        "For example, as discussed above and indicated in Table 1, the intention (KNOW ?h (REF ?object-descriptor)) can be achieved by telling the hearer circumstantial information about the object (CIRCUMSTANCE), by contrasting the object with an object known to the user (CONTRAST), or by telling the hearer some of the attributes or parts of the object (ELABORATION-OBJECT-ATTRIBUTE or ELABORATION-WHOLE-PART respectively).",
        "Moreover, the mapping in Table 1 makes it clear that a particular rhetorical strategy may serve many intentions.",
        "For example, CONTRAST may be used to identify the referent of a description, to define a new term, to identify the differences between entities, to make the hearer believe that a method is the best one for achieving a domain goal, etc.",
        "As we will see, operators in our plan language achieve intentions by posting rhetorical subgoals and/or speech acts.",
        "The second reason for separately and explicitly representing the two types of goals is so that the completed plan structure will contain an explicit representation of the speaker's intentions as well as a record of the speech acts and rhetorical strategies used to achieve them.",
        "As we have argued above, it is essential that the intentional structure of a text be recorded so that the system may respond to the user's follow-up questions.",
        "In addition, having the rhetorical structure explicitly noted in the text plan allows the text generator to include discourse markers in the final text in a straightforward manner.",
        "Such markers enhance the coherence of the text and aid the reader in understanding the text as a whole, by helping him or her understand how",
        "the parts of the text relate to one another (Brewer 1980; Cahour, Falzon, and Robert 1990; Ehrlich and Cahour 1991; Goldman and Duran 1988; Levy 1979; Meyer, Brandt, and Bluth 1980).11 In a system such as ours, sets of connectives are associated with each rhetorical relation, and one can be chosen based on features of the final text being produced (e.g., whether or not a sentence boundary occurs between nucleus and satellite, etc.).",
        "The system need not reason directly about the relationships between the effects of speech acts to determine a suitable connective â a process we believe to be much more computationally intensive."

        "Two of these are shown in Figures 15 and 16.",
        "The operator in Figure 15 is very general and can be used to motivate any action in terms of a hearer goal that the act may help to achieve.",
        "It posts a subgoal to make the hearer believe that the act is a step in achieving the goal.",
        "In the simplest case, this subgoal will be refined directly into a surface speech act that informs the hearer of this fact.",
        "The operator in Figure 16 is a more specific operator and can be used only when the act to be motivated is a replacement (e.g., replace SETQ with SETF).",
        "In this case, one strategy for motivating the act is to compare the object being replaced and the object that replaces it with respect to a goal of the hearer.",
        "The three operators shown in Figures 12, 14, and 15 together form one operationalization of a portion of the RST schema shown in Figure 13.",
        "Referring back to this schema and the definition of the RST relation MOTIVATION shown in Figure 6, the reader will note that these three operators can be used to produce the nucleus and the MOTIVATION satellite portion of the schema.",
        "To complete the operationalization of the full schema shown in Figure 13, we must also provide operators to refine the second optional satellite, (COMPETENT ?hearer (DO ?hearer ?act)).",
        "For the sake of brevity, we have omitted these operators here.",
        "There are three important points to note about our operationalization.",
        "First, operators like the one shown in Figure 14 provide an explicit link between speaker intentions and the rhetorical means that achieve them.",
        "In the case of this particular operator, there is actually a one-to-one mapping between the intention (Achieve state where",
        "Plan operator for motivating a replace act by describing differences between replacer and replacee.",
        "hearer is persuaded to do an act) and the rhetorical strategy for achieving it (MOTIVATION).",
        "However, as Table 1 shows, this is not the case for subject matter relations.",
        "By providing operators that explicitly link intentions with rhetorical strategies, our system can handle the many-to-many mapping between intentions and the communicative strategies that achieve them.",
        "So, to return to the Phillips screwdriver example, our system would have several plan operators for achieving the intention: (KNOW ?hearer (REF ?description)).",
        "One plan operator would indicate that a rhetorical strategy for achieving this goal is to tell the hearer the location of the object (CIRCUMSTANCE), another would indicate that another way to achieve the goal is to tell the hearer the identifying attributes of the object (ELABORATION-OBJECT-ATTRIBUTE), etc.",
        "Second, operators like the one shown in Figure 14 contribute to the computational efficiency of the system.",
        "These operators encode knowledge about the rhetorical strategies that may be used to satisfy particular intentions.",
        "Other operators, e.g., the MOTIVATION operators shown in Figures 15 and 16, encode different methods for realizing these rhetorical strategies in different situations.",
        "Thus we have provided a plan language that preserves an explicit representation of the intention behind each portion of the text, while maintaining the efficiency advantages that originally motivated the use of schemata of rhetorical predicates or relations for natural language generation.",
        "Third, as illustrated by the two alternative operators for achieving a MOTIVATION subgoal shown in Figures 15 or 16, in our plan language we can represent very general strategies that are applicable across domains, as well as very specific strategies that may be necessary to handle the idiosyncratic language used in a particular domain.",
        "While one may argue that the operator in Figure 16 could be replaced by a more general, domain-independent operator, this does not obviate the need for domain-specific communication strategies.",
        "Rambow (1990) argues that domain-specific communication knowledge must be used (whether implicitly or explicitly) in all planned communica",
        "tion, and advocates that domain communication knowledge be represented explicitly.",
        "In our plan language, some types of domain-specific communication strategies can be represented in plan operators.",
        "When there are multiple operators capable of achieving a given effect, the constraint mechanism controls which operators are deemed appropriate in a given context.",
        "Note, however, that we do not wish to claim that a top-down planning formalism that maps speakers' intentions to rhetorical and speech acts can or should be used to generate all text types.",
        "In particular, Kittredge, Korelsky, and Rambow (1991) have shown that RST cannot account for the structure of report texts.",
        "Moreover, they argue that report generation does not require reasoning about the speaker's intentions to affect the mental attitudes of the hearer.",

        "The next two levels correspond to the top two levels of Appelt's hierarchy: illocutionary acts (e.g., inform, request), and locutionary acts (assert, ask, command).14 The actions at each level in the hierarchy have been encoded into plan operators that are used in a process of hierarchical decomposition (Sacerdoti 1977) to refine rhetorical acts through illocutionary acts into locutionary acts.",
        "An example operator from Maybury's system is shown in Figure 20.",
        "This is a rhetorical operator that can be used to define an entity by giving its \"logical defini-tion\" (the entity's genus and differentia.)",
        "Note that operators in Maybury's language",
        " contain both a \"header\" and an \"effects\" field.",
        "The header field designates the type of act (e.g., define, inform) associated with the operator, whereas the effects field specifies the effect(s) that this act is expected to have on the hearer's mental state.",
        "To cause the planner to generate a text, a \"discourse controller\" posts a goal to cause an effect in the hearer's mental state, such as KNOW-ABOUT(USER, KC-135).",
        "This goal is matched against the effects field of operators in the plan library, and one is chosen.",
        "Therefore, at the top level, Maybury's system has a record of the intention causing the text to be produced.",
        "But now consider what happens during goal refinement.",
        "When an operator is instantiated, the clauses in its decomposition field are posted as subgoals.",
        "Note from Figure 20 that in Maybury's operator language expressions in the decomposition field are not subgoals to affect the hearer's mental state.",

        "So, in fact Maybury's system does not have a record of the intentional structure behind the text it is producing.",
        "There are two problems.",
        "First, except at the top level, planning is done by matching against the header field of operators, not against the effects field.",
        "Because there are multiple effects listed for most of the operators, the system cannot know which one is the intended effect!",
        "Maybury's system thus cannot distinguish between intended effects and side effects.",

        "Therefore, Maybury's system does not have the knowledge necessary for recovering from failures, as our system does.",
        "A second problem with Maybury's text plans is that they do not capture the relationship between intentions, i.e., that some intentions are in the plan because they in turn serve other intentions that appear higher in the plan tree.",
        "Once again, this is because Maybury's system simply records all the effects of each action.",
        "It is impossible to tell from the sets of effects at each level of the decomposition how effects are related to one another.",

        "While we believe that it is useful to represent additional effects of operators, it is crucial to distinguish intended effects from side effects.",
        "Therefore, we argue that while Maybury's approach does indeed represent the effects of all of the \"communicative acts\" in his plans, it does not capture intentional structure and therefore cannot be used to recover from communication failures.",
        "In related work, Cawsey (1993) built a system called EDGE that allows the user to interrupt with clarification questions while a text is being generated.",
        "EDGE plans extended tutorial explanations about the structure and input/output behavior of simple electrical circuits.",
        "This system is novel because it addresses issues of conversation management, such as turn-taking and topic control.",
        "The system separates discourse planning rules from content planning rules for this purpose.",
        "EDGE plans an explanation at a high level, following a specified curriculum.",
        "This plan is fleshed out as the dialogue progresses, causing sentences to be generated.",
        "After each sentence is generated, the system pauses to allow the user to supply feedback by choosing an item from a menu.",
        "The EDGE discourse planner maintains an agenda indicating the topics that will be covered later in the explanation.",
        "Based on this agenda, the system can recognize when the user is asking about a topic that will be covered eventually, and can make",
        "A plan operator for defining (from Maybury [1992]).",
        "comments such as We'll be getting to that in a moment.",
        "If this is not the case, or if the user insists, EDGE answers the user's question immediately.",
        "Once the interruption has been addressed, EDGE alters its subsequent explanation plan based on what took place during the interruption, and proceeds with its explanation as specified in the overall explanation plan.",
        "To resume from interruptions coherently, the discourse planning rules that manage the conversation include markers and meta-comments (e.g., Anyway, I was talking about..",
        ".).",
        "Because of its extended explanation plan and its discourse management rules, EDGE can handle interruptions in ways that are beyond the current capability of our system.",
        "However, as Cawsey points out, EDGE is based on a largely syntactic model of dialogue structure, and the system does not explicitly represent why different dialogue actions are selected.",
        "The effects that dialogue operators are intended to have on the user's knowledge and goals are not represented.",
        "EDGE content plans are much like schemas and therefore suffer from the limitations we discussed in Section 3.2.1.",
        "If a user fails to understand a text produced by a content plan, the system's only recourse is to try another strategy to achieve the top-level content goal, e.g., \"describe how an entity works.\" Moreover, the content plans of EDGE are domain-specific, and are not based on general rhetorical techniques.",
        "Because rhetorical structure is not represented, the system cannot choose connective markers or use other rhetorical devices that make text easier to comprehend.",
        "For these reasons, EDGE cannot handle the types of phenomenon our system handles.",
        "It is also important to note that, because we are dealing with expert and advisory applications, our system must be able to manage a dialogue whose structure emerges dynamically as the user asks questions.",
        "In advisory interactions, the system presents the user with a recommendation or result and only provides explanations when the user requests them.",
        "It is not appropriate for the system to plan extended explanations, testing the user's understanding and elaborating without provocation.",
        "Therefore, Cawsey's approach, which relies on the fact that the system has an extended explanation plan to follow, cannot be used directly.",
        "It is clear, however, that our approach and Cawsey's are complementary, and that a complete system would need to incorporate aspects of both.",
        "In particular, our system should be augmented to include conversation management operators in order to manage topic shifts, to handle interruptions, and to generate meta-comments about the discourse itself.",

        "Status and Future Directions The text planner presented in this paper is implemented in Common Lisp and can produce the text plans necessary to participate in the sample dialogue described in this paper and several others; see Moore (in press) and Paris (1991a).",
        "We currently have over 150 plan operators that can answer the following types of questions: Why?",
        "Why conclusion?",
        " â Why are you trying to achieve goal?",
        "Why are you using method to achieve goal?",
        "Why are you doing act?",
        "How do you achieve goal (in the general case)?",

        "What is a concept?",
        "What is the difference between conceptl and concept2?",

        "The text planner is being incorporated into several knowledge-based systems and two intelligent tutoring systems currently under development.",
        "Two of these systems are intended to be installed and used in the field.",
        "This will give us an opportunity to evaluate the techniques proposed here and extend the system as appropriate.",
        "It has also been employed in Reithinger's (1991) system for incremental language generation, and serves as the basis of the presentational planner for WIP, a multimedia system that plans text and graphics to achieve communicative goals (Wahlster et al.",
        "1991).",
        "Finally, it is the basis for a text planner capable of generating explanatory texts that integrate examples with their surrounding context (Mittal and Paris 1993).",
        "This integration would not be possible without our system's explicit representation of the intentions for generating portions of the text and the rhetorical strategies used to achieve them.",
        "We have begun to investigate how the discourse history should be indexed and exploited to control the dialogue and affect subsequent responses in more general ways.",
        "As reported here, the dialogue history is used primarily to determine how to interpret and answer follow-up questions (e.g., Why?, How come?",
        "), and to determine how to respond when the user asks a question that has already been answered or indicates that an explanation was not understood (Huh?).",
        "In Carenini and Moore (1993) and Rosenblum and Moore (1993) we discuss additional ways in which prior explanations can affect the generation of the current utterance.",

        ".",
        "), or to introduce new goals into the dialogue (e.g., Well, now suppose I wanted to enhance efficiency .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ").",
        "In order to allow the user to change topics and introduce new goals at will, the system will need to be able to track the user's shifting goals and attention.",
        "Sidner (1985) and Carberry (1987) have proposed approaches for tracking the topic of conversation in task-oriented dialogues.",
        "However, their approaches rely on the assumption that the topic of conversation closely follows the structure of the domain task.",
        "Litman and",
        "Allen (1987) identified types of subdialogues in task-oriented interactions, including clarifications and corrections, in which topic shift deviates from task structure, and they devised a plan recognition model for handling such subdialogues.",
        "Our system currently handles what Litman and Allen call clarification subdialogues.",
        "We believe that our model could be extended to handle other types of subdialogues, and that the text plans recorded in our dialogue history will aid in more general discourse management tasks than the ones we currently address.",
        "To perform these tasks, our system must understand how the previous responses stored in its discourse history relate to one another.",
        "That is, we must address issues of how to build a representation of the intentional structure of the dialogue that is emerging across conversational turns (Grosz and Sidner 1986) and to track global focus (Grosz 1977).",
        "In addition, we will need communicative strategies for managing the dialogue, e.g., strategies for introducing a topic, strategies for returning to a topic, etc."

        "We argued that, in order to participate in such dialogues, a system must be capable of reasoning about its own previous utterances.",
        "Follow-up questions must be interpreted in the context of the ongoing conversation, and the system's previous contributions form part of this context.",
        "We claimed that to handle explanation dialogues successfully, a discourse model must include the intended effect of individual parts of the text on the hearer, as well as a representation of how the parts relate to one another rhetorically.",
        "Through principled arguments and detailed examples, we showed that previous approaches to multisentential text generation, which do not explicitly represent the intentional structure of their utterances, cannot be used for advisory dialogues.",
        "We presented our approach to text generation in which the system reasons about and records the intentions behind each text span as well as the rhetorical means used to achieve them.",
        "Finally, we demonstrated how this record can be used to overcome some of the limitations of earlier approaches."
