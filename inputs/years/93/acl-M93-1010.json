        "Our research and development goals are:",
        "• more rapid development of new applications, • the ability to train (and re-train) systems based on user markings of correct and incorrect output, • more accurate selection among interpretations when more than one is found, and • more robust partial interpretation when no complete interpretation can be found.",

        "For the version of PLUM used in MUC-5, part of speech information was determined by using well-known Markov modeling techniques embodied in BBN's part-of-speech tagger POST [5].",
        "We also used a correction model, AMED [3], for improving Japanese segmentation and part-of-speech tags assigned by JUMAN.",
        "For the microelectronics domain, we used a probabilistic model to help identify the role of a company in a capability (whether it is a developer, user, etc.).",
        "Statistical modeling in PLUM contributes to portability, robustness, and trainability.",
        "The second key feature is our use of learning algorithms both to obtain the knowledge bases used by PLUM' s processing modules and to train the probabilistic algorithms.",
        "We feel the key to portability of a data extraction system is automating the acquisition of the knowledge bases that need to change for a particular language or application.",
        "For the MUC-5 applications we used learning algorithms to train POST, AMED, and the template-filler model mentioned above.",
        "We also used a statistical learning algorithm to learn case frames for verbs from examples (the algorithm and empirical results are in [4]).",
        "A third key feture is partial understanding, by which we mean that all components of PLUM are designed to operate on partially interpretable input, taking advantage of information when available, and not failing when information is unavailable.",
        "Neither a complete grammatical analysis nor complete semantic interpretation is required.",

        "• Automatic training and acquisition of knowledge bases can yield relatively good performance at reduced labor, as evidenced, for example, by a quick port to the microelectronics domain (in 2 languages) in 2 person-months (after which further refinements were made).",
        "• Domains dominated by jargon (sub-language) may be easier than domains of normal vocabulary because there is less ambiguity and more predictability.",
        "For TIPSTER this means that the microelectronics domain was easier than joint ventures.",
        "• Japanese was easier to process than English because of strong clues provided by case-markers, and a less varied linguistic structure in the articles.",
        "• Availability of a large text corpus was invaluable for quick knowledge acquisition.",
        "A smaller number of filled templates should still be adequate.",
        "• Our algorithms were already largely language and domain-independent; an important goal remains to further automate the porting process.",
        "• Finite-state pattern matching is a useful complement to linguistic processing, offering a good fall-back strategy for addressing language constructions that are hard to treat via general linguistically-based approaches.",
        "• Continued work on discourse processing is important to improving performance.",
        "Reliably determining when different descriptions of events or objects in fact refer to the same thing remains one of the hardest problems in data extraction.",
        "• Improving syntactic coverage is a priority.",

        "The reason for the second spurious tie-up stems from PLUM having identified \"Taiwan\" (in the phrase \"in Taiwan\") as a corporation, and more precisely, as a joint venture company.",
        "The lexical entry for \"Taiwan\" incorrectly lists it as a corporation, as well as a country.",
        "Once \"Taiwan\" was identified as a corporation, the pattern [\"set up\" ... <company> with <company>1 matched the text \"set up a joint venture in Taiwan with a local concern and ...\", and \"Taiwan\" was identified as the joint venture company.",
        "Since this joint venture company was found to be different from \"Bridgestone Sports Taiwan Co.,\" which was also identified as a joint venture company by the system, 2 separate tie-ups were generated.",
        "After the test was run, we removed the definition of \"Taiwan\" as a corporation.",
        "With this change, the system generated I less tie-up object, and it correctly found the reference between \"a joint venture\" and \"the joint venture.\"",

        "\"UNION PRECISION CASTING CO\" was missed because it was not recognized as a possible company name: capitalization information was not available to help with name recognition (the article was fully capitalized), and the tagging component tagged \"casting\" as a V, a category which is not allowed to be taken as part of a company name.",

        "(1) What information triggers the instantiation of each of the two LITHOGRAPHY objects?",
        "The PLUM system generated 3 lithography objects, all of type UNKNOWN (the key contains 1 LASER lithography and 1 UNKNOWN lithograpy).",
        "The three triggering phrases are: \"a new stepper,\" \"the stepper,\" and \"latest stepper\"",
        "(2) What information indicates the role of Nikon Corp. for each Microelectronics Capability?",
        "The PLUM system initially finds Nikon Corp. as the manufacturer of each of the 3 capabilities (in the key, Nikon is the manufacturer of the LASER lithography and the manufacturer and distributor of the UNKNOWN lithography).",
        "Nikon was associated with each of the three capabilities because it occurred in the same sentence.",
        "Our statistical model of entity<->capability relationships indicated that Nikon was most likely to be a manufacturer, so it was placed in this role.",
        "We actually found Nikon as a distributor of all 3 capabilities, but we removed this relation as it was determined to be unlikely by our statistical model.",
        "Nikon was thought to be a distributor because of the trigger verbs \"market\" and \"sell.\"",
        "The discourse rule then picked up Nikon Corp. (at score I) as the agent of this verb.",
        "(3) Explain how your system captured the GRANULARITY information for \"The company's latest stepper.\"",
        "The granularity phrase \"a resolution of 0.45 micron\" was correctly understood by the semantics component and was associated with the appropriate lithography object via a discourse rule.",
        "However, the granularity filler was ruled out by the template generator because its confidence score fell outside the threshold set for this slot (the threshold setting is tailored to provide the best overall system performance).",
        "Consequently, the granularity information did not appear in the response template.",
        "(4) How does your system determine EQUIPMENT TYPE for \"the new stepper\"?",
        "\"the company's latest stepper\"?",
        "Equipment types are defined hierarchically in PLUM's domain model.",
        "The word \"stepper\" is linked to the concept STEPPER in the domain model and triggers a STEPPER discourse event.",
        "The template generator translates STEPPER events into equipment objects of type STEPPER.",
        "So the equipment_type is based on the domain model concept that is associated with the trigger phrase.",
        "(5) How does your system determine the STATUS of each equipment object?",
        "The equipment status is defaulted to IN_USE.",
        "(6) Why is the DEVICE object only instantiated for LITHOGRPAHY-1?",
        "PLUM's discourse heuristic for finding a process's device only looks within the same sentence.",
        "In this article, the 64-mbit DRAM device is in the same sentence as the first lithography object, but no other.",
        "Other comments on walkthrough performance: The PLUM system found 3 microelectronics capabilities instead of the 2 in the answer key.",
        "The spurious capability results from a discourse referencing problem: the lithography object triggered by the definite phrase \"the stepper\" was not found to be coreferential with the lithography object triggered by \"a new stepper\" in the previous sentence.",
        "PLUM's definite referencing mechanism is controlled by a parameter When this parameter is turned on, PLUM correctly resolves the definite reference in this example, and only 2 lithography capabilities are generated.",
        "However, turning the parameter on negatively affects scores overall, so it was off for the MUC-5 test.",
        "The walkthrough article exemplifies our use of the entity relation statistical model.",
        "The PLUM system, through discourse processing, had hypothesized Nikon Corp as both the distributor and manufacturer of <LITHOGRAPHY2789568-1>, as the distributor of <LITHOGRAPHY-2789568-2>, and as the distributor and purchaser/user of <LITHOGRAPHY-2789568-3>.",
        "However, these relations were found at a fairly low confidence by a discourse search rule looking around within the sentence.",
        "On the other hand, the statistical model (derived from training data) indicated that Nikon is most likely to be a manufacturer.",
        "So the template generator removed the unlikely relations (distributor and purchaser/user) and entered the likely relation of manufacturer.",
        "Compared against the key, the statistical model was correct in removing the purchaser/user relation but incorrect in removing one of the distributor relations.",
        "The PLUM system incorrectly generated only 1 stepper equipment object.",
        "This was because the discourse event triggered by \"the company's latest stepper\" was incorrectly merged with the earlier stepper events.",
        "If PLUM could have recognized the two granularities and associated them with the 2 different stepper objects (at a high level of confidence), this over-merging error could have been prevented.",
        "The device size information was missed because PLUM failed to correctly analyze the sequence \"64- mbit dram.\"",
        "Since running the walkthrough message for the MUC-5 test, this problem has been fixed, so the device size information in this article is now reported.",
        "Some entities are picked up directly in the semantics when parsed within a fragment, or via lexical clues and syntactic/semantics contexts within phrases.",
        "Others are picked up via discourse rules.",
        "(4) How many discourse entities were identified anywhere in the text, and how did the system determine which of these were reportable?",
        "The template generator's parameters were set to only output objects directly related to a tie-up.",
        "There was no problem.",
        "(8) Sentence 2 ends with a general statement about products developed in tie-ups between insurance companies and securities companies.",
        "How would your system determine that this is a generic, not a specific reference?",
        "No tie-up is generated when no proper names of companies are mentioned.",
        "(9) Discuss any specific analysis your system does to handle terms like \"ryousha\", which appears in Sentence 2.",
        "How does your system deal with the usage of the particle \"no\" that precedes it?",
        "Currently, our system does not deal with conjunctions like \"ryousha\"."
