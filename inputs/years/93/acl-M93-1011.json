        "The GE-CMU TIPSTER/SHOGUN system is the result of a two-year research effort, part of the ARPA-sponsored TIPSTER: data extraction program.",
        "The project's main goals were: (1) to develop algorithms that would advance the state of the art in coverage and accuracy in data extraction, and (2) to demonstrate high performance across languages and domains and to develop methods for easing the adaptation of the system to new languages and domains.",
        "The system as used in MUC-5 represents a considerable shift from those used in earlier stages of the program and in previous MUC's.",
        "The original SHOGUN design integrated several different approaches by combining different knowledge sources, such as syntax, semantics, phrasal rules, and domain knowledge, at runtime.",
        "This allowed the system to achieve a good level of performance very quickly, and made it easy to test different modules and methods; however, it proved very difficult to make all the changes necessary to improve the system, especially across languages, when system knowledge was so distributed at runtime.",
        "As a result, the team adopted a new approach, relying heavily on finite-state approximation.",
        "This method combines several earlier previous of work, including Pereira's research on grammar approximation [4], some of the original ideas on parser compilation from Tomita [5], and GE's representation of the dynamic lexicon [3, 1].",
        "Like Pereira's model, the system uses a finite-state grammar as a loose version of a context free",
        "grammar, under the assumption that the finite state grammar will cover all the inputs that the general grammar would recognize but perhaps be more tolerant.",
        "However, the system also includes methods for compiling different knowledge sources into the finite state model, particularly emphasizing lexical knowledge and domain knowledge as reflected in a corpus.",
        "This model, in which knowledge is combined at development time to be used by a finite-state pattern matching engine at run-time, makes it easier to tune the system to a new language or domain without sacrificing the benefit of having general linguistic and conceptual knowledge in the system.",
        "While the GE systems, and more recently, the GE-CMU systems, have done well in all the MUC evaluations, our rate of progress has never been so great as it has been in the period before MUC-5.",
        "This is in spite of the fact that the team's diagnostic and debugging efforts had to be divided across languages and domains (handling Japanese, for example, presented a significant overhead in simply being able to follow the rules and analyze the results).",
        "We attribute this progress to the current focus on facilitating and automating the knowledge acquisition process, especially on the use of a corpus.",
        "This paper will give a very brief overview of the configuration of the system, followed by the analysis of the examples, and some conclusions about the results."

      "text": [
        "The TH)STER/SHOGUN system as configured for the 24-month/ MUC-5 benchmark has roughly the same components as earlier versions of the system, but the system now performs linguistic analysis entirely using a finite-state pattern matcher, instead of LR parsing or chart-style parsing, both of which were part of the configuration in MIJC-4.",
        "Figure 1 shows the basic components of the SHOGUN system, using our own names for modules, where applicable, along with the labels used in Jerry Hobbs' paper \"The Generic Information Extraction System\".",
        "The core components of SHOGUN are a subset of the modules that Hobbs describes.",
        "However, the system differs from other current extraction systems in the use of the finite-state analyzer and the way that corpus-based knowledge is integrated into the lexico-syntactic rules."

      "heading": "Finite â€“ state Sentence Analysis",
      "text": [
        "Because many of the MUC-5 systems DOW perform much the same type of pre-processing, name recognition, and post.",
        "processing that SHOGUN has, we will concentrate here on linguistic analysis, including",
        "parsing and lexical disambiguation, which were the main research areas of our work on SHOGUN.",
        "About half of the MUC-5 systems still use linguistic analysis driven by \"traditional\" phrase structure rules, traditional in the sense that there is a clearly separable syntactic component whose knowledge consists mainly of rules for recognizing grammatical constituents based on word categories (like noun, ver)) and word order.",
        "SHOGUN differs from all these systems in that it no longer has any purely syntactic component, and uses finite state rules in place of phrase structure rules.",
        "The remaining systems divide roughly into those that emphasize pattern matching and those that emphasize fragment parsing.",
        "The fragment parsing systems, notably BBN's, work fairly close to the way our MU(-4 system did, taking advantage of partial parses by using a combination of syntactic and domain knowledge to guide the combination of syntactic chunks.",
        "The difference between this approach and SIIOGUN's current processing is that fragment parsing is still a largely syntax-first method, while pattern matching tends to introduce specialized domain and corpus knowledge by combining this knowledge with syntactic knowledge in the system's declarative representation.",
        "By this coarse characterization, the \"pattern matching\" group of systems includes, for example, SRI and Unisys as well as GE-CMU.",
        "We also consider UMass to be in this category, because their linguistic analysis emphasizes lexical and conceptual knowledge rather than constituent structure.",
        "Among these approaches, we believe the main differentiator is not in the basic processing algorithms but in the way that knowledge ends up getting assigned to various system components.",
        "If there is one noteworthy trend among the MUC systems as they have evolved over time, it is that they have become more knowledge-based, especially emphasizing more corpus-based and lexical knowledge as well as automated knowledge acquisition methods.",
        "Within the emerging \"generic\" model, the main difference among systems is thus in the content of their knowledge bases.",
        "Here, the distinguishing characteristic of SHOGUN is probably the degree to which the system still includes sentence-level knowledge, assigning linguistic and conceptual roles much the way the TRUMP/TRUMPET combination did but using more detailed, lexically-driven knowledge.",
        "Many of the sentence-level rules, for example, include groupings like start a facility and organization noun phrase, which combine traditional syntactic phrases with lexical or domain knowledge.",
        "As systems continue to become still broader in scope and more accurate, it is likely that the way knowledge is acquired will become the main differentiator.",
        "The rest of this paper will discuss the overall results of SHOGUN on MUC-5 and describe how the system handles some of the system walkthrough examples.",
        "The analysis of the examples will highlight some of these characteristics and demonstrate the system's actions in various stages of processing."

      "heading": "OVERALL RESULTS",
      "text": [
        "The SHOGUN system did very well on MUC-5.",
        "The team's specific goals were to achieve results on the MUC5/TIPSTER tasks that were above the level of the simpler MUC-4 task, to attain comparable performance across languages and domains, and to reduce customization time as much as possible.",
        "In addition, the aim was to produce near-human accuracy at a throughput orders of magnitude faster than human beings.",
        "These goals seemed rather ambitious, but SHOGUN reached all of them.",
        "The following is a summary of SHOGUN's performance on all the official metrics.",
        "We put error rate first and F-measure last in this table because these are the only ones that can be used for overall system comparison (the goal being low error rate and high F-measure).",
        "The overall results here are better, on average, than SHOGUN's scores on the MUC-4 benchmark.",
        "While",
        "it is very difficult to compare results across domains across languages, it is clear that this shows substantial progress, as the MUC-5 tasks are certainly much harder and more detailed than MUC-4.",
        "In addition, the average improvement between the TIPSTER 18 month benchmark and the current point was over 20%, and there is certainly more room for further improvement.",
        "Thus we are confident that our current methods and algorithms support continued progress toward high accuracy.",
        "While it seems that there is substantial variation among the scores on the different language-domain pairs, this variation is reasonable given the differences among the task and the variations on the test samples.",
        "The EME result is worse than the others, but the EME MUC-5 test set seemed to be a very difficult one for our system.",
        "In fact, the system on a blind test using the same configuration scored 9 error rate points better in EME than on the test reported above.",
        "We are not sure what accounts for this variability in EME, which is much greater than on the other domain-language pairs.",
        "With respect to achieving human performance, it is not clear where good human perform falls on these scales, but we are close.",
        "At the TIPSTER 12-month test, a study of trained human analysts placed individual analysts between 70 and 80 in F-measure.",
        "However, this test used a somewhat more generous scoring algorithm than the current one (there have been a number of important changes to the scoring since the 12-month point), and did not separate the analysts work from the preparation of the \"ideal\" answers â€“ it is important in a blind test that the human subject have no impact on the answer key, because there are many texts that involve fine-grained interpretation.",
        "The results on Japanese are, on average, somewhat higher than the English results.",
        "This is consistent with our tests.",
        "We attribute this to the fact that the Japanese tests are considerably easier than the English (a factor that is somewhat difficult to weight, given that none of our system developers know Japanese).",
        "Some of the influences that make the Japanese easier are greater homogeneity in the text sources (for example, EME includes very different sources from EJV, while JJV and JME are quite consistent in style), shorter stories with fewer distinct events in Japanese, far fewer new joint venture companies in Japanese, and an emphasis in Japanese on research and sales rather than production (production activities are more difficult to assign to codes in the template design).",
        "In addition to the SIIOGUN system, the GE-CMU team ran the Japanese benchmarks only using a system called TEXTRACT, which was developed in parallel to SHOGUN by Tsuyoshi Kitani, a visiting researcher at CMU from NTT Data.",
        "TEXTRACT, like SHOGUN, emphasizes lexically-driven pattern matching, and the two systems share a Japanese tagging/segmentation program from NTT Data, called MAJESTY.",
        "While there is little else that is directly shared between the two system's, additions to TEXTRACT's knowledge base were incrementally adapted, in functionality, to SHOGUN's knowledge base in JJV, thus it it not surprising that the systems had similar performance on this set.",
        "TEXTRACT generally had a better performance on company name recognition than SHOGUN, and a somewhat more effective method of splitting events.",
        "SHOGUN had better coverage of industry types and products (based, we think, on the heavy use of statistically-based training), and had higher recall (but lower precision) in JME.",
        "Figure 3 shows the results of both systems on the recall/precision scale on the various MUC-5 sets."

        "The examples are in many ways typical of the TIPSTER-SHOGUN system.",
        "These are relatively easy messages, but the problems the system encountered are illustrative.",
        "In the English message, the system made a few minor mistakes, some of which may even have been matters of fine-grained interpretation, and had an error rate of 15 for EJV0592.",
        "This is much better than the average message; on the whole, the EJV performance is pulled down by \"tangled tie-up\" messages in which the system has a great deal of difficulty determining who is doing what with whom.",
        "11V0002 was much harder, because it requires information to be split across two tie-ups.",
        "The system correctly determined that there were two tie-ups (which it did not do when it ran this message at the 12- month point), but.",
        "it failed to recognize \"Toukyou kaijou\" as an alias for \"Toukyou kaijou kasai hoken\", and as a result ended up getting a whole bunch of aliases and entity pointers wrong.",
        "In addition, SHOGUN made the very typical mistake of almost getting the product service information but losing most of the points, anyway.",
        "In this ease, the Japanese text says that the tie-up will be selling a new product called \"hyu-man\".",
        "SHOGUN correctly spots this and assumes that whatever \"hyu-man\" is will be wholesale sales with code 50.",
        "The analyst infers from the context that \"hyu-man\" is an insurance product, so the actual industry type is \"finance\" rather than \"sales\".",
        "Finally, the answer key contains an error in the string fill, so SHOGUN gets scored completely wrong on this object.",
        "We emphasize these minor mistakes because it helps to show, for one thing, how hard it is to get extremely high accuracy, and, for another, the relative effects of easy and hard objects.",
        "SHOGUN was, by far, the most accurate system in determining industry information, probably because our efforts on automated knowledge acquisition used this object as a test case for both English and Japanese.",
        "However, the net effect of the industry object in SHOGUN was a reduction in error of .2 in English and 1.2 in Japanese over what the system would have produced by leaving the product service slot blank.",
        "This is because potentially spurious information on hard objects and slots dilutes the good scores produced on the easier objects and slots.",
        "Hence it is very difficult to show improvement by getting more information; the easiest improvements are to get higher and higher performance on the \"critical\" slots and objects.",
        "In addition, the system made many technical errors with the location and alias slots, some of which are illustrated here.",
        "Often these were due to bugs, but there are many other problems.",
        "The location slot(s) proved much more difficult than expected, because many forms of subtle inferences often affect location information, such as inferring that one site subsumes another or inferring location by process of elimination (especially in Japanese).",

        "The examples and the analysis here are illustrative of the performance of the TIPSTER/SHOGUN system on MUC-5.",
        "While the system has done well and continued to improve significantly, there are still quite a number of problems that could be fixed to achieve better accuracy.",
        "On the other hand, the steady improvement of the system and the high performance across languages are very gratifying, and the fact that we already seem close to human performance seems to bode well for the deployment of this technology.",
        "While research up to this point has emphasized interpretation and control issues, we see corpus analysis and knowledge acquisition algorithms as being the key topics for further research and further progress.",
        "In this way, MUC-5 may represent a turning point from matters of structure to matters of scale, with most of the necessary work on this type of task being broadening scope and scale.",
        "At the same time, we expect that simple but very challenging tasks will emerge that test some of the key algorithms that are required for data extraction."
