      "text": [
        "Language Systems, Inc. (LSI) believes that the best system for producing a complete and accurate automated analysis of natural language text is an in-depth text understanding system that employs linguistic as well as other analytical techniques to interpret the text.",
        "Our DBG (Data Base Generation) natural language processing system performs full-scale linguistic analysis of text in order to produce a system-internal text-level representation of the content of the text.",
        "This representation is composed of a set of entity and event frame structures, interrelated to reflect the organization and content of the text.",
        "This representation of the text can then be mapped into any data structure required by a downstream application, such as the templates specified for the MUC-5/Tipster applications.",
        "DBG has been designed as a single core system for handling texts of different types in different domains for a variety of applications.",
        "Application types for which DBG has provided the input include information extraction and database generation tasks such as MUC-5, message fusion (the combination of information derived from various kinds of sources, including text; see [1]), and the translation of text into another language using spoken input and output ([2]).",
        "It is clear to us that our DBG system, while achieving MUC-5 results comparable to EME scores attained by Tipster contractors in the MUC-5 tests, is still far from achieving the level of performance that we believe is possible for it.",
        "LSI's official MUC-5 P&R score for English Microelectronics (EME) texts was 42.74, which represents a considerable improvement over our MUC-4 P&R score of 18.87 on TST3.",
        "As we continue to incorporate improved versions of the various components of our natural language processing system (Figure 1) and to exploit more fully the capabilities of existing components, we expect that our scores will continue to improve.",
        "Founded upon research performed over the last twenty years, the DBG system has been under actual development for the last seven years.",
        "The basic architecture of the core system has remained the same over that time.",
        "Because the system is modular, the individual modules can be redesigned and updated without affecting the rest of the system.",
        "Most of the current modules have been redesigned or extended within the last three years.",
        "'Support for MUC-5 final testing was provided by the Army Research Laboratory/SLCBR-SE-C, under Contract No.",
        "DAAA15-89-C-0004 (Subcontract No.",
        "05-562-01 to Logicon, Inc.) Also, we gratefully acknowledge the assistance of Andrew Brislen and Michael Possedi from Sun Microsystems, and Carrie Du Bois from Quintus, during the final testing period."

      "text": [
        "Among the innovative aspects of the DBG system as used for MUC-5 are a flexible frame-based concept hierarchy that is accessible at every stage of processing; a principle-based syntactic parser which enables the identification of sentence-level event-entity relations very early in processing; an integrated ability to handle incomplete information and structures; and the frame-based text-level representation mentioned above which allows for intersentential reference resolution and for the explicit representation of the event-entity relations and implicit content of the text.",
        "These relations were then easily mapped into EME templates.",
        "LSI's main area of development for MUC-5 was the extension of the knowledge contained in the concept hierarchy and the use of this knowledge at every stage of processing.",
        "Although the frame-based hierarchy was a component of the DBG system as early as MUCK-2, it was not exploited significantly until MUC-5.",
        "This, more than any other factor, was responsible for the increase in our performance over MUC-4.",
        "Each item in the lexicon is associated with a concept frame, as illustrated in Figure 2.",
        "The frames or concept nodes bear \"isa\" (set membership) relations to other concepts in the hierarchy.",
        "During lexical analysis, the lexical items in the text are linked to concepts in the hierarchy.",
        "These concept links then provide the framework for producing the set of instantiated concept frames and links (the frame-based text-level representation) which is the final output of internal DBG processing.",
        "The frame-based concept hierarchy also allows for semantic checking at any point in processing and provides a mechanism for the inheritance of features and other information to direct descendants in the hierarchy.",
        "A related innovative DBG component is the Word Acquisition Module (WAM), which uses morphological analysis to provide grammatical category information for words for which no lexical entry exists.",
        "Based on the category assignment, a lexical entry and an \"isa\" link to a concept frame are automatically generated for each unknown item to allow complete processing of all sentences containing unknown words.",
        "The DBG syntactic parser as implemented for MUC-5 has a number of innovative aspects.",
        "The parser is to a great extent language-independent; it produces structures which reflect the partial isomorphism holding between syntactic and semantic structures in order to increase accuracy of processing.",
        "While the goal is to produce complete parses, the parser is also robust enough to produce usable partial parses in the absence of a complete parse.",
        "The design of the LSI parser is based on the Government-Binding theory of syntax.",
        "It is essentially a head-driven parser, and includes both bottom-up and expectation-based aspects.",
        "Argument structures associated with lexical items are projected into the syntax.",
        "Syntactic structure is determined from both item-specific lexical requirements as well as general requirements on syntactic structures (e.g., all sentences in languages like English require a subject).",
        "The use of empty categories and syntactic chains, combined with knowledge of event types contained in the concept hierarchy, enables the parser to associate thematic roles with entities expressed in noun phrases in a variety of construction types correctly and in a relatively straightforward manner.",
        "Constructions which are usually assumed to include empty categories (i.e., phonetically null syntactic elements) include passives, embedded infinitival sentences, questions, and relative clauses.",
        "The rationale for this assumption is that in constructions of this type, words (usually verbs) which typically require either an external argument (an argument in the specifier position), or an internal argument (an argument in complement position) appear with no appropriate argument in one of these positions.",
        "Since syntactic structures are characterized as \"projections\" of lexical items, these positions are assumed to be latently present, and linked to a phonetically realized argument in some other position via coindexing.",
        "The phonetically realized argument and the empty category thus form a syntactic \"chain\".",
        "By using these chains, we can associate the usual thematic roles assigned to certain positions with a given overt noun phrase, even if the overt phrase is not in the usual position.",
        "So adherence to certain grammatical principles in conjunction with a well-engineered event knowledge base has enabled us to get something \"for free\", as it were, in the MUC-5 task.",
        "Several of the innovative aspects of the DBG frame-based text-level knowledge representation, which we will here call the LSI templates (as distinct from the MUC-5 application-oriented EME templates) were not used extensively for MUC-5.",
        "These include the ability to combine contextual information – e.g.,",
        "comment: An insulator film resulting from the exposure of the silicon surface in oxidation, chemical vapor deposition, or sputtering.",
        "information derived from the header of a military message – with information extracted from the text; the capability of interpreting degree-of-belief information and relating it to meta-levels of event structure; and the incorporation of text grammar expectations as to the form and location of information within the text.",
        "Although these aspects of DBG are important in processing written and even transcribed voice messages in the Air Force and Army messages to which the system has been applied, the MUC-5 application does not depend heavily on outside information, and is not concerned with evaluation of the information received, and is characterized by more variability in information structure across texts.",
        "The relational organization of the DBG event and entity templates, however, was extremely useful in MUC-5 processing.",
        "Because it resembles the object-oriented organizational structure of the EME templates, the generation of EME template relations was relatively straightforward.",
        "Also, the thematic roles of the entity templates in relation to the events is explicit in the LSI templates and so can be easily associated with the role-specific slots (e.g., manufacturer, distributor) in the EME templates.",
        "In addition, the ability to establish co-reference at the text level in the LSI templates prevents overgeneration of EME templates and facilitates the correct template linkage.",
        "In the next section, the basic processing is described and illustrated by an example sentence."

        "The basic components of the DBG system are shown in the system diagram in Figure 1.",
        "They are the preprocessing module, the lexical analysis module, the syntactic parse module, the semantic parse module, and the knowledge representation module.",
        "An additional module, the application interface, maps the extracted knowledge into appropriate data structures according to the requirements of a given downstream application.",
        "Processing is sequential – the output of each module is a data structure that serves as input to the succeeding module and is then available to all later modules.",
        "Each module contains a processing mechanism and a knowledge base that includes general as well as domain-sensitive knowledge.",
        "The respective knowledge bases, indicated in ovals, are the lexicon and morphological rules, the set of grammatical principles used to construct the syntactic parse trees, the concept hierarchy, the discourse rules, and the rules for mapping into external data structures.",
        "As described in the previous section, at the stage of lexical analysis, the lexical items in the text are linked to nodes in the concept hierarchy, which enables information derived from the concept hierarchy to be used at any point in processing.",
        "Sample lexical items are shown in Figure 2.",
        "In addition to the basic components, the DBG system has an Unexpected Inputs (UX) Subsystem that handles new or erroneous data and evaluates and records system performance.",
        "This subsystem consists of modules that are integrated into the system modules; they are shown in the system diagram as small boxes inside the larger modules to which they apply.",
        "The two UX modules of the DBG system that were used for MUC-5 are the Lexical Unexpected Inputs (LUX) module and the Word Acquisition Module (WAM), both of which apply at the Lexical Analysis stage.",
        "The LUX module corrects errors by attempting partial matches between unmatched words in the text and items in the lexicon, using rules based on certain error hypotheses.",
        "As mentioned previously, new or unidentified words are passed on to WAM, wherein word class information is assigned based on morphological analysis.",
        "To illustrate the processing, the lexical analysis, syntactic parse, and semantic parse for an example sentence are shown in Figure 3, and the LSI internal templates for the same sentence, are shown in Figure 4.",
        "The sentence used is the first sentence of the example text 2606871, i.e., \"Hampshire Instruments has sold an x-ray lithography system to AT&T Bell Laboratories.\" The syntactic parse is created by projecting lexical items into elementary phrasal trees, which are then linked according to subcategorization and selectional requirements, as well as general principles of grammar."

        "Structural characteristics of the tree are then matched with the thematic specifications of the lexical items heading the phrases in the tree.",
        "In the semantic parse, shown in Figure 3, the thematic roles are explicitly labeled and related by indices to the verb 'sell'.",

        "Other information, including the tense and voice of the verb, is also given.",
        "Before a noun phrase can be assigned a given thematic role, it has to qualify both syntactically and by meeting semantic categorial requirements.",

        "Similarly for patient, recipient, and others.",
        "During the second pass, all the important MUC-5 words (specific processes, company names, equipment, devices) which were not handled in the first pass are processed, and each triggers an entity template.",

        "After all the templates are filled, co-reference links among the entity templates are established.",
