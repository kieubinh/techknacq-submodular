        "The system's underlying architecture, shown in Figure 1 overleaf, follows a by-now familiar task breakdown.",
        "Processing occurs in two main phases: preprocessing (in the elementizer module), which covers processes ranging from document destructuring to simple parsing, and natural language analysis per se, including application-specific output generation.",
        "As with several other MUC systems, our use of an explicit preprocessing phase is directly borrowed from work by Jacobs O. al (1991).",
        "One way Alembic differs from other MUC systems, however, is in exploiting SGML (Goldfarb 1990) as the interchange lingua franca between processing phases.",
        "The intention is to allow system modules whose invocation occurs early in the analysis of a document to record processing results directly in the document through SGML markup.",
        "This information then becomes available to subsequent modules as meta-data.",
        "Further, the elementizer itself is composed of a sequence of processing phases that also exchange partial results through SGML.",
        "As a result of this SGML-based architecture, the system's overall flow of control is governed from an object-oriented document manager built on top of Goldfarb's public domain SGML parser, ARC-SGML.",
        "For MUC-5, the preprocessing elementizer thus takes a source message file and normalizes it in various ways, yielding an intermediate SGML document.",
        "The document manager then builds an internal document object by parsing the resulting SGML.",
        "The actual content analysis of the document is performed by invoking the natural language analysis modules on the internal document object, and the results of these analyses are stored as attributes of the document.",
        "Another way in which Alembic differs from a prototypical MUC-class system is in its emphasis on text enrichment.",
        "That is, the output of the system is actually a new version of the source document enriched by semantic markup.",
        "The markup consists of a template-based index and simple semantic annotations identifying people, organizations, places, etc.",
        "For the MUC task, Alembic also provides selective output that consists solely of filled templates.",

        "Of Hobbs' several preprocessing tasks, the elementizer performs two: detecting sentence and paragraph boundaries, and tokenizing certain parts of the lexicon.",
        "The parts in question include some gargantuan sub-lexica that we do not want to have to load into our main processor, e.g., lists of personal names and the inventory of geography terms from the TIPSTER gazetteer.",

        "Specifically, we rely on structured CCG-style categories to handle argument structure, and on binary-branching phrase structure rules to handle modifier attachment and other general phrase structure phenomena.",
        "A transitive verb, for example is treated as the V/N category, i.e., as a function that takes a noun phrase argument on the right (the N term) and produces a verb phrase (the V term).",

        "From a computational perspective, however, the most important is that it makes the grammar entirely unary- or binary-branching.",
        "This is so because the syntactic phenomena that must traditionally be treated through greater-than-binary rules are typically complex argument structures – in our framework, these phenomena are handled through \"stacked\" functor categories, such as V/N/N.2 By relying on the binary-branching property of the grammar, we can thus simplify many aspects of our parser; we don't need to construct dotted rules, for example.",
        "Although there are many further interesting and unconventional aspects of Alembic's parser, they are only of secondary interest to an information extraction audience.",
        "For the present purpose, we will thus only allude to some of the parser's other relevant characteristics.",

        "These heuristics are simple and have so far proved themselves workable in practice.",
        "In particular, we prefer argument attachments to modifier attachments, and among multiple modifier attachments, we prefer those that attach deepest in the parse tree.",

        "We then compared the performance of these derivative systems to the baseline performance of the full system on the 86-message section of the dry run test set.",
        "These results are summarized in Table 2, and as can be readily seen, there are no substantial differences between the experimental conditions.",
        "We were somewhat surprised to note a slight performance improvement when we disabled the secondary OAL lexicon, which attests to a certain degree to the robustness of our fallback strategy of mapping unknown lexical items to the UNK-N category.",
        "One should refrain, however, from drawing any sweeping conclusions from these experiments.",
        "Indeed, the baseline recall level of Alembic on this task is still fairly low, so the effects of these experimental manipulations are probably masked by the lack of sufficient baseline recall.",
        "For example, if Alembic fails to identify a company as a joint venture participant, it does not matter whether the system later succeeds through reference resolution at determining the company's nationality or location.",
        "Finally, we performed an additional experiment in which we hand-tagged all geographical entities, corporations, and personal names, rather than leaving this task to the elementizer and parser.",
        "The intention here was to provide an oracle for these phrase types, so as to help us determine how much of our recall error might have been due to inadequacies in the parser or elementizer, especially with respect to parsing the names of joint venture participants.",
        "Once again, we found no significant difference between the baseline system and the oracle-driven system.",
        "This substantiates our anecdotal impressions that an inadequate extraction model is the main cause of our recall errors."

        "Alembic is still on the early end of its maturation curve.",
        "Our grammar, for example, was undergoing constant development up until the fmal runs – unlike many other MUC sites, we did not enter this endeavor with anything remotely close to a general grammar of English, or even of the so-called noun and verb groups.",
        "Throughout this time period, basic system development was thus responsible for stealing precious time away from domain engineering.",
        "One benefit of all our MUC-5 development, is that Alembic has reached a reasonably stable state.",
        "We now have a flexible framework within which to explore data extraction tasks such as EJV in MUC-5.",
        "We are especially encouraged by our recall/precision profile over the last few weeks of development.",
        "Our daily tests revealed a consistently high precision level that remained stable even with daily improvements in recall.",
        "We are also pleased by our preliminary experiences with the new inference component.",
        "Among MUC-5 participants, Alembic is distinguished by its ability to accommodate strategies that place a high premium on full parsing (the lexical inference rules) alongside strategies more geared towards fragment parsing (the event merging rules).",
        "We look forward to exploiting this new flexibility as we continue informal self-evaluation on the MUC-5 task, and as we explore future data extraction problems."
