        "The Computing Research Laboratory at New Mexico State University, in collaboration with Brandeis University, was one of four sites selected to develop systems to extract relevant information automatically from English and Japanese texts.",
        "The systems produced by the Tipster research groups have already been evaluated at 12 and 18 months into the project.",
        "The performance of the Diderot System has improved both for English and Japanese.",
        "The performance in Japanese, however, is still far ahead of our English performance.",
        "The Tipster project is, without a doubt, the largest scale Applied Natural Language Processing task yet undertaken anywhere in the world.",
        "The government data preparation effort involved the selection and analysis of more than 5,000 individual texts.",
        "The results of this analysis have been used to develop and test the systems produced by each site.",
        "The software used to support this human extraction task, both for English and Japanese, was developed and supported by the CRL under a separate subcontract.",
        "Because of the emphasis on different languages and different subject areas the research has focused on the development of general purpose, reusable techniques.",
        "The CRL/Brandeis group have implemented statistical methods for focusing on the relevant parts of texts, programs which recognize and mark names of people, places and organizations and also dates.",
        "The actual analysis of the critical parts of the texts is carried out by a parser controlled by lexical structures for the 'key' words in the text.",
        "To extend the system's coverage of English and Japanese some of the content of these lexical structures was derived from machine readable dictionaries.",
        "These were then enhanced with information extracted from corpora.",
        "The system has already been evaluated in the 4th Message Understanding Conference (MUC-4) where it was required to extract information from 200 texts on South American terrorism.",
        "Considering the very short development time allowed for this additional domain the system performed adequately.",
        "The system was then adapted to handle the business domain and also to process Japanese texts.",
        "Further extensions to the system allowed it to process texts on microelectronics development.",
        "Performance at the 12 and 18 month evaluations was good for Japanese, but less good for English where we have been attempting to automate much of the development process.",
        "A more pragmatic approach was adopted for the final 24 month evaluation, using the same hand-crafted techniques for English as had been used for Japanese.",
        "We estimate the amount of effort used directly to build the systems described here is around sixty man months."
