        "The PRC Adaptive Knowledge-based Text Understanding System (PAKTUS) was developed as an Independent Research and Development project at PRC from 1984 through 1992.",
        "It includes a core English lexicon and grammar, a concept network, processes for applying these to lexical, syntactic, semantic, and discourse analysis, and tools that support the adaptation of the generic core to new domains, primarily by acquiring sublanguage and domain-specific lexicon and topic patterns.",
        "The lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis components required little adaptation for MUC-5, the most significant change being conversion of the task-specific semantic representations to object-oriented form.",
        "The discourse analysis component was modified to operate on the task-specific semantic structures, rather than the generic case frames."

        "The overall structure and operation of PAKTUS are shown in Figure 1.",
        "This is similar to the \"generic system\" described in [1].",
        "Processing proceeds mostly sequentially, with the exception of the interaction between the syntactic and semantic components at the clause and noun phrase level, and between the lexical analysis and preprocessor.",
        "For the MUC5 task, we added some bracketing capabilities to handle the special syntactic phenomena in the financial application domain which might cause problems for the parser or later extraction processes.",
        "These phenomena include company name, currency, temporal expressions, and one percentage expression.",
        "For example, \"BRIDGESTONE SPORTS CO.\", \"BRIDGESTONE SPORTS TAIWAN CO\" , \"UNION PRECISION CASTING CO\" and \"TAGA CO.\" are recognized as company names during the bracketing phase; \" 20 MILLION NEW TAIWAN DOLLARS\" is bracketed as ((20000000 DOLLARACURRENCY BASE CATAIWAN)); and \"75 PCT BY\" is treated as a preposition.",
        "The complete sentence parse rate for the MUC5 corpus was significantly improved by the bracketing process, minimizing the need for complex additions to the grammar.",
        "Unlike the generic system, PAKTUS has no text filter or preparser.",
        "Full parses are attempted on all sentences, and the first syntactico-semantically successful parse of a sentence is accepted.",
        "Parse time is restricted as a linear function of the number of words, however, and parse fragments are returned, implicitly conjoined, if a full parse cannot be produced in the allotted time.",
        "Full parses were achieved for approximately 50 percent of the sentences in the MUC-5 corpus.",
        "Useful information was obtained from the fragmentary parses of the other half, however.",
        "Based on comparison of the MUC-5 error measures when fragmentary parses were included and excluded,",
        "the fragmented parses yielded, on average, about one-third as much correct information as the full parses.",
        "Another variation on the generic system is that fragment combination and semantic interpretation are integrated in PAKTUS, and semantic interpretation is divided into two distinct modules: one that produces a generic representation of the complete sentence, and a subsequent module that maps this into (possibly several) task-specific representations.",
        "In addition, at the lexical analysis phase, as mentioned above, each word was associated with both syntactic and semantic information.",
        "Lexical patterns were developed as an alternative to semantic interpretation based on full syntactico-semantic parses.",
        "This takes advantage of the information rich lexical analysis.",
        "A pattern matcher uses the results of both the lexical analysis (as in Figure 2a) and the syntactic analysis (as in Figure 3b) to extract information.",
        "This is invoked when the extraction based on full parsing fails to yield any data.",
        "The patterns are defined as regular expressions that are matched against the results of lexical analysis.",
        "When a match is found, the corresponding noun phrases (produced by the full parser) are extracted and the task-specific semantic representation is constructed from these.",
        "PAKTUS has no separate lexical disambiguation module: that function is distributed across all system modules.",
        "Initially, words are assigned all possible meanings available in the lexicon.",
        "Senses that are inconsistent with any processing choice are filtered out when that choice is considered.",
        "the PAKTUS lexicon are fetched or derived at this time; disambiguation is generally delayed until later phases.",
        "Many of the words are unknown to the PAKTUS lexicon; it will make guesses from the context.",
        "An example of an ambiguous word is \"concern.\"",
        "Figure 2b shows some of the lexicon information for this word in PAKTUS.",
        "This includes a list of the 4 PAKTUS primitive words corresponding to the token \"concern\" plus objects containing information for each primitive word.",
        "These objects are embedded in a semantic network; they inherit much additional information from it.",
        "Sample PAKTUS grammar specifications relevant to S1 are shown in Figure 3a, and the syntactic analysis of this sentence is shown in Figure 3b.",
        "This analysis is represented as a configuration of syntactic registers (the main ones are shown in the figure) and register fillers.",
        "The grammar fragment of Figure 3a recognized the bound clause in Si (\" ... it has set up a joint venture...\").",
        "Several semantic frames that apply to Si are shown in Figure 4a, and the generic semantic analysis of this sentence is shown in Figure 4b.",
        "PAKTUS represents the semantic analysis as five case frames: one for the sentence, one for each of the three subordinate clauses (only two of which are displayed in the figure), and one for the \"joint venture\" NP.",
        "The semantic rules are distributed in a network of objects like those in Figure 4a.",
        "Information is organized in several hundred conceptual objects (e.g., CACREATE - the concept for \"set up\" in Si) and case roles (e.g., RARESULT - the thing created).",
        "Information about how to map from syntactic registers to case roles may be stored in concept frames, lexical frames, or role frames, along with semantic constraints on allowable fillers.",
        "For example, the RARESULT role of CACREATE is normally filled by the direct object (DO) register.",
        "This information is inherited by RARESULT from the more general RAOBJECT role."
