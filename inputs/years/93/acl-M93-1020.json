      "text": [
        "For the past three years, TRW has been developing a-text analysis tool called DEFT-Data Extraction from Text.",
        "Based on the Fast Data Finder (MO, DEFT processes large volumes of text at very high speeds, identifying patterns which serve as indicators for the presence of relevant objects, relationships, or concepts in the data.",
        "These indicators are processed by a series of system-supplied utilities or custom-written functions which refine the data and reformulate it into frames which can be presented to a user for review, editing, and submission to a downstream application or database.",
        "Superficially, DEFT resembles a Natural language Understanding (NUJ) system; however, there are key differences.",
        "DEFT entertains very limited goals in the processing of natural language input.",
        "Although DEFT processes unconstrained input, it is looking for textual entities which are tightly constrained and presented to the system as a list of expressions or in a powerful pattern specification language.",
        "It exploits expectations about how a small set of entities will be expressed to reduce the amount of computation required to locate those and only those entities.",
        "The broader question of the \"meaning\" of the text in the document is bypassed in favor of rapid, robust processing that can be readily moved from domain to domain.",
        "As long as the input for a particular domain is sufficiently predictable, data extraction with a satisfactory level of recall and precision for many applications can he achieved.",
        "We are currently installing three DEFT systems for a United States government agency; initial reviews have been highly favorable.",
        "Our involvement in MUG-5 derives from a request by the government to turn DEFT to a COTS product, with the intent of having a fully-supported version of the system by the end of the year.",
        "An analysis of the broader commercial and government market for text extraction suggested that the scope of problems that DEFT should be able to address needed to be expanded; however, it was established that replication of the ongoing research and development work in the NIT community was an inappropriate role for our development group.",
        "Rather, we wanted DEFT to be able to integrate with systems already developed or in development for functionality which falls outside the narrow boundaries of DEFT's pattern-based capabilities.",
        "At the same time, DEFT's ability to express patterns needed to be extended from it's current, highly effective means for defining \"atomic\" patterns to the definition of patterns in relationship to each other, permitting simple syntactic information to be added to DEFT's lexical knowledge.",
        "Thus, DEFY would have the potential to find entities not expressly defined",
        "in a lexicon, improve its ability to correctly determine the relation between entities, and decrease the overgeneration that tends to be associated with approaches that rely exclusively on pattern matching.",
        "A mechanism was selected for enhancing pattern specification which was felt to be compatible with the notion of integrating DEFT with third-party systems.",
        "As will be described in some detail, DEFT is intrinsically an engineering shell which is intended to facilitate such integration while making its rapid pattern-matching services available to the other system components.",
        "Unfortunately, the software implementing this concept was not available at the time of the final MUC-5 evaluation, the results of which therefore serve only to confirm our expectations that the recognition of \"simple\" (i.e. isolated) patterns is woefully insufficient for complex data extraction problems.",
        "While we regret that the capabilities of the extended version of DEFT could not be demonstrated for MUC-5, we feel that the outcomes justify our belief that real-world message understanding problems necessitate an engineering solution that can pit a choice of technologies against the specific problem at hand different technologies being optimum for different tasks.",
        "We believe that DEFT's success in handling simple data extraction problems can be extended, and that DEFF is well-suited to a role as an integrator of text analysis capabilities.",
        "It is toward this end that we are focusing our ongoing productization efforts."

      "text": [
        "It is convenient to envision DEFT as a pipeline, as shown in Figure 1.",
        "At the head is a standardized document interlace to message handling systems.",
        "At the tail is a process which generates frames and distributes these to the appropriate destinations on the basis of content.",
        "In between is a series of text analysis \"filters\" which apply DEFT lexicons (pattern searches) against the text (using the EDO and call specific extraction functions to process the textual fragments located by the lexicons.",
        "All processes are controlled by means of external configuration files and a \"workbench\" which contains tools for interacting with DEFT and the data DEFT extracts.",
        "We will describe each of these major components in turn.",
        "The DOCUMent Interface: Message Queuing.",
        "It is assumed that DEFT will be embedded in an existing automated message handling (AMI1) system.",
        "DEFT's interface with these systems is called Message Queuing (MQ).",
        "\"Isext is typically disseminated to MQ (e.g. by a messaging system like TRW's ELCSS or KOALA that receives government cables, wire service input, etc.)",
        "on the basis of subject matter, source, structure, or other characteristic with salience for how the message's language will be analyzed.",
        "MQ can also accommodate documents loaded from other sources, such as native wire services, an existing full-text database, CD-ROM, OCR, and so on.",
        "Text is assumed to be in ASCII or extended ASCII; in the near-future, DEFT will build on work currently underway to allow the FIN to accommodate Unicode for foreign character sets, such as Japanese.",
        "Structural features, such as document boundaries, sentence boundaries, paragraphs, tabularization, encoded tags (such as SGML), embedded non-textual media, etc.",
        "can he defined for a particular document class using DEFT specification Files.",
        "MQ utilizes a configuration file to assign a processing thread tailored to the problem domain to each category of document classified by the dissemination system or by whatever means (including manual) is used to route documents to DEFT.",
        "Documents",
        "are associated with a processing thread by placing them in a particular WI \"inbasket\" (a standard Unix directory).",
        "Each in-basket is polled periodically, using a set of criteria (time and number of messages since the last processing thread was initiated) defined in the configuration file.",
        "Extracting Data: RAI Analysis Filters.",
        "When MQ assigns a document to a processing thread, it is subjected to a sequence of procedures which operate on the text to locate patterns of interest and use these patterns as a guide to extract the data required for a particular problem domain.",
        "This sequence of processes determines what is extracted and how it is extracted.",
        "The sequence is defined as an ordered list of \"extraction phases\" in a configuration file.",
        "This list can be changed at any time to substitute or add new extraction phases to refine a text processing thread.",
        "New threads can be modeled on existing ones, facilitating transitions to new problem areas.",
        "Each extraction phase is an executable program.",
        "The behavior of a phase is dependent on the order in which it is called (i.e. its relationship to the phases that have been executed before it) and on parameters which are supplied in the configuration file.",
        "In this way, a generalized extraction phase can be configured for a specific analytic objective.",
        "DEFT has a library of extraction phases that perform the most elementary analytic processes; new phases are be written on a problem-specific basis.",
        "DEFT provides an application programming interface (API) in the form of a library of utilities which allows a custom extraction phase to interact with the data structure which is common to all extraction phases, and which is used to communicate between phases.",
        "This structure is the DEFT \"Tag File.\"",
        "The Tag File is a cumulative record of the processing performed by each extraction phase.",
        "Each phase receives the Tag File from the preceding phase, and passes it.",
        "to",
        "the next.",
        "A \"tag\" represents a textual pattern identified by DEFT in the text or data created by an extraction function.",
        "Much of the power of DEFT comes from the ability to apply a mixture of extraction phases that is optimally suited for a given class of document and extraction problem.",
        "For example, one extraction phase might reason about the relative time of occurrence of events located in the text, basing its analysis on the occurrence of various forms of date/time indicators as well as the presence of such modifiers as \"last week,\" or \"three years ago.\"",
        "Another phase might construct corporate names on the basis of the occurrence of a known name or the presence of a designator (e.g. \"Inc.\" or \"S.A.\").",
        "Yet another phase might act upon these names to reason about their potential relationship in a joint venture.",
        "Locating Data: DEFT Lexicons.",
        "The patterns that DEFT uses to locate data of interest in the text arc contained in DEFF's lexicons.",
        "Lexicons serve various purposes: to identify potential frames, to determine the \"scope\" of a frame in the text (i.e. the boundaries to be used to find data to fill the frame slots), to find the contents for a slot in a frame, to determine structural elements (e.g. sentences, paragraphs, header information), and to set the attributes of a text object (e.g. classification level).",
        "Lexicons are of two types: list and pattern.",
        "The list lexicon associates a set of synonyms (or spelling variants) with a given object.",
        "It is useful when the complete set of strings associated with an object can be specified.",
        "The pattern lexicon is used when the textual variations associated with an object cannot be specified.",
        "For example, all possible monetary values cannot be conveniently enumerated, but a single pattern describing monetary values in terms of digits, punctuation, and denomination strings can be constructed.",
        "Associated with lexicon entries are attributes, representing the semantics of the problem domain.",
        "An attribute is a characteristic of the object represented in the text by its synonym list or pattern.",
        "It might be the normalized form of a name or other data about an object which is useful to map into a frame, such as the country associated with a corporate name.",
        "In a list lexicon, these attributes are known explicitly when an entry is created; they are not inferred from the text.",
        "In a pattern lexicon, however, the attributes cannot be known in advance because it is not known what exact value will hit against the pattern.",
        "For this reason, attributes must be extracted for a pattern lexicon: Attribute extraction is handled by a C or C++ program referred to as an \"extraction function.\"",
        "For example, given the location of a corporate designator, a function might reconstruct the corporate name.",
        "The success of a data extraction system that relies on pattern matching and string finding depends on how exhaustively it can search for the variations expected in input language.",
        "DEFT has proved successful in its current applications in part because its lexicons can be extremely large, thanks to the capabilities (in terms of both functionality and performance) of the RN.",
        "Searching Text for Lexicon Entries: The FOF.",
        "DEFT uses the TRW-developed Fast Data Finder to rapidly locate instances of a potentially enormous set of patterns in the input text.",
        "The power of the MI; originates in two ways: the hardware architecture and the expressiveness of its Pattern Specification Language (PSI.).",
        "The current generation 11)1-3, now a COTS product manufactured by Paracel, Inc., uses a massively parallel architecture to stream 'text past a search pattern at disk speeds (currently 3.5-million characters/second using a standard SCSI disk).",
        "Searches are compiled into micro code for a proprietary chip set which can accommodate up to 3,600 simultaneous character searches or Boolean operations.",
        "Lexicons are broken into \"pipelines\" which fully fill the chip set; each pipeline is run against all of the text in the set of documents currently being processed.",
        "NIQ batches messages as they come in so as to optimize the use of the FM larger message sets are processed more efficiently than several smaller ones.",
        "The tradeoff between batching and \"real-time\" processing can be independently balanced in the MQ configuration file for each in-basket and processing thread.",
        "Search patterns are specified in PSI,.",
        "Because the MI' uses a streaming approach, PSL is not dependent on word boundaries.",
        "Extremely complex patterns can be expressed, which can include such features as error tolerance, sliding windows, multiple wildcard options, nested macros, character masking, ranging, and the usual Boolean operations.",
        "Features that support \"fuzzy matching,\" like error tolerance, are extremely important for handling \"noisy\" input.",
        "Output Generation: Frame Assembly and Rowing.",
        "When the filters that comprise a processing sequence have executed, the 'Fag File is passed to the \"Frame Assembly and Region Routing\" (FARR) module.",
        "This program, which constitutes the \"tail\" of the DEFT pipeline, assembles the data elements generated during the analysis thread into frames based on an external definition file.",
        "This file specifies which slots are associated with which frames, how to transform a data value for display to the user (e.g. normalize \"England\" to \"United Kingdom\"), how to transform a value for storage in a downstream database (e.g. abbreviate \"England\" as \"UK\"), how to validate a data value, whether a data type can be multiply-occurring, and so on.",
        "One issue that arises during frame assembly is when to associate a data value with an instance of the frame class for which it is defined.",
        "In DEFT, this operation is associated with \"scoping.\"",
        "Scoping is the process of determining the extent in the text of a concept associated with a pattern.",
        "For example, if a pattern of words indicative of a joint venture is found, the scope of the \"tie-up\" frame might be taken to be the location of the pattern plus or minus two sentences.",
        "The unit of scoping (in this case, sentence) need not be a syntactic unit it can be any pattern stored in a special type of lexicon used exclusively for determining frame scope.",
        "The unit of scoping and its extent (e.g., \"plus or minus n\") can be determined independently for each frame class.",
        "When a pattern that gives rise to a slot value of a type defined for a given frame class is found in the text, the slot is automatically mapped by FARR to any frame whose scope encompasses the location of the pattern.",
        "Thus, if the name of a corporation were to occur within the two sentence range of the tic-up frame in our example, it would appear in that frame.",
        "Of course, this may not be accurate DEFT has a tendency to overgenerate slots through bogus associations that arise because of this weak scoping mechanism.",
        "Another issue that is encountered is overlapping frames.",
        "The \"best available\" resolution can be specified in the frame definition file.",
        "One alternative is simply to accept both frames, since they may be describing separate concepts.",
        "If the frames are of different classes, FARR supports the attribution of a priority to each class, and only the frame with the highest priority need be retained.",
        "If the frames are of the same class, FARR supports a \"non-multiply occurring\" attribute, which optionally suppresses all but one of the frames.",
        "Unfortunately, the action taken is generalized to all situations the specifics of a given case cannot be taken into account.",
        "Thus, DEFT tends to either overgenerate or lose frames.",
        "When a message's frames have been generated and ambiguities resolved (to the extent that DEFT can resolve them), the frames (and the message) are routed to a destination directory on the basis of their content.",
        "Routing instructions are defined in a rule base using a normalized conjunctive form of field-value pairs.",
        "It should be kept in mind that although DEFT's primary mission is extraction, not 'dissemination, the routing capability (since it is based on knowledge representation) provides a sensitive mechanism for determining the destination of a message and the structured representation of its contents.",
        "Controlling the System: DEFT Tools and Specification Management.",
        "In order to make DEFT portable to different computing environments and problem domains, the definition of user-modifiable system characteristics has been exported to a set of external specification files.",
        "These files govern the interface with the surrounding message handling system, the output data model, EDF configuration, and other \"housekeeping\" functions.",
        "Specification files are maintained using any convenient text editor.",
        "The most important system specifications.",
        "from the standpoint of the end-user are the lexicons and the frame routing rules.",
        "To facilitate lexicon development and maintenance, a lexicon editor is bundled with DITT that provides a graphic user interface (under X/Motil) for interactively defining lexicons and entering/editing lexicon entries.",
        "Lexicons can also be created/updated from databases or external machine-readable files (e.g. gazetteers, corporate name lists) using a batch load protocol.",
        "I.ike the lexicon editor, the routing rule manager provides a GUI for maintaining routing rules.",
        "It uses a spreadsheet metaphor to minimize the user's exposure to the potentially complex Boolean logic that the rules can involve.",
        "Menus of valid values and conditions tests are automatically provided.",
        "Another important DEFT tool is frame review.",
        "DEFT was developed under the assumption that a user would always be in the loop; it was not intended to run autonomously.",
        "This package therefore supports simultaneous display of messages and the frames derived from them, providing highlights that show where slot values were extracted.",
        "Menus of valid values drawn from the lexicons assist the user in filling slots that were omitted by DEFT.",
        "Features for selectively deleting superfluous slots and frames are particularly important, since DEFT (like other pattern-based approaches to text analysis) tends to overgenerate data.",
        "A mechanism is also provided to facilitate manually linking frames of different classes into higher-level logical aggregations, since DEFT was not originally designed with an automated linking capability.",
        "Clearly, these two design assumptions human interaction and manual frame linking had an impact on working with the MUC-5 data.",
        "DEFT as an Engineering Shell This description of the DEFT system has emphasized that analysis threads are composed of independent components \\■hich communicate through a common data structure using a library of utilities that constitute an API.",
        "It is our contention that •",
        "DEFf's strengths are:",
        "• A powerful pattern searching capability, which we are extending.",
        "• The ability to integrate COTS, GOTS, and custom-written programs within the DEFT architecture.",
        "We believe that there will probably not be a single text analysis or NUJ system that meets the requirements of all conceivable applications.",
        "There will always be a tradeoff between such factors as speed, depth of analysis, breadth of coverage, portability, robustness, and analysis methodology that will favor one technology over another for a particular problem.",
        "The real question is not \"What is the best system?",
        "\", but \"What is the best system at this moment?\"",
        "Our current development work on DEFT is chiefly targeted at its usefulness as an integration tool.",
        "DEFT provides a high-speed pattern searching capability which can successfully extract data from structured or tightly constrained textual inputs, while providing preprocessing services (e.g. tagging words with part of speech or semantic attributes) for third-party software which performs more extensive natural language processing for unconstrained textual inputs.",
        "This approach should be especially efficient for applications in which messages are mixed (formatted and unformatted), text analysis tasks are varied in complexity, and throughput is a major consideration."
