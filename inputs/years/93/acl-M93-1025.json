        "The SNAP information extraction system has been developed as a part of a three-year SNAP project sponsored by the National Science Foundation.",
        "The main goal of the SNAP project is to build a massively parallel computer capable of fast and accurate natural language processing [5].",
        "Throughout the project, a parallel computer was built in the Parallel Knowledge Processing Laboratory at USC, and various software was developed to operate the machine [3].",
        "The approach in designing SNAP was to find a knowledge representation and a reasoning paradigm useful for natural language processing which exhibits massive parallelism.",
        "We have selected marker-passing on semantic networks as a way to represent and process linguistic knowledge.",
        "The work for MUC-5 started at the end of January 1993.",
        "Prior to this we had implemented on SNAP a memory-based parsing system which was also used for MUC-4.",
        "Since the domain has been changed from MUC-4, we improved the dictionary with semantic tags necessary for EJV domain, developed a new template generation module, and constructed a new knowledge base including concept hierarchy and concept sequence patterns for parsing.",
        "Our group consisting of one faculty and five graduate students spent approximately 6 months to engineer a large system."

        "The underlying ideas of the SNAP natural language processing system are: (1) memory based parsing, and (2) marker-passing on semantic networks [5].",
        "In SNAP, parsing becomes a guided search over the knowledge base which stores linguistic information.",
        "Input words activate and predict concepts in the knowledge base.",
        "While the semantic network represents the static part of the knowledge base, marker passing is the mechanism which changes the state of the knowledge base with each new word.",
        "Based on the MUC-4 experience, we emphasized efficiency and practicality in developing the system for MUC-5.",
        "Full analysis of input texts is avoided.",
        "The system picks up only necessary and relevant information from input texts.",
        "The knowledge base of domain specific phrasal patterns for TIE-UP relationship has been constructed automatically by using a lexical acquisition system called PALKA, and couple of backup routes have been established to extract partial information when parsing fails."

      "heading": "SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE",
      "text": [
        "The SNAP system architecture is shown in Figure 1.",
        "It consists of a preprocessor, phrasal parser, memory-based parser, knowledge base, and template generator.",
        "The preprocessor provides lexical lookup and semantic tagging.",
        "The phrasal parser performs grouping of words, and the memory-based parser generates semantic meaning representation by using stored patterns in the knowledge base.",
        "The knowledge base consists of a domain concept hierarchy including location hierarchy, a set of phrasal patterns for TIE-UP, and semantically relaxed versions of some phrasal patterns.",
        "The phrasal patterns are automatically extracted",
        "from training texts by the PALKA lexical acquisition system.",
        "The template generator has a set of rules to fill slots from the phrasal parser results and the memory-based parser results.",
        "To detect a TIE-UP relationship, the template generator first checks the memory-based parser output for the regular patterns.",
        "If there is no memory-based parser output, it tries to apply rules to the phrasal parser output, and if no rules are applicable, it checks the memory-based parser output for the relaxed patterns.",
        "Figure 2 shows the flow of control including the backup routes.",
        "PREPROCESSOR Description of Operation Our preprocessor is not significantly different from the \"generic preprocessor\".",
        "It locates sentence boundaries and inserts sentence boundary markers for the phrasal parser.",
        "In addition, sentences are joined together on one line so that pattern matching can take place for concatenating noun phrases together.",
        "Certain noun phrases are grouped together to reduce work load on the phrasal parser.",
        "These noun phrases come from 4 different sources: our permuted list of company names, locations from the gazeteer, a list of special words related to facilities, titles, and positions, specifically chosen for filling template slots and/or recognizing the possibility of filling slots, and noun phrases from WordNet.",
        "(Company names are a special case that will be discussed below.)",
        "As in our system for MUC-4 last year, our preprocessor continues to group semi-auxiliary verbs like USED_TO and prepositional phrases like SUCH_AS and AS_TO together.",
        "Contractions such as CAN'T and DON'T are expanded into CAN NOT and DO NOT.",
        "Numbers in the text are normalized by removing commas and/or dollar signs.",
        "Abbreviations immediately following numbers without intervening spaces are separated from the number, and expanded; for example 2.3BN is converted into 2.3 BILLION.",
        "Three such abbreviations following numbers deserve a small note.",
        "When s follows a number, it is always a plural, as in 1980s or IBM MODEL 55s; this s is just removed as no important information required in our system is lost.",
        "The abbreviation M is ambiguous, and could mean either million or meters; because it almost always means million in this domain, it is always changed to million.",
        "Finally, the obvious abbreviation 4wD is converted to FOUR WHEEL DRIVE.",
        "Punctuation markers are separated from the words they are adjacent to, and then each word is looked up in our dictionary.",
        "For each word, every possible part of speech is passed on to the phrasal parser segment of our system.",
        "In the dictionary lookup function, numbers are a special case.",
        "In order that numbers which are not spelled out do not have to be added to the dictionary, the dictionary lookup program tests words to find out if they are cardinal, ordinal, or real numbers, and then reports their part of speech as such.",
        "No spelling correction is done in the preprocessor; misspelled words are reported as unknown to the phrasal parser, and they will usually be interpreted as a corporation name if some other word in the noun",
        "phrase such as CORP. suggests this, or a human name otherwise.",
        "Morphological processing is performed, but not at run time; a set of programs is applied to the input files used in construction of the dictionary to generate all possible inflected forms of words.",
        "As mentioned above, corporation names are recognized and grouped together in the preprocessor.",
        "In order to match as many company names as possible, a program was written to generate permutations of the company names in our list of such names.",
        "Abbreviations such as INc. are permuted into both IN C and INCORPORATED, and abbreviations such as \"S.A.\" are permuted into their various forms such as \"S.A\" and \"S.",
        "A.\".",
        "This increases the size of our list of corporations several-fold.",
        "In addition, each of these abbreviations is added to our preprocessor dictionary, and tagged as a corporation name in case only the abbreviation is recognized in some input text.",
        "In addition to the part of speech, root form, and other related information such as tense or number which was in our preprocessor dictionary for passing along to the phrasal parser, many of the words in our preprocessor dictionary were tagged according to the requirements of our rule-based inferencing and template filling module.",
        "These tags included MUC5-COMPANY, approximately 12 different types of facilities (MUC5-FACILITY1 for broadcasting stations and studios, MUC5-FACILITY2 for plants, mills, and development facilities, etc.",
        "), ten or so different position tags (MUC5-POSITION1 for CEO, chief executive officer, etc., MUC5-POSITION2 for chairman, chairmen, chairman of the board, etc.",
        "), and several different human name and title tags (MUC5-NAME-TITLE for Mr., Mrs., etc., MUC5-HUMAN-NAMEFAMILY, MUC5-HUMAN-NAME-GIVEN, MUC5-HUMAN-NAME-MALE, and MUC5-HUMANNAME-FEMALE).",
        "These tags alerted later processing states that the words so tagged might be important for template filling.",
        "Tags were not the only method used for this.",
        "The knowledge-base that we built from WordNet, for example, provided a very easy way to recognize words that were part of a date, or words which indicated time.",
        "We also built a knowledge-base of location names and possible types (cities, countries, etc.",
        "),",
        "from the available gazeteer file, and included the tag MUC5-LOCATION on all words in our preprocessor dictionary which might have been location names in the text.",
        "For several pronouns and prepositions such as I and TO, which are also city names in Indonesia, our phrasal parser always ignored this tag.",
        "Even though the gazeteer was very large, there are place names missing such as KAOHSIUNG in the walk-through message.",
        "This year, WordNet was used to substantially increase the size of our dictionary.",
        "However, through an unfortunate oversight, the morphological programs were not run on the verbs from WordNet in order to generate all of their inflected forms.",
        "This caused the word ENTRUSTING to be missing from our dictionary, and not recognized, when it should have been there.",
        "Even with WordNet, though, our dictionary doesn't contain all inflected forms of all words.",
        "WordNet contains the noun CAPITAL, but not the verb form CAPITALIZE, and so none of the inflected forms of that particular verb were included in our dictionary, and we failed to recognize that CAPITALIZED was either a past tense or past participle verb form.",
        "Since our system doesn't do any morphological processing at run time, this is an area where significant improvement could be made with relatively little effort; if unknown words were run through a process that guessed at their part of speech with decent accuracy, then our phrasal parser would do a better job of segmenting each sentence into its constituent phrases.",
        "This would have made a difference this year, as there were several times where a verb was unknown, treated incorrectly as a noun by our phrasal parser, and lumped into a noun phrase as part of a corporation name."

        "LEXICAL ACQUISITION SYSTEM To provide the domain specific semantic patterns (FP-structures) presented in the previous section, an automatic lexical acquisition system called PALKA has been developed [4].",

        "The original text consists of complex sentences which contain relative clauses, nominal clauses, conjunctive clauses, etc.",

        "The phrasal parser groups words based on each word's syntactic category and ordering rules for noun-groups and verb-groups.",

        "All the noun groups representing a company name are mapped as an ENTITY.",
        "Separating ENTITY0 from others is done by a human after generating all the FP-structures.",

        "As discussed in the performance analysis section, the FP-structures generated by PALKA greatly affects the overall scores.",
