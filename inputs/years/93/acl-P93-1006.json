        "The recent development of broad–coverage natural language processing systems has stimulated work on the evaluation of the syntactic component of such systems, for purposes of basic evaluation and improvement of system performance.",
        "Methods utilizing hand–bracketed corpora (such as the University of Pennsylvania Treebank) as a basis for evaluation metrics have been discussed in Black et al.",
        "(1991), Harrison et al.",
        "(1991), and Black et al.",
        "(1992).",
        "Three metrics discussed in those works were the Crossing Parenthesis Score (a count of the number of phrases in the machine produced parse which cross with one or more phrases in the hand parse), Recall (the percentage of phrases in the hand parse that are also in the machine parse), and Precision (the percentage of phrases in the machine parse that are in the hand parse).",
        "We have developed a methodology for using hand–bracketed parses to examine both the internal and external performance of a grammar checker.",
        "The internal performance refers to the behavior of the underlying system – i.e.",
        "the toke-nizer, parser, lexicon, and grammar.",
        "The external performance refers to the error critiques generated by the system.'",
        "Our evaluation methodology relies on three separate error reports generated from a corpus of randomly selected sentences: 1) a report based on unbracketed sentences, 2) a report based on optimally bracketed sentences with our current system, and 3) a report based on the optimal bracketings with the system modified to insure the same coverage as the unbracketed corpus.",
        "The bracketed report from the unmodified system tells us something about the coverage of our underlying system in its current state.",
        "The bracketed report from the modified system tells us something about the external accuracy of the error reports presented to the user.",
        "Our underlying system uses a bottom–up, full– ambiguity parser.",
        "Our error detection method relies on including grammar rules for parsing errorful sentences, with error critiques being generated from the occurrence of an error rule in the parse.",
        "Error critiques are based on just one of all the possible parse trees that the system can find for a given sentence.",
        "Our major concern about the underlying system is whether the system has a correct parse for the sentence in question.",
        "We are also concerned about the accuracy of the selected parse, but our current methodology does not directly address that issue, because correct error reports do not depend on having precisely the correct parse.",
        "Consequently, our evaluation of the underlying grammatical coverage is based on a simple metric, namely the parser success rate for satisfying sentence bracketings (i.e. correct parses).",
        "Either the parser can produce the optimal parse or it can't.",
        "We have a more complex approach to evaluating the performance of the system's ability to detect errors.",
        "Here, we need to look at both the 1.",
        "We use the term critique to represent an instance of an error detected.",
        "Each sentence may have zero or more critiques reported for it.",
        "overgeneration and undergeneration of individual error critiques.",
        "What is the rate of spurious critiques, or critiques incorrectly reported, and what is the rate of missed critiques, or critiques not reported.",
        "Therefore we define two additional metrics, which illuminate the spurious and missed critique rates, respectively: Precision: the percentage of correct critiques from the unbracketed corpus.",
        "Recall: the percentage of critiques generated from an ideal bracketed corpus that are also present among those in the unbracketed corpus.",
        "Precision tells us what percentage of reported critiques are reliable, and Recall tells us what percentage of correct critiques have been reported (modulo the coverage)."

        "The Boeing Simplified English Checker (a.k.a.",
        "the BSEC, cf.",
        "Hoard, Wojcik, and Holzhauser 1992) is a type of grammar and style checker, but it is more accurately described as a `controlled English checker' (cf. Adriaens 1992).",
        "That is, it reports to users on where a text fails to comply with the aerospace standard for maintenance documentation known as Simplified English (AECMA 1989).",
        "If the system cannot produce a parse, it prints the message \"Can't do SE check.\" At present, the Checker achieves parses for about 90 percent of the input strings submitted to it.",
        "The accuracy of the error critiques over that 90 percent varies, but our subjective experience suggests that most sentence reports contain critiques that are useful in that they flag some bona fide failure to comply with Simplified English.",
        "The NLP methodology underlying the BSEC does not rely on the type of pattern matching techniques used to flag errors in more conventional checkers.",
        "It cannot afford simply to ignore sentences that are too complex to handle.",
        "As a controlled sublanguage, Simplified English requires 2.",
        "The 90 percent figure is based on random samplings taken from maintenance documents submitted to the BSEC over the past two years.",

        "that every word conform to specified usage.",
        "That is, each word must be marked as `allowed' in the lexicon, or it will trigger an error critique.",
        "Since the standard generally requires that words be used in only one part of speech, the BSEC produces a parse tree on which to judge vocabulary usage as well as other types of grammatical violations.3 As one would expect, the BSEC often has to choose between quite a few alternative parse trees, sometimes even hundreds or thousands of them.",
        "Given its reliance on full–ambiguity parse forests and relatively little semantic analysis, we have been somewhat surprised that it works as well as it does.",
        "We know of few grammar and style checkers that rely on the complexity of grammatical analysis that the BSEC does, but IBM's Critique is certainly one of the best known.",
        "In discussing the accuracy of Critique, Richardson and Braden–Harder (1993:86) define it as \"the actual 'under the covers' natural language processing involved, and the user's perception.\" In other words, there are really two levels upon which to gauge accuracy – that of the internal parser and that of the reports generated.",
        "They add: \"Given the state of the art, we may consider it a blessing that it is possible for the latter to be somewhat better than the former.\" The BSEC, like Critique, appears to be smarter than it really is at guessing what the writer had in mind for a sentence structure.",
        "Most error critiques are not affected by incorrect phrasal attachment, although grossly incorrect parses lie behind most sentence reports that go sour.",
        "What we have not fully understood in the past is the extent to which parsing accuracy affects error critiques.",
        "What if we could eliminate all the bad parses?",
        "Would that make our system more accurate by reducing incorrect critiques, or would it degrade performance by reducing the overall number of correct critiques reported?",
        "We knew that the system was capable of producing good error reports from relatively bad parses, but how many of those error reports even had a reasonably correct parse available to them?",
        "3.",
        "The Simplified English (SE) standard allows some exceptions to the 'single part of speech' rule in its core vocabulary of about a thousand words.",

        "What a program can do is count the number of words in sentences and compound nouns, detect violations of parts of speech, flag the omission of required words (such as articles) or the presence of banned words (such as auxiliary have and be, etc.).",
        "The overall function of such a program is to present the writer with an independent check on a fair range of Simplified English requirements.",

        "To date, The Boeing Company is the only aerospace manufacturer to produce a program that detects such a wide range of Simplified English violations.",
        "In the past, Boeing and other companies have created checkers that report on all words that are potential violations of SE, but such 'word checkers' have no way of avoiding critiques for word usage that is correct.",
        "For example, if the word test is used legally as a noun, the word – checking program will still flag the word as a potential verb – usage error.",
        "The BSEC is the only Simplified English checker in existence that manages to avoid this.4 As Richardson and Braden – Harder (p. 88) pointed out: \"We have found...that professionals seem much more forgiving of wrong critiques, as 4.",
        "Oracle's recently released CoAuthor product, which is designed to be used with the Interleaf word processor, has the potential to produce grammatical analyses of sentences, but it only works as a Simplified English word checker at present.",
        "long as the time required to disregard them is mini-mal.\" In fact, the chief complaint of Boeing technical writers who use the BSEC is when it produces too many nuisance errors.",

        "There is no `canonical' parse, nor have we yet implemented a `fitted parse' strategy to reclaim information available in no–parses.6 Our problem has been the classic one of selecting the best parse from a number of alternatives.",

        "Second, the methodology helped us to detect some obscure bugs in the system.",
        "For example, the TWO – COMMAND and NOUN CLUSTER errors were not being flagged properly in the unmodified bracketed set because of bugs in the report generator.",
        "These bugs had not been noticed because the errors were being flagged properly in some sentences.",
        "When a system gets as large and complicated as ours, especially when it generates hundreds or thousands of parse trees for some sentences, it becomes very difficult to detect errors that only show up sporadically and infrequently in",
        "the data.",
        "Our new methodology provided us with a window on that aspect of system performance.",
        "Perhaps a more interesting observation concerns the relationship between our system and one like Critique, which relies on no – parses to trigger a fitted parse 'damage repair' phase.",
        "We believe that the fitted – parse strategy is a good one, although we have not yet felt a strong need to implement it.",
        "The reason is that our system generates such rich parse forests that strings which ought to trigger no – parses quite frequently end up triggering 'weird' parses.",
        "That is, they trigger parses that are grammatical from a strictly syntactic perspective, but inappropriate for the words in their accustomed meanings.",
        "A fitted parse strategy would not work with these cases, because the system has no way of detecting weirdness.",
        "Oddly enough, the existence of weird parses often has the same effect in error reports as parse fitting in that they generate error critiques which are useful.",
        "The more ambiguity a syntactic system generates, the less likely it is to need a fitted parse strategy to handle unexpected input.",
        "The reason for this is that the number of grammatically correct, but 'senseless' parses is large enough to get a parse that would otherwise be ruled out on semantic grounds Our plans for the use of this methodology are as follows.",
        "First, we intend to change our current system to improve deficiencies and lack of coverage revealed by this exercise.",
        "In effect, we plan to use the current test corpus as a training corpus in the next phase.",
        "Before deploying the changes, we will collect a new test corpus and repeat our method of evaluation.",
        "We are very interested in seeing how this new cycle of development will affect the figures of coverage, Precision, and Recall on the next evaluation."
