        "Context-free grammar (CFG) has been a well accepted framework for computational linguistics for a long time.",
        "While it has drawbacks, including the inability to express some linguistic constructions, it has the virtue of being computationally efficient, 0(0)-time in the worst case.",
        "Recently there has been a gain in interest in the so-called 'mildly' context-sensitive formalisms (Vijay-Shanker, 1987; Weir, 1988; Joshi, Vijay-Shanker, and Weir, 1991; Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1993a) that generate only a small superset of context-free languages.",
        "One such formalism is lexicalized tree-adjoining grammar (LTAG) (Schabes, Abeille, and Joshi, 1988; Abeille et al., 1990; Joshi and Schabes, 1992), which provides a number of attractive properties at the cost of decreased efficiency, 0(7/6)-time in the worst case (Vijay-Shanker, 1987; Schabes, 1991; Lang, 1990; Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1993b).",
        "An LTAG lexicon consists of a set of trees each of which contains one or more lexical items.",
        "These elementary trees can be viewed as the elementary clauses (including their transformational variants) in which the lexical items participate.",
        "The trees are combined by substitution and adjunction.",
        "LTAG supports context-sensitive features that can capture some language constructs not captured by CFG.",
        "However, the greatest virtue of LTAG is that it is lexicalized and supports extended domains of locality.",
        "The lexical nature of LTAG is of linguistic interest, since it is believed that the descriptions of many linguistic phenomena are dependent upon lexical data.",
        "The extended domains allow for the localization of most syntactic and sernantic dependencies (e.g., filler-gap and predicate-argument relationships).",
        "A further interesting aspect of LTAG is its ability to lexicalize CFGs.",
        "One can convert a CFG into an LTAG that preserves the original trees (Joshi and Schabes, 1992).",
        "Lexicalized context-free grammar (LCFG) is an attractive compromise between LTAG and CFG, that combines many of the virtues of LTAG with the efficiency of CFG.",
        "LCFG is a restricted form of LTAG that places further limits on the elementary trees that are possible and on the way adjunction can be performed.",
        "These restrictions limit LCFC.",
        "; to producing only context-free languages and allow LCFG to be parsed in 0(n3)-time in the worst case.",
        "However, LCFG retains most of the key features of LTAG enumerated above.",
        "In particular, most of the current LTAG grammar for English (Abeille et al., 1990) follows the restrictions of LCFG.",
        "This is of significant practical interest because it means that the processing of these analyses does not require more computational resources than CFGs.",
        "In addition, any CFG can be transformed into an equivalent LC'FG that generates the same trees (and therefore the same strings).",
        "This result breaks new ground, because heretofore every method of lexicalizing CFGs required context-sensitive operations (Joshi and Schabes, 1992).",
        "The following sections briefly, define LCFG, discuss its relationship to the current LTAG grammar for English, prove that LCFG can be used to lexicalize CFG, and present a simple cubic-time parser for LCFG.",

        "Adjunction inserts a copy of an auxiliary tree into another tree in place of an interior node that has the same label as the foot of the auxiliary tree.",
        "The subtree that was previously connected to the interior node is reconnected to the foot of the copy of the auxiliary tree.",

        "As discussed in the motivation section, strong lexicalization that preserves tree sets is possible using LTAG.",

        "To prove the theorem we first prove a somewhat weaker theorem and then extend the proof to the full theorem.",
        "In particular, we assume for the moment that the set of rules for G does not contain any empty rules of the form A E. Step 1 We begin the construction of G' by constructing a directed graph LCG that we call the left corner derivation graph.",

A left corner derivation in a CFG is a partial derivation starting from any non-terminal where every expanded node (other than the root) is the leftrnost child of its parent and the left corner is a non-terminal.",
        "A left corner derivation is uniquely identified by the list of rules applied.",
        "Since G does not have any empty rules, every rule in G is represented in LCG.",

        "Step 2 The set of initial trees I for G' is constructed with reference to LCG.",

        "Mark this as the foot node of T. While doing the above, leave all the other non-terminal symbols in T unexpanded, and label them all substitution nodes.",
        "The LCG in Figure 8 has two minimal cyclic paths (one from A to A via B and one from B to B via A).",

To see this, consider that every path in LCG can be represented as an initial non-cyclic path with zero or more minimal cycles inserted into it.",
        "The set of trees that can be created by combining the initial trees from Step 2 with the auxiliary trees from Step 3 using both substitution and adjunction is the set of every derivation in G. To see this, consider that every derivation in G can be decomposed into a set of left corner derivations in G that are combined with substitution.",

        "Note that since G is finitely ambiguous, there must be a frontier node to the right of the foot of an auxiliary tree T. If not, then T would correspond to a derivation XX in G and G would be infinitely ambiguous.",
        "After Step 4, every auxiliary tree is lexicalized, since every tree that does not have a terminal to the right of its foot is replaced by one or more trees that do.",
        "Since there were only a finite number of finite initial and auxiliary trees to start with, there are still only a finite number of finite auxiliary trees.",
        "The change in the auxiliary trees caused by Step 4 does not alter the set of trees that can be produced in any way, because the only change that was made was to make substitutions that could be made anyway, and when a substitutable node was eliminated, this was only done after every possible substitution at that node was performed.",
