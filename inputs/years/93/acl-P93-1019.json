        "The significance of specifying the FA and not merely the language it generates is that it allows us to use FA technology in processing allomorphy, even while keeping the interface to other grammar components maximally transparent (i.e., there is NO interface – all linguistic information is specified via FDL).",
        "Our motivation for exploring this application of typed feature logic is the opportunity it provides for integrating in a single descriptive formalism not only (i) allomorphic and morphotactic information but also (ii) concatenative and non-concatenative allomorphy.",
