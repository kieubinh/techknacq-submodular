        "will be rephrased as \"Make sure the plus on the battery lines up with the plus on the battery compartment.\"",
        "Even when alternative words can be used instead of an unknown word (e.g., a descriptive expression can be used instead of an object name), the alternative phrase may interact with other parts of the sentence which then need to be reworded as well.",
        "In this paper, we discuss the different strategies used in COMET for selecting words with which the user is familiar.",
        "Since COMET integrates text and pictures in a single explanation 1, unknown words are frequently disambiguated through accompanying pictures.",

      "text": [
        "COMET's architecture is shown in Figure 1.",
        "On receiving a request for an explanation via a menu interface, the content planner uses schemas [6] to determine which information should be included in the explanation from the underlying knowledge sources.",
        "The explanation content, represented as a hierarchy of logical forms (LFs) [7] is passed to the media coordinator [3, 8], which adds annotations indicating which portions are to be produced by the text generator and which by the graphics generator [91.",
        "The Lexical Chooser is part of the text generator [7].",
        "Typically, it selects a word or phrase for each semantic concept in the input LF (i.e., the semantic constraints on word choice).",
        "In terms of coverage, the implementation can select words for 148 different semantic concepts using 253 mapping rules, thus yielding on average slightly less than two alternative word choices per concept (there are many concepts which are mapped to a single word, while others have more than two alternatives).",
        "The lexicon contains 159 open class words.",
        "In this paper, we show how the user model and past discourse (pragmatic constraints) also influence word choice.",
        "But these are not the only constraints on word choice.",
        "Syntactic form of the sentence and lexical constraints are other demonstrated [10, 11] influences on lexical choice.",
        "For example, once the verb has been chosen, syntactic constraints on its arguments (e.g., whether the object is a clause,",
        "an adj, or np) will influence what words are chosen to realize the semantic concept that fill these arguments.",
        "Conversely, if one of the verb roles can only be realized as a noun phrase, for example, and not as other syntactic categories, this restricts which verb is selected.",
        "Lexical constraints on word choice arise from the use of collocations [12].",
        "For example, a verb like \"stand\" takes the preposition \"on\" for its location role, while the verb \"turn\" takes the preposition \"onto.\"",
        "Lexical choice is thus influenced by a wide variety of constraints which interact in many ways.",
        "Since syntactic and lexical constraints are only available within the text generator, lexical choice is delayed until this point.",
        "Thus COMET waits until a variety of semantic, pragmatic, syntactic and lexical constraints are accumulated before selecting words.",
        "This means that COMET can use syntactic and lexical constraints on word choice in conjunction with semantic and graphical constraints provided as input, plus the new pragmatic constraints we present.",
        "Previous work addressing pragmatic constraints on word usage folded lexical choice into the content planner (e.g., [13], [1]).",
        "This was possible since the work focused primarily on lexical side effects of content determination (e.g., what property to include in a reference as opposed to what linguistic form to use for a property).",
        "Such approaches do not allow a system to take syntactic and lexical constraints on word choice into account.",
        "On receiving the hierarchy of logical forms, the Lexical Chooser determines the overall grammatical form of each sentence based on the semantic structure of the LFs (e.g., conditional sentences are generated for precondition-action structures) and selects the words and phrases realizing semantic concepts of the LF.",
        "It passes a specification of the sentence's grammatical form and open-class words to the general purpose surface sentence generator FUF [14, 15, 16].",
        "The Lexical Chooser uses a rewriting system itself implemented on top of FUF.",
        "Its lexicon consists of a base of rules, where each rule rewrites a given set of semantic features into a corresponding set of lexical and syntactic features.",
        "Thus, each lexicon entry associates a semantic concept with words that can be used to realize it.",
        "Additional constraints from the user model, past discourse, and the underlying knowledge base determine which of the alternative words or phrases should be selected.",
        "The user model indicates both the reading level of the current user4, any individual words that COMET knows the user does not understand, and any wording preferences (e.g., the user knows abbreviations, the user is familiar with military terminology).",
        "We make no claims about which of these forms of user models is easier to acquire, but simply show how to use them when available.",
        "If none of the alternative wordings for a given semantic concept of the LF are known to the user and the",

        "Step 2 of 6",
        "Remove the old holding battery, shown in the cutaway view.",
        "accompanying illustration cannot disambiguate these words, COMET reinvokes the content planner to replan portions of the sentence content or to include additional semantic information.",
