        "Natural language processing (NLP) systems need various knowledge including syntaclic, semantic, discourse, and pragmatic knowledge in different applications.",
        "Perhaps due to the relatively well-established syntactic theories and formalisms, there were many syntactic processing systems either manually constructed or automatically extended by various acquisition methods (Asker92, Berwiek85, Brent91, Liu92b, Lytinen90, Samuelsson91, Simmons91 Sanfi-lippo92, Smadja91 and Sekine92).",
        "However, the satisfactory representation and acquisition methods of domain-independent semantic, discourse, and pragmatic knowledge are not yet developed or computationally implemented.",
        "NLP systems often suffer the dilemma of semantic representation.",
        "Sophisticated representation of semantics has better expressive power but imposes difficulties on acquisition in practice.",
        "On the other hand, the poor adequacy of naive semantic representation may deteriorate the performance of NLP systems.",
        "Therefore, for plausible acquisition and processing, domain-dependent semantic bias was aften employed in many previous acquisition systems (Grishman92b, Lang88, Lu89, and Velardi91).",
        "In this paper, we present an implemented system that acquires domain-independent thematic knowledge using available syntactic resources (e.g. syntactic processing systems and syntactically processed corpora).",
        "Thematic knowledge can represent semantic or conceptual entities.",
        "For correct and efficient parsinz, thematic expectation serves as a basis for conflict resolution (Taraban88).",
        "For natural language understanding and other applications (e.g. machine translation), thematic role recognition is a major step.",
        "Thematic relations may serve as the vocabulary shared by the parser, the discourse model, and the world knowledge (Tanenhaus89).",
        "More importantly, since thematic structures are perhaps most closely linked to syntactic structures (Jackendoff72), thematic knowledge acquisition may be more feasible when only Lyntactic resources are available.",
        "The consideration of the availability of the resources from which thematic knowledge may be derived promotes the practica feasibility of the acquisition method.",
        "In general, lexical knowledge of a lexical head should (at least) include 1) the number of arguments of the lexic.1 head, 2) syntactic properties of the arguments, and 3) thematic roles of the arguments (the argument t.'ructure).",
        "The former two components may be either already constructed in available syntactic processors or acquired by many syntactic acquisition systems.",
        "However, the acquisition of the thematic roles of the arguments deserves more exploration.",
        "A constituent Pay have different thematic roles for different verbs in different uses.",
        "For example, \"John\" has different thematic roles in (1.1) - (1.4).",

        "(1.3) The ,nagic wand turned [Theme John] into a frog.",
        "(1.4) The letter reached [Goal John] yesterday.",
        "To acquire thematic lexical knowledge, precise thematic roles of arguments in the sentences needs to be determined.",
        "In the next section, the thematic roles considered in this paper are listed.",
        "The syntactic properties of the thematic roles are also summarized.",
        "The syntactic properties serve as a preliminary filter to reduce the hypothesis space of possible thematic roles of arguments in training sentences.",
        "To further resolve the ambiguities, heuristics based on various linguistic phenomena and constraints are introduced in section 3.",
        "The heuristics serve as a general guidance for the system to collect valuable information to discriminate thematic roles.",
        "Current status of the experiment is reported in section 4.",
        "In section 5, the method is evaluated and related to previous methodologies.",
        "We conclude, in section 6, that by properly collecting discrimination information from available sources, thematic knowledge acquisition may be more feasible in practice."

        "VP packets and NP packets recorded syntactic properties of the arguments of verbs and nouns respectively.",
        "Since not all constructions involving movement were tagged with trace information in the corpus, to derive the arguments, the procedure needs to consider the constructions of passivization, interjection, and unbounded dependency (e.g. in relative clauses and wh-questions).",
        "That is, it needs to determine whether a constituent is an argument of a verb (or noun), whether an argument is moved, and if so, which constituent is the moved argument.",
        "Basically, Case Theory, Theta Theory (Chomsky81), and Foot Feature Principle (Gazdar85) were employed to locate the arguments (Liu92a, Liu92b).",
        "Table 3 summarizes the results of the argument extraction.",
        "About 96% of the trees were extracted.",
        "Parse trees with too many words (60) or nodes (i.e. 50 subgoals of parsing) were discarded.",
        "Al VP packets in the parse trees were derived, but only the NP packets having PPs as modifiers were extracted.",
        "These PPs could help the system to hypothesize argument structures of nouns.",
        "The extracted packets were assimilated into an acquisition system (called EBNLA, Liu92a) as syntactic subcategorization frames.",

        "Therefore, although the parse trees could provide good quality of argument packets, the information was too sparse to resolve thematic role ambiguities.",

        "On average, for resolving ambiguities, 113 queries were generated for every 100 successfully acquired argument structures.",

        "Volition Heuristic, Tlematic Hierarchy Heuristic, and Preposition Heuristic had almost equal frequencies of application in the experiment.",
        "As an example of how the clues and heuristics could successfully derive argument structures of verbs, consider the sentence from ATIS: \"The flight going to San Francisco ...\".",
        "Without issuing any queries, the learner concluded that an argument structure of \"go\" is \" (Th), (Go)\".",
        "This was because, according to the clues, \"San Fran-cisco\" could only be Goal, while according to One-Theme Heuristic, \"the flight\" was recognized as Theme.",

        "The result showed that, after (manually or automatically) acquiring an argument packet (i.e. a syntactic sebcategorization frame plus the syntactic constituent pf the external argument) of a verb, the acquisition method could be invoked to upgrade the syntactic knowledge to thematic knowledge by issuing only 113 queries for every 100 argument packets.",
        "Since checking the validity of the generated sentences is not a heavy burden for the trainer (answering 'yes'",

        "Although \"Mary\" may be Theme in this case as well, treating \"Mary\" as Goal is more fme-grained.",
        "The clues and heuristics may often lead to acceptable argument structures, even if the argument structures are inherently ambiguous.",

        "Preliminary syntactic analysis could be achieved by many natural language processing systems.",
        "Toward semantic interpretation on input sentences, thematic lexical knowledge is needed.",
        "Although each lexicon may have its own idiosyncratic thematic requirements on arguments, there exist syntactic clues for hypothesizing the thematic roles of the arguments.",
        "Therefore, exploiting the information derived from syntactic analysis to acquire thematic knowledge becomes a plausible way to build an extensible thematic dictionary.",
        "In this paper, various syntactic clues are integrated to hypothesize thematic roles of arguments in training sentences.",
        "Heuristics-guided ambiguity resolution is invoked to collect extra discrimination information from the trainer or the corpus.",
        "As more syntactic resources become available, the method could upgrade the acquired knowledge from syntactic level to thematic level."
