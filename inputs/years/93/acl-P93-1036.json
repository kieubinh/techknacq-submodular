        "A model of the human parser must explain, among other factors, the following two aspects of the processing of a syntactic ambiguity: the initial attachment preferences that people exhibit, and their ability or inability to later revise an incorrect attachment.",
        "This paper presents a competition-based parser, CAPERS, that predicts critical attachment behaviors of the human sentence processor, without the use of explicit preference heuristics or revision strategies.",
        "CAPERS is a massively parallel network of processing nodes that represent syntactic phrases and their attachments within a parse tree.",
        "A syntactic ambiguity leads to a network of alternative attachments that compete in parallel for numeric activation; an attachment wins over its competitors when it amasses activation above a certain threshold.",
        "The competition among attachments is achieved solely through a technique called competition-based spreading activation (CBSA) (Reggia 87).",
        "The effective use of CBSA requires restrictions on the syntactic attachments that are allowed to compete simultaneously.",
        "Ensuring these network restrictions necessitates the further constraint that a stable state of the network can only represent a single valid parse state.",
        "The resulting network structure defines a limited set of corn-peting attachments that simultaneously define the initial attachments for the current input phrase, along with the reanalysis possibilities for phrases previously structured within the parse tree.",
        "The competitive mechanism and its ensuing restrictions have profound consequences for the modeling of the human sentence processor.",
        "Whereas other models must impose explicit conditions on the parser's attachment behavior (Abney 89; Gibson 91; McRoy & Hirst 90; Pritchett 88), in CAPERS both initial attachment preferences and reanalyzability are a side effect of independently motivated computational assumptions.",
        "Furthermore, parsing models generally employ two different computational mechanisms in determining syntactic attachments: a general parser to establish the attachment possibilities, and additional strategies for choosing among them (Abney 89; Frazier 78; Gibson 91; McRoy & Hirst 90; Shieber 83).",
        "By contrast, CAPERS provides a more restrictive account, in which a single competitive mechanism imposes constraints on the parser that determine the potential attachments, as well as choosing the preferred attachment from among those.",
        "The competitive mechanism of CAPERS also leads to an advantageous integration of serialism and parallelism.",
        "In order to conform to human memory limitations, other parallel models must be augmented with a scheme for reducing the number of structures that are maintained (Gibson 91; Gorrell 87).",
        "Such pruning schemes are unnecessary in CAPERS, since inherent properties of the competitive mechanism lead to a restriction to maintain a single parse state.",
        "However, in spite of this serial aspect, CAPERS is not a simple serial model.",
        "The network incorporates each input phrase through a parallel atomic operation that determines both the initial attachment for the current phrase and any revision of earlier attachments.",
        "Thus, CAPERS avoids the problems of purely serial or race-based models that rely on backtracking, which is cognitively implausible, or explicit revision strate",
        "gies, which can be unrestrictive (Abney 89; Frazier 78; Inoue k Fodor 92; McRoy Si Hirst 90; Pritchett 88).",
        "Other work (Stevenson 93b, 90) describes the detailed motivation for the CAPERS model, its explanation of serial and parallel effects in human parsing, and its predictions of a broad range of human attachment preferences.",
        "This paper focuses on the competitive mechanism described above.",
        "Section 2 briefly describes the implementation of the parser.I Section 3 discusses the constraints on the network structure, and Section 4 demonstrates the consequences of these constraints for the processing of attachment ambiguities.",
        "Section 5 summarizes how the competitive mechanism provides a principled and uniform account of the example human attachment preferences and garden path phenomena."

        "CAPERS dynamically creates the parsing network by allocating processing nodes in response to the input.",
        "Control of the parse is distributed among these nodes, which make attachment decisions solely on the basis of the local communication of simple symbolic features and numeric activation.",
        "The symbolic information determines the grammaticality of potential attachments, while numeric activation weighs the relative strengths of the valid alternatives.",
        "The spreading activation process allows the network to gradually settle on a set of winning attachments that form a globally consistent parse tree.",
        "Building the Network When an input token is read, the parser activates a set of phrasal nodes, or p-nodes, from a pool of X templates; their symbolic features are initialized based on the input token's lexical entry.",
        "Figure 1 shows a sample X template and its instantiation.",
        "Syntactic phrases are only allocated in response to explicit evidence in the input; top-down hypothesizing of phrases is disallowed because it greatly increases the complexity of the network.",
        "Next, the parser allocates processing nodes to represent the potential attachments between the current input phrase and the existing parse tree.",
        "Attachment nodes, or a-nodes, are established between potential sisters in the parse tree; each anode connects to exactly two p-nodes, as shown in",
        "symbolic features and numeric activation, and outputs them to its neighbors.",
        "This network processing loop continues until the activation level of each anode is either above a certain threshold 0, or is zero.",
        "The set of active anodes in this stable state represents the current parse tree structure.",
        "At this point, the next input token is read and the process is repeated.",
        "Grammaticality of Attachments Unlike other connectionist parsers (Cottrell 89; Fanty 85; Selman Az Hirst 85), CAPERS is a hybrid model whose limited symbolic processing abilities support the direct representation of the grammar of a current linguistic theory.",
        "In Government-Binding theory (GB) (Chomsky 81, 86; Rizzi 90), the validity of syntactic structures is achieved by locally satisfying the grammatical constraints among neighboring syntactic phrases.",
        "CAPERS directly encodes this formulation of linguistic knowledge as a set of simultaneous local constraints.",
        "Symbolic features are simple attribute/value pairs, with the attributes corresponding to grammatical entities such as Case and theta roles.",
        "The values that these attributes can assume are taken from a predefined list of atoms.",
        "GB constraints are implemented as equality tests on the values of certain attributes.",
        "For example, the Case Filter in GB states that every NP argument must receive Case.",
        "In CAPERS, this is stated as a condition that the attribute Case must receive a value when the attribute Category equals Noun and the attribute IsArgument equals True.",
        "An anode receives symbolic features from its p",
        "nodes, which are used to determine the grammaticality of the attachment.",
        "If an anode receives incompatible features from its two p-nodes, then it is an invalid attachment and it becomes inactive.",
        "Otherwise, it tests the equality conditions that were developed to encode the following subset of GB constraints: the Theta Criterion, the Case Filter, categorial selection, and the binding of traces.",
        "The algorithm outputs a numeric representation of the degree to which these grammatical constraints are satisfied; this state value is used in determining the anode's activation level.",
        "Choosing Preferred Attachments Multiple grammatical attachments may exist for a phrase, as in Figure 3.",
        "The network's task is to focus activation onto a subset of the grammatical attachments that form a consistent parse tree for the input processed thus far.",
        "Attachment alternatives must be made to effectively compete with each other for numeric activation, in order to ensure that some anodes become highly activated and others have their activation suppressed.",
        "There are two techniques for producing competitive behavior in a connectionist network.",
        "The traditional method is to insert inhibitory links between pairs of competing nodes.",
        "Competition-based spreading activation (CBSA) is a newer technique that achieves competitive behavior indirectly: competing nodes vie for output from a common neighbor, which allocates its activation between the competitors.",
        "In a CBSA function, the output of a node is based on the activation levels of its neighbors, as in equation 1.",
        "where: ojj is the output from node ni to node n ; is the activation of node ni; ranges over all nodes connected to node ni.",
        "For reasons of space efficiency, flexibility, and cognitive plausibility (Reggia et al.",
        "88), CBSA was adopted as the means for producing competitive behavior among the anodes in CAPERS.",
        "Each p-node uses a CBSA function to allocate output activation among its a-nodes, proportional to their current activation level.",
        "For example, the NP node in Figure 3 will send more of its output to the attachment to the V node than to the I' node.",
        "The CBSA function is designed so that in a stable state of the network, each p-node activates a number of anodes in accordance with its grammatical properties.",
        "Since every XP must have a parent in the parse tree, all XP nodes must activate exactly one anode.",
        "An X or X' node must activate a number of anodes equal to the number of complements or specifiers, respectively, that it licenses.",
        "The anodes enforce consistency among the p-nodes' individual attachment decisions: each anode numerically ANDs together the input from its two p-nodes to ensure that they agree to activate the attachment.",
        "A p-node that has obligatory attachments must at all times activate the appropriate number of anodes in order for the network to stabilize.",
        "However, since the phrase(s) that the p-node will attach to may occur later in the input, the parser needs a way to represent a \"null\" attachment to act as a placeholder for the p-node's eventual sister(s).",
        "For this purpose, the model uses processing nodes called phi-nodes to represent a \"dummy\" phrase in the tree.'",
        "Every X and X' node has an anode that connects to a phi-node, allowing the possibility of a null attachment.",
        "A phi-node communicates default symbolic information to its a-node, with two side effects.",
        "The anode is always grammatically valid, and therefore represents a default attachment for the p-node it connects to.",
        "But, the default information does not fully satisfy the grammatical constraints of the a-node, thereby lowering its activation level and making it a less preferred attachment alternative."

        "The competitive mechanism presented thus far is incomplete.",
        "If all possible attachments are established between the current phrase and the existing network, CBSA cannot ensure that the set of active anodes forms a consistent parse tree.",
        "CBSA can weed out locally incompatible anodes by requiring that each p-node activate the grammatically appropriate number of a-nodes, but it cannot rule out the simultaneous activation of certain incompatible attachments that are farther apart in the tree.",
        "Figure 4 shows the types of structures in which CBSA is an insufficient",
        "its XP node activates an anode between it and a specially designated stack node.",
        "Because the stack cannot satisfy grammatical constraints, stack node attachments are only activated if no other attachment is available for the XP.",
        "The flexibility of CBSA allows the stack to activate more than one a-node, so that multiple phrases can be pushed onto it.",
        "The surprising result is that, by having the stack establish anodes that compete for activation like normal attachments, the indirect competitive relationships within the network effectively suppress all inconsistent attachment possibilities, including those of Figure 4(b).",
        "This result relies on the fact that any incompatible anodes that are created either directly or indirectly",
        "The use of CBSA, and the adoption of a stack mechanism to support this, strongly restrict the attachments that can be considered by the parser.",
        "The only anodes that can compete simultaneously are those in the set of attachments between the current phrase and the tree on top of the stack.",
        "The competitive",
        "relationships among the allowed anodes completely define the sets of anodes that can be simultaneously active in a stable state of the network.",
        "These logical attachment possibilities, shown in Figure 6, follow directly from the propagation of local competitions among the anodes due to CBSA.",
        "In over 98% of the approximately 1400 simulations of attachment decisions in CAPERS, the network stabilized on one of these attachment sets (Stevenson 93b).",
