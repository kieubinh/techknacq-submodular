        "Although automated word sense disambiguation has become a popular activity within computational lexicology, evaluation of the accuracy of disambiguation systems is still mostly limited to manual checking by the developer.",
        "This paper describes our work in collecting data on the disambiguation behavior of human subjects, with the intention of providing (1) a norm against which dictionary-based systems (and perhaps others) can be evaluated, and (2) a source of psycholinguistic information about previously unobserved aspects of human disambiguation, for the use of both psycholinguists and computational researchers.",
        "We also describe two of our most important tools: a questionnaire of ambiguous test words in various contexts, and a hypertext user interface for efficient and powerful collection of data from human subjects."

      "heading": "1 The need for a metric of disambiguation",
      "text": [
        "Research in automatic lexical disambiguation has been going on for decades, and in recent years experimental disambiguation systems have proliferated.",
        "The problem of determining the accuracy of these systems has been little recognized: the usual check for correctness is a comparison of the test results against the experimenter's own judgment.",
        "Even less considered has been the question of what constitutes correctness in disambiguation, beyond the intuitive recognition that some disambiguations are better (\"correct\") and others worse (\"incorrect\").",
        "A common approach to disambiguation is to select among the homographs and senses provided by a machine-readable dictionary (e.g. Lesk [1986], Byrd [1989], Krovetz [1989], Slator [1989], Guthrie et al.",
        "[1990], Ide and Veronis [1990], and Veronis and Ide [1990].",
        "Dictionaries deal with the ambiguity of words by providing multiple definitions for sufficiently ambiguous words.",
        "These multiple definitions may be homographs (distinct words of unrelated meaning, whose written forms coincide) or senses (related but nonidentical meanings of a single word).",
        "The inadequacy of a finite, discrete set of sense definitions to resolve all ambiguities has been pointed out by Boguraev and Pustejovsky [1990], Kilgarriff [1991], and Ahlswede [forthcoming].",
        "For the practical task of disambiguation in natural language processing, however, the dictionary is a valuable and convenient source of sense distinctions; in our view, the best single source."

        "Many previous studies of human disambiguation have been from a psycholinguistic point of view.",
        "Simpson and Burgess [1988], surveying some of these studies, identify three basic models of ambiguity processing: (1) restriction by context, (2) ordered access, and (3) multiple access.",
        "Prather and Swinney [1988] consider whether the lexical component of human language processing is modular, i.e., acts independently of other components, or whether it interacts with other components.",
        "Computationally oriented evaluations of human disambiguation began as incidental adjuncts to computational projects.",
        "Amsler and White [1979], with the help of assistants, manually (i.e., by human judgment) disambiguated the nouns and verbs used in definitions in the Merriam-Webster Pocket Dictionary.",
        "In an informal study, they found that their disambiguators' self-consistency on repeat performance was high (84%) but their consistency with respect to each other was lower.",
        "The need for some means of evaluating automatic disambiguation methods, more rigorous than the experimenter's personal judgment, has become more obvious with the recent growing interest in the topic.",
        "Gale, Church and Yarowsky [1992], for instance, have followed the approach of estimating upper and lower bounds on the performance of a system."

      "heading": "3 Preliminary experiments",
      "text": [
        "The project described in this paper began when one of us (Ahlswede) wrote disambiguation programs based on those of Leak [1986] and Ide and Veronis [1990] for application in dictionary and corpus research.",
        "Leak claimed 50-70% accuracy on short samples of literary and journalistic input.",
        "Ide and Veronis claimed a 90% accuracy rate for their program, although they explained that they had tested it against strongly distinct definitions â€“ mainly homographs rather than senses.",
        "After running the programs on test data containing ambiguities at both homograph and sense level, and evaluating the results, Ahlswede doubted whether, given this subtler mix of ambiguities, even a single human judge would achieve 90% consistency on successive evaluations of the same output; moreover, the consistency among multiple judges might well be much lower.",
        "Ahlswede recruited seven colleagues and friends to evaluate the test data, then compared their disambiguations of the test data against each other.",
        "The level of agreement averaged only 66% among the various human informants, ranging from 31% to 88% between pairs of informants [Ahlswede, forthcoming].",
        "This figure was based on a simple pairwise comparison strategy.",
        "The informants rated each sense definition of a test word with a \"1\" indicating that it correctly represented the meaning of the word as used in the test text; \"-1\" if the definition did not correctly represent the meaning; and \"0\" if for any reason the informant could not decide one way or the other.",
        "Pairs of informants were then compared by matching their ratings of the sense definitions of each word.",
        "The pair were considered to agree on a test word if at least one sense received a \"1\" from both informants and if no sense receiving a \"1\" from either informant was given a \"-1\" by the other.",
        "This scoring method had the advantage of simplicity, but it did not reflect the agreement implicit in the rejection as well as the selection of senses by both informants.",
        "But the relative weight of common rejections and commOn selections among the senses of a given test word depends on the total number of senses, which varies widely.",
        "No discrete-valued scoring mechanism seems able to solve this problem.",
        "A pairwise scoring procedure that gives much more plausible results is the coefficient of correlation, applied to the parallel evaluations by the informants being compared.",
        "It clearly distinguishes the relatively high agreement expected from human subjects from the relatively low agreement predicted for primitive automatic disambiguation systems, and from the more or less random behavior of a control series of random \"disambiguations.\"",
        "1. hl through h7 are human informants; h6 took the test twice.",
        "2. ml and mla are implementations of Lesk's algorithm.",
        "In mla, the test texts were previously disambiguated for part of speech; senses of inappropriate parts of speech were assumed incorrect, and left out of the test data.",
        "3. m2 is a spreading activation algorithm related to the Ide-Veronis algorithm.",
        "4. al is a control in which all senses of all test words received a \"1\".",
        "In our first scoring strategy, al achieved absurdly high scores.",
        "5. rand is a control created by randomly scrambling the sequence of answers in one of the human samples.",
        "These results suggested that a very high accuracy rate is not so much unrealistic as meaningless: which of the human informants should the computer agree with, if the humans cannot agree among themselves?",
        "For this reason, the informal experiment has led to the development of a larger and more formal test of human disambiguation performance.",
        "The main areas of innovation are (1) a much more systematically designed questionnaire, to be administered to hundreds of subjects rather than only seven, and (2) a user interface to facilitate both the completion of the questionnaire by this large number of human subjects, and our analysis of their performance.",
        "The biggest advantage of a computerized interface is that we can study the timing of subjects' responses: valuable information that could not be recorded in the original written test.",
        "Combined with the user interface, the questionnaire is adapted for administration to human informants, but it can be adapted with little effort for use with dictionary-based disambiguation programs, as was done with its written (but also machine-readable) predecessor."

        "The prototype version of the present questionnaire was a printed list of 100 test texts, each with an ambiguous word highlighted and a list of definitions following.",
        "Subjects typically took the test home, and reported needing anything from half an hour to several days to complete the questionnaire.",
        "The test was difficult to complete for several reasons.",
        "The test texts were themselves dictionary definitions, chosen at random from the machine-readable version of the Collins English Dictionary (CED).",
        "(This was because the project grew out of an effort specifically to disambiguate definition texts in the CED.)",
        "Many of the words being defined by the test texts were highly obscure, e.g. paduasoy n. a rich strong silk fabric used for hangings, vestments, etc.",
        "or India paper n. another name (not in technical usage) for bible paper [Ahlswede and Lorand, 1993] Disambiguation was done (as it still is in the present questionnaire) by choosing one or more from a set of dictionary definitions of the highlighted word.",
        "This was hard work, and volunteers were hard to find.",
        "Therefore, though the present version of the questionnaire avoids \"hard\" words except where these are explicitly being studied, it is still tough enough that we pay our subjects a small honorarium.",
        "Like its prototype, the present questionnaire consists of 100 test texts, each with an ambiguous test word or short phrase (e.g., ring up, go over).",
        "The number 100 was chosen, based on our experience with the prototype, as a compromise between a smaller test, easier on the subject but less informative, and a larger test which might be prohibitively difficult or time-consuming to take."

        "One of the original criteria for both test words and test texts, neutrality between British and American usage [Ahlswede, 1992], was found virtually impossible to maintain.",
        "The CED is British, and many if not most of its multi-sense entries include definitions of idiomatic British usages.",
        "To leave these out would be to risk distorting the results as a metric for a disambiguation program that used the CED as a whole without excluding those particular definitions.",
        "The other categories are American, and in the interest of consistency, American idioms were freely permitted as well.",
        "Several other criteria for selecting test texts were retained and followed: 1.",
        "Difficulty of resolution.",
        "This can only be estimated subjectively until the questionnaire results are in, except for the twenty dictionary definitions, where a rough measure of difficulty of resolution is provided by the \"coefficient of certainty\" [Ahlswede, forthcoming].",
        "A second measure, the \"coefficient of dissent\", specifically measures disagreement as opposed to uncertainty.",
        "The high negative correlation between coefficient of certainty and coefficient of dissent (-0.942) indicated that, in practice, there was little difference between widespread uncertainty and widespread disagreement.",
        "Partly because of the apparent lack of importance in this distinction, and partly for the convenience of automating the questionnaire, the \"0\" option in the prototype has been eliminated.",
        "The subject is forced to decide \"yes\" or \"no\" to each sense.",
        "Size of context.",

        "In some cases phrases have been deleted with ellipsis, where the full text seemed unmanageably long and the deleted phrase irrelevant to the disambiguation of the test word.",
        "The net sentence length ranges from 5 to 28 with a median of 14.",
        "Results so far indicate, as did Lesk's observations, that sentence length does not significantly affect performance.",
        "Global context was early recognized as a potential problem: human disambiguation decisions are made not only on the basis of the immediate sentence-level context, but also on an awareness of the domain: for instance, the word capital is likely (though not certain) to mean one thing in the Wall Street Journal and another thing in a political editorial about the federal government.",
        "Since the test texts are short and have no global context whatever, we compensate by adding a small parenthetical note at the end of each text, identifying it as \"Tips\", \"CED\", \"Twain\" or \"special\".",
