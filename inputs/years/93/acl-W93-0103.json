        "The level of the conceptual representation of words can be very complex in certain contexts, but in this paper we assume rather simple structure in which a concept is a set of weighted associated words.",
        "We propose an automatic concept acquisition framework based on the conditional probabilities suppliedd by a network representation of lexical relations.",
        "The network is in the spirit of Belief Net, but the probabilities are not necessarily Bayesian.",
        "In fact this variation of Bayesian Net is discussed recently by (Neal, 1992).",
        "We employed the Belief Net with non Bayesian probabilities as a base for representing the statistical relations among concepts, and implemented the details of the computation.",
        "Belief or Bayesian Nets have been extensively studied in the normative expert systems (Heckerman, 1991).",
        "Experts provided the network with the Bayesian(subjective) probabilities solely based on his/her technical experiences.",
        "Thus the net has been also known as a Belief Net among a dozen other names that share all or some of the principles of Bayesian net.",
        "The probabilistic model has been also used in the problems of integrating various sources of evidences within sound framework (Cho, 1992).",
        "One of the powerful features of Belief Net is that the conditional independences of the variables in the model are naturally captured, on which we can derive a form of probabilistic inference.",
        "If we regard the occurrence of a word as a model variable and assume the variables occur within some conditional influences of the variables(words) that previously took place, the Belief approach appears to be appropriate to compute some aspects of lexical relations latent in 1T1,is work was supported in part by a grant from Korea National Science Foundation as a basic research project and by a grant from Korea Ministry of Science and Technology in project \"an intelligent multimedia information system platform and image signal transmission in high speed network\"",
        "the texts.",
        "The probabilities on dependent variables are computed from the frequencies, so the probability is now of objective nature rather than Bayesian.",
        "The variation of Belief Net we use is identical to the sigmoid Belief Net by Neal (1992).",
        "In ordinary Belief Nets, 2\" probabilities for a parent variable with n children should be specified.",
        "This certainly is a burden in our context in which the net may contain even hundred thousands of variables with heavy interconnections.",
        "Sigmoid interpretation of the connections as in artificial neural networks provides a solution to the problem without damaging the power of the network.",
        "Computing a joint probability is also exponential in an arbitrary Belief network, thus Gibbs sampling which originates from Metropolis algorithm introduced in 50's can be used to approximate the probabilities.",
        "To speed up the convergence of the sampling we adopted simulated annealing algorithm with the sampling.",
        "The simulated annealing is also a descendant of metropolis algorithm, and has been frequently used to compute an optimal state vector of a system of variables.",
        "From the Collocation Map we can compute an arbitrary conditional probabilities of variables.",
        "This is a very powerful utility applicable to every level of language processing.",
        "To name a few automatic indexing, document classification, thesaurus construction, and ambiguity resolution are promising areas.",
        "But one big problem with the model is that it cannot be used in real time applications because the Gibbs sampling still requires an ample amount of computation.",
        "Some applications such as automatic indexing and lexical concept acquisition are fortunately not real time bounded tasks.",
        "We are currently undertaking a large scale testing of the model involving one hundred thousand words, which includes the study on the cost of sampling versus the accuracy of probability.",
        "To reduce the computational cost in time, the multiprocessor model that is successfully implemented for Hopfield Network(Yoon, 1992) can be considered in the context of sampling.",
        "Other options to make the sampling efficient should be actively pursued, and their success is the key to the implementation of the model to the real time problems."

        "Then the content of vebral form must be a clue to the reminded structure.",
        "The reminded structure is commonly referred to as the meaning of a word.",
        "Still the verbal representation can be arbitrarily complex, yet the representation is made up of words.",
        "Thus the words in the clue to the meaning of a word seem to be an important element of the meaning.",
        "Now define the concept of a word as Definition 1 The lexical concept of a word is a set of associated words that are weighted by their associativeness.",
        "The notion of association is rather broadly defined.",
        "A word is associated with another word when the one word is likely to occur in the clue of the reminded structure of the other word in some relations.",
        "The association by its definition can be seen as a probabilistic function of two words.",
        "Some words are certainly more likely to occur in association with a particular word.",
        "The likeliness may be deterministically explained by some formal",
        "theories, but we believe it is more of inductive(experimental) process.",
        "Now define the concept a of word w as a probabilistic distribution of its associated words.",
        "Thus the set of associated words consists of those whose probability is above threshold value T. The probabilistic distribution of words may exist independently of the influence of relations among words though it is true that relations in fact can affect the distribution.",
        "But in this paper we do not take other information into the model.",
        "If we do so, the model will have the complexity and sophistication of knowledge representation.",
        "Such an approach is exemplified by the work of Goldman and Charniak (1992).",
        "Equation 1 can be further elaborated in several ways.",
        "It seems that the concept of a word as in Equation 1 may not be sufficient.",

        "If the indirect association is repeated for several depths a class of words in particular aspects can be obtained.",
        "A potential application of Equation 3 and 4 is the automatic thesaurus construction.",
        "Subsumption relation between words may be computed by carefully expanding the meaning of the words.",
        "The subsumption relation, however, may not be based on the meaning of the words, but it rather be defined in statistical nature.",
        "The definition of lexical meaning as we defined is simple, and yet powerful in many ways.",
        "For instance, the distance between words can be easily computed from the representation.",
        "The probabilistic elements of the representation make the acquisition an experimental process and base the meaning of words on more consistent foundation.",

        "Being DAG is a big advantage of the formalism in computing probabilistic decisions, so we cannot help but stick to it.",
        "A cyclic relation should be broken into linear form as shown in figure 1.",
        "Considering the size of collocation map and the connectivity of nodes in our context is huge it is not practical to maintain all the combination of conditional probabilities for each node.",
        "For instance if a node has n conditioning nodes there will be 2n units of probability information to be stored in the node.",
        "We limit the scope to the direct dependencies denoted by arcs.",

        "Once a text is transformed into an ordered set of words, the list should be decomposed into binary relations of words to be expressed in collocation map.",
        "Here in fact we are making an implicit assumption that if a word physically occurs frequently around another word, the first word is likely to occur in the reminded structure of the second word.",
        "In other words, physical occurrence order may be a cause to the formation of associativeness among words.",
        "When Di is represented by a, b, c, • , z), the set of binary relations with window size 3(let us call this set it3) format is as follows.",
        "For words di and c, P(ci Idi) can be computed at least in two ways.",

        "It approximates the probabilities, and when optimal solutions are asked simulated annealing can be incorporated.",
        "Not only for computing probabilities, pattern completion and pattern classification can be done through the map using Gibb's sampling.",
        "In Gibb's sampling, the system begins at an arbitrary state or a given S, and a free variable is selected arbitrarily or by a selecting function, then the value of the variable will be alternated.",

        "Gradual learning(non batch) may degrade the performance of pattern classification probably by a significant degree, but what we want to do with collocation map is not a clear cut pattern identification up to each learning instance, but is a much more brute categorization.",
        "One way to implement the learning is first to clamp the nodes corresponding to the input set of binary dependencies, then run Gibb's sampling for a while.",
        "Then, add the average of energy changes of each arc to the existing values.",
