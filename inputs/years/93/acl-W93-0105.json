        "The identification of unknown proper names in text is a significant challenge for NLP systems operating on unrestricted text.",
        "A system which indexes documents according to name references can be useful for information retrieval or as a preprocessor for more knowledge intensive tasks such as database extraction.",
        "With the growing use of tagged corpora in a variety of language-related research areas, being able to reliably tag proper names is an obvious advantage.",
        "In addition, the development of practical techniques for name identification help to shed light on the various uses of proper names in text.",
        "Traditional approaches to unknown proper name identification involve, broadly speaking, the lexical lookup of names or name fragments in a name database.",
        "For example, approaches such as [Aone et al., 92], [Aberdeen et al., 92], and [Cowie et al., 92], identify person names by marking off phrases which contain unknown words close to known name elements like first or last names, and (in [Cowie et al., 92]) unknown words close to specific title-words.",
        "As the above studies show, name databases such as cross-cultural listings of common first and last names as well as existing geographical gazetteers, are helpful in name recognition.",
        "However, approaches based exclusively on unknown words and known name elements can be confused by known common nouns (or other parts of speech) which occur in proper names, even person names.",
        "More importantly, such approaches require an initial name element database.",
        "Creating such databases can be a labor-intensive task.",
        "Furthermore, no matter how large the database one can manually construct, the problem still arises of identifying names which don't happen to be present",
        "in any given name database.",
        "The fact that proper names form, lexically speaking, an open class whose elements grow far more rapidly than other open classes, and the fact that they often contain other open-class elements, makes the incompleteness of such databases an obvious problem.",
        "Our approach aims at deriving proper names and their semantic attributes automatically from large corpora, without relying on any listing of name elements.",
        "The overall approach is based on two main ideas.",
        "Firstly, we hypothesize that for certain genres of text (for example, Wall Street Journal news stories), new references are introduced by information occurring in the immediate syntactic environment of the proper name.",
        "(What the precise set of such genres is remains to be determined, but our initial set includes the most common forms of news stories and excludes literary narratives.)",
        "Many of these local contextual clues reflect felicity conventions for introducing new names.",
        "New names of people (as well as organization names, and to some extent location names) are generally accompanied by honorifics and various appositive phrases which help anchor the new name reference to mutually assumed knowledge.",
        "Further contextual clues come from selectional restrictions, for example, given \"Kambomambo murdered Zombaluma\" (from [Radford, 88]), the verb is the main clue to the hypothesis that the two names are those of people.",
        "Although the idea of exploiting local context to identify semantic attributes in new names is in itself not new (e.g. [Coates-Stephens, 91], [Paik et al., 93]), little attention has been paid in name identification work to the discourse properties of names.",
        "Our second, and more general idea is to view proper names as linguistic expressions whose interpretation often depends on the discourse context.",
        "For example, in the discourse \"U.S. President Bill Clinton....Clinton....Mr. Clinton....President Clinton\", the interpretations of \"Clinton\", \"Mr. Clinton\" and \"President Clinton\" are dependent on the prior reference to \"U.S. President Bill Clinton\", much as \"the president\", \"he\" and \"himself\" are dependent on prior context in the discourse \"U.S. President Bill Clintoni....the presidenti....hei....himselfi\".",
        "The need for text-driven extraction of names presupposes in turn a computational model of discourse which identifies individuals based on the way they are described in the text, instead of relying on their description in a preexisting knowledge base.",
        "The overall discourse representation framework which we use is Luper-foy's three-tiered model [Luperfoy, 91], which in turn is a computational adaptation of Landman's pegs model of NP semantics [Landman 86].",
        "The idea of the three-tiered model is that there are three significant levels of representation: linguistic expressions, Discourse Pegs, and knowledge base objects.",
        "A distinctive feature of Discourse Pegs (hereafter referred to as Pegs) as opposed to similar constructs in the literature, like File Cards ([Heim, 81]), Database Objects ([Sidner, 79]), Discourse Referents ({Karttunen, 68]), and Discourse Entities ([Webber, 78], [Dahl and Ball, 90]), is that they describe unique objects with respect to the current discourse, rather than with respect to the underlying belief system or world model.",
        "Thus, in an article mentioning Bill Clinton there may be two guises in which he may appear, as Governor Clinton and President Clinton; these would correspond to two distinct pegs.",
        "It is important to stress that pegs, as a result, do not correspond to equivalence classes of coreferential mentions; rather, there is one peg for each distinct object under discussion, irrespective of the number of entities in the world of reference.",
        "Objects which are distinct in the text may still need to be related to each other for their interpretation; for example, in the discourse \"President Bill Clinton... the Clintons....Hilary\", the expressions \"President Bill Clinton\", \"the Clintons\" and \"Hilary\" each introduce new pegs, but these pegs are each linked, as",
        "\"partial dependents\", to the previous one.",
        "An interesting subcase of this involves name mergers, e.g. an article describing a joint venture between two companies may use the two individual company names followed by a merged name for the joint venture.",
        "In applying this framework to the unknown name problem, we first distinguish three types of entities: (i) Mentions - these are text segments which are tokens of proper names in text; (ii) Contexts - these are text segments which provide information about syntactic and semantic properties associated with a name; and (iii) Hypotheses - these are hypotheses about individuals and their semantic attributes, associated with a Mention.",
        "Given this framework, the goal of unknown name identification is to use the text itself to generate Hypotheses about possible individuals distinguished by a Mention.",
        "In a given text context, descriptions from earlier Mentions of a name may be further specified by new information associated with subsequent Mentions of the name (which may take a somewhat different form from previous Mentions).",
        "In general, two Hypotheses, each associated with a different Mention, are linked together (by means of a common Peg) whenever they are mutually compatible.",
        "Thus, two Mentions, Mention 1 and Mention 2, can be considered to be indirectly anchored together to a common Peg whenever hypothetical information associated with each is mutually compatible.",
        "For ease of presentation, we may speak of these coanchored mentions as \"coreferential\" (when what we really mean is this more specific sense of coanchoring); also, we will use the capitalized word \"Coreference\" for the process of computing pegs for a mention, a process which may result in either the coanchoring of the mention to one or more existing pegs, or the allocation of a new peg.",
        "We describe the Coreference process in more detail in Section 4.",
        "2 Proper Names - Syntactic Forms and Semantic Attributes We first need to describe more precisely what we mean by proper names.",
        "In terms of syntactic categories, proper names are commonly identified as lexical NPs.",
        "In the examples in this paper, we use j to identify an internal proper name constituent of interest.",
        "Proper names often occur inside definite NPs, where the proper name can function as the syntactic head (\"the [President of France]\" , \"the [Gulf of California]\", \"the Reagan [White House]\", \"Iraq's president [Saddam Hussein]\", \"Lake [George]\"), a complement (\"the president of [France]\" ), or an adjunct or attributive NP (\"the [Reagan] White House\", \"the [Bush] administration\").",
        "They can also occur with indefinite determiners (\"an [Arnold Schwartznegger]\" , \"a [Washington Redskin]\", \"an [IBM]\").",
        "As lexical NPs, proper names have substantial internal structure: they can be formed out of primitive proper name elements (\"Oliver North\", \"Gramm-Rudman\" \"Villa-Lobos\"), other proper names (\"Lake George\", \"the [President of France]\", \"the [Reagan White House]\", \"Anne of a Thousand Days\") and also out of non-proper names (\"the [Savings and Loan] crisis\", \"General Electric Co.\", \"Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation\", \"Committee for the Protection of Public Welfare\").",
        "A common resulting form is the open compound proper name (\"the [Carter Administration National Energy Conservation Committee]\" ).",
        "Given an occurrence of a proper name in text, we can use the text itself to extract semantic attributes associated with that name.",
        "As mentioned earlier, the local context frequently offers valuable clues.",
        "Also, for certain varieties of names, such as organization names (\"Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation\") and geographical location names (\"Easter Island\"), the internal structure of the name can be used to hy",
        "pothesize various semantic attributes.",
        "A study reported in [Amsler, 87] on proper names in the New York Times containing the word \"center\" (such as \"Grand Forks Energy Research Center\" and \"Boston University's Center for Adaptive Systems\") is suggestive of the scope of such techniques.",
        "Identifying idiomatic uses is obviously a problem: as [Amsler, 87] points out, \"Grand Funk Railroad\" is the name of a rock group.",
        "In keeping with such an approach, we have developed subgrammars which model the internal syntax and semantics of geographical names, which, in combination with information from the local Context, can be used to guess the type of location."

        "The approach of text skimming is associated with much recent work on data extraction from text (e.g. [Mauldin 891, [Jacobs 881, and many others).",
        "In general, this means that different parts of the text can be processed to different depths, with some parts being skipped over lightly.",
        "The text skimming approach also implies, in our case, that we lighten the burden of lexical semantics: in contrast to approaches like [Coates-Stephens, 91], we need only represent word meanings for words closely related in meaning to the semantic attributes we are attempting to extract.",
        "While we were attracted to such an approach, our work also explores some of the practical tradeoffs associated with text skimming.",
        "The overall algorithm involves first tokenizing the text into sentences and words, then proposing candidate name mentions, and finally allowing various knowledge sources (KSs) to vote on and propose hypotheses about a given mention.",
        "Each KS can generate multiple scored hypotheses about a given mention.",
        "The KSs are applied in a predetermined order to a mention, with each KS refining the hypotheses generated by the previous KS.",
        "Names which are identified beyond a certain confidence level (a variable recall/precision threshold) are added to a hypothetical lexicon after asking the user about them.",
        "Over time, learnt names (or name elements) in the hypothetical lexicon increase the likelihood of recognizing a name mention.",
        "The system assumes a shallow knowledge base representing the specific concepts and attributes to be extracted.",

        "The semantic lexicon associated with this knowledge base is a small one, of the order of a few hundred words, consisting of titles, honorifics, location nouns and organizational suffixes extracted from phrases tagged as NP in the Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus.",
        "Words associated with these entities are the only ones which currently have any lexical semantics in our system.",
        "(A noteable exception comes from our work on place names, which exploits, for comparison purposes, a TIPSTER gazetteer).",
        "This small lexicon is complemented by the very large syntactic lexicon derived from the Lancaster-Oslo-Bergen corpus, which is used by our part-of-speech tagger and parser [de Marcken, 90].",
        "A variety of different grammars are used by the system.",
        "The simpler kind are regular expression grammars which rely on part-of-speech, some specific key lexical items from our semantic lexicon, and punctuation - these grammars drive a pattern matcher which is an extension of the one described in [Norvig, 92].",
        "Such grammars are used for modeling the internal syntax and semantics of geographical names and person names, and also for locating various Context boundaries - for example, identifying an appositive construction.",
        "Further segmentation of the appositive (see Section 3.3) is done by a mix",
        "ture of pattern-matching of the above kind and NP parsing (into head, pre-modifiers, and post-modifiers) using the MIT Fast Parser [de Marcken, 90] and its associated syntactic grammar.",
        "At present, we perform only a rudimentary analysis of organization names, merely hypothesizing whether a mention is a likely organization name or not.",
        "We have used the WSJ as a training corpus.",
        "The mode of knowledge engineering has involved building a rudimentary proper name tagger, followed by iterations through a cycle of tagging the corpus with records of Mentions and their occurrence Contexts, examining the tagged corpus to improve the knowledge sources, and retagging.",

        "The identification of person names and geographical locations is in place, as well as a rudimentary organization tagger (which does not extract any interesting attributes regarding the organization).",
        "The pegs-based",
        "Coreference KS has been implemented, but the breaking of a link from a mention to a peg is not as yet propagated to other pegs.",
        "We have not yet implemented a treatment of partial dependents, which involve modeling interrelationships among pegs.",
        "Problems we are currently working on include conjunctions (e.g. is \"AVX and Kyocera\" a single entity?",
        "), the treatment of partial dependents and references to sets (e.g. the discourse \"Indira Gandhi....Rajiv Gandhi....the Gandhis\").",
        "We are also investigating the applicability of Bayesian inference networks to the overall problem.",
        "Recently, we conducted an empirical evaluation of the system.",
        "In a nutshell (details are deferred to a separate paper), the evaluation was carried out on a test set of 42 hand-tagged WSJ articles, using a scoring program we developed.",
        "The hand-tagging marked only the type of the tag (person, organization, or location), ignoring attributes.",
        "Scores on <precision, recall> varied from <76%, 72%> to <84%, 80%>, depending on whether partial matches (e.g. only a fragment of a name in the program's tag, or a title identified as part of a name) were accepted.",
        "We soon expect to more directly evaluate the Coreference KS, but in the meantime we can offer the observation that the Coreference KS has been observed to be extremely effective (apart from the exceptions we mentioned earlier) for name mentions in the WSJ, especially for people mentions.",
        "In conclusion, then, we have found that a treatment of proper names as potentially context-dependent linguistic expressions can be effectively applied to the problem of unknown name identification in newswire text, especially when combined with local-context based text skimming.",
        "In addition to determining more precisely the genre limitations of such an approach, one future direction would be to consider porting the system to another language."
