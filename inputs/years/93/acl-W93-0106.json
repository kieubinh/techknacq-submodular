        "Much effort is being applied to the creation of lexicons and the acquisition of semantic and syntactic attributes of the lexical items that comprise them, e.g, [1], [4],[7],[8], [11], [16], [18], [20].",
        "However, a lexicon as given may not suit the requirements of a particular computational task.",
        "Because lexicons are expensive to build, rather than create new ones from scratch, it is preferable to adjust existing ones to meet an application's needs.",
        "In this paper we describe such an effort: we add associational information to a hierarchically structured lexicon in order to better serve a text labeling task.",
        "An algorithm for partitioning a full-length expository text into a sequence of subtopical discussions is described in [9].",
        "Once the partitioning is done, we need to assign labels1 indicating what the subtopical discussions are about, for the purposes of information retrieval and hypertext navigation.",
        "One way to label texts, when working within a limited domain of discourse, is to start with a predefined set of topics and specify the word contexts that indicate the topics of interest (e.g., [101).",
        "Another way, assuming that a large collection of pre-labeled texts exists, is to use statistics to automatically infer which lexical items indicate which labels (e.g., [12]).",
        "In contrast, we are interested in assigning labels to general, domain-independent text, without benefit of pre-classified texts.",
        "In all three cases, a lexicon that specifies which lexical items correspond to which topics is required.",
        "The topic labeling method we use is statistical and thus requires a large number of representative lexical items for each category.",
        "The starting point for our lexicon is WordNet [13], which is readily available online and provides a large repository of English lexical items.",
        "WordNet2 is composed of synsets,",
        "structures containing sets of terms with synonymous meanings, thus allowing a distinction to be made between different senses of homographs.",
        "Associated with each synset is a list of relations that the synset participates in.",
        "One of these, in the noun dataset, is the hyponymy relation (and its inverse, hypernymy), roughly glossed as the \"ISA\" relation.",
        "This relation imposes a hierarchical structure on the synsets, indicating how to generalize from a subordinate term to a superordinate one, and vice versa.' This is a very useful kind of information for many tasks, such as reasoning with generalizations and assigning probabilities to grammatical relations [17].",
        "We would like to adjust this lexicon in two ways in order to facilitate the label assignment task.",
        "The first is to collapse the fine-grained hierarchical structure into a set of coarse but semantically-related categories.",
        "These categories will provide the lexical evidence for the topic labels.",
        "(After the label is assigned, the hierarchical structure can be reintroduced.)",
        "Once the hierarchy has been converted into categories, we can augment the categories with new lexical items culled from free text corpora, in order to further improve the labeling task.",
        "The second way we would like to adjust the lexicon is to combine categories from distant parts of the hierarchy.",
        "In particular, we are interested in finding groupings of terms that contribute to a frame or schema-like representation [14]; this can be achieved by finding associational lexical relations among the existing taxonymic relations.",
        "For example, WordNet has the following synsets: \"athletic game\" (hyponyms: baseball, tennis), \"sports implement\" (hyponyms: bat, racquet), and \"tract, piece of land\" (hyponyms: baseball_diamond, court), none of which are closely related in the hierarchy.",
        "We would like to automatically find relations among categories headed by synsets like these.",
        "(In Version 1.3, the WordNet encoders have placed some associational links among these categories, but still only some of the desired connections appear.)",
        "In other words, we would like to derive links among schematically related parts of the hierarchy, where these links reflect the text genre on which text processing is to be done.",
        "[19] describes a method called WordSpace that represents lexical items according to how semantically close they are to one another, based on evidence from a large text corpus.",
        "We propose combining this term-similarity information with the hierarchical information already available in WordNet to create structured associational information.",
        "In the next section we describe the algorithm for compressing the WordNet hierarchy into a set of categories.",
        "This is followed by a discussion of how these categories are to be used and why they need to be improved.",
        "Section 4 describes the first improvement technique: including new, related terms from a corpus, and Section 5 describes the second improvement technique: bringing disparate categories together to form schematic groupings while retaining the given hierarchical structure.",

        "We would like to decompose the WordNet noun hierarchy into a set of disjoint categories, each consisting of a relatively large number of synsets.",
        "(This is necessary for the text-labeling task, because each topic must be represented by many different terms.)",
        "The goal of creating categories of a particular average size with as small a variance as possible.",
        "There is some limit as to how small this variance can be because there are several synsets",
        "that have a very large number of children (there are sixteen nodes with a branching factor greater than 100).",
        "This primarily occurs with synsets of a taxonymic flavor, i.e., mushroom species and languages of the world.",
        "There are two other reasons why it is not straightforward to find uniformly sized, meaningful categories:",
        "(i) There is no explicit measure of semantic distance among the children of a synset.",
        "(ii) The hierarchy is not balanced, i.e., the depth from root to leaf varies dramatically throughout the hierarchy, as does the branching factor.",
        "(The hierarchy has ten root nodes; on average their maximum depth is 10.5 and their minimum depth is 2.)",
        "Reason (ii) rules out a strategy of traveling down a uniform depth from the root or up a uniform height from the leaves in order to achieve uniform category sizes.",
        "The algorithm used here is controlled by two parameters: upper and lower bounds on the category size (see Figure 1).",
        "For example, the result of setting the lower bound to 25 and the upper bound to 60 yields categories with an average size of 58 members.",
        "An arbitrary node N in the hierarchy is chosen, and if it has not yet been registered as a member of a category, the algorithm checks to see how many unregistered descendants it has.",
        "In every case, if the number of descendants is too small, the assignment to a category is deferred until a node higher in the hierarchy is examined (unless the node has no parents).",
        "This helps avoid extremely small categories, which are especially undesirable.",
        "If the number of descendants of N falls within the boundaries, the node and its unregistered descendants are bundled into a new category, marked, and assigned a label which",
        "is derived from the synset at N. If N has too many descendants, that is, the count of its unmarked descendants exceeds the upper bound, then each of its immediate children is checked in turn: if the child's descendant count falls between the boundaries, then the child and its descendants are bundled into a category.",
        "If the child and its unmarked descendants exceed the upper bound, then the procedure is called recursively on the child.",
        "Otherwise, the child is too small and is left alone.",
        "After all of N's children have been processed, the category that N will participate in has been made as small as the algorithm will allow.",
        "There is a chance that N and its unmarked descendants will now make a category that is too small, and if this is the case, N is left alone, and a higher-up node will eventually subsume it (unless N has no parents remaining).",
        "Otherwise, N and its remaining unmarked descendants are bundled into a category.",
        "If N has more than one parent, N can end up assigned to the category of any of its parents (or none), depending on which parent was accessed first and how many unmarked children it had at any time, but each synset is assigned to only one category.",
        "The function \"mark\" places the synset and all its descendents that have not yet been entered into a category into a new category.",
        "Note that #descendents is recalculated in the third-to-last line in case any of the children of N have been entered into categories.",
        "In the end there may be isolated small pieces of hierarchy that aren't stored in any category, but this can be fixed by a cleanup pass, if desired."

        "The larger categories resulted in better-trained classifications, but the classes often conflated quite disparate terms.",
        "The current implementation produces smaller, more coherent categories.",
        "The advantage is that a more distinct meaning can be associated with a particular label, but the disadvantage is that in many cases so few of the words in the category appear in the training data that a weak model is formed.",
        "Then the categories with little distinguishing training data dominate the labeling scores inappropriately.",
        "In the category-derivation algorithm described above, in order to increase the size of a given category, terms must be taken from nodes adjacent in the hierarchy (either descendants or siblings).",

        "To remedy this problem, we have experimented with increasing the size of the categories in two different ways: (1) The first approach is to retain the categories in their current form and add semantically similar terms, extracted from corpora independent of WordNet, thus improving the training of the labeling algorithm.",

        "Thus the top four or five super-categories should suffice to indicate the main topics of documents.",
        "We have not yet rigorously analyzed the performance of the labeler with the original categories or with the super-categories.",
        "In future we plan to obtain reader judgements about which categories are the best labels for various texts.",
        "Here we show some example output and discuss its characteristics.",
        "The table below compares the results of the labeler using the original categories against the super-categories.",
        "The numbers beside the category names are the scores assigned by",
        "the algorithm; the scores in both cases are roughly similar.",
        "It is important to realize that only the top four or five labels are to be used from the super-categories; since each super-category subsumes many categories, only a few super-categories should be expected to contain the most relevant information.",

        "It describes how Soviet women have little political power, discusses their role as working women, and describes the benefits of college life.",
        "The second article is a 77-sentence popular science magazine article about the Magellan space probe exploring Venus.",
        "When using the super-categories, the labeler avoids grossly inappropriate labels such as \"mollusk_genus\" and \"goddess\" in the Magellan article, and combines categories such as \"layer\", \"natural_depression\", and \"rock stone\" into the one super-category \"land terra_firma\".",
        "Looking again at the longer texts of the United Stales Constitution and Genesis we see that the super-categories are more general and less redundant than the categories shown in Section 2.",
        "(Alhough the high scores for the \"breads\" category seems incorrect, even though the term \"bread\" occurs 25 times.)",
        "In some cases the user might desire more specific categories; this experiment suggests that the labeler can generate topic labels at multiple levels of granularity."

        "We have discussed two approaches to augmenting and rearranging the components of a lexicon, in effect adding new features to its members, by making use of lexical association information from a large corpus.",
        "We've used lexical cooccurrence statistics in combination with a modified lexicon to classify proper names, associate more specific senses to broadly defined terms, and classify new words into existing categories with some degree of success.",
        "We've also used these statistics to suggest how to rearrange a lexicon with a taxonymic structure into more frame-like categories, and assigned more general main-topic labels to texts based on these categories.",
        "One conclusion that may be drawn from this work, especially the results in Section 4, is that we have provided a mechanism for successfully combining hand-built lexicon information with knowledge-free, statistically-derived information.",
        "The combined information from the categories derived from WordNet provided the clusters from which WordSpace centroids could be created, and these centroids in turn provided candidate words to improve the categories.",
        "In future, in addition to expanding the evaluation of the results described here, we would like to try reversing the experiment; that is, starting with WordSpace vectors, see which parts of WordNet should be interlinked into schematic categories.",
