        "Automatic approaches to the acquisition of word taxonomies have generally made use of machine readable dictionaries (MRD) for the typical definitory nature of MRD texts.",
        "For example, in Byrd et al., (1987) and other similar studies the category of a word is acquired from the first few words of a dictionary definition.",
        "Besides the well known problems of inconsistency and circularity of definitions, an inherent difficulty with this approach is that verbs can hardly be defined in terms of genus and differentiae.",
        "Verb semantics resides in the nature of the event they describe, that is better expressed by the roles played by its arguments in a sentence.",
        "Psycholinguistic studies on verb semantics outline the relevance of thematic roles, especially in categorisation activities Keil, (1989), Jackendoff (1983) and indicate the argument structure of verbs as playing a central role in language acquisition Pinker (1989).",
        "In NLP, representing verb semantics with their thematic roles is a consolidated practice, even though theoretical researches (Pustejovski (1991)) propose more rich and formal representation frameworks.",

        "These studies, though valuable, leave several open problems:",
        "1) A metric of conceptual closeness based on mere syntactic similarity is questionable, particularly if applied to verbs.",
        "In fact, the argument structure of verbs is variegated and poorly overlapping.",
        "Furthermore, subject and object relations do not fully characterize many verbs.",
        "2) Many events accumulate statistical evidence only in very large corpora, even though in Pereira and Tishby (1992) the adopted notion of distributional similarity in part avoids this problem.",
        "3) The description of a word is an \"agglomerate\" of its occurrences in the corpus, and it is not possible to discriminate different senses.",
        "4) None of the aforementioned studies provide a method to describe and evaluate the derived categories.",
        "As a result, the acquired classifications seem of little use for a large-scale NLP system, and even for a linguist that is in charge of deriving the taxonomy.",
        "Our research is an attempt to overcome in part the aforementioned limitations.",

        "The algorithm learns verb classifications through the systematic observation of verb usages in sentences.",
        "The algorithm has been tested on two domains with very different linguistic styles, a commercial and a legal corpus of about 500,000 words each.",
        "In section 2 we highlight the advantages that concept formation algorithms, like COBWEB, have over \"agglomerate\" statistical approaches.",
        "However, using a Machine Learning methodology for a Natural Language Processing problem required adjustments on both sides.",

        "These modifications are discussed in sections 2.1 trough 2.3.",
