        "There is a widespread belief among linguists that a predicate's subcategorization frames are largely determined by its lexical-semantic properties [23, 11, 121.",
        "Consider the domain of movement verbs.",
        "Following Talmy [23], these can be semantically classified with reference to the meaning components: MOTION, MANNER, CAUSATION, THEME (MOVING ENTITY), PATH AND REFERENCE LOCATIONS (GOAL, SOURCE).",
        "Lexicalization patterns which arise from identifying clusters of such meaning components in verb senses can be systematically related to distinct subcategorization frames.1 For example, the arguments of a verb expressing directed caused motion (e.g. bring, put, give) are normally a causative subject (agent), a theme direct object (moving entity) and a directional argument expressing path and reference location (goal), e.g.",

        "However, a motion verb which is not amenable to direct external causation [13], will typically take a theme subject, with the possible addition of a directional argument, e.g. (2) The baby crawled (across the room) Co-occurrence restrictions between meaning components may also preempt subcategorization options; for example, manner of motion verbs in Italian cannot integrate a completed path component and therefore never subcategorize for a directional argument, e.g. (3)*Carlo ha camminato a casa Carlo walked home 'Following Levin [12] and Sanfilippo [18], we maintain that valency reduction processes (e.g. the causative-inchoative alternation) are semantically governed and thus do not weaken the correlation between verb semantics and subcategorization properties.",
        "These generalizations are important for NLP since they frequently cover large subclasses of lexical items and can be used both to reduce redundancy and elucidate significant aspects of lexical structure.",
        "Moreover, a precise characterization of the relation between semantic subclasses and subcategorization properties of verbs can aid lexical disambiguation.",
        "For example, the verb accord can be used in either one of two senses: agree or give, e.g.",
        "(4) a The two alibis do not accord",
        "Your alibi does not accord with his b They accorded him a warm welcome Accord is intransitive in the agree senses shown in (4a), and ditransitive in the give sense shown in (4b).",
        "The manual encoding of subcategorization options for each choice of verb subclass in the language is very costly to develop and maintain.",
        "This problem can be alleviated by automatically extracting collocational information, e.g. grammar codes, from Machine Readable Dictionaries (MRDs).",
        "However, most of these dictionaries are not intended for such processing; their readership rarely require or desire such exhaustive and exacting precision.",
        "More specifically, the information available is in most cases compiled manually according to the lexicographer's intuitions rather than (semi-)automatically derived from texts recording actual language use.",
        "As a source of lexical information for NLP, MRDs are therefore liable to suffer from omissions, inconsistencies and occasional errors as well as being unable to cope with evolving usage [1, 4, 2, 61.",
        "Ultimately, the maintenance costs involved in redressing such inadequacies are likely to reduce the initial appeal of generating subcategorization lists from MRDs.",
        "In keeping with these observations, we implemented a suite of programs which provide an integrated approach to lexical knowledge acquisition.",

        "This has led an increasing number of researchers to look at text corpora as a source of information [8, 22, 9, 6, 3].",
        "For example, Brent [6] describes a program which retrieves subcategorization frames from untagged text.",
        "Brent's approach relies on detecting nominal, clausal and infinitive complements after identification of proper nouns and pronouns using predictions based on GB's Case Filter [16) – e.g. in English, a noun phrase occurs to the immediate left of a tensed verb, or the immediate right of a main verb or preposition.",
        "Brent's results are impressive considering that no text preprocessing (e.g. tagging or bracketing) is assumed.",
        "However, the number of subcategorization options recognized is minima1,2 and it is hard to imagine how the approach could be extended to cover the full range of subcategorization possibilities without introducing some form of text preprocessing.",
        "Also, the phrasal patterns extracted are too impoverished to infer selectional restrictions as they only contain proper nouns and pronouns.",
        "2Brent's program recognizes five subcategorization frames built out of three kinds of constituents: noun phrase, clause, infinitive.",
        "Lexical acquisition of collocational information from preprocessed text is now becoming more popular as tools for analyzing corpora are getting to be more reliable [9].",
        "For example, Basili et al.",
        "[3] present a method for acquiring sublanguage-specific selectional restrictions from corpora which uses text processing techniques such as morphological tagging and shallow syntactic analysis.",
        "Their approach relies on extracting word pairs and triples which represent crucial environments for the acquisition of selectional restrictions (e.g. V_prep_N(go,to,Boston)).",
        "They then replace words with semantic tags (V_prep_N(PHYSICAL_ACT-to-PLACE)) and compute co-occurrence preferences among them.",
        "Semantic tags are crucial for making generalizations about the types of words which can appear in a given context (e.g. as the argument of a verb or preposition).",
        "However, Basili et al.",
        "rely on manual encoding in the assignment of semantic tags; such a practice is bound to become more costly as the text under consideration grows in size and may prove prohibitively expensive with very large corpora.",
        "Furthermore, the semantic tags are allowed to vary from domain to domain (e.g. commercial and legal corpora) and are not hierarchically structured.",
        "With no consequent notion of subsumption, it might be impossible to identify \"families\" of tags relating to germane concepts across sublanguages (e.g. PHYSICAL_ACT, ACT; BUILDING, REAL_ESTATES)."

        "In order to do this, we ran CorPSE on a section of the Penn Treebank comprising 576 bracketed sentences from radio transcripts.",
        "LFrom these sentences, CorPSE extracted 1335 SF tokens comprising 1245 active VPs and 90 passives.",
        "The SF tokens were converted into 817 SF types.",
        "The coalescence process reduced the 817 SF types to 583, which are representative of 346 distinct verb stems.",
        "The verb stern of 308 of these 583 SF types was semantically ambiguous as it was associated with more than one semantic tag.",
        "In some",
        "cases, this ambiguity was appropriate because the semantic codes assigned to the stem were all compatible with the complement structure of their SF type.",
        "For example, the verb call can occur in either one of two senses, summon and phone, with no change in subcategorization structure:",
        "(17) a Supper is ready, call the kids b Call me when you land in Paris",

        "(18) ( (\"call\" (\"G\"-summon \"V-phone)) ((*NP* (\"C\" \"J\" \"N\"))))",
        "In other cases, the ambiguity was in need of resolution as some of the verb-stem's semantic codes referred to the same LLOCE entry or were incompatible with the complement structure in the SF type (see §3.1.3).",
        "Disambiguation using semantic tag equivalence reduced the ambiguity of 206 types, totally disambiguating 31 stems.",
        "Applying collocation restrictions further reduced 38 stems, totally disambiguating 24 of them.",
        "Taking into account that the amount of data processed was too small to use statistical techniques for disambiguation, the results achieved are very promising: we managed to reduce ambiguity in over half the SF types and totally disambiguated 16 percent, thus providing a unique correspondence between semantic verb class and subcategorization frame in 346 cases.",
        "Of the remaining 179 SF frames, 106 had verb stems with two semantic codes, 72 had verb stems with 3-5 semantic codes and the verb stem of one SF type had 6.",
        "Needless to say, the number of ambiguous SF types is bound to increase as more texts are processed.",
        "However, as we accumulate more data, we will be able to apply statistical techniques to reduce lexical ambiguity, e.g. by computing co-occurrence restrictions between the semantic codes of the verb stem and complement heads in SF types.",
        "The table below summarizes some of the results concerning the correlation of semantic codes and subcategorization options obtained by running CorPse on the Penn Treebank fragment.",
        "The first column lists the LLOCE semantic codes which are explained in (20).",
        "The second column indicates the number of unique subcategorization occurrences for each code.",
        "A major difficulty in computing this relation was the presence of certain constituents as arguments that are usually thought of as adjuncts.",
        "For example, purpose clauses and time adverbials such as yesterday, all day, in March, on Friday had often been bracketed as arguments (i.e. sisters to a V node).",
        "Our solution was to filter out inadequately parsed arguments semi-automatically.",
        "Certain constituents were automatically filtered from SF types as their status as adjuncts was manifest, e.g. complements introduced by prepositions and complementizers such as without, as, since and because.",
        "Other suspect constituents, such as infinitive VPs which could represent purpose clauses, were processed by direct query.",
        "A second problem was the residual ambiguities in SF types mentioned above.",
        "These biased the significance of occurrences since one or more codes in an ambiguous SF type could be inconsistent with the subcategorization of the SF type.",
        "A measure of the \"noise\" factor introduced by ambiguous SF types is given in the third column of (19), where ambiguity rate is computed by dividing the number of codes associated with the same complement structure by the number of occurrences of that code with any complement structure.",
        "This ambiguity measure allows the significance of the figures in the second column to be assessed.",
        "For example, since the occurrences of \"E\" instances were invariably ambiguous, it is difficult to draw reliable conclusions about",
        "them.",
        "Indeed, on referring most of these SF types (e.g. beat, bolt and have) back to their source texts, the \"Food St Drink\" connotation proved incorrect.",
        "The figures in column 1 were normalised as percentages of the total number of occurrences in order to provide a measure of the statistical significance of the results in the remaining columns.",
        "We thus conclude that the results for B, E, H, and I are unlikely to be significant as they occur with low relative frequency and are highly ambiguous.",
        "The final three columns quantify the relative frequency of occurrence for VP, SBAR and PP complements in SF types for each semantic code.",
        "Although the results are not clear-cut, there are some emerging trends worth considering.",
        "For example, the low frequency of VP and SBAR complements with code \"M\" reflects the relatively rare incidence of clausal arguments in the semantics of motion and location verbs.",
        "By contrast, the relatively high frequency of PP complements with this code can be related to the semantic propensity of motion and location verbs to take spatial arguments.",
        "The \"A\" verbs (eg.",
        "create, live and murder) appear to be strongly biased towards taking a direct object complement only.",
        "This might be due to the fact that these verbs involve creating, destroying or manipulating life rather than events.",
        "Finally, the overwhelmingly high frequency of SBAR complements with \"G\" verbs is related to the fact that thought and communication verbs typically involve individuals and states of affairs.",
        "We also found interesting results concerning the distribution of subcategorization options among specializations of the same general code.",
        "For example, 23 out of 130 occurrences of \"M\" verbs exhibited an \"NP PP\" complement structure; 17 of these were found in SF types with codes \"M50-M65\" which largely characterize verbs of caused directed motion: Putting and Taking, Pulling & Pushing.",
        "This trend confirms some of the observations discussed in the introduction.",
        "It is now premature to report results of this kind more fully since the corpus data used was too small and genre-specific to make more reliable and detailed inferences about the relation between subcategorization and semantic verb subclass.",
        "We hope that further work with larger corpora will uncover new patterns and corroborate current correlations which at present can only be regarded as providing suggestive evidence.",
        "Other than using substantially larger texts, improvements could also be obtained by enriching SF types, e.g. by adding information about subject constituents."
