        "should be mapped to thematic roles in the semantic structures (e.g. agent, theme, etc.).",

      "heading": "2.1 Situation Types",
      "text": [
        "Each of a verb's lexical senses is classified into one of the four default predicate-argument mapping types called situation types.",
        "As shown in Table 1, situation types of verbs are defined by two kinds of information: 1) the number of subcategorized NP or S arguments and 2) the types of thematic roles which these arguments should or should not map to.",
        "Since this kind of information is applicable to verbs of any language, situation types are language-independent predicate-argument mapping types.",
        "Thus, in any language, a verb of type CAUSED-PROCESS has two arguments which map to AGENT and THEME in the default case (e.g. \"kill\").",
        "A verb of type PROCESS-OR-STATE has one argument whose thematic role is THEME, and it does not allow AGENT as one of its thematic roles (e.g. \"die\").",
        "An AGENTIVE-ACTION verb also has one argument but the argument maps to AGENT (e.g. \"look\").",
        "Finally, an INVERSE-STATE verb has two arguments which map to THEME and GOAL; it does not allow AGENT for its thematic role (e.g. \"see\").",
        "Examples from three languages are shown in Table 2.",
        "Although verbs in different languages are classified into the same four situation types using the same definition, mapping rules which map grammatical functions (i.e. subject, object, etc.)",
        "in the syntactic structures1 to thematic roles in the semantic structures may differ from one language to another.",
        "This is because languages do not necessarily express the same thematic roles with the same grammatical functions.",
        "This mapping information is language-specific (cf. Nirenburg and Levin [16]).",
        "The default mapping rules for the four situation types are shown in Table 3.",
        "They are nearly identical for the three languages (English, Spanish, and Japanese) we have analyzed so far.",
        "The only difference is that in Japanese the THEME of an INVERSE-STATE verb is expressed by marking the object NP with a particle \"-ga\" , which is usually a subject",
        "marker (cf. Kuno [12]).2 3 So we add such information to the INVERSE-STATE mapping rule for Japanese.",
        "Generalization expressed in situation types has saved us from defining semantic mapping rules for each verb sense in each language, and also made it possible to acquire them from large corpora automatically.",
        "This classification system has been partially derived from Vendler and Dowty's as-pectual classifications [19, 9] and Talmy's lexicalization patterns [18].",
        "For example, all AGENTIVE-ACTION verbs are so-called activity verbs, and so-called stative verbs fall under either INVERSE-STATE (if transitive) or PROCESS-OR-STATE (if intransitive).",
        "However, the situation types are not for specifying the semantics of aspect, which is actually a property of the whole sentence rather than a verb itself (cf. Kriflca [11], Dorr [8], Moens and Steedman [15]).",
        "For instance, as shown below, the same verb can be classified into two different aspectual classes (i.e. activity and accomplishment) depending on the types of object NP's or existence of certain PP's.",
