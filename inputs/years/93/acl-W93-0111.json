        "Semantic issues have been addressed, particularly for sense disambiguation, by using large contexts, e.g., 50 nearby words (Gale, Church & Yarowsky, 1992) or by reference to on-line dictionaries (Krovetz, 1991; Lesk, 1986; Liddy & Paik, 1992; Zernik, 1991).",
        "More recently, methods to work with entirely untagged corpora have been developed which show great promise (Brill & Marcus, 1992; Finch & Chater, 1992; Myaeng & Li, 1992; Schütze, 1992).",
        "They are particularly useful for text with specialized vocabularies and word use.",
        "These methods of unsupervised classification typically have clustering algorithms at their heart (Jain & Dubes, 1988).",
        "They use similarity of contexts (the distribution principle) as a measure of distance in the space of words and then cluster similar words into classes.",
        "This paper demonstrates a particular approach to these classification techniques.",
        "In our approach, we take into account both the relative positions of the nearby context words as well as the mutual information (Church & Hanks, 1990) associated with the occurrence of a particular context word.",
        "The similarities computed from these measures of the context contain information about both syntactic and semantic relations.",
        "For example, high similarity values are obtained for the two semantically similar nouns,",

        "We demonstrate the technique on three problems, all using a 200,000 word corpus composed of 1700 abstracts from a specialized field of biology: #1: Generating the full classification tree for the 1,000 most frequent words (covering 80% of all word occurrences).",

        "The results described below were obtained using no pretagging or on-line dictionary, but the results compare favorably with methods that do.",
        "The results are discussed in terms of the semantic fields they delineate, the accuracy of the classifications and the nature of the errors that occur.",

        "Nevertheless, we experimented with classifying 100 words of corpus frequency 1 with and without expanding the context words.",
        "Though hand scoring the results is difficult, we estimate that there were 8 reasonable pairs found initially and 26 pairs when expansion was used.",
        "Examples of words that paired well without expansion are \"overlaps\" and \"flank\" (due to a preceding \"which\") and \"malB\" and \"cheA-cheB\" (due to the context \"...the [rnalB, cheA-ch eB] re gi on ...\" ).",
        "After expansion, pairs such as \"setting\", \"resetting\" appeared (due in part to the expansion of the preceding \"as\" and \"to\" context words into simsets which both included \"with\", \"in\" and",
        "The amount of information available about frequency 1 words can vary from a lot to nothing at all, and most frequently tends to the latter, viz., \"John and Mary looked at the blork.\"",
        "Nevertheless, such words are prominent, 44% of our corpus' vocabulary.",
        "About half of them are non-technical and can therefore be analyzed from other corpora or on-line dictionaries.",
        "Word morphology and Latinate morphology in particular, can be helpful.",
        "Online chemical databases, supplemented with rules for chemical nomenclature will clarify additional items, e .g., \"2-epoxypropylphosphonic\" or \"phosphoglucomutase-deficient\".",
        "Furthermore, there are naming conventions for genetic strains and mutants which aid recognition.",
        "The combination of all these methods should lead to a reasonable accuracy in the classification of frequency 1 words."

        "Our corpus of 220,000 words is much smaller than ones of 40 million words (Finch & Chater, 1992) and certainly of 360 million (Brown, Della Pietra, deSousa, Lai & Mercer, 1992).",
        "But judging by the results we have presented, especially for the full 1,000 word clustering, our corpus appears to make up in specificity for what it lacks in size.",
        "Extending this work beyond abstracts to full papers will be challenging because our corpus requires SGML markup to deal with Greek characters, superscripts and subscripts, etc.",
        "(Futrelle, Dunn, Ellis & Pescitelli, 1991).",
        "We have over 500,000 words from the bacterial chemotaxis research papers carefully marked up by hand in this way.",
        "The characterization of context can obviously be extended to more context positions or words, and extensions of our word-rooted expansion techniques are potentially very powerful, combining broad coverage with specificity in a \"tunable\" way.",
        "Morphology can be added to the context vectors by using the ingenious suggestion of Brill to collect high-frequency tri-letter word endings (Brill & Marcus, 1992).",
        "One of the more subtle problems of the context specification is that it uses summed frequencies, so it may fail to retain important correlations.",
        "Thus if only AB or CD sequences occurred, or only AD or CB sequences, they would lead to the same (summed) context vector.",
        "The only correlations faithfully retained are those with the target word.",
        "Characterizing context n-grams could help work around this problem, but is a non-trivial task."
