        "These pattern-based systems use short and fairly specific lexical patterns to specify the relation between strings in the source text and particular entries in a problem-dependent knowledge representation.",
        "This one-step process substitutes for a conventional two-level process of a full syntactic parse followed by semantic interpretation.",
        "With considerably less time and development effort (notably demonstrated by [11, 8]), these systems achieve performance comparable to more standard systems that rely heavily on full syntactic analysis ([9, 5]).",
        "However, because these pattern-based systems are still viewed as linguistically ungrounded and somewhat ad hoc, formal work in the application and acquisition of lexical patterns has lagged system development.",
        "In most current systems, patterns are produced through tedious hand analysis of text ([11, 4, 8]), while system coverage is gained either through extensive linguistic knowledge on the part of the researcher (in judging appropriate pattern generalizations), or by generating and testing massive numbers of patterns.",
        "One exception to hand analysis is Lehnert's work in [12], in which machine learning techniques are used to infer possible patterns for extraction.",
        "While this AutoSlog technique has dramatically reduced system development time, the inference techniques use only sparse linguistic information, provide no means of generalizing patterns across domains, and still require that the rules be checked by the researcher for applicability."
