        "Moore and Pollack have recently given an analysis of R.ST relations in terms of intentional versus informational levels of discourse [5].",
        "According to their (convincing) analysis, presentational RST relations correspond to the intentional level of discourse and subject matter relations to the informational level.",
        "For each text there should exist two RST analyses: one containing only presentational relations and the other containing only subject matter relations.",
        "Mann and Thompson had discussed multiple analyses in RST ([1], pp.",
        "26-30), stating that a presentational analysis is the only analysis when both presentational and subject-matter relation definitions are satisfied between a given pair of text spans.",
        "In their view, the presentational analysis is chosen as correct since it describes the changes in the hearer's system of beliefs, i.e. provides deeper insights into discourse goals.",
        "Moore and Pollack, however, argue that these two analyses should not compete; instead, \"a complete model of discourse structure must maintain both levels of relation\".",
        "In this paper we take this argument one small step further and suggest a way these two levels might be organized into a stratified structure.",
        "Our discussion here has a very narrow focus and does not attempt to answer such important questions as whether the RST collection of presentational relations is exhaustive and adequate for describing all possible intentional structures."

      "text": [
        "In Meaning – Text theory (MTT), when there are two (or more) alternative analyses of text which (according to intution) belong to distinct levels of representation, one should ask whether one of them can be seen as a means of expressing the other.",
        "Moore and Pollack argue for coexistence of intentional (presentational) and informational (subject matter) analyses, but they do not attempt to describe the relationship between them.",
        "They show that there is no one-to-one mapping between presentational and subject matter relations, and moreover, that the presentational and subject matter analyses may have different structures (e.g., the presentational and subject matter relations may have opposite directionality, [5], pp.",
        "542 – 543).",
        "Their conclusion is that there is no easy way to relate these two levels.",
        "From the viewpoint of MTT, however, the intentional vs. informational dichotomy observed by Moore and Pollack appears quite natural.",
        "An analogy can be seen with the relationship between the semantic and deep syntactic levels in M'rT: semantic relations are in a many-to-many correspondence with deep syntactic relations.",
        "Moreover, there is no isomorphism or even preservation",
        "of structure between a semantic graph and a deep syntactic tree which expresses it.",
        "For example, on the semantic level, an adverb such as often is typically analyzed as a predicate whose argument (i.e., dependent) is the remaining sentence graph.",
        "On the (deep) syntactic level, the same adverb is a dependent of the main verb.",
        "Thus the direction of dependency can easily change as one passes from semantics to syntax.",
        "Following this analogy, we propose to consider the informational level of discourse as a means of expressing the intentional level.",
        "Intuitively, this seems quite plausible because informing the hearer about informational relations between discourse elements can hardly be considered a self-sufficient goal.",
        "Moore and Pollack stress that the intentional level is the primary one since it describes the speaker's strategy to achieve her intentional goal.",
        "In keeping with MTT methodology, to give substance to a claim of separate strata, one must produce a system of rules that map the relations of the \"meaning\" level to the relations of the \"means\" level.",
        "Each \"meaning\" relation can map to many \"means\" relations (or combinations of such relations) and vice versa, one and the same \"means\" relation can appear in more than one mapping rule.",
        "Each rule describes the contextual conditions for its application in enough detail to justify the distinction between various \"means\", if such exist.",
        "At the moment, we can give only a few examples of such mapping rules, one of which we present below.",
        "Nevertheless, we present this very preliminary analysis for purposes of discussion, in the belief that work in discourse representation is crucial for text generation theory and applications.",
        "A stratificational view has significant implications.",
        "One of these is to eliminate linear order from the description of intentional RST relations.",
        "Note that in RsT a. given intentional relation may hold between two text segments appearing in either order provided that appropriate discourse connectives are used.",
        "In our view, linear order and, correspondingly, discourse connectives should appear only on the informational level.",
        "Abstract intentional relations express only the dependencies between propositions, not the lexical or \"syntactic\" artifacts associated with the means of their expression."

        "Moore and Pollack show that the same example admits an analysis on the informational level in terms of the Volitional Cause relation.",
        "In our terms, this would mean that the intentional relation Evidence can be realized by the informational relation Volitional Cause under certain conditions.",
        "If there are other informational relations that are capable of realizing the same intentional relation, these conditions should clearly identify the application context for each informational relation.",
        "Another informational relation capable of realizing Evidence is Non-Volitional Cause, as shown in text (2a-2b):",

        "In contrast, in both examples 1 and 2 the satellite (1a,2a) was a general proposition.",
        "We offer the following sketch of an Intentional-to-informational mapping rule: If the intentional relation Evidence holds between two propositions Pi and P2, where PI is a nucleus and P2 is a satellite, then, if PI is a general proposition (i.e. the equivalent of a common sense \"law\" is given as Evidence), then if there is a conscious agent such that both PI and P2 refer to her actions, then the Volitional Cause informational relation can be chosen; else (if there is no agent.",
        "in Pi and P2 as described above), then the Non-Volitional Cause informational relation can be chosen; if P2 is a general proposition, then the Elaboration information relation can be chosen."
