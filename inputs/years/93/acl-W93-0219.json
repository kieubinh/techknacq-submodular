        "If no cue phrase exists for a relation lexical cohesion may play that role.",

        "In Example 1 the coNDtTioNality in the link between the two sentences is expressed by means of the conjunction when.",
        "In example 2, on the contrary, the SEQUENCE ill the events reported is implicit in the verbs which can be inferred as temporally linked.",
        "This example also shows how a rhetorical relation contributes to the development of the topic and the progression of theme.",
        "It can be observed, for instance, that the SEQUENCE relation preserves the theme over a chain of events (on that point see also [Matthiessen and Bateman, '91])."
