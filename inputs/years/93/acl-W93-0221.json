        "While communicative intention certainly plays a role in language generation, we have found that there is a need for textual and rhetorical relations as well in our document generation system, PLANDoc.",
        "PLANDoc will produce multi-page narratives describing the activities of telephone network planning engineers.",
        "These narratives will be read by managers and auditors as well as other planning engineers.",
        "Since the reports contain summaries, sometimes determining what information to include and how to organize it is based solely on textual constraints.",
        "Summaries must be concise and information can be packed in using constructions such as ellipsis, conjunction and modification.",
        "Thus, textual constraints that rely on syntactic structure, lexical information, and parallels in the semantic types of the underlying information must play a role in organizing a summary.",
        "Since the intended audience of the narratives is broad, we often need to determine what information to include in the narrative based on general presentational factors that aim to improve the clarity of the text.",
        "Rhetorical relations are useful for modelling this sort of constraint.",
        "There are also cases where it is necessary to communicate the planning engineer's intent in taking a specific action.",
        "However, we cannot model this computationally since we have no access to information about intention.",
        "While we cannot automatically generate information based on intent, we do allow the engineer to enter statements that describe her reasons for an action.",
        "These user-authored statements can be interspersed with machine-generated text.",
        "In the following sections, we first give some background on the PLANDoc system and the narratives that we are aiming to generate.",
        "We follow this with examples that illustrate why different types of constraints are needed in determining the content and organization of a PLANDoc narrative.",
        "All examples are taken from a set of narratives written by an experienced planning engineer for actual runs of the underlying planning system that PLANDoc is based on."

        "Currently, planning engineers use a powerful software tool, the PLAN system, that helps them derive 20-year relief plans optimizing the timing, placement and cost of new facilities in a route in the telephone network.",
        "Documentation of relief plans is needed to justify their implied expenditures to managers, auditors, and regulators as well as to provide a record of the engineer's reasoning for future network studies.",
        "PLANDoc will generate documentation using a trace of an engineer's interaction with PLAN.",
        "Given a model of the current configuration of a route along with ftwecasts of future service demands, the planning engineer first calls upon PLAN to generate a Base relief plan for the route.",
        "Although the Base plan is the most economical long-term solution, it generally needs to be refined to account for practical and intangible factors known to the engineer but unknown to the computer.",
        "For example, the engineer may need to postpone the placement of equipment in a certain CSA (Carrier Serving Area) due to a fixed cap on near-term expenditures, or she may decide to activate DLC (Digital Loop Carrier) equipment in another CSA because small manholes in that area make the placement of additional copper cables impractical.",
        "For this reason PLAN includes a powerful Interactive Refinement Module that allows the engineer to do 'what-if modeling to explore the effects of various refinements to the Base plan.",
        "The engineer draws upon her expertise to determine what refinements to try, often including some that she fully expects",
        "to be sub-optimal, if only for the purpose of proving the point to managers, auditors and regulators.",
        "In the end, some subset of refinements is selected as the final Proposed Relief Plan."

        "We employed an experienced planning engineer to write sample PLANDoc narratives based on actual PLAN runs.",
        "These manually-written narratives serve as models for our system development.",
        "The opening and closing paragraphs of PLANDoc narratives are summaries of the Base Plan and the final Proposed Relief Plan.",
        "The main body of PLANDoc narratives is a sequence of one-paragraph descriptions of each refinement scenario the engineer chooses to include.",
        "In addition to the machine-generated refinement paragraphs, the engineer is given the opportunity to enter a manually-written Engineer's Note for each refinement.",
        "The purpose the Engineer's Note is to provide motivation or to describe the reasoning behind the refinement.",
        "Thus, the main body of the narrative consists of alternating refinement paragraphs and engineering notes.",
        "The Engineer's Notes are clearly meant to communicate intentions.",
        "In contrast, we have observed that some of our model refinement paragraphs (to be generated automatically): 1) appear to be organized by textual relations that govern their discourse structure; 2) include sentences that seem to be motivated by rhetorical relations; and 3) include sentences that require access to communicative goals in order to be generated.",
        "We provide examples of each."

        "In the following refinement paragraph, 8 messages have been grouped together based on textual constraints.",
        "Because of the similarity of each individual message and resulting sentence, the messages can be combined using conjunction to produce a very concise sentence.",
        "1) This refinement demanded the following changes: denied DLC activations to CSA 2119, 2653, 2755, and 2757; used a cutover strategy of \"ALL\" for CSA 2605 and 2713; changed the \"ALL\" DLC system to \"id1c96\" for CSA 2605; and demanded DLC activation for CSA 2651 in 1994Q1.",

        "In the body of the narrative, the date is usually included with each separate activation.",
        "To generate a summary like this, PLANDoc would have to note that it could group a series of activations initially and delay mentioning the date since it can refer back to them using a phrase such as \"All these new activations.\"",
        "Such a decision can only be opportunistically based on similarities between data that can be grouped together and the available of an appropriate means for referring back to them.",
        "2) The BASE plan for this route called for activating new DLC sites with fiber T l support in CSA 2117, CSA 2651, CSA 2105, CSA 2113, CSA 2115, CSA 2703, CSA 2755 and CSA 2757.",

        "All these new activations are in the first 10 years of the study.",
