        "It is commonly assumed that in engaging in communication, the speaker' (S) has a specific communicative intention.",
        "Communicative intentions relate to that domain that the use of language can affect, namely the mental state of the hearer (H), i.e., H's beliefs, desires, and intentions.",
        "Of course, S may have other intentions that relate to the world at large (such as to get H to open a window), but these are not properly speaking communicative intentions: they can only be achieved by use of language if language first produces some appropriate change in H's mental states.",
        "In discussing the ways in which S's use of language can affect H's mental states, it is important to make a distinction between the fact that H is entertaining a belief, desire, or intention, and the degree or strength with which it is entertained.",
        "This distinction has not always been made in the text generation literature; presumably, this is because for the types of texts whose generation has been studied, namely reports, documentation, and manuals of various kinds, this distinction is not relevant.",
        "This is because these texts (weather reports, military reports, instruction manuals, and so on) are \"authoritative texts\": if the text makes H entertain a certain belief or intention, then H will do so with a sufficient strength to satisfy S's communicative goals.",
        "I claim that the interesting aspects of rhetorical relations (or \"rhetoric\" for short), and the intersting role that rhetoric can play in discourse generation, have not been studied because the types of text analyzed and generated have been one-sided in significant respects.",

        "Thus S's goal is that H be affected by the text.",
        "In order to achieve this goal, S must know about the process of decoding that 11 will use, otherwise S cannot purposefully use language.",

        "planning is more likely to yield interesting instances of the use of rhetoric, since in monologic genres the modeling of the strength of H's beliefs, desires, and intentions must remain conjectural, while in dialogic genres, H's feedback can contribute to S's assessment of H's mental state.",
