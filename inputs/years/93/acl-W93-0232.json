        "Discourses are the collaborative activities of (human) agents who have purposes for communicating.",
        "Discourse structure includes the purposes of those agents, which I take, following [GroszSid86], to be formally expressible as intentions and beliefs.",
        "While the theory of discourse structures has influenced how many computational linguists think about discourse processing, it does not preclude careful consideration of rhetorical function in discourses.",
        "Nor does it settle the question of how intentions are conveyed by particular utterances in particular genres of discourse.",
        "In recent research I have been studying discourses that occur when people communicate about their collaboative activities.",
        "These people are collaborating not only to make the discourse happen, but to get something done together in the world.",
        "Following on the model of SharedPlans in [GroszSid90, GroszKra93], I have asked, how is it that agents use language to come to hold the beliefs and intentions specified by the SharedPlan model as necessary for successful collaboration?",
        "Using naturally occurring conversations of human agents collaborating, I have observed that their discourses cycle through a series of proposals, rejections, assents, counters, modifications and retractions.",
        "To clarify this observation, I have devised an artificial language of negotiation [Sidner92] whose sentences are messages containing proposals of propositions, rejections of propositions, etc.",
        "The semantics of these messages is specified in terms of beliefs, especially mutual belief, and intentions that the discourse participants come to hold about the propositional content of the message.",
        "Along with the language is an \"environment\" for interpretation that keeps track of accepted, open and rejected proposals.",
        "Using this language I have created artificial conversations in which the beliefs and intentions of the participants are fully evident.",
        "Such conversations have some of the richness of naturally occurring ones, though they lack such attentional devices of human discourse as cue phrases.",
        "They also contain more redundancy than human discourse; in the artificial language individual utterances can not serve several functions at once, as is very common in natural human discourse.",
        "I maintain as a working hypothesis that the negotiation language can model naturally occur-ing discourses as cycles of negotiations.",
        "Under this hypothesis, the recognition that an utterance serves as a proposal as opposed to a counterproposal, for example, is determined not by the relation of the utterance to previous utterances.",
        "It is determined by recognition of beliefs and intentions conveyed by the utterance and by the current discourse state with respect to beliefs and intentions (e.g. which beliefs are not yet mutually believed, which are, and which cannot be because one discourse participants holds that the belief is false); these together indicate how the beliefs and intentions of the current utterance operate as proposals, counterproposals, rejections and the like.",
        "As a model of human discourse, the negotiation language provides a fine-grained model of the beliefs and intentions and relations among them that is conveyed in individual utterances.",
        "It does not eliminate the need for recognizing what role the particular beliefs and intentions conveyed play in the agents' plans, especially in their SharedPlans, and hence plan recognition is still critical.",
        "Recent work by Lochbaum [Lochbaum93) provides an outlook on plan recognition for collaborative activity.",
        "The negotiation language might appear to be similar to relations in RST and other theories because terms such as proposing, counterproposing and rejection seem similar to, for example, Mann",
        "and Thomson's evidence, antithesis and concession relations.",
        "The distinctions may be clarified by first noting that the general term \"discourse structure relations\" is ambiguous.",
        "Relations might be between utterances or utterances and segments (i.e. elements of the linguistic structure), between constructs of attentional state or between those of the intentional structure [GroszSid86].",
        "RST, Hobbs' theory and the McKeown schemas [Manntho87, Hobbs79, McKeown85] are all relations among parts of linguistic structure.",
        "The dominance and satisfaction precedence of the Grosz and Sidner theory are relations among constructs of intentional structure.",
        "In [Moorepar89] work, RST is used to organize and enact the intentions of the speaker, as well as to maintain a model of how portions of the text are related to each other.",
        "Because the negotiation language concerns relations among belief and intentions, it is an example of relations among intentional structure.",
        "Both this language and the use of RST in Moore and Paris' work suggest that certain aspects of rhetorical relations are captured in the beliefs and intentions conveyed in utterances in combination with the state of the discourse.",
        "The negotiation language viewpoint however does not critically address the issue of rhetorical function in part because it is not clear what aspects of discourse behavior one wants to claim must be addressed by rhetorical function.",
        "What is the role of rhetorical function or rhetorical knowledge in discourse?",
        "What aspects of discourse must be accounted for by rhetorical function?",
        "While rhetorical relations like those of RST have been useful in the generation systems of McKeown and the ISI systems, no one has claimed that the recognition of these relations is essential for the interpretation of discourse; many researchers do accept the view, originally propounded by Austin, Searle and Grice, that intentions and beliefs conveyed in utterances are intended to be recognized.",
        "Do rhetorical relations or other textual relations concern rhetorical knowledge?",
        "Or are they misnamed, so that the term linguistic structure relations is more apt?",
        "Rhetorical function concerns a different aspect of communication than the recognition of intention, namely the affective one.",
        "By this I mean the role of an utterance in evoking in the hearer or reader some change of state (including an emotional one) that the hearer or reader does not necessarily recognize; often affect is less than successful if the hearer is aware of it.",
        "In classical tradition, which extends back to Aristotle's view of rhetoric, rhetorical function concerns the art of persuasion; in more recent times, rhetoric is the art of social control and motivation through communication.",
        "Hovy's Ph.D. [Hovy89] work can be seen as an experiment in rhetorical function.",
        "His PAULINE system can present an event from several different points of view, depending on, among other things, the goals for influencing hearer's opinions; Hovy's system is not concerned with the hearer recognizing what is going on.",
        "Research by Cahn [Cahn90], addressesing the automatic synthesis of utterances with affective mood (e.g. utterances that sound happy or sad or angry), demonstrates that affect may be carried at the most fine grained level of communication.",
        "Both rhetorical theory and intentional theories deal with a discourse participant coming to hold a belief on the basis of utterances from another participant.",
        "Modern rhetoric (especially in advertising) concerns itself with causing the participant to do something (such as buy a certain product), a concern not entirely unakin to intending that another perform an action [GroszKra93].",
        "It is only rhetorical theories that address the means of achieving these ends by affect on the hearer, either with or without the hearer recognizing it.",
        "It is unclear to me whether Hobbs, McKeown or Mann and Thompson intended their relations to operate rhetorically in the sense described above.",
        "If the relations were not so intended, then they may continue to provide the kind of organizing framework they have played in generation systems without having a parallel role in interpretation systems.",
        "And if they were not, then rhetorical function is a matter computational linguistics might still need to address.",
        "Because rhetorical function is one of affect on the hearer, it may be valuable to generation systems, which must plan for the affect of utterances on discourse participants, the force of utterances in persuasive activity, and perhaps social aspects of discourse participants.",
        "Rhetorical function may also be useful to the interpretation of discourse.",
        "One might want to consider how to build systems that are sensitive to the affect of utterances (or perhaps not, since it might be easier to have computational conversational partners that do not respond to such matters).",
        "Rhetorical function does not yet seem critical to many researchers in computational linguistics, but a better understanding of its role in discourse may clarify issues of this workshop."
