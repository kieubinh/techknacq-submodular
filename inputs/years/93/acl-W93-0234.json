      "heading": "Diverse Accounts of Coherence",
      "text": [
        "Various accounts of discourse coherence have been offered in the literature, each with their own merits and limitations.",
        "For example, Grosz & Sidner [1986] defined a coherent discourse to be one in which a single discourse purpose is \"shared bffy all the participants and when each utterance of the discourse contributes to achieving this purpose.\" Grosz and Sidner provided a clear account of certain aspects of the hierarchical and prerequisite structure of discourse.",
        "However they did not address the variety of communicative roles that sibling text segments can play with respect to each other.",
        "Intersegmental coherence is the concern of rhetorical structure theory (RST), whose proponents have stated (in various forms, and most directly by Hovy [1988]) that a coherent text is one in which each contiguous segment of text is related by a rhetorical relation.",
        "This claim is concisely stated, easy to understand and apply, and intuitively appealing.",
        "However it is deficient in being too weak in explanatory power and too strong in its conditions for coherence.",
        "It is too weak because the rhetorical relations themselves were developed by identifying relationships between contiguous segments of text in a corpus of texts considered to be coherent.",
        "Because of this circularity, the rhetorical characterization of coherence does not account for the sources of coherence or say why the text is coherent: the rhetorical relations are merely descriptive of coherent text.",
        "The claim is too strong because coherence does not necessarily require rhetorical relations between every contiguous segment of a text.",
        "The ordering of a text can be arbitrary at points.",
        "There is unlikely to be a well motivated rhetorical relation between those segments whose contiguity is arbitrary.",
        "This problem has shown up in text generation: Moore 8i Paris [1991] encountered certain difficulties in the design of their explanation planner that they attributed to the requirement that a rhetorical relation be present between each pair of contiguous segments in a plan.",
        "RST has also been criticized for conflating different kinds of relations that should be distinguished [Grosz & Sidner 1986, Moore & Pollack 1993, Suthers 1990].",
        "Finally, Hobbs' [1979] characterization of coherence as the ease of inferring coherence relations linking the parts of the text has also been criticized on the basis that the coherence relations serve no purpose once they have been inferred.",
        "The reader is more concerned with discerning",
        "the communicative intent of a text than with verifying its coherence, and the theoretician should be as well.",
        "The relations by which coherence is defined should be independently motivated for reasons of communicative functionality.",
        "This view is not inconsistent with the view that coherence relations must be recognized to succeed in making a text coherent.",
        "The former simply requires that coherence relations serve some communicative function other than being recognized as contributing to coherence.",
        "Hobbs' characterization can be restated as follows: a discourse is coherent to the extent that it makes its communicative functionality plain.",
        "However this leaves us with the question of precisely which functionally motivated relations are needed to account for coherence, and how these relations can provide a structural \"test\" for coherence that replaces the initial approximation provided by Hovy's interpretation of RST."

        "A partial ordering in terms of constraints derived from the above functional relationships [Suthers 1993b].",
        "Based on this structural taxonomy, two concise (though oversimplified) conditions for a coherent explanation can be stated:",
        "• The graph of informative, supplemental, and propositional relations between segments is a connected graph meeting the definitions of these relations (i.e., there are no isolated units of analysis, weaker than requiring a relation between each contiguous pair of units).",
        "• The sequencing of the segments is consistent with the intended communicative functionality of the segments, the functionality being discerned by the aforementioned relations [Suthers 19934",
        "(Given a more adequate treatment of exchange structure, the conditions could be extended to include the appropriateness of the dominating rhetorical acts for the exchange context.)",
        "This characterization of coherence addresses the weakness of the previous accounts by identifying the sources of coherence in independently motivated constraints on the content and organization of an explanation without unnecessarily strong conditions or assumptions about hearer inferences.",
        "Additionally, the proliferation of coherence relations is reduced by separating supplemental roles from domain-specific relations.",
        "My argument for the above taxonomy depends on my theoretical assumptions about the text planning process rather than on direct linguistic evidence.",
        "This deficiency can be addressed by empirical work.",
        "However, regardless of whether this particular taxonomy proves to be the most useful, I expect that it is plausible enough to make the point that a complete description of the coherence and communicative functionality of discourse requires acknowledgment of functionally distinct categories of relationships between segments, not just different relationships within a category.",
        "This is especially the case in text genres that mix informational and intentional goals (such as instructional texts).",

        "However it should be noted that the above characterization of coherence is oriented towards the needs of generation rather than the process of comprehension.",
        "\"Coherence\" from the point of view of the understander need not be the same as \"coherence\" from the point of view of the generator, as their processing requirements may differ.",
        "A related question is whether coherence is the combined effect of its aspects identified by the analyst, or whether it suffices to attend to only one source of coherence when many are possible.",
        "Gisela Redeker3 argues that a hearer need only recognize the presence of one coherence relation; therefore when multiple relations hold between two segments (ideational, rhetorical, or segmental in her terminology), the speaker can choose which to mark.",
        "(She provides evidence that one could have marked both.)",
        "Yet marker choice does not rule out the need to process other aspects of coherence, for example the planner must decide whether and how to use an ideational (e.g. causal) relation in constructing a rhetorical (e.g., evidential) one.",

        "Both the analysis and generation of coherent and functional text depend on the coordination of multiple types of structural relations at different granularities.",

        "The author has proposed distinctions between exchange, informative, propositional, contextual, supplemental, and sequential structure [Suthers 19934 these differentiate types of intentional and rhetorical structure.",

        "Regardless, we need to deal with multiple descriptions when analyzing a text.",
