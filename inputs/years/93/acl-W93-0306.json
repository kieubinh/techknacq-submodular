        "Let us summarise a few key features of this style of analysis.",
        "• As most parsing frameworks, also the present style of analysis employs a lexicon and a grammar.",
        "What may distinguish the present approach from most other frameworks is the considerable degree of attention we pay to the morphological and lexical description: morphological analysis is based on an extensive and detailed description that employs inflectional and central derivational categories as well as other morphosyntactic features that can be useful for stating syntactic generalisations.",
        "In this way 'This paper is based on a longer manuscript with the same title.",

        "based on hand-coded linguistic rules rather than on corpus-based statistical models.",
        "They employ structural categories that can be found in descriptive grammars, e.g. [Quirk, Greenbaum, Leech and Svartvik, 1985].",
        "Regarding the at times heated methodological debate on whether statistical or rule-based information is to be preferred in grammatical analysis of running text (cf. e.g. [Sampson, 1987a; Taylor, Grover and Briscoe, 1989; Church, 199*, we do not object to probabilistic methods in principle; nevertheless, it seems to us that rule-based descriptions are preferable because they can provide for more accurate and reliable analyses than current probabilistic systems, e.g. part-of-speech taggers Noutilainen, Heikkila and Anttila, 1992; Voutilainen, forthcoming al.'",
        "Probe-1C..onsider for instance the question posed in [Church, 1992] whether lexical probabilities contribute more to morphological or part-of-speech disambiguation than context does.",
        "The ENGCG morphological disambigua-tor, which is entirely based on context rules, uniquely bilistic or heuristic techniques may still be a useful add-on to linguistic information, if potentially remaining ambiguities must be resolved - though with a higher risk of error.",
        "• In the design of our grammar schemes, we have paid considerable attention to the question on the resolvability of grammatical distinctions.",
        "In the",
        "design of accurate parsers of running text, this question is very important: if the description abounds with distinctions that can be dependably resolved only with extrasyntactic knowledge2, then either the ambiguities due to these distinctions remain to burden the structure-based parser (as well as the potential application based on the analysis), or a guess, i.e. a misprediction, has to be hazarded.",
        "This descriptive policy brings with it a certain degree of shallowness; in terms of information content, a tag-based syntactic analysis is somewhere between morphological (e.g. part-of-speech) analysis and a conventional syntactic analysis, e.g. a phrase structure tree or a feature-based analysis.",
        "What we hope to achieve with this compromise in information content is the higher reliability of the proposed analyses.",
        "A superior accuracy could be considered as an argument for postulating a new, 'intermediary' level of computational syntactic description.",
        "For more details, see e.g. [Voutilainen and Tapanainen, 1993).",
        "• Our grammar schemes are also learnable: according to double-blind experiments on manually assigning morphological descriptions, a 100% interjudge agreement is typical [Voutilainen, forthcoming 4.3 • The ability to parse running text is of a high priority.",
        "Not only a structurally motivated description is important; in the construction of the parsing grammars and lexica, attention should also be paid to corpus evidence.",
        "Often a grammar rule, as we express it in our parsing grammars, is formed as a generalisation 'inspired' by corpus observations; in this sense the parsing grammar is corpus-based.",
        "However, the description need not be restricted to the corpus observation: the linguist is likely to generalise over past experience, and this is not necessarily harmful - as long as the generalisations can also and correctly identifies more than 97% of all appropriate descriptions, and this is considerably more than the near90% success rate achieved with lexical probabilities alone [Church, 1992].",
        "Moreover, note that in all, the ENGCG disambiguator identifies more than 99.5% of all appropriate descriptions; only, some 2-3% of all analyses remain ambiguous and thus do not become uniquely identified.",
        "For more details, see [Voutilainen, forthcoming 1993].",
        "'Witness, for instance, ambiguities due to adverbial attachment or modifier scope.",
        "'The 95% interjudge agreement rate reported in [Church, 1992] probably indicates that in the ease of debatable constructions, explicit descriptive conventions have not been consistently established.",

        "be validated against representative test corpora.",
        "• At least in a practical application, a parsing grammar should assign the best available analysis to its input rather than leave many of the input utterances unrecognised e.g. as ill-formed.",
        "This does not mean that the concept of well-formedness is irrelevant for the present approach.",
        "Our point is simply: although we may consider some text utterance as deviant in one respect or another, we may still be interested in extracting as much information as possible from it, rather than ignore it altogether.",
        "To achieve this effect, the grammar rules should be used in such a manner4 that no input becomes entirely rejected, although the rules as such may express categorical restrictions on what is possible or well-formed in the language.",
        "• In our approach, parsing consists of two main kinds of operation: 1.",
        "Context-insensitive lookup of (alternative) descriptions for input words 2.",
        "Elimination of unacceptable or contextually illegitimate alternatives.",
        "Morphological analysis typically corresponds to the lookup module: it produces the desired morphosyntactic analysis of the sentence, along with a number of inappropriate ones, by providing each word in the sentence with all conventional analyses as a list or alternatives.",
        "The grammar itself exerts the restrictions on permitted sequences of words and descriptors.",
        "In other words, syntactic analysis proceeds by way of ambiguity resolution or disambiguation: the parser eliminates ill-formed readings, and what 'survives' the grammar is the (syntactic) analysis of the input utterance.",
        "Since the input contains the desired analysis, no new structure will be built during syntactic analysis itself.",
        "• Our grammars consist of constraints - partial distributional definitions of morphosyntactic categories, such as parts of speech or syntactic functions.",
        "Each constraint expresses a piecemeal linear-precedence generalisation about the language, and they are independent of each other.",
        "That is, the constraints can be applied in any order: a true grammar will produce the same analysis, whatever the order.",
        "The grammarian is relatively free to select the level of abstraction at which (s)he is willing to express the distributional generalisation.",
        "111 particular, also reference to very low-level categories is possible, and this makes for the accuracy of the parser: while the grammar will contain more or less abstract, feature-oriented rules, often it is also expedient to state further, more particular restrictions on more particular distributional classes, even at the word-form level.",
