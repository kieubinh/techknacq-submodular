        "Discussions of sentence processing have focused primarily on structurally-based preference strategies such as right association and minimal attachment [Kimball, 1973; Frazier, 1979; Ford eta!., 1982]; [Hobbs and Bear, 1990), while acknowledging the importance of semantics and pragmatics in attachment decisions, propose two syntactically-based attachment rules that are meant to be generalizations of those structural strategies.",
        "Others, however, have argued that syntactic considerations alone are insufficient for determining prepositional phrase attachments.",

        "In the preference semantics framework, attachment relations of phrases are determined by comparing the preferences emanating from all the entities involved in the attachment, until the best mutual fit is found.",
        "Their CASSEX system represents the various meanings of the preposition in terms of (a) the preferred semantic class of the noun or verb that proceeds the preposition (e.g., move, be, strike), (b) the case of the preposition (e.g., instrument, time, lc-static), and (c) the preferred semantic class of the head noun of the prepositional phrase (e.g., physob, event).",

        "(See also discussion in [Schubert, 1984].)",

        "phrase attachments by using preferences obtained by applying a set of heuristic rules to dictionary definitions.",
        "The rules match against lexico-syntactic patterns in the definitions – for example, if confronted with the sentence She are a fish with a fork, the system evaluates separately the plausibility of the two proposed constructs eat with fork and fish with fork based on how well the dictionary supports each.",
        "By making use of on-line dictionaries, the authors hope to create a system that will scale up; however, they report no overall evaluation.",
        "An empirical study by [Whittemore et al., 1990] supports the main premise of these proposals: they observe that in naturally-occurring data, lexical preferences (e.g., arrive az, flight to) provide more reliable attachment predictions than structural strategies.",
        "Unfortunately, it seems clear that, outside of restricted domains, hand-encoding of preference rules will not suffice for unconstrained text.",
        "Information gleaned from dictionaries may provide a solution, but the problem of how to weight and combine preferences remains."

        "is swamped by numerous other classifications in which quarter is interpreted as a physical object (coin, animal part), a number (fraction, rational number), a unit of weight (for measuring grain), and so forth.",

        "The conceptual association strategy described here leaves room for a number of improvements.",
        "The use of mutual information as an association measure, and the weighting of the mutual information score in order to bias the computation in favor of large counts, warrant further consideration – mutual information has been criticized for, among other things, its poor behavior given low frequencies, and an alternative measures of association may prove better.",
        "In addition, as noted in the previous section, combining evidence using the paired t-test is problematic, essentially because of word-sense ambiguity.",
        "One alternative might be to perform sense disambiguation in advance – the results of [Yarowsky, 19931 demonstrate that a significant reduction in the number of possible noun classifications is possible using only very limited syntactic context, rather than global word co-occurrence statistics.",
        "Another related alternative would be to select a single best classification – for example, using the measure of selectional association proposed in [Resnik, 1993) – rather than considering all possible classifications.",
        "Another possibility to investigate is the incorporation of structurally-based attachment strategies along with lexical and conceptual association.",
        "Such a fusion of structural and lexical preference strategies is suggested in [Whittemore eta!., 19901, and (Weischedel et aL, 1989)",
        "have found that a structural strategy (closest attach-ment\") performs well in combination with a class-based strategy, although they use a relatively small, domain-specific taxonomy of classes and assume each word has a pointer to a unique class.",
        "Still another direction for future work involves the application of similar techniques to other problems like prepositional phrase attachment for which the resolution of ambiguities would seem to require some form of semantic knowledge.",
        "The problems discussed in [Church and Path, 1982] – including ambiguous prepositional phrase attachment, noun-noun modification, and coordination – would seem to form a natural class of problems to investigate in this manner.",
        "Although there will always be ambiguities that can be resolved only by appeal to complex inferences or highly domain-dependent facts, we believe the combination of domain-independent, knowledge-based resources such as WordNet with corpus-based statistics may provide the semantic power necessary for solving many instances of such problems, without the need for general reasoning about world knowledge."
