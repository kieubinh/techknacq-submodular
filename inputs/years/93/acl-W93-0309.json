        "Collocations in the sense of 'frequently cooccurring words' can quite easily be extracted from corpora by statistic means.",
        "From a linguistic point of view, however, a more restricted use of the term is preferable which takes into account the difference between what Sinclair (196(i) called casual vs. sig,nificant collocations.",
        "Casual word combinations show a normal, free syntaginatic behaviour.",
        "In this paper, collocations shall refer only to word combinations that have a certain affinity to each other in that they follow combinatory restrictions not explainable with syntactic and semantic principles (e.g. hammer a nail into sth.",
        "rather than 'beat a nail into sth.).",
        "For collocations that are based on a verb and a noun (preferably an object argument, sometimes however the subject of an intransitive verb), three types of V-N combinations are distinguished for German in the literature: verbal phrasemes (idioms) (e.g. Brundage et al.",
        "1992), support verb constructions (SVCs) (v.Polenz 1989 or Danlos 1992) and collocations in the narrower sense (Hausmann 1989).",

        "(1992:7) and Barkema (1989:24) point out, the differences between these three types are gradual and \"it is hard to find criteria of good selectivity to distinguish collocations from phrasemes\".",
        "Although our main interest lies in SVCs we will in the following not distinguish between i) SVCs (e.g. to take into consideration), ii) lexicalized combinations with support verbs where the noun has lost its original meaning and which belong to phrasemes (e.g. to take a fancy), and iii) collocational combinations of support verbs with concrete or non-predicative nouns (e.g. to take a seat); we will refer to all these cases as V-N collocations."

        "A substantial cause for this unpredictable difference is the frequency of occurrence and the probability with which the occurrence of one component determines the occurrence of the other' (our translation).",
        "The unpredictability of a collocation is thus partly caused by the high cooccurrence frequency of its components compared to the relative frequency of the single words.",
