        "In the association experiment first used by Calton (1880) subjects are asked to respond to a stimulus word with the first word that comes to their mind.",
        "These associative responses have been explained in psychology by the principle of learning by contiguity: \"Objects once experienced together tend to become associated in the imagination, so that when any one of them is thought of, the others are likely to be thought of also, in the same order of sequence or coexistence as before.",
        "This statement we may name the law of mental association by contiguity.\"",
        "(William James, 1890, p. 561).",
        "When the association experiment is conducted with many subjects, tables are obtained which list the frequencies of particular responses to the stimulus words.",
        "These tables are called association norms.",
        "Many studies in psychology give evidence that there is a relation between the perception, learning and forgetting of verbal material and the associations between words.",
        "If we assume that word-associations determine language production, then it should be possible to estimate the strength of an associative relation between two words on the basis of the relative frequencies that these words co-occur in texts.",
        "Church et al.",
        "(1989), Wettler & Rapp (1989) and Church & Hanks (1990) describe algorithms which do this.",
        "However, the validity of these algorithms has not been tested by systematic comparisons with associations of human subjects.",
        "This paper describes such a comparison and shows that corpus-based computations of word associations are similar to association norms collected from human subjects.",
        "According to the law of association by contiguity, the association strength between two words should be a function of the relative frequency of the two words being perceived together, i.e. the relative frequency of the two words occuring together.",
        "Further more, the association strength between words should determine word selection during language or speech production: Only those words can be uttered or written down which associatively come to mind.",
        "If this assumption holds, then it should be possible to predict word associations from the common occurences of words in texts."

        "If word i occurs in another context, i. e. not in proximity to word j, the association strength between i and j is decreased by a constant fraction:",
        "Under the assumption that the learning rate 81 and the inhibition rate 02 are of identical size, the expected value aid of the association strength aij(t) from i to j for too is equal to the conditional probability of j given i (compare Foppa, 1965):",
        "From these assumptions it could be expected that a stimulus word i leads to those response j, for which the value of equation 3 is at a maximum.",
        "Rapp & Wettler (1991) compared this with other predictions, where additional assumptions on learning and reproduction were taken into account.",
        "With equation 3, mainly words with high corpus frequencies, e. g. function words, were predicted as associative responses.",
        "The predictions were improved when the following formula was used with an exponent of a = 0.66, and the word with the highest rid was considered to be the associative response.",
        "The introduction of the denominator indicates that in the association experiment less frequent words are used than during language production.",
        "This inhibition of frequent words can be explained by the experimental situation, which furthers responses that are specific to the stimulus word.",
        "The exponential function can be interpreted as the tendency that subjective estimations are often found to be exponential functions of the quantities to be estimated."

        "They have the advantage that translations of the stimulus words were also given to German subjects (Russell & Meseck, 1959, and Russell, 1970) so that our model could be tested for English as well as for German.",
        "The Russell & Jenkins association norms, also referred to as the Minnesota word association norms, were collected in 1952.",
        "The 100 stimulus words from the Kent-Rosanoff word association test (Kent & Rosanoff, 1910) were presented to 1008 students of two large introductory psychology classes at the University of Minnesota.",

        "Seven years later, Russell & Meseck (1959) repeated the same experiment in Germany with a carefully translated list of the stimulus words.",
        "The subjects were 331 students and pupils from the area near Wiirzburg.",
        "The quantitative results reported on later will be based on comparisons with these norms.",
        "The American as well as the German association norms were collected more than 30 years ago.",
        "The texts which were used to simulate these associations are more recent.",
        "One might expect therefore that this discrepancy will impair the agreement between the observed and the predicted responses.",
        "Better predictions might be attained if the observed associations had been produced by the same subjects as the texts from which the predictions are computed.",
        "However, such a procedure is hardly realizable, and our results will show that despite these discrepancies associations to common words can be predicted successfully."

        "Examples include man woman, black -.4 white and bitter sweet.",

        "Equivalently, the association strength between word pairs always occuring together in a strict formation (separated by a constant number of other words) could be reduced.",
        "When going from English to German, the parameters ,3 and y in equation 6 needed to be readjusted in such a way, that less frequent words obtained a better chance to be associated.",
        "This reflects the fact, that there is more variation in the associative responses of German than of American subjects, and that American subjects tend to respond with words of higher corpus frequency.",
        "We believe that by considering additional languages this parameter adjustment could be predicted from word-frequency-distribution.",
        "In conclusion, the results show, that free word associations for English and German can be successfully predicted by an almost identical algorithm which is based on the co-occurencefrequencies of words in texts.",
        "Some peculiarities in the associative behavior of the subjects were confirmed in the simulation.",

        "Both arguments need a critical revision.",
        "Recent work with large corpora as well as a large number of connectionist studies have yielded very useful results in different psychological domains, and the high predictive power of the associationist approach makes that the intuitive appeal of cognitivist explanations is fading rapidly."
