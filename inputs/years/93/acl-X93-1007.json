        "This section presents a summary of the TIPSTER results, including some comparative system performance and some conclusions about the success of the detection half of the TIPSTER phase I project.",
        "For more details on the individual experiments, please see the system overviews.",
        "Four contractors were involved in the document detection half of TIPSTER.",
        "Two of the contractors worked in English only (Syracuse University and HNC Inc.), one contractor worked in Japanese only (TRW Systems Development Division), and one contractor worked in both languages (University of Massachusetts at Amherst).",
        "The four contractors had extremely varied approaches to the detection task.",
        "TRW transformed an operational English retrieval system (based on pattern matching using a fast hardware approach), into a Japanese version of the same operation, with a special interface designed to facilitate work in Japanese.",
        "The University of Massachusetts approach involved taking a relatively small experimental system using a probabilistic inference net methodology, scaling it up to handle the very large amounts of text and long topics in TIPSTER, and modifying the algorithms to handle Japanese.",
        "Both Syracuse University and HNC Inc. built completely new systems to handle the English collection.",
        "In the case of Syracuse University, their system is based heavily on a natural language approach to retrieval, with many of the techniques traditionally used in document understanding applied to the retrieval task.",
        "HNC Inc. took a totally different approach, applying statistical techniques based on robust mathematical models (including the use of neural networks).",
        "There were three evaluations of the contractors' work; one at 12 months, one at 18 months, and the final one at 24 months.",
        "In each case, the contractors working in English have made multiple experimental runs using the test collection, and turned in the top list of documents found.",
        "These results were first used to create the sample pool for assessment, and then were scored against the correct answers based on results from all runs (including TREC-1 runs for the 18-month evaluation and TREC-2 runs for the 24-month evaluation).",
        "Standard tables using recall/precision and recall/fallout measures were distributed and compared.",
        "The evaluation of the Japanese work took place only at the 24-month period."

      "text": [
        "The work done for the 12-month evaluation was mainly a scaling effort.",
        "Not all data was available so only partial results were completed.",
        "In particular, the University of Massachusetts turned in 7 runs using the adhoc topics, with experiments trying different parts of the topic to automatically create the query, and also adding phrases.",
        "Additionally they tried some manually edited queries.",
        "HNC Inc. turned in 4 runs using the adhoc topics, with experiments also using different parts of the topic to automatically generate queries.",
        "Additionally they tried various types of \"bootstrapping\" methodologies to generate context vectors.",
        "Syracuse University turned in no runs, but had completed the extensive design work as proposed in their timeline.",
        "The University of Massachusetts also did 4 runs on the routing topics, but the lack of good training data made this very difficult.",
        "In general the results for the systems was good, with the University of Massachusetts outperforming HNC Inc. on the adhoc runs, but it was felt by all that this evaluation represented a very \"baseline\" effort.",
        "For these reasons, no graphs of these results will be presented."

      "text": [
        "By the 18-month mark, the systems had finished much more extensive sets of experiments.",
        "The University of Massachusetts continued to investigate the effects of using different parts of the topic for the adhoc runs, but this time trying different combinations using the inference net methodology.",
        "Figure 1 shows three INQRY runs for the adhoc topics done for the 18-month evaluation.",
        "The plot for INQRYV represents results from queries created automatically using most of the fields of the topics.",
        "The IN-QRYJ results are from the same queries, but including phrases and concept operators.",
        "The INQRYQ results",
        "show the effects of manually editing the INQRYJ queries, with those modifications restricted to eliminating words and phrases, adding additional words and phrases from the narrative field, and inserting paragraph-level operators around words and phrases.",
        "As can be seen, the use of phrases in addition to single terms helped somewhat, but the results from manual modification of the queries were the best adhoc runs.",
        "Figure 1 also shows the two HNC adhoc results for the 18-month evaluation period.",
        "These runs represent final results from many sets of bootstrapping runs in which HNC evolved techniques for completely automatically creating context vectors for the documents.",
        "The plot marked HNC2aV represents the results using these context vectors for retrieval and using automatically built queries from the concepts field of the topic.",
        "The HNC2aM results adds a rough Boolean filter to the process, requiring that three terms in the concepts field match terms in the documents before the context vectors are used for ranking.",
        "This Boolean filter provided considerable improvements.",
        "Figure 2 shows the routing results for the 18-month evaluation.",
        "The three plots for the INQRY system represent a baseline method (INQRYA, same as INQRYJ adhoc approach), and two modifications to this method.",
        "The IN-QRYP results show the effect of manually modifying the query, similar to the method used in producing the INQRYQ adhoc results.",
        "The plot for INQRYR shows the first results from probabilistic query expansion and reweighting performed automatically using relevance feedback techniques on the training data.",
        "Both methods improve results, with the automatic feedback method results approaching the manual-modification method, especially at the high recall area of the curve.",
        "The HNC routing results shown on figure 2 represent the use of two different types of neural networks.",
        "The plot marked HNCrt1 is the baseline result, created by using the adhoc methods similar to those used in run HNC2aV.",
        "The HNCrt2 results represent using neural network techniques to learn improved stem weights for the context vectors based on the training data.",
        "The HNCrt3 results come from using the training data to determine what type of routing query to use, i.e. an automated adhoc query (similar to HNC2aM), a manual query, or a query using the neural network techniques (HNCrt2).",
        "Clearly the neural network learning techniques significantly improve performance, with the per topic \"customization\" performance (HNCrt3) working best.",
        "In terms of system comparison, the University of Massachusetts runs were consistently better than the HNC runs for the adhoc topics, whereas for the routing topics both groups were similar.",
        "The results were a major improvement over their baseline (12-month) results for both groups.",
        "At the 18-month evaluation period, Syracuse University had the first stage of their system in operation and turned in results for the first time.",
        "The results for adhoc and routing are shown in figures 3 and 4.",
        "Since the results are for only a subset of the data used by the other contractors, they cannot be directly compared.",
        "Additionally since the results are only for the first stage of retrieval, which emphasizes high recall, they should not be viewed as the final results from the system.",
        "Figure 3 shows four Syracuse runs on the adhoc topics.",
        "The documents used are the subset of the collection having the Wall Street Journal only.",
        "The first three plots, DRsfcl, DRpnal, and DRtsal, represent three operations in the DR-LINK system.",
        "The first operation does a rough filtering operation on the data, only retrieving documents with suitable subject field codes.",
        "The next two operations locate proper nouns and look at document structure.",
        "There is a considerable improvement in performance between the first two operations.",
        "The fourth run (DRfull) used a manual version of the second stage to produce final results.",
        "These results are for only half the topics, so cannot be strictly compared to the first three runs, but they do indicate the potential improvements to precision that can be expected from the second stage.",
        "Figure 4 shows the same operations, and generally the same improvements, for the routing topics.",
        "In this case the subset of documents used was the AP newswire documents.",

        "Additionally an automatically-built thesaurus was tried.",
        "They also did 15 runs with the routing topics, trying various experiments combining relevance feedback, query combinations, proximity operators and special phrase additions.",

        "Figure 5 shows the recall/precision curves for the adhoc topics.",
        "The three INQRY runs include their baseline method (INQ009), which is same as the baseline method INQRYJ developed at the 18-month evaluation period.",
        "The first modification (INQ012) uses the inference net to \"combine\" weights from the documents and weights from the best-matching paragraphs in the document.",
        "The second modification (INQ015) shows the new term expansion method using an automatically-built thesaurus.",
        "Both modifications show some improvements over the baseline method.",
        "The three HNC runs shown on figure 5 include a baseline (liNCadl) that is similar to their best 18-month adhoc approach (HNC2aM), but that uses a required match of 4 terms rather than 3.",
        "The HNCad3 results show the effects of using a larger context vector of 512 terms rather than only 280 terms for the baseline results.",
        "This causes a slight improvement.",
        "The HNCad2 results are using some manual relevance feedback.",
        "The University of Massachusetts results are better than the HNC results, but there were improvements in both systems over the 18-month evaluation.",
        "Figure 6 shows the recall/fallout curves for the best runs of these two systems.",
        "Both plots show the same differences in performance, but it can be seen on the recall/fallout curve that both systems are retrieving at a very high accuracy.",
        "At a recall of about 60 percent (i.e. about 60 percent of the relevant documents have been retrieved) the precision of the INQRY results is about 30 percent.",
        "The fallout, however, is about 0.0004, meaning that most non-relevant documents are being properly screened out.",
        "This corresponds to a probability of false alarm rate of 0.0004 at this point, in ROC terminology.",
        "Figure 7 shows the routing results for both groups.",
        "The run marked INQ026 is the baseline run of the INQRY system and uses the same methodology as the adhoc INQ009 run.",
        "The other two runs add some type of relevance feedback using the training documents.",
        "The plot marked INQ023 uses both relevance feedback and proximity operators to add 30 terms and 30 pairs of terms from the relevant documents to the query.",
        "The most complex run, INQ030, constructed the queries similarly to run INQ023, but additionally weighted the documents using a combination method similar to adhoc run INQ012.",
        "These runs represented the best results from many different experiments, and the relevance feedback gives significant improvement over the baseline runs.",
        "The HNC routing results also represent the best of many experiments.",
        "The results for HNCrt5 show the neural network learning using stem weighting, similar to HNCrt2 at the 18-month evaluation.",
        "The second two sets of results represent data fusion techiques, with HNCrtl being fusion of four types of retrievals, using the same combinations for all topics, and HNCrt2 using different combinations for different topics.",
        "The data fusion combinations both work well, but the per topic combination works the best, just as the less sophisticated version of this run worked best at the I8-month evaluation.",
        "Again the University of Massachusetts results were better than the HNC results, but with major improvements in both systems over the 18-month evaluation.",
        "Figure 8 shows the recall/fallout curves for the best runs of both groups.",

        "The results of this combination are passed to the second stage (figure 10).",
        "Note that due to processing errors there were documents lost between stages, and these official results are therefore inaccurate.",
        "Additionally only 19 topics (out of 50) are shown in figure 10.",
        "The improvements that could have been expected do not show because of these problems.",

        "The \"cm1L2\" run is the basic SMART system, but using less than optimal term weightings (by mistake).",
        "The \"dortQ2\" results come from using the training data to find parameter weights for various query factors, whereas the \"Brkly3\" results come from performing statistical regression analysis to learn term weighting.",
        "The \"CLARTA\" system adds noun phrases found in an automatically-constructed thesaurus to improve the query terms taken from the topic.",

        "Again three systems are based on the Cornell SMART system.",
        "The plot marked \"crnlCl\" is the actual SMART system, using the basic Rocchio relevance feedback algorithms, and adding many terms (up to 500) from the relevant training documents to the terms in the topic.",
        "The \"dortPl\" results come from using a probabilistically-based relevance feedback instead of the vector-space algorithm.",
        "These two systems have the best routing results.",
        "The \"BrklyS\" system uses statistical regression on the relevant training documents to learn new term weights.",
        "The \"cityr2\" results are based on a traditional probabilistic reweighting from the relevant documents, adding only a small number of new terms (10-25) to the topic.",
        "The \"INQ003\" results also use probabilistic reweighting and add 30 new terms to the topics.",
        "The \"hnc2c\" results are similar to the HNCrt1 fusion results for the 24-month TIPSTER evaluation.",
        "These plots mask important information as they are averages over the 50 adhoc or routing topics.",
        "Whereas often the averages show little difference between systems, these systems are performing quite differently when viewed on a topic by topic basis.",
        "Table 1 shows the \"top 8\" TREC-2 systems for each adhoc topic.",
        "The various system tags illustrate that a wide variety of systems do well on these topics, and that often a system that does not do well on average may perform best for a given topic.",
        "This is an inherent performance characteristic of information retrieval systems, and emphasizes the importance of getting .beyond the averages in doing evaluation.",
        "Clearly systems that perform well on average reflect better overall methodologies, but often much can be learned by analyzing why a given system performs well or poorly on a given topic.",
        "This is where more work is needed with respect to analyzing the TIPSTER and TREC results.",
        "Tables 2, and 3 show some preliminary analysis of two of the topics with respect to the TIPSTER contractors.",
        "Table 2 gives the ranks of the relevant documents retrieved either by the IINCrtl run or the INQ023 run.",
        "Clearly the HNC run is better for this topic, providing much higher ranks for most of the relevant documents.",
        "Note that five of the relevant documents were not retrieved by either system.",
        "Table 3 shows a slightly different view of the same phenomena, but for topic 121.",
        "There were a total of 55 relevant documents for this topic, with only 13 of them found by the TIPSTER systems.",
        "Table 3 lists those 13 documents, the rank at which they were retrieved, and the \"tag\" of the system retrieving them.",
        "Note that for this topic the INQUERY system is performing better than the HNC system.",
        "These tables illustrate the varying performance of different methods across the topics.",
        "A major challenge facing each group is to determine which strategies are successful for most topics, and which strategies are successful only for some topics (including how to identify in advance this topic subset)."

      "text": [
        "What are some of the conclusions that can be drawn from the many experiments performed in the TIPSTER and TREC evaluations, and equally important, what is the lasting value of this two-year project?",
        "First, the statistical techniques (using non-Boolean methods without any formal query language) that were used on the smaller test collections DO scale up.",
        "The simplest example of this is the consistently high performance of the Cornell SMART system in TREC.",
        "This very basic system",
        "relies on the vector-space model and on carefully crafted term weighting to produce their high results.",
        "A more complex example of the successful use of statistical techniques is the University of Massachusetts INQUERY system, which uses the more sophisticated inference network approach to achieve their high performance.",
        "This system has been very successful throughout the TIPSTER project, and has achieved this success using variations on their original system rather than having to completely revise their techniques.",
        "Second, the results obtained by the best systems in TIPSTER and TREC are at a level of performance that is generally accepted to be superior to the best current Boolean retrieval system.",
        "More importantly, this performance is achieved from simple natural language input, allowing consistently superior retrieval performance without exhaustive training or experience.",
        "These systems are clearly ready to be tested in fully operational environments.",
        "Third, the use of a large test collection has shown some unexpected results.",
        "Techniques that should have brought improvements have not done so.",
        "The use of phrases instead of single terms has not resulted in significant improvements; the use of proximity or paragraph-level retrieval has not shown especially good results; and the use of more complex NLP techniques have not worked well yet.",
        "Conversely, techniques that have not been successful before such as using types of automatic thesaurii for topic expansion have had unexpected success.",
        "These unexpected results using a large test collection are reopening research on old discarded ideas and starting research in new areas.",
        "It is much too early to draw firm conclusions on any of these techniques.",
        "Often poor performance that is attributed to one problem may be the result of lack of balance in parameter adjustment, e.g., the lack of improvement from phrases may be caused by the difficulty in balancing the weights of these phrases and the weights of single terms.",
        "What is the lasting value of the document detection half of the TIPSTER phase I project?",
        "The first contribution in my opinion has been the development of a large test collection and the wide acceptance of its use via the TREC conferences.",
        "The lack of a large test collection has been a major barrier in the field of information retrieval and its removal allows an expansion of research by many groups worldwide.",
        "The second lasting value is the demonstration of the feasibility of using the non-Boolean, statistically-based retrieval systems both in the ARPA community and in the broader commercial sector.",
        "Not only have well-established small-scale research groups braved the scaling effort, but at least four new commercial products have used the TIPSTER/TREC program as launching pads.",
        "The TIPSTER program has caused the establishment of two major new retrieval research groups; both Syracuse University and HNC Inc. have built systems during the TIPSTER project that are approaching the power of the best of the TIPSTER/TREC systems.",
        "Additionally many of the TREC systems are either new groups in the information retrieval research arena or are older groups expanding their small programs to tackle this major retrieval experiment.",
        "The final lasting value of the TIPSTER project has been the joining of the NLP community and the information retrieval (IR) community in the project.",
        "This has led to the high expections for combining these disjoint technologies in phase II and has helped cement the important collaboration of two diverse groups of researchers.",
        "These three lasting contributions are not only of value individually, but will lead to a resurgence of research in the information retrieval area.",
        "The combination of the large test collection, the growing demand for improved retrieval products, and the increased collaboration between the NLP and IR communities will result in new techniques that will finally achieve the breakthrough in performance that is TIPSTER's goal."
