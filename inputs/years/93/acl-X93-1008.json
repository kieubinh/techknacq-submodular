        "The TIPSTER project in the Information Retrieval Laboratory of the Computer Science Department, University of Massachusetts, Amherst (which includes MCC as a subcontractor), has focused on the following goals:",
        "• Improving the effectiveness of information retrieval techniques for large, full-text databases, • Improving the effectiveness of routing techniques appropriate for long-term information needs, and • Demonstrating the effectiveness of these retrieval and routing techniques for Japanese full text databases [5].",
        "Our general approach to achieving these goals has been to use improved representations of text and information needs in the framework of a new model of retrieval.",
        "This model uses Bayesian networks to describe how text and queries should be used to identify relevant documents [7, 4, 8].",
        "Retrieval (and routing) is viewed as a probabilistic inference process which compares text representations based on different forms of linguistic and statistical evidence to representations of information needs based on similar evidence from natural language queries and user interaction.",
        "Learning techniques are used to modify the initial queries both for short-term and long-term information needs (relevance feedback and routing, respectively).",
        "This approach (generally known as the inference net model and implemented in the INQUERY system [1]) emphasizes retrieval based on combination of evidence.",
        "Different text representations (such as words, phrases, paragraphs, or manually assigned keywords) and different versions of the query (such as natural language and Boolean) can be combined in a consistent probabilistic framework.",
        "This type of \"data fusion\" has been known to be effective in the information retrieval context for a number of years, and was one of the primary motivations for developing the inference net approach.",
        "Another feature of the inference net approach is the ability to capture complex structure in the network representing the information need (i.e. the query).",
        "A practical consequence of this is that complex Boolean queries can be evaluated as easily as natural language queries and produce ranked output.",
        "It is also possible to represent \"rule-based\" or \"concept-based\" queries in the same probabilistic framework.",
        "This has led to us concentrating on automatic analysis of queries and techniques for enhancing queries rather than on in-depth analysis of the documents in the database.",
        "In general, it is more effective (as well as efficient) to analyze short query texts than millions of document texts.",
        "The results of the query analysis are represented in the INQUERY query language which contains a number of operators, such as #SUM, #AND, #0R, #NOT, #PHRASE, and #SYN.",
        "These operators implement different methods of combining evidence.",
        "Some of the specific research issues we are addressing are morphological analysis in English and Japanese, word sense disambiguation in English, the use of phrases and other syntactic structure in English and Japanese, the use of feature recognizers (for example, company, country and people name recognizers) in representing documents and queries, analyzing natural language queries to build structured representations of information needs, learning techniques appropriate for routing and structured queries, techniques for acquiring domain knowledge by corpus analysis, and probability estimation techniques for indexing.",
        "The TIPSTER and TREC evaluations have made it clear that a lot remains to be learned about retrieval and routing in large, full-text databases based on complex information needs.",
        "On the other hand, we have made considerable progress in developing effective techniques for this environment, and the evaluations have shown that good levels of performance can be achieved."

        "The main processes in INQUERY are document indexing, query processing, query evaluation and relevance",
        "feedback.",
        "We will give a brief description of these processes.",
        "In the document indexing process, documents are parsed and index terms representing the content of documents are identified.",
        "INQUERY supports a variety of indexing techniques including simple word-based indexing, indexing based on part-of-speech tagging and phrase identification, and indexing by domain-dependent features such as company names, dates, locations, etc.",
        "The last type of indexing is a first step towards integrating detection and extraction systems.",
        "In more detail, the document structure is used to identify which parts will be used for indexing.",
        "The first step of this process is to scan for word tokens.",
        "Most types of words (including numbers) are indexed, although a stopword list is used to remove very common words.",
        "Stopwords can be indexed, however, if they are capitalized (but not at the start of sentences) or joined with other words (e.g. \"the The-1 system\").",
        "Words are then stemmed to conflate variants.",
        "We have developed a new stemming algorithm that has a number of advantages for operational systems.",
        "A number of feature recognizers written with the UNIX utility flex are then used to identify objects such as company names and mark their presence in the document using \"meta\" index terms.",
        "A company name such as IBM in the text, for example, will result in a meta-term *COMPANY being recorded at that position in the text.",
        "The use of these meta-terms extends the range of queries that can be specified.",
        "This completes the usual processing for document text.",
        "The document indexing process also involves building the compressed inverted files that are necessary for efficient performance with very large databases.",
        "Since positional information is stored, overhead rates are typically about 40% of the original database size.",
        "Query processing involves a series of steps to identify the important concepts and structure describing a user's information need.",
        "INQUERY is unique in that it can represent and use complex structured descriptions in a probabilistic framework.",
        "Many of the steps in query processing are the same as those done in document indexing.",
        "In addition, a part-of-speech tagger is to used to identify candidate search phrases.",
        "Domain-dependent features are recognized and meta-terms inserted into the query representation.",
        "The relative importance of query concepts is also estimated, and relationships between concepts are suggested based on simple grammar rules.",
        "An evaluation of some of the query processing techniques is presented in [2].",
        "INQUERY is also capable of expanding the query using relationships between concepts found by either using manually specified domain knowledge in the form of a simple thesaurus or by corpus analysis.",
        "The WORDFINDER system is a version of INQUERY that retrieves concepts that are related to the query.",
        "WORDFINDER is constructed by identifying noun groups in the text and representing them by the words that are closely associated with them (i.e. occur in the same text windows).",
        "Concept \"documents\" are then stored in INQUERY.",
        "This technique has shown considerable promise in retrieval experiments.",
        "The query evaluation process uses the inverted files and the query represented as an inference net to produce a document ranking.",
        "The evaluation involves probabilistic inference based on the operators defined in the INQUERY language.",
        "These operators define new concepts and how to calculate the belief in those concepts using linguistic and statistical evidence.",
        "We are constantly experimenting with and refining these operators (for example, the operator defining a phrase-based concept) in order to improve retrieval performance.",
        "The efficiency of retrieval is comparable to commercial information retrieval systems.",
        "The relevance feedback process uses information from user evaluations of retrieved documents to modify the original query in ad-hoc retrieval or routing environments.",
        "The INQUERY system, because it can represent structured queries, supports a wide range of learning techniques for query modification [6].",
        "In general, new words and phrases are identified in the sample of relevant documents.",
        "These are added to the original query and all the terms in the query are then reweighted.",
        "With the amount of relevance information available in TIPSTER, relatively simple automatic techniques appear to produce good levels of effectiveness.",
        "We are also investigating the effect of using more limited information and more complex learning techniques, such as neural networks.",
        "The Japanese version of INQUERY only differs from the English version in the low-level language processing and some aspects of the interface.",
        "We have carried out experiments using both character and word-based representations of documents in combination with word-based processing of queries that are represented using the INQUERY language.",
        "These experiments have shown that character-based representations, which are efficient to produce, are surprisingly effective."

        "Document will describe marketing strategies carried out by U.S. companies for their agricultural chemicals, report predictions for market share of such chemicals, or report market statistics for the chemicals.",
        "pesticide, herbicide, fungicide, insecticide, fertilizer, predicted sales, market share, stimulate demand, price cut, volume of sales",
        "• document indexing, • WORDFINDER, • query processing, • query evaluation, • relevance feedback, and routing.",
        "Each subsystem is described in more detail below.",
        "Document Indexing: The text-processing modules for document indexing are frequently described as document parsers or document parsers and feature recognizers.",
        "The purpose of all document parsing modules is to generate transactions whereby words, or terms, and their locations are stored in the document indexes.",
        "The phases of document parsing and term recognition are (1) layout analysis, (2) lexical analysis, (3) syntactic analysis, and (4) concept identification.",
        "Each of these phases may generate multiple transactions for each document, each transaction recording term, document and the locations in the document where term is found.",
        "INQUERY has a set of default text processing modules.",
        "We will discuss the default module behavior, but these modules can be easily replaced if some behavior other than the default is desired.",
        "The minimal document layout analysis must identify the beginnings and end of documents, and the beginning and end of each text segment.",
        "Text is distinguished from formatting information, cataloguing information or any information to be excluded for retrieval purposes.",

        "ally, title, document identification code and other special fields may be identified, and a document layout format may be enforced.",
        "The default parser relies on a subset of Standardized General Mark-up Language (SGML), but any layout analysis module may be substituted in order to recognize whatever document style is required.",
        "The only requirements are that the layout analysis module indicate to the indexing system when to begin and end indexing for that document, and which section(s) to treat as text to be indexed.",
        "The function of a lexical analysis module is to identify and record word boundaries, recognize stopwords and stem the words as desired, and generate transactions so the words will be indexed for retrieval.",
        "In theory, every word in the document collection will be indexed.",
        "In practice, it is helpful to identify very common words, such as operators or closed-class words, which do not carry any meaningful information for retrieval purposes (although they may offer significant information for text or content extraction).",
        "These stopwords are not indexed, although they are retained in the text so that subsequent textual analysis (syntactic analysis, feature recognition) may make use of them.",
        "Stemming is performed to conflate words that have the same root form or stem, in spite of different endings (Figures 1 and 2).",
        "The current version of INQUERY uses the Porter stemmer.",
        "A new stemmer, which is more sensitive to the true morphological word stems, has been developed (Figure 3).",
        "The KSTEM stemmer has certain advantages over the Porter stemmer.",
        "The Porter stemmer produces strings that are not necessarily English words.",
        "Because the stemmed representation is sometimes unintelligible, it is difficult to get feedback from a human user by presenting a processed query for modification.",
        "In addition, the Porter stemmer sometimes conflates words that are related by only spelling.",
        "Thus the phrases \"a conflict over foreign policy\" and \"a conflict between foreigners and the police\" would produce the same query network with the Porter stemmer.",

        "WORDFINDER: WORDFINDER is a process, analagous to document indexing, in which simple noun groups are indexed by the words that occur near them in the document text.",
        "The result of this indexing process is a database in which one or more words can be used to retrieve simple noun groups.",
        "This database can be used for query expansion, as a method of adding concepts that are related to a set of query terms.",
        "WORDFINDER is based on the assumption that concepts that have a similar lexical context may be related semantically.",
        "For example, the words \"connectionism\" and \"neural networks\" occur in similar lexical contexts, but rarely in the same documents.",
        "The semantic relationship captured is not necessarily synonymy, because WORDFINDER also might relate \"connectionism\" and \"back propagation\", which co-occur but have different meanings.",
        "The major steps in constructing a WORDFINDER database are:",
        "1.",
        "Extract simple sequences of nouns, using part of speech tagging (e.g. [3]).",
        "2.",
        "For each noun sequence, collect the significant words that occur in any document within a window of n words containing the sequence.",
        "The words collected form a feature vector representing the lexical context of the sequence.",
        "3.",
        "Queries are expanded by adding noun groups that are close in feature space to the words in the original query (see Figures 6 and 7).",
        "In Figures 6 and 7 the floating point numbers to the left of each query expansion term are belief values.",
        "The absolute magnitude of a belief value is not meaningful.",

        "It is the result of the complex process of query evaluation combining term weights, document and collection frequencies and query network structure.",
        "Within in the same query expansion set, however, the relative magnitude of belief values is significant.",
        "Further research will determine if a weighting scheme for expansion terms can be developed based on the belief values.",
        "There is an advantage to using WORDFINDER for automatic query expansion.",
        "Since the query expansion concepts are derived from the text of the collection itself, WORDFINDER automatically creates collection-specific concept links.",
        "Further research will compare the value of generic WORDFINDER databases to collection-specific ones.",
        "WORDFINDER is sensitive to several parameters, including the size of the window, decisions about what words to include in the window, and whether low and/or high frequency noun groups are removed from the database.",
        "Experiments have shown that getting these parameters right is important to the effectiveness of the concepts returned.",
        "The current implementation of WORDFINDER shows promise on the TIPSTER data, but further work is necessary to build a WORDFINDER that would be effective on a variety of document collections.",
        "Query Processing: Queries can be made to INQUERY by using either natural language or a structured query language or a mixture of the two.",
        "Natural language queries are interpreted by text processing modules which ensure that the handling of lexical analysis and concept recognition match that of the indexing subsystem.",
        "The resulting modified queries are converted to the structured query language by applying the #SUM operator to the terms in the query.",
        "Equations 1-6 (below, in the discussion of the Retrieval engine) describe #SUM and the other operators in INQUERY's structured query language.",
        "Query operators permit the text-processing system or the user interface to supply structural information with the query, including phrase grouping or proximity requirements.",
        "Query text is generally converted to lower case and checked for stopwords and stemmed, if necessary, to produce canonical word forms.",
        "Query text processing must minimally mirror the indexing text processing.",
        "But because query texts are much shorter than document collections, it is practical to experiment with more thorough textual analysis at the research and development stage.",
        "All text processing is experimental and the sequence of operations is adjusted frequently as more is learned about the effects of this processing.",
        "Text processing methods which prove successful with queries can then be integrated into the indexing process.",
        "This reduces the need to repeatedly index large document collections in order to make small experimental adjustments.",
        "For this reason, much TIPSTER query processing is performed as preprocessing rather than in the body of the INQUERY program.",
        "Preprocessing stages are made up of sed, awk, flex (or lex) scripts and C code.",
        "Query text processing that has been integrated into INQUERY is made up of flex feature analyzers.",
        "Currently INQUERY has a small number of internal query text processors.",
        "One handles hyphenated words and groups of capitalized words by enclosing them in these proximity operators.",
        "Orthographic clues such as hyphenation and capitalization, when reliable, are very good clues to phrasal grouping.",
        "Hyphens are generally discarded during indexing so that an expression such as Iran-Contra or voice-activated become Iran Contra and voice activated, respectively.",
        "In query processing, the symmetrical procedure is to remove the hyphen and to phrase the words as #1( Iran Contra ) or #1( voice activated ), requiring that the two words be found adjacent in a document for the query operator to be satisfied.",
        "Groups of capitalized words are similarly phrased so that the phrase House of Representatives in a query is transformed to #3( House Representatives ).",

        "Another of INQUERY's query text processors removes phrases that discuss the retrieval process rather than the desired material, such as \"customer reports that...\" or \"A relevant document must contain...\".",
        "This behavior is domain dependent, so the program's rules should be modified or augmented for different types of use.",
        "What follows is a description of the text preprocessing modules that have been used for TIPSTER queries.",
        "The order of their use is not fixed, but it can be significant.",
        "For example, it was found useful to phrase a hyphenated compound such as wordl-word2 as #1 ( wordi word2 ) and to phrase a group of capitalized words as #3 ( words word2 ...).",
        "We have experimented with removing names of countries and some capitalized expressions from medium-sized phrases (e.g.,",
        "Obviously, it makes a difference whether you process hyphenated and capitalized words before or after you generate the larger #PHRASE.",
        "The input and output description for a processor or preprocessor is the same: query text.",
        "There are no restrictions.",
        "However, text which is tagged with part of speech tags contains more information and more \"noise\".",
        "So, for each query text preprocessor, there are two versions, one which operates on tagged text and one for untagged text.",
        "There are two main kinds of query styles: a natural language query and a keyword or key concept query.",
        "For example, the <desc> and <narr> fields of a TIPSTER topic (see Figure 8) represent natural language queries of varying levels of abstraction.",
        "The <con>, <title> and <fac> fields represent key concepts in the query.",
        "The main difference between the two types of processing is that the key concept query has more controlled information.",
        "The phrasing and emphasis are already given and do not have to be conjectured from the language structure.",
        "It is valuable to discover how to treat both styles of query, because a good user interface will make it easy for a user to input both styles.",
        "For example, a user may enter a prose query and then highlight the important words and phrases in the query in some convenient manner.",
        "These highlighted words would then be treated as key concepts in the query processing.",
        "Natural language query fields are tagged for syntactic category by a part-of-speech (POS) tagger.",
        "Currently we use the tagger developed by Ken Church [3].",
        "This tagger is proprietary software and not available with INQUERY.",
        "We have developed our own POS tagger, which we are beginning to use now.",
        "Additionally, we change operator phrases to single words in order to simplify later processing.",
        "An example of this simplification is replacing the phrase in, order to with the infinitive particle to or replacing with respect to with the word regarding.",
        "The goal of this replacement is to remove phrases which resemble noun phrases syntactically but which are really syntactic operators (e.g., phrasal prepositions) with no substantive content.",
        "When the text is tagged and the potentially irrelevant material has been removed, syntactically-based noun group capture is performed.",
        "Certain kinds of noun phrase patterns are enfolded in a #PHRASE operator (Figure 9):",
        "1.",
        "A noun phrase which contains more than one modifying adjective and noun is enclosed in a #PHRASE operator;",
        "2.",
        "A head noun with no premodifiers and followed by a prepositional phrase is enclosed in a #PHRASE operator with the head noun of the prepositional phrase; All text in the query is searched for constraint expressions.",
        "Among these expressions are the words company, not U. S. or a restriction in the nationality section of the <fac> field to U.S. or other nationality.",
        "A restriction to U.S. nationality as the area of interest is implemented by penalizing documents for references to foreign countries.",
        "A restriction to other nationalities is implemented by repeating that country as a term.",
        "This asymmetry depends on the fact that the document collection is drawn solely from U.S. sources, and therefore the U.S., as the default area of interest, is rarely referred to unless a government body or foreign policy implementation is under discussion (Figure 9).",
        "There is some recognition of simple time expressions, such as since 1984 which are expanded to the set of years which might be intended by the phrase in question.",
        "Countries are recognized as such and are handled so that expressions like South Africa are phrased as #1( south africa ) even when they appear in the middle of a larger group of capitalized words.",
        "In addition, proper names such as country names are moved out of the scope of #PHRASE operators, since it generally increases the effectiveness of a *PHRASE to reduce the number of words in it.",
        "Nationality constraints can better be maintained within the scope of the larger and more tolerant #SUM operator.",
        "For example the phrase \"import ban on South African diamonds\"",
        "and finally #SUM (#SYN (#1(south african) #1(south africa)) #PHRASE(import ban on diamonds)).",
        "Key concept query processing is different from prose query processing since the concept separation provided by the user can presumably be trusted.",
        "Instead of using a part-of-speech tagger, we rely on comma delimitation of concepts, and #PHRASE the words found between each pair of delimiters (Figure 9: Terms from <con> field).",
        "Additionally, if any constraints were found anywhere else in the query, e.g., a mention of the word company or an exclusionary geographical constraint (e.g., not USA or only USA), the query will be modified according to these constraints.",
        "For example (Figure 9), only USA #NOT (#FOREIGNCOUNTRY ) and not USA #NOT ( #USA ).",
        "If the word company is found in a query, then a second copy of the key concepts (the <con> field), is produced where each item in the field appears in an unordered window operator with the feature #COMPANY.",
        "For example, if the word South Africa appears as a key concept (and company appears somewhere in the query), then the preprocessor would produce the term #UW50( #COMPANY #1( south africa)) which would match any document",
        "which had a company name within fifty words of South Africa.",
        "We have experimented with manual modification of processed queries in order to measure the feasibility and effectiveness of simple user adjustments to automatic query processing output.",
        "We have explored simple modifications such as adding a term from the Narrative field, deleting a term, and constraining existing terms to appear near each other in a document (Figure 10).",
        "This has proved to be generally effective in increasing the quality of retrieval results.",
        "Retrieval Engine: Once a query net is formed, the retrieval subsystem can rank documents according to the belief that they are relevant to the query.",
        "INQUERY's methods of combining evidence are summarized below, and are documented more fully in [9].",
        "Node belief scores are calculated as a combination of term frequency (tf) and inverse document frequency (idf) weights.",
        "The values are normalized to remain between 0 and 1, and are further modified by tf and belief default values which the user may define at program invocation.",
        "Calculation of a belief for a given query operator is dependent on the type of operator and the number and belief in its arguments as presented in Equations 1-6.",
        "Relevance Feedback and Routing: The INQUERY system is able to refine queries automatically based upon relevance feedback by a user.",
        "The general approach is for the system to select terms from relevant documents, add them to the query, and then reweight all of the query terms [6].",
        "Experiments have been conducted with a variety of algorithms for term selection and weighting.",
        "Early experiments [6] showed that ranking terms by the product of their frequency in relevant documents (rdf) and their inverse document frequency (idf) was best on small and medium-sized collections with relatively small numbers of relevance judgements.",
        "The number of terms added was set empirically at 5.",
        "Term weights were determined by their frequency in relevant documents (rt f).",
        "The INQUERY system still uses this model for interactive relevance feedback, where the number of relevance judgements per query is generally low (e.g. < 15).",
        "Our approach to the routing portion of our TIPSTER work was based initially upon our existing relevance feedback mechanisms.",
        "Routing profiles were constructed by a two step process.",

        "In general, these improvements are consistently better than 10%, but in the case where WORDFINDER is included, there is nearly a 30% improvement.",
        "Table 8 shows that even small changes can still produce improvements.",
        "We have in general resisted tuning INQUERY to the TIPSTER collection.",
        "We have, however, had to change the probability estimation formulae considerably to produce good results for a large, heterogeneous database.",
        "The improvement in Table 8 is the result of running experiments on the earlier parts of TIPSTER, and more improvements of this kind can be expected.",
        "Tables 9 and 10 give the results of experiments on a small Japanese database using 27 of our own queries and relevance judgements.",
        "The results compare word-based and character-based indexing with different forms of query processing.",
        "The results show that word-based indexing performs well at low recall levels, but that averaged over all recall levels, it is significantly lower.",
        "The best performance has been obtained using a combination of both representations (this result is not shown here).",

        "• IR techniques, which are primarily based on words and statistics, produced very good results when scaled up for the TIPSTER database and topics.",
        "• For ad-hoc queries, automatic processing produces very good results.",
        "Manual modification can result in significant benefits, but topics 101-150 were different in that respect.",
        "• Paragraph-based retrieval can help performance, but only when used in combination with document-based results.",
        "• Automatic query expansion techniques produced encouraging results, but more work is needed to refine the techniques and understand the size of training set needed.",
        "• Automatic relevance feedback produces very good results for routing when there are large numbers of relevance judgements available.",
        "Manual queries are not competitive, but can help in combination.",
        "• Combining document representations and queries, for which INQUERY was designed, can result in very significant performance improvements.",
        "This was also shown to be true for Japanese.",
        "• INQUERY has been shown to be an effective, flexi- References ble and efficient retrieval and routing engine.",
