      "text": [
        "As part of the Tipster program, TRW has built an interface to the TRW Fast Data Finder (FDF) to search native Japanese scripts.",
        "The program is called the Japanese Fast Data Finder (JFDF).",
        "This effort involved working out the issues of converting and loading Japanese text into the FDFs file-system, adapting the FDF to properly search 16-bit characters, developing an X-windows application program to work in Japanese, and researching query formulation techniques that will provide good precision and recall against Japanese texts.",
        "We aimed our design toward providing special query generation support for non-native Japanese speakers.",
        "We developed an algorithm to convert English proper nouns or terms to multiple possible Katakana representations.",
        "We setup the user interface to provide easy access to lists of predefined subqueries and to an English to Japanese thesaurus.",
        "While the prototype was implemented to work with Japanese, we believe the JFDF could easily be extended to work with other languages such as Chinese and Korean.",
        "Data loaded for searching can be converted from multiple representations to a common Unicode representation if desired.",
        "Using Unicode allows a single database to contain documents in multiple languages.",
        "Query terms entered in Japanese could match against equivalent characters in Chinese or Korean documents.",
        "The basic query formulation paradigm is extended boolean search.",
        "The user is provided with an expandable boolean form in which to enter query terms.",
        "Kana terms are entered by selecting the appropriate entry mode and typing Romaji.",
        "Kanji terms are entered by first entering the Hiragana and then asking for a menu of choices.",
        "Terms from the browser window may be copied and pasted into the query window to help refine a query.",
        "The user may select from a menu of choices to require query terms to be within a specified proximity window.",
        "A full set of features to browse, save, recall, print, and manipulate the results of searches are provided.",
        "There are also features to select the databases to search and to create and load new databases.",
        "Each screen has a help button which brings up a description of the available functions.",
        "Since there are a number of different encoding schemes used for Japanese, the program currently runs using either Extended Unix Coding (EUC) or Unicode.",
        "Routines are provided to convert from one to another so that all documents in the database are represented in a common encoding format.",
        "It is easier to convert data once at load time than to convert (and search) each user query in multiple data representations."

      "heading": "Query Generation Features for the Non-Native Speaker",
      "text": [
        "One of our primary considerations during the design of the JFDF was to make it easy to operate for the non-native Japanese speakers, which we believe make up the bulk of our prospective government users.",
        "We implemented three special features to aid query generation.",
        "First, the JFDF includes a 28,000 entry English to Japanese thesaurus which can be used to help select appropriate terms for the search.",
        "The user types the term in English and receives a menu of possible Japanese terms and their English meanings.",
        "The user may select any combination of terms which are then included by reference in the query.",
        "The thesaurus is in a simple format that may be easily extended at customer sites.",
        "Second, the user may select from a menu of predefined subqueries.",
        "These subqueries are typically setup by the system administrator or an advanced user.",
        "They may them",
        "selves include any valid FDF query expression including proximity, nested boolean logic, or error tolerance.",
        "By selecting the subquery 'Sony', the user could include in his top level query a number of different ways to reference Sony Corporation and its products.",
        "Third, we implemented an English to Japanese transliteration scheme for proper nouns.",
        "This was a major undertaking.",
        "While the Japanese \"spellings\" for common foreign loan words or Western public figures tend to become quickly standardized (and thus could be included in the thesaurus), company names, new product names, and non-public figures are not likely to be represented in consistent Katakana across sources.",
        "Particular difficulties arise when the foreign words contain sounds or patterns of sounds (i.e. two consonants in a row) not used in Japanese.",
        "In these cases there are a number of different ways the foreign proper noun might be expressed in Katakana.",
        "Our transliteration algorithm maps an English word to its most likely Katakana possibilities.",
        "The basic idea is to break the word apart phonetically and then substitute as many of the possible ways the sounds might be heard by a Japanese speaking person as alternatives.",
        "Figure 1 shows three simple examplesl.",
        "We believe that this style of transliteration, with the FDF hardware available to execute the resultant expressions easily, is one of the JFDF's most effective and novel features.",
        "We reviewed the performance of this algorithm on a sample list of 150 English last names and tallied that the program was picking up the academically correct variation 80-90% of the time.",
        "Designing the retrieval system around the Fast Data Finder is desirable for two reasons.",
        "First, the FDF can cost effectively evaluate complex query patterns required to achieve high recall and precision.",
        "In searching for Western proper nouns for example, we made heavy use of the FDFs ability to scan complex phonetically equivalent alternative Katakana representations of each word.",
        "Second, since the FDF can process data with no word segmentation, data preprocessing, or index construction, it is ideal for real-time dissemination systems.",
        "Thousands of detailed user profiles can be evaluated against large batches of documents within minutes of their arrival.",
        "1* The notation \"a (b I c 1 d\" means an \"a\" followed by a \"b\" or \"c\" followed by a \"d\".",
        "Thus the user entered term of 'Reagan' will match on any of 1.1151., or 1).--iY-1,/ or L-7-y_i or 1./--i)1_,"
