        "Three TIPSTER contractors -- BBN, GE/CMU, NMSU/Brandeis participated in the August '93 MUC-5 evaluation for both the English joint venture (EJV) and English microelectronics (EME) domains and their Japanese-language counterparts, the JJV and JME applications.",
        "Two other contractors -- SRI and SRA -- participated in the EJV and JJV domains alone.",

        "Of the five systems that tested in both English and Japanese, all but one scored higher in the Japanese-language applications according to both the summary error-based scores and recall/precision-based metrics.",
        "This overall result has lead some participants and observers to suggest that Japanese is an \"easier\" language than English.",
        "Japanese-language usage in the total 1297-article JJV corpus exhibits the same degree of ellipsis-generated vagueness and ambiguity as in other domains and genres of Japanese writing.",
        "On the other hand, however, in matters of information presentation JJV articles are very formulistic.",
        "This paper argues that the stereotypical structure of the topic sentence in the JJV corpus together with the \"default\" pattern of certain template fills gives the Japanese systems a ready basis for extracting information and inserting it into a template.",

        "The argument outlined in this paper is based upon a discourse analysis of two portions of the entire 1297- article JJV corpus: the 150-article JJV test set and 100 randomly selected development-set articles.",
        "In addition, a descriptive analysis was performed on approximately 50 JJV test articles and corresponding template results for varying combinations of the six systems that participated in MUC-5; all six systems, however, were analyzed on a subset of 12 selected articles, or a total of 72 individual template results.",
        "The entire descriptive examination is motivated by a desire to understand better the various systems' capabilities in order to make the numerical results more tangible to potential users.",
        "The assumption is that one can construct a composite performance-based description for each system derived from the analysis of individual templates, and that the resulting snapshot -- what the system actually does -- will be more comprehensible to users than the theoretical model of a system outlined in a technical summary -- what it should do.",
        "Although the discourse analysis has not yielded a full-blown discourse structure for the JJV corpus, the most essential element of the evolving top-down paradigm, the topic sentence, is identified.",
        "Any attempt to formulate a complete discourse paradigm for JJV must first deal with this sentence.",
        "It contains much information significant in its own right and more to the point for data extraction -- relevant to template insertion.",
        "In fact, most of the time the topic sentence contains all the minimally required data for instantiating and tracking a tie-up relationship.",
        "This paper first examines the stereotypical nature of this topic sentence -- hereafter referred to as an article's \"Impact Line\" -- before moving onto a discussion of the \"default\" mechanism.",
        "The Impact Line prototype operating in conjunction with the instantiation of certain high-percentage slot fills (\"defaults\") provides a proficient extraction heuristic and corresponding salubrious quantitative effect upon system performance."

        "This paper has shown that JJV articles possess a stereotypical pattern of introducing much significant information amenable to the data extraction task.",

        "Impact Line prototype.",
        "Furthermore, the \"mining\" of the Impact Line to a minimal degree by extracting the topic marker-designated ENTITY is, one could say, a little that goes a long way.",
        "This is due in large part to that ENTITY's strategic place in the template and the way in which default fills associated with it are propagated throughout the template.",
        "Hence, higher scores result for JJV than EJV.",
        "A system, such as System 3 above, that takes full advantage of the Impact Line prototype and the plethora of information available therein can maximize its capability and show a quantum leap in statistical performance.",
        "Obviously, the formulation of a complete JJV discourse structure would raise performance to another level.",
        "Discourse analysis alone, however, will not resolve all the problems endemic to Japanese, such as ellipsis.",
        "If the formulistic nature of Japanese discourse in the JJV domain is a boon to data extraction, then its penchant for omitting sentence topics altogether is a potential minefield.",
        "Discrete data items that have been easily identified at the outset need to be correctly referenced to other activities that follow or the resulting template fills will paint.",
        "a totally misleading picture as to who is doing what to whom.",
        "This paper has discussed a heuristic for topic-marker substitution that might help in this regard, but it is only a small part of the equation for making Japanese more explicit."
