        "In evaluating the state of technology for extracting information from natural language text by machine, it is valuable to compare the performance of machine extraction systems with that achieved by humans performing the same task.",
        "The purpose of this paper is to present some results from a comparative study of human and machine performance for one of the information extraction tasks used in the Tipster/ MUC-5 evaluation that can help assess the maturity and applicability of the technology.",
        "The Tipster program, through the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) and several collaborating U.S. government agencies, produced a corpus of filled \"templates\" â€“ structured information extracted from text.",
        "This corpus was used both in the development of machine extraction systems by contractors and in the evaluation of the developed systems.",
        "Production of templates was performed by human analysts extracting the data from the text and structuring it, using a set of structuring rules for \"filling\" the templates and computer software that made it easier for analysts to organize information.",
        "Because of this rather extensive effort by analysts to create these templates, it was possible to study the performance of humans for this task in some detail and to develop methods for comparing this performance with that of machines participating in the Tipster/MUC-5 evaluation.",
        "The texts that the templates were filled from were newspaper and technical magazine articles concerned either with joint business ventures or microelectronics fabrication technology.",
        "Each topic domain used text in two languages, English and Japanese.",
        "This paper discusses preparation of templates and presents detailed results for human and machine performance; a shorter paper [1] discusses preparation of templates and basic results.",
        "The primary motivation for this study was to provide reliable data that would allow machine extraction performance to be compared with that of humans.",
        "The MUC and Tipster programs have included extensive efforts to develop measurements that can objectively evaluate the performance of the different machine systems.",
        "However, although these measures are capable of reliably discriminating between the performance of different machine systems, they are not very useful by themselves in evaluating how near the technology is to providing reliable performance and the extent to which it is ready to be used in applications.",
        "Sundheim [2] initiated human performance study for extraction by providing estimates of human performance for the task used in the MUC4 evaluation; the present study provides human data for the Tipster/MUC-5 evaluation that was produced under relatively controlled conditions and with methods and statistical measures that assess the reliability of the data.",
        "A second motivation for the study was for its value in helping produce better quality templates so as to allow high-quality system development and reliable evaluation.",
        "The quality and consistency of the templates being produced were monitored as analysts were trained and gained experience, and particular efforts were made to identify the causes of errors and inconsistency so as to develop strategies for reducing error and increasing consistency.",
        "A third motivation for studying human performance was to better understand the nature of the extraction task and the relative performance of humans compared with machines on different aspects of the task.",
        "Such an understanding can particularly help in the construction of human-machine integrated systems that are designed to make the best use of",
        "what are at the present time rather different abilities of humans and machines [3].",
        "This paper is organized as follows: The paper begins with a discussion of how the templates were prepared, with particular emphasis on the strategies that were used that served to minimize errors and maximize consistency, including detailed fill rules, having more than one analyst code a given template, and the use of software tools with error detection capabilities.",
        "The paper next describes the results of an investigation into the extent to which template codings made by analysts that are playing different roles in the production of a particular template influence the resulting key, which provides clues to the effectiveness of the quality control strategies used in the template preparation process.",
        "The results of an experimental test of different methods of scoring human performance are then presented, with the goal of selecting a method that is statistically reliable, minimizes bias, and has other desirable characteristics.",
        "Data that indicates overall levels of human performance on the task, variability among analysts, and reliability of the data are then presented.",
        "The results of an investigation into the development of analyst skill are then presented, with the significant question being the need to understand whether the performance levels being measured truly reflect analysts who have a high level of skill.",
        "The performance of humans for information extraction is then compared with that of machine systems, in terms of both errors and metrics that attempt to separate out two different aspects of performance, recall and precision.",
        "The results of a study comparing the effect of key preparation on the evaluation of machine performance are then presented.",
        "This is particularly relevant to the question of how keys should be future MUC and Tipster evaluations.",
        "A study is then presented of the extent to which machines and humans agree on the relative difficulty of particular templates.",
        "The results of a pilot study in which the performance of humans and machines is compared for particular kinds of information, to see what information machines are comparatively worse or better than humans in extracting, is then presented.",
        "A final section of the paper makes some general conclusions about the results and their implications for assessing the maturity and applicability of extraction technology."

        "The development of templates for the English Microelectronics corpus began in the fall of 1992.",
        "It began with an interagency committee that developed the basic template structure and, when it had evolved to the point that'it was relatively stable, two experienced analysts were added to the project so that they could begin training toward eventual production work.",
        "About two months after that, two more production analysts joined the project.",
        "The template structure was object-oriented, with a template consisting of a number of objects, or template building blocks with related information.",
        "Each object consisted of slots, which could be either fields containing specific information or pointers, that is, references, to other objects.",
        "Slot fields can either be set fills, which are filled by one or more categorical choices defined for that field, or by string fills, in which text is copied verbatim from the original article.",
        "In cases of ambiguity, analysts could provide alternative fills for a given slot.",
        "In addition, analysts could include comments when desired to note unusual problems or explain why a particular coding was selected.",
        "Comments were not scored and were primarily used when analysts compared two or more codings of a given article to determine which was the more correct.",
        "For more information on the template design see [4].",
        "Also see [5] for a discussion of selection of the articles in the corpora and preparation of the data, and [6] for a discussion of the different extraction tasks, domains, and languages.",
        "Previous experience with the English and Japanese Joint Ventures corpus had made it clear that producing templates with a high degree of quality and consistency is a difficult and time-consuming task, and we attempted to make the best use of what had been learned in that effort in producing templates for English Microelectronics with quality and consistency appropriate to both the needs of the project and the resources we had available.",
        "\"Quality\" refers to minimizing the level of actual error by each analyst.",
        "\"Error\" includes the following: (1) Analysts missing information contained in or erroneously interpreting the meaning of an article; (2) Analysts forgetting or misapplying a fill rule; (3) Analysts misspelling a word or making a keyboarding (typographical) error or the analogous error with a mouse; and (4) Analysts making an error in constructing the object-oriented structure, such as failing to create an",
        "object, failing to reference an object, providing an incorrect reference to an object, or creating an extraneous object.",
        "\"Consistency\" refers to minimizing the level of legitimate analytical differences among different analysts.",
        "\"Legitimate analytical differences\" include the following: (1) Different interpretations of ambiguous language in an article; (2) Differences in the extent to which analysts were able or willing to infer information from the article that is not directly stated; and (3) Different interpretations of a fill rule and how it should be applied (or the ability or willingness to infer a rule if no rule obviously applies).",

        "These rules were created by a group of analysts who met periodically to discuss problems and to agree on how to handle particular cases via a general rule.",
        "One person (who was not one of the production analysts) served as the primary person maintaining the rules.",

        "The second step was the development of a procedure in which two analysts participated in coding nearly half of the articles, and the reconciliation of different codings to produce final versions.",
        "For 300 articles in a \"high quality\" development set and for the 300 articles in the test set, the following procedure was followed: Two analysts first independently coded each article, with the resulting codings provided to one of these same analysts, who produced a final version, or \"key\".",
        "The remaining 700 development templates were coded by only one analyst, with each of four analysts coding some portion of the 700 articles.",
        "The purpose of the two-analyst procedure was to correct inadvertent errors in the initial coding and to promote consistency, by allowing the final analyst to change his or her coding after seeing an independent coding by a different analyst.",
        "The procedure also promoted consistency in the long run by providing analysts with examples of codings made by other analysts so that they could see how other analysts handled a given problem.",
        "It also helped improve the fill rules by allowing analysts to detect recurring problems that could be discussed at a meeting and lead to a change in the fill rules."

      "heading": "Software Support Tools",
      "text": [
        "The third step was the development of software tools that helped analysts to minimize errors, detect certain kinds of errors, and support the process of comparing initial codings.",
        "One such tool was the template-filling tool developed by Bill Ogden and Jim Cowie at New Mexico State University (known as Locke in the version designed for English Microelectronics).",
        "This tool, which runs on a Sun workstation and uses the Xwindows graphical user interface, provided an interface that allowed analysts to easily visualize the relationships among objects and thus avoid errors in linking objects together.",
        "The tool also allowed analysts to copy text from the original article by selecting it with a mouse, entering it verbatim into a template slot, thus eliminating keystroke errors.",
        "In addition, the Locke tool has checking facilities that allowed analysts to detect such problems as unreferenced or missing objects.",
        "A second tool was the Tipster scoring program (developed by Nancy Chinchor and Gary Dunca at SAIC [81) which provided analysts making keys with a printout of possible errors and differences between the initial codings.",
        "Another program, written by Gerry Reno at the Department of Defense at Fort Meade, did final checking of the syntax of completed keys.",
        "The four analysts who coded templates all had substantial experience as analysts for U.S. government agencies.",
        "In all cases analysts making the keys were unaware of the identity of the analyst producing a particular coding.",
        "Analysts did often claim that they could often identify the analyst coding a particular article by the comments included in the template coding or the number of alternative fills added, although when this was investigated further it appeared that they were not necessarily correct in their identification.",
        "In addition to the templates and keys created for the development and test sets described above, a small number of codings and keys were made for the purpose of studying human performance on the extraction task.",
        "In February, 1993, at about the time of the 18-month Tipster evaluation, a set of 40 templates in the development set were coded by all analysts for this purpose.",
        "Similarly, for 120 templates of the 300-template test set that was coded in June and July, 1993 extra codings were made by the two analysts that would have not normally participated in coding those articles, resulting in codings by all 4 analysts for 120 articles.",
        "between the extremes of using a single analyst and the pro 1 cedure that had been used for English Joint Ventures in 4 which two analysts would independently make codings and provide the codings to a third analyst who would make a key.",
        "OTHER CODING It is of interest to know whether this form of checking is achieving its intended result â€“ that of improving the quality and consistency of templates.",
        "We can investigate this indirectly by measuring the level of influence analysts playing different roles (and producing different codings) have on the key that is produced.",
        "The question of influence is also of interest â€“ as will be seen in the next section â€“ for its implications in understanding the characteristics of different methods for measuring human performance.",
        "To investigate this influence, data from the set of 120 templates that all analysts coded were analyzed separately based on the role in the production of the key played by the particular coding.",
        "Figure 1 shows the relationship between different codings and the analysts producing them.",
        "Analyst 1 produces, based on the original article, what will be called here the primary coding of the article.",
        "Analyst 2 produces independently the secondary coding of the article.",
        "The primary and secondary codings are then provided to Analyst 1, who produces the key.",
        "Analysts 3 and 4 also produce other codings of the article that have no effect on the key.",
        "Each analyst plays a particular role (Analyst 1, 2, 3, or 4) for 30 of the 120 templates.",
        "Note that when Analyst 1 uses the primary and secondary codings in making the final coding, or key, there is a natural bias toward the primary coding.",
        "This is primarily because Analyst 1 created that coding, but also because the analyst typically does not create the key from scratch with the Locke tool, but modifies the primary coding (probably reinforcing the tendency to use the primary coding unless there is a significant reason for changing it).",
        "Figure 2 shows the results of this analysis, with performance expressed in terms of error per response fill, as calculated with the methodology described by Nancy Chinchor and Beth Sundheim [7] and implemented by the SAIC scoring program [8].",
        "All objects in the template were scored, and scoring was done in \"key to key\" mode, meaning that both codings were allowed to contain alternatives for each slot.",

        "The primary additional problem posed when attempting to measure the performance of humans performing extraction",
        "is that of \"who decides what the correct answer is?\"",
        "In the case of the English Microelectronics analysts, the four analysts whose performance we are attempting to measure became â€“ once they had substantial training and practice â€“ the primary source of expertise about the task, with their knowledge and skill often outstripping that of others who were supervising and advising them.",
        "This made it especially difficult to measure the performance of particular analysts.",
        "We approached the problem of determining the best method for scoring humans empirically: We compared experimentally four different methods for scoring codings by human analysts.",
        "In general, the criteria is objectivity, statistical reliability, and a perhaps difficult-to-define \"fairness\" or plausibility of making appropriate comparisons, both between different human analysts and between humans and machines.",
        "In evaluating different scoring methods, the 120 templates in the Tipster/MUC-5 test set that had been coded by all four analysts were used.",
        "As was described in the previous section, keys for each template in this set were made by one of the analysts, using as inputs codings done independently by the analyst making the key and one other analyst.",
        "Each of the 4 analysts made keys for 30 of the 120 templates and also served as the independent analyst providing a coding to the analyst making the keys for a different set of 30 templates.",
        "In addition, for 60 of the 120 templates, a fifth analyst made a second key from codings made by the four analysts.",

        "The data is shown in terms of percent error, with all objects scored, and with \"key to response\" scoring being used.",
        "In key to response scoring, alternative fills for slots are allowed only in the key, but not in the coding being scored.",
        "Since in the data collected here, analysts did normally add alternative fills (since their goal was to make keys), these alternatives were removed before scoring, with the first alternative listed assumed to be the most likely one and thus kept, and others deleted.",
        "The purpose of using key-to-response scoring was so that the resulting data could be directly compared with data from machine systems, which produced only one fill for each slot.",
        "Scoring was done in batch mode, meaning that human analysts were not used (as they are in interactive mode) to judge cases in which strings did not completely match.",

        "The \"Other Ana-lysts\" condition was nearly as consistent, with a variance of 3.16.",
        "The \"Independent Analysts\" and \"5th Analyst\" conditions were much less consistent, with variances of 9.08 and 30.19, respectively.",
        "The high variance of the \"Independent Analysts\" condition, however, resulted only from the performance of analyst D, who had a very small sample size, only 30 templates.",
        "If analyst D is left out, the variance becomes only 0.32 for this condition.",
        "The high variability across analysts for the 5th analyst could be a result either of the small sample size or, more likely, a tendency for the 5th analyst to code articles in a manner more similar to some analysts (especially analyst C) than others (especially analyst B).",
        "The subjective opinions of the analysts and their co-workers suggested that all English Microelectronics analysts here were generally at the same level of skill, which is consistent with the above data.",
        "(This was not true of the English Joint Venture analysts, for example, where both the data and the opinions of analysts and others suggested considerable variability of skill among analysts.)",
        "However, it should be noted that all of the conditions in which analysts are being scored by other analysts run the risk of making the differences among analysts artificially low.",

        "This results in the 18 month condition producing scores that are artificially low in terms of errors, compared to the 24 month condition.",
        "The difference, based on the data in Figure 5, can be estimated at from about 4 to 8 percentage points.",
        "Thus, it appears that analysts who started early did not improve their skill, or improved it minimally, between the 18 and 24 month tests.",
        "However, analysts who started later did appear to learn substantially, with error scores of 36% in the 18 month condition and 30.5% in the 24 month condition, with the amount of learning for the analysts who started later probably somewhat more than shown because of the difference in the method of making keys.",
        "Because of the differences in scoring methods between the conditions and the small sample size in the 28 month condition, the above results are only suggestive.",
        "An alternative approach to assessing the development of skill of analysts (that does not require keys for scoring) compares the pattern of disagree",

        "Such a pattern can be constructed by running the scoring program for a given set of templates in \"key to key\" mode (so that it calculates a measure of disagreement between two codings) for all pairs of codings for the four analysts.",

        "Note that all cells of the Difference matrix have positive scores, indicating that consistency between all pairs of analysts has increased.",

        "For the Later Starting Analysts (C and D), however, shown at the far right, consistency between the two analysts increased by 6 percentage points, indicating that these analysts were still developing their skill.",
        "For the case where the mean of all pairs of early-late analysts (AC, AD, BC, and BD) is calculated, shown as the middle vertical bar, consistency increased by an average of 4.375 percentage points, indicating that the less-skilled analysts had increased their consistency with the more-skilled analysts.",
        "The general finding here is that (1) the analysts who started earlier improved their skill minimally from the 18 to 24 month tests; and (2) analysts who started later improved their skill considerably.",
        "Because by the time of the 24 month test the later starting analysts had as much or more practice coding templates as did the early starting analysts at the time of the 18 month test, it is reasonable to assume that their increase in skill reflects an early part of the learning curve and that by the 24 month test all analysts have started to reach an asymptotic level of skill.",
        "The evidence in the literature for the development of skill in humans suggests that skill continues to develop, if slowly, for years or decades even on simple tasks, and it can be expected that continued practice on information extraction by these analysts would increase their level of skill.",
