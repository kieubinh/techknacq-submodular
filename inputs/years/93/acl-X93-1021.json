        "The past history of the system is discussed and the operation of its major components described.",
        "A summary of scores at the 24 month workshop is given.",
        "Because of the emphasis on different languages and different subject areas the research has focused on the development of general purpose, reusable techniques.",
        "The CRL/Brandeis group have implemented statistical methods for focusing on the relevant parts of texts, programs which recognize and mark names of people, places and organizations and also dates.",
        "The actual analysis of the critical parts of the texts is carried out by a parser controlled by lexical structures for the 'key' words in the text.",
        "To extend the system's coverage of English and Japanese some of the content of these lexical structures was derived from machine readable dictionaries.",
        "These were then enhanced with information extracted from corpora.",
        "The system has already been evaluated in the 4th Message Understanding Conference (MUC-4) where it was required to extract information from 200 texts on South American terrorism.",
        "Considering the very short development time allowed for this additional domain the system performed adequately.",
        "The system was then adapted to handle the business domain and also to process Japanese texts.",
        "Further extensions to the system allowed it to process texts on microelectronics development.",
        "Performance at the 12 and 18 month evaluations was good for Japanese, but less good for English where we have been attempting to automate much of the development process.",
        "A more pragmatic approach was adopted for the final 24 month evaluation, using the same hand-crafted techniques for English as had been used for Japanese.",
        "We estimate the amount of effort used directly to build the systems described here is around sixty man months."

        "The second is a lexical pattern driven parse which identifies the roles of the objects in a specific sentence.",
        "These two operate together to produce frames closely related to the final semantics of a template.",
        "The approach bypasses the normal two stage approach of parsing to a tree structure and then applying inference mechanisms to derive the final logical form for the sentence.",
        "The recognition of objects uses two lists of allowable and required semantic types for each object.",
        "Thus a location is allowable as part of an organization semantic object, but either an organization name or an organization noun phrase must be found to satisfy the semantic constraints for an organization.",
        "These constraints are specified in a declarative form.",
        "It is this level of the parser which recognizes conjunctions and lists of objects.",

        "Besides, unless we have a semantic interpretation module that is intelligent and rich enough, it is impossible to have a domain independent mechanism that can correctly interpret, say, definite descriptions (consider possessive modifiers for company and equipment).",
        "To make things even worse, it is also very difficult to specify some of these conditions declaratively.",

        "Similar experiments were performed on the English microelectronics texts.",

        "1. language modularity: allowing the addition of new languages with a minimum of effort through use of a limited interlingual representation for lexical and domain knowledge; Since the English and Japanese systems use the same system architecture in both domains and the same internal representation is used in English and Japanese system, the conversion from English system to corresponding Japanese system was relatively easy.",
        "The English Joint Venture system was converted to give the Japanese JV system and the English Micro-Electronic system was converted to give the Japanese ME system by one native speaker of Japanese.",
        "The differences between English and Japanese systems are as follows:",
        "• Data for tagging.",
        "Company, human, title, and place names and time expressions are language specific.",
        "• Patterns for GLS cospecification.",
        "There is a set of Japanese verbs for indicating various kinds of tie-ups such as import tie-up, sales tie-up, and business tie-up.",
        "Besides, the majority of the tie-ups in Japanese Joint-Venture articles involve only two parent companies and there is no mention of the JV company.",
        "Thus this fact is relfected on the cospec patterns of these verbs.",
        "• Patterns for recognizing company name aliases.",
        "As explained above, the Japanese system uses character-based and language-specific rules for recognizing aliases.",
        "2. acquisition of benefits of scale through the addition of lexical information automatically from existing machine-readable dictionaries;",
        "We used the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English to generate the initial verb patterns using verb sub categorization information, which is supplied in the dictionary, supplemented by example definitions which sometimes preferred subject and object information in the form of bracketed example subject and object types.",
        "This was then extended by finding additional pattern information in the Wall Street Journal Corpus.",
        "The dictionary, however, did not prove rich enough to provide all the possible ways of expressing information found in newspaper text, For example team up with, join forces, and so on.",
        "These have been added using patterns for equivalent senses found in the dictionary.",
        "Additionally the dictionary was used to generate semantic classes of nouns, for example all the words like factory which represent an industrial site.",
        "This was done for several classes of noun.",
        "The other source of this type of information was the keys provided for training data.",
        "3. the use of well-motivated Lexical Structures (LS's) to capture the presuppositional and anaphoric aspects of texts structures, essential for successful extraction;",
        "The lexical structures used in Diderot specify possible patterns occurring in the text and the types of appropriate objects found at specific locations in the patterns.",
        "By allowing noun phrases with appropriate heads to satisfy these constraints the lexical structures allow the generation of partially completed frames which can then be processed by the reference resolution module.",
        "4. the initial seeding of structures automatically by the techniques of (2) above, and the tuning of the LS's against corpora for particular languages (e.g. Japanese); Tuning of lexical structures against the corpus has been a major effort in our project.",
        "This has not produced the results we had hoped for.",
        "This may be partially due to the lack of specificity of the corpus we were using.",
        "In addition some of the methods developed depended on having corpora tagged with reasonably accurate semantic information.",
        "Our semantic tagging module has increased in accuracy during the course of the project.",
        "During the initial development phase it was probably not of sufficient quality to support the corpus development effort.",
        "5. the use of strong semantic resolution techniques (based on Wilks' Preference Semantics 1?])",
        "for the resolution of lexical ambiguity, and the imposition of appropriate structure on real (i.e. potentially ill-formed, multi-sentence) input text; Semantic constraints are applied to the structures which occupy the various fields in the cospecification pattern.",
        "These impose necessary conditions on the information gathered for each field.",
        "This proved sufficient to disambiguate the uses of the forms found in both domains.",
        "6. given that full parsing of very large-scale text samples is out of the question in the current state of the art, in the sense of parsing every sentence of a large text into a formal structure of any depth and content, we propose a set of alternative partial parsers and segmenters, all parsing to a canonical interlingual representation for selected sentences; This statement is almost a thumbnail sketch of our current system.",
        "Our system essentially operates with patterns at a variety of levels.",
        "These produce a very specific domain dependent canonical representation containing the essential information required for the construction of a set of templates.",
        "7. we shall define a set of \"minimalist AI techniques\" to connect inferentially the information carried by the slot-names of the TIPSTER templates: among these will be Finite State Acceptor demons that know about, e.g., the structures of dates, places, person names in English and Japanese and have access to large publicly-available word lists; Our system is dependent on a multiplicity of finite state machines which recognize the basic building blocks of a template.",
        "These processes often rely on large lists of terms for the specific class of item being recognized.",
        "In other case they rely on patterns derived by using corpus analysis tools such as Keyword in Context (KWIC) indexes (for example for equipment names).",
        "8. although statistical techniques used alone and unaided for traditionally AI tasks give poor results and seem to offer no clear path to optimization, the use of some such techniques is now firmly established in conjunction with symbolic techniques and we shall propose statistical techniques for gathering what we shall refer to as the \"true lexicon\" of the texts, and using these to locate relevant \"text points\" for detailed analysis;",
        "Our statistical techniques have been used in a variety of ways during the development of Diderot.",
        "In the original MUC-4 system they were used to identify specific paragraphs, for Tipster microelectronics they marked relevant texts.",
        "These methods have already been discussed.",
        "In addition the methods allow us to identify important vocabulary for a domain.",
        "This has been less important for the well defined domains we have worked on, but would prove useful to an analyst moving into a new domain who already had a collection of relevant and irrelevant texts.",
        "9. closely connected to (7) will be Metallel procedures that determine standard metonymic and hierarchical relations between text items and other items available to the domain knowledge base (e.g. Moscow often should be replaced by Soviet Government).",
        "Like the procedures of (7) it has access to an automatically-generated tangled genus hierarchy from the methodology of (2).",
        "A study of the metaphor and metonymy occurring in the joint venture domain was made at an early stage in the project.",
        "Various classes of metaphors were identified.",
        "However, the large majority of these proved to occur in standard ways and could be classified as dead metaphors.",
        "The most appropriate approach seemed to be to code these explicitly into the lexicons used by the system."

        "With Tabula Rasa an analyst can define windows for each data object which is to be extracted from the text.",

        "The first version of the system was developed in five months and was evaluated in the 4th Message Understanding Conference (MUC-4) where it extracted information from 200 texts on South American terrorism.",
        "At this point the system depended very heavily on statistical recognition of relevant sections of text and on the ability to recognize semantically significant phrases (e.g. a car bomb) and proper names.",
        "Much of this information was derived from the keys.",
        "The next version of the system used a semantically based parser to structure the information found in relevant sentences in the text.",
        "The parsing program was derived automatically from semantic patterns.",
        "For English these were derived from the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English, augmented by corpus information and these were then hand translated to equivalent Japanese patterns.",
        "The Japanese patterns were confirmed using a phrasal concordance tool.",
        "A simple reference resolving module was also written.",
        "The system contained large lists of company names and human names derived from a variety of online sources.",
        "This system handled a subset of the joint venture template definition and was evaluated at twelve months into the project.",
        "Attention was then focused on the microelectronics domain.",
        "Much of the semantic information here was derived from the extraction rules for the domain.",
        "A single phrase in microelectronics can contribute to several different parts of the template, to allow for this a new semantic unit the factoid was produced by the parser.",
        "This produced multiple copies of a piece of text, each marked with a key showing how the copy should be routed and processed in subsequent stages of processing.",

        "It is extremely difficult to point at individual components of the system and say this works, and this does not.",
        "Throughout the processing each component is dependent on the performance of previous stages.",
        "Our main accomplishment was in the construction of five working extraction systems over the two years of the project.",
        "We are particularly pleased with the performance of our two Japanese systems.",
        "For the English systems we adhered to our plan of attempting to automate as much as possible the development of the system, in particular the lexicon and associated semantic patterns.",
        "This work is going to continue, but at the moment the performance of a system developed in this manner is unlikely to match one which depends on careful hand tuning.",
        "Our name and object recognizing software is a stand alone component and has now reached levels of precision and recall of 75% for both languages.",
        "The automatic generation of our parser from the GLS lexical entries is also a useful method developed in the system.",
        "However, we need more sophisticated debugging techniques to enable us to track parse failures and errors.",
        "We feel that we have explored the problems involved in implementing a linguistic theory (Pustejovsky's Generative Lexical Semantics) in an operational system.",
        "This has lead to additions to the theory to support the specifics of extraction and also to ignoring interesting aspects which did not support the task.",
        "In particular we have failed to achieve the generative aspect of the theory which allows the lexical attributes of nouns to be incorporated in the more general sense of a verb.",
        "We have relied on a much simpler semantic typing for proper nouns and noun phrases.",
        "Our other main research theme was to develop lexical entries from corpora.",
        "This proved to be a very time consuming process and based as it is in a kind of averaging may not produce data specific enough for the task.",
        "An analyst with some knowledge of how the system operates could write patterns for actual sentences that fill templates more specifically than those we generated for our English systems.",
