        "In a collaborative effort between academics and industry, we have embarked on a project that uses text generation research in service of an industrial application.",
        "Bellcore and Columbia are jointly developing a system, PLANDoc, that will document the activity of planning engineers as they study telephone routes'.",
        "Telephone planning engineers currently use a software tool, the Bellcore LEIS2-PLAN system, that helps them derive 20-year capacity expansion plans based on growth forecasts and economic constraints.",
        "PLANDoc takes as input a trace of the engineer's interaction with LEIS-PLAN and produces",
        "a 1-2 page summary.",
        "The PLANDoc prototype is currently being tested by development teams and will move into use by regional planners sometime this Fall.",
        "The role of documentation has gained increasing importance as businesses attempt to achieve higher levels of productivity, often with fewer employees.",
        "In such environments, work must be carefully documented, both to make previous business decisions readily available to current employees, and to provide management with information needed to authorize major expenditures, in the million dollar range.",
        "Network planning managers need justification for why a proposed plan is best and whether alternatives were investigated.",
        "Until recently this information was provided orally, if at all, due to time constraints.",
        "But internal auditors and public regulators have increased the demand for formal documentation.",
        "Indeed, lawsuits have made the lack of documentation extremely costly.",
        "In a recent settlement, Pacific Bell promised to provide increased documentation in lieu of an 80 million dollar rebate to rate payers.",
        "PLANDoc documentation also promises to be useful in training new planning engineers; it provides a record of how experienced planning engineers arrive at their decisions, information which is not currently available.",
        "Because telephone network planning is currently done with an automated software system that produces a trace, albeit cryptic, of the actions of both the system and the user, development of an automated documentation system is quite practical; input to a report generator is automatically produced and readily available.",
        "Our approach makes use of existing text generation tools; we adopted the FUF/SURGE package(FUF5; Elhadad 93), developed and widely used at Columbia (Robin 93; McKeown et al.",
        "90; McKeown & Feiner 90; Elhadad 93; Paris 87; Wolz 92), which handles the generation of individual sentences.",
        "Given the PLAN trace and the FUF/SURGE sentence generation tools, development of PLANDoc requires bridging the gap between the two.",
        "The main research problems include:",
        "• organizing the content of the report, i.e., content planning, • mapping facts in the trace to sentence structures and choosing appropriate words, i.e., lexicalization.",
        "To handle these appropriately, we performed a user needs analysis to gather details about the kinds of reports that users would find helpful.",
        "Our analysis revealed two overriding practical considerations for the design and implementation of the PLANDoc automatic documentation generator:",
        "• the need for user-centered design, and • the need for a bounded sublanguage.",
        "The first of these was motivated by the fact that the system would eventually be used in a live production setting.",
        "The second was mandated by the need for a concise, but fluent report.",
        "The analysis showed that reports must avoid repeating similar information which occurs across input facts, while at the same time avoiding repeating exact phrasing.",
        "In this paper, we show how PLANDoc uses a systematic combination of conjunction and paraphrasing power to achieve these goals.",
        "Further, we show how we bounded their different combinations to avoid a combinatoric explosion of possible phrasings, while still maintaining fluency and conciseness in the generated reports.",
        "The systematic use of conjunction and ellipsis to achieve conciseness, combined with paraphrasing power, is a unique feature of the PLANDoc system.",
        "In the following sections, we first describe the user needs analysis, then turn to a description of the sublanguage and the constrained use of conjunction and paraphrasing.",

        "This activity is an integral part of telephone operations.",
        "New installations are costly, but at the same time facilities exhaustion can lead to a disruption in telephone service.",
        "Currently, about 1,000 planning engineers in 8 regional and independent telephone companies produce a total of about 15,000 route studies per year.",
        "The engineer uses PLAN to compute an optimum, cost-effective base relief plan needed to meet forecast demand over the next twenty years.",
        "The base plan, however, may not always be realizable or desirable due to political, economical, practical and other factors known to the engineer but not to the computer.",
        "The engineer uses PLAN's Interactive Refinement Module that allows 'what-if' modeling to explore the effects of various changes to the base plan.",
        "For example, an engineer might explore requesting a DLC activation for a given site, or changing a fiber activation time.",
        "After comparing the effects of different refinement scenarios, the engineer ultimately decides on a realizable relief plan to recommend to management for project authorization.",
        "Overall interaction with PLAN thus includes an automatically generated base plan, a sequence of refinements to explore the effects of different changes to the base, and a final proposed plan which may include elements of the base plan along with a selected set of refinements."

        "Our",
        "goal was to determine how engineers actually used the PLAN system, whether they would find an automated documentation facility to be helpful, and, if so, what the form and content of the narratives should be.",
        "We learned that novice planners often run 'bozo' refinements just to develop a feel for the process, while experienced planners sometimes run refinements they know will be suboptimal just for the record, i.e., for the benefit of managers, auditors and regulators who might ask \"did you try such and such?\".",
        "More critical to the need for documentation, we also learned that experienced planners keep handwritten notes on paper, listing their refinements and why they tried them; they asked for a way to enter their notes on-line to keep track of their reasoning.",
        "Inexperienced planners asked to see narratives written by experienced planners in order to learn from them; unfortunately few such narratives exist.",
        "Finally, all planners welcomed the idea of having the computer generate narratives that they could include in their documentation packages, especially if they could add to the narratives themselves.",
        "These findings shaped the content of PLANDoc narratives and the design of the system.",
        "Specifically, they indicated that planners may not want all refinements that they tried to appear in the narrative.",
        "For example, novice planners do not want to include their 'bozo' refinements, while experienced planners do want to include the suboptimal refinements they ran to show that their final refinements were superior.",
        "Thus, PLANDoc includes a facility that lets the planner select a subset of refinements to be included in the final narrative.",
        "Planners made it clear that they use knowledge not included in PLAN to make their decisions (e.g., corporate strategies) and they wanted a way to record that knowledge on-line, while they were working.",
        "This gave rise to PLAN-Doc's facility to prompt for manually-written engineer's notes at crucial points.",

        "The target narratives also informed the design of PLANDoc's Content Planner.",
        "Our analysis revealed that choosing a specific paraphrase for use in a summary depends on what has already been mentioned (i.e., the choice is based on previous discourse).",

        "When all but one or two attributes are common, ellipsis can be used for every common attribute, resulting in a concise form that uses a list-like structure for one or two roles of the sentence.",
        "To generate this form, the Content Planner builds a message where one semantic role has as its value",
        "a list and the Lexicalizer selects conjunction for the lexical role.",
        "Examples 1 and 2 in Figure 6 illustrate these cases.",
        "However, the more messages that are grouped together, the greater the number of potentially distinct attributes.",
        "PLANDoc groups such long compound messages into several separate sentences, where each sentence has a different common partition.",
        "It then combines these compound sentences together into a single conjunction.",
        "Example 3, Figure 6, illustrates this case.",
        "To generate these complex forms, the Content Planner indicates for each message which attributes are common and which are distinct.",
        "It then indicates which common attributes should be gapped; depending on the attribute and its position, sometimes only the first reference is ungapped, while in other cases all but the last is gapped.",
        "SURGE generates the full sentence for each message, but suppresses the gapped constituents when linearizing the syntactic tree representing the sentence.",
        "While this approach is less efficient, it is highly general since it can handle any combination of attributes without specifically anticipating it.",
        "Conjunction and ellipsis cannot be generated blindly, however.",
        "When conjunction is used for certain paraphrases, ambiguity and/or invalid sentences can result.",
        "The examples in Figure 7 show how conjunction using one paraphrase form (active with verb \"use\") is appropriate for conjunction with two distinct attributes (cutover strategy and CSA site), but a passive paraphrase for the same input produces an infelicitous result.",
        "This is because one distinct attribute occurs to the left of the verb (\"ALL\" in the first clause) and the other (CSA site) to the right of the verb.",
        "Unless no ellipsis at all is used (in which case there is no point in using conjunction), it is impossible to generate a reasonable sentence.",
        "Thus, while we have implemented a general algorithm, there are still cases that are exceptions to our approach.",
        "By limiting paraphrasing we have also limited the number of these cases to a manageable amount."
