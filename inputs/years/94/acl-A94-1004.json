        "Character shape code generation avoids the computational expense of conventional optical character recognition (OCR).",

        "In this paper, the ambiguity is shown to be practically limited to an acceptable level.",
        "It is illustrated that: first, punctuation marks are clearly distinguished from the other characters; second, stop words are generally distinguishable from other words, because the permutations of character shape codes in function words are characteristically different from those in content words; and third, numerals and acronyms in capital letters are distinguishable from other words.",
        "With these classifications, potential content-representing words are identified, and an analysis of their distribution yields their rank.",
        "Consequently, introducing character shape codes makes it possible to inexpensively and robustly bridge the gap between electronic documents and hard-copy documents for the purpose of content identification."

        "Documents are becoming increasingly available in machine-readable form.",
        "As they are stored automatically and transferred on networks, many natural language processing techniques that identify their content have been developed to assist users with information retrieval and document classification.",
        "Conventionally, stored records are identified by sets of keywords or phrases, known as index terms (Salton, 1991).",
        "Although documents are increasingly being computer generated, they are still printed on paper for reading, dissemination, and markup.",
        "As it is believed that paper will remain a comfortable medium for reading and modification (O'Gorman and Kasturi, 1992), development of content identification techniques from a document image is still important.",
        "OCR is often used to convert a document image into machine-readable form, but processing performance is limited by the overhead of OCR (Mori et al., 1992; Nagy, 1992; Rice et al., 1993).",
        "Because of the inaccuracy and expense of OCR, we decided to avoid using it.",
        "Instead, we have developed a method that first makes generalizations about images of characters, then performs gross classification of the isolated characters and agglomerates these character shape codes into spatially isolated (word shape) tokens (Nakayama and Spitz, 1993; Sibun and Spitz, this volume).",
        "Generating word shape tokens is inexpensive, fast, and robust.",
        "Word shape tokens are a potential alternative to character coded words when they are used for language determination and part-of-speech tagging (Nakayama and Spitz, 1993; Sibun and Spitz, this volume; Sibun and Farrar, 1994).",

        "Recognizing word shape tokens from images is two or three orders of magnitude faster than conventional OCR (Spitz, 1994), and is robust for real-world documents which are sometimes degraded by poor printing and which sometimes use more than a single font.",
        "The use of only 13 character shape codes instead of approximately 100 standard character codes results in a one-to-many correspondence between word shape tokens and words.",
        "Figure 2 shows how much character shape codes reduce word variation using the most frequent 10,000 English words (Carroll et al., 1971) in order of frequency.",
        "A word is defined as a string of graphic characters bounded on the left and right by spaces.",
        "Words are distinguished by their graphic characters.",
        "For example, \"apple\", \"Apple\", and \"apples\" are three different words, while \"will\" (modal) and \"will\" (noun) are the same.",
        "For the purpose of comparing the character shape code representation with the standard character code representation, the x axis represents the number of frequent words, and the y axis represents the number of distinct words represented in both ASCII and character shape codes.",
        "The number of words in ASCII naturally corresponds to the number of original words one-to-one.",
        "On the other hand, the number of words in character shape codes (the number of word shape tokens) is less than half of the number of original words.",
