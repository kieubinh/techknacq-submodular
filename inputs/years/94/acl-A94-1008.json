        "This paper combines knowledge-based and statistical methods for part-of-speech disambiguation, taking advantage of the best features of both approaches.",
        "The resulting output is fully and accurately disambiguated.",
        "We demonstrate a system that accurately resolves most part-of-speech ambiguities by means of syntactic rules and employs a stochastic tagger to eliminate the remaining ambiguity.",
        "The overall results are clearly superior to the reported results for state-of-the-art stochastic systems.",
        "The input to our part-of-speech disambiguator consists of lexically analysed sentences.",
        "Many words have more than one analysis.",
        "The task of the disambiguator is to select the contextually appropriate alternative by discarding the improper ones.",
        "Some of the inappropriate alternatives can be discarded reliably by linguistic rules.",
        "For example, we can safely exclude a finite-verb reading if the previous word is an unambiguous determiner.",
        "The application of such rules does not always result in a fully disambiguated output (e.g. adjective–noun ambiguities may be left pending) but the amount of ambiguity is reduced with next to no errors.",
        "Using a large collection of linguistic rules, a lot of ambiguity can be resolved, though some cases remain unresolved.",
        "The rule system may also exploit the fact that certain linguistically possible configurations have such a low frequency in certain types of text that they can be ignored.",
        "A rule that assumes that a preposition is followed by a noun phrase may be a useful heuristic rule in a practical system, considering that dangling prepositions occur relatively infrequently.",
        "Such heuristic rules can be applied to resolve some of the ambiguities that survive the more reliable grammar rules.",
        "A stochastic disambiguator selects the most likely tag for a word by consulting the neighbouring tags or words, typically in a two or three word window.",
        "Because of the limited size of the window, the choices made by a stochastic disambiguator are often quite naive from the linguistic point of view.",
        "For instance, the correct resolution of a preposition vs. subordinating conjunction ambiguity in a small window is often impossible because both morphological categories can have identical local contexts (for instance, both can be followed by a noun phrase).",
        "Some of the errors made by a stochastic system can be avoided in a knowledge-based system because the rules can refer to words and tags in the scope of the entire sentence.",
        "We use both types of disambiguators.",
        "The knowledge-based disambiguator does not resolve all ambiguities but the choices it makes are nearly always correct.",
        "The statistical disambiguator resolves all ambiguities but its decisions are not very reliable.",
        "We combine these two disambiguators; here this means that the text is analysed with both systems.",
        "Whenever there is a conflict between the systems, we trust the analysis proposed by the knowledge-based system.",
        "Whenever the knowledge-based system leaves an ambiguity unresolved, we select that alternative which is closest to the selection made by the statistical system.",
        "The two systems we use are ENGCG (Karlsson et al., 1994) and the Xerox Tagger (Cutting et al., 1992).",
        "We discuss problems caused by the fact that these taggers use different tag sets, and present the results obtained by applying the combined taggers to a previously unseen sample of text."

        "The English Constraint Grammar Parser, ENGCG (Voutilainen et al., 1992; Karlsson et al., 1994), is based on Constraint Grammar, a parsing framework proposed by Fred Karlsson (1990).",
        "It was developed 1989-1993 at the Research Unit for Computational Linguistics, University of Helsinki, by Atro Voutilainen, Juha Heikki15, and Arto Anttila; later on, Ti-mo Jirvinen has extended the syntactic description, and Pasi Tapanainen has made a new fast implementation of the CG parsing program.",
        "ENGCG is primarily designed for the analysis of standard written English of the British and American varieties.",
        "In the development and testing of the system, over 100 million words of running text have been used.",
        "The ENGTWOL lexicon is based on the two-level model (Koskenniemi, 1983).",
        "The lexicon contains over 80,000 lexical entries, each of which represents all inflected and central derived forms of the lexemes.",
        "The lexicon also employs a collection of tags for part of speech, inflection, derivation and even syntactic category (e.g. verb classification).",
        "Usually less than 5 % of all word-form tokens in running text are not recognised by the morphological analyser.",
        "Therefore the system employs a rule-based heuristic module that provides all unknown words with one or more readings.",
        "About 99.5 % of words not recognised by the ENGTWOL analyser itself get a correct analysis from the heuristic module.",
        "The module contains a list of prefixes and suffixes, and possible analyses for matching words.",
        "For instance, words beginning with un... and ending in ... al are marked as adjectives.",
        "The grammar for morphological disambiguation (Voutilainen, 1994) is based on 23 linguistic generalisations about the form and function of essentially syntactic constructions, e.g. the form of the noun phrase, prepositional phrase, and finite verb chain.",
        "These generalisations are expressed as 1,100 highly reliable 'grammar-based' and some 200 less reliable add-on 'heuristic' constraints, usually in a partial and negative fashion.",
        "Using the 1,100 best constraints results in a somewhat ambiguous output.",
        "Usually there are about 1.04-1.07 morphological analyses per word.",
        "Usually at least 997 words out of every thousand retain the contextually appropriate morphological reading, i.e. the recall usually is at least 99.7 %.",
        "If the heuristic constraints are also used, the ambiguity rate falls to 1.02-1.04 readings per word, with an overall recall of about 99.5 %.",
        "This accuracy compares very favourably with results reported in (de Marcken, 1990; Weischedel et al., 1993; Kempe, 1994) – for instance, to reach the recall of 99.3 %, the system by (Weischedel et al., 1993) has to leave as many as three readings per word in its output."

        "Some concluding remarks are in order.",
        "• Using linguistic information before a statistical module provides a better result than using a statistical module alone.",
        "• ENGCG leaves some 'hard' ambiguities unresolved (about 3-7 % of all words).",
        "This amount is characteristic of the ENGCG rule-formalism, tagset and disambiguation grammar.",
        "It does not necessarily hold for other knowledge-based systems.",
        "• Only about 20-25 % of errors made by the statistical component occur in the analysis of these `hard' ambiguities.",
        "That means, 75-80 % of the errors made by the statistical tagger were resolved correctly using linguistic rules.",
        "• Certain kinds of ambiguity left pending by ENGCG, e.g. CS vs. PREP, are resolved rather unreliably by XT.",
        "• The overall result is better than other state-of-the-art part-of-speech disambiguators.",
        "In our",
        "27000 word test sample from previously unseen corpus, 98.5 % of words received a correct analysis.",
        "In other words, the error rate is reduced at least by half.",
        "Although the result is better than provided by any other tagger that produces fully disambiguated output, we believe that the result could still be improved.",
        "Some possibilities: • We could use partly disambiguated text (e.g. the output of parsers D1, D2 or D3a) and disambiguate the result using a knowledge-based syntactic parser (see experiments in (Voutilainen and Tapanainen, 1993)).",
        "• We could leave the text partly disambiguated, and use a syntactic parser that uses both linguistic knowledge and corpus-based heuristics (see (Tapanainen and Jãrvinen, 1994)).",
        "• Some ambiguities are very difficult to resolve in a small window that statistical taggers currently use (e.g. CS vs. PREP ambiguity when a noun phrase follows).",
        "A better way to resolve them would probably be to write (heuristic) rules.",
        "• We could train the statistical tagger on the output of a knowledge-based tagger.",
        "That is problematic because generally statistical methods seem to require some compact set of tags, while a knowledge-based system needs more informative tags.",
        "The tag set of a knowledge-based system should be reduced down to some subset.",
        "That might prevent some mapping errors but there is no guarantee that the statistical tagger would work any better.",
        "• We could try the components in a different order: using statistics before heuristical knowledge etc.",
        "However, currently the heuristic component makes less errors than the statistical tagger.",
        "• We could use a better statistical tagger.",
        "But the accuracy of XT is almost the same as the accuracy of any other statistical tagger.",
        "What is more, the accuracy of the purely statistical taggers has not been greatly increased since the first of its kind, CLAWS1, (Marshall, 1983) was published over ten years ago.",
        "We believe that the best way to boost the accuracy of a tagger is to employ even more linguistic knowledge.",
