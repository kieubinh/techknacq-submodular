        "Current technologies in natural language processing are not so mature as to make general purpose systems applicable to any domains; therefore rapid customization of linguistic knowledge to the sub-language of an application domain is vital for the development of practical systems.",
        "In the currently working systems, such customization has been carried out manually by linguists or lexicographers with time-consuming effort.",
        "We have already proposed a mechanism which acquires sublanguage-specific linguistic knowledge from parsing failures and which can be used as a tool for linguistic knowledge customization (Kiyono and Tsujii, 1993; Kiyono and Tsujii, 1994).",
        "Our approach is characterized by a mixture of symbolic and statistical approaches to grammatical knowledge acquisition.",
        "Unlike probabilistic parsing, proposed by (Fujisaki et al., 1989; Briscoe and Carroll, 1993), *also a staff member of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.,Ltd., Shinagawa, Tokyo, JAPAN.",
        "which assumes the prior existence of comprehensive linguistic knowledge, our system can suggest new pieces of knowledge including CFG rules, subcate-gorization frames, and other lexical features.",
        "It also differs from previous proposals on lexical acquisition using statistical measures such as (Church et al., 1991; Brent, 1991; Brown et al., 1993) which either deny the prior existence of linguistic knowledge or use linguistic knowledge in ad hoc ways.",
        "Our system consists of two components: (1) the rule-based component, which detects incompleteness of the existing knowledge and generates a set of hypotheses of new knowledge and (2) the corpus-based component which selects plausible hypotheses on the basis of their statistical behaviour.",
        "As the rule-based component has been explained in our previous papers, in this paper we focus on the corpus-based component.",
        "After giving a brief explanation of the framework, we describe a data structure called Hypothesis Graph which plays a crucial role in the corpus-based process, and then introduce two statistical measures of hypotheses, Global Plausibility and Local Plausibility, which are iteratively determined to select a set of plausible hypotheses.",
        "An experiment which shows the effectiveness of our method is also given."

        "[3] Knowledge which belongs neither to [1] nor to [2], but is indispensable to the given corpus.",
        "[1] implies that knowledge for less frequent constructions can be ignored at the initial stage of linguistic knowledge customization.",
        "Such knowledge will be discovered after major defects of the current grammar are rectified, because the GP of a generic hypothesis is defined as being sensitive to the frequency of the hypothesis.",
        "[2] means that we assume that the set of initially provided grammar rules has a comprehensive coverage of English basic expressions.",

        "Also note that only when this assumption is satisfied, can the HG produce a reasonable set of hypotheses.",
        "On the other hand, because of this assumption, our framework can learn structurally complex and linguistically meaningful lexical descriptions, like a subcategorization frame.",
        "[3] is reflected in the way of the computation of GP values.",
        "A generic hypothesis one of whose instances occurs as a single possible hypothesis that can recover a parsing failure will have the GP value of 1, even though its frequency is very low.",
        "The computation mechanism of GP and LP bears a resemblance to the EM algorithm(Dempster et al., 1977; Brown et al., 1993), which iteratively computes maximum likelihood estimates from incomplete data.",
        "As the purpose of our statistical analysis is to choose \"correct\" hypotheses from a hypothesis set which contains unnatural hypotheses as well, our motivation is different from that of the EM algorithm.",
        "However, if we consider that the hypothesis deletion is maxmizing the plausibility of \"correct\" hypotheses, the computation procedures of both algorithms have a strong similarity.",
        "The grammatical knowledge acquisition method proposed in this paper will be incorporated into the tool kit for linguistic knowledge customization which we are now developing.",
        "In the practical use of our method, a grammar maintainer will be shown a list of hypotheses with high GP values and renew the current version of grammatical knowledge.",
