        "Our method contrasts with pattern-matching techniques by offering an expressive and convenient descriptive framework.",
        "It also differs from a general multipurpose parser by an ability to recycle linguistic knowledge embodied in terminological data.",
        "Higher quality in terminological extraction is achieved thanks to a description of term variations.",
        "Areas of application using such a tool for terminology extraction include automatic indexing through an assignment of text pointers to thesaurus entries, knowledge acquisition form textual databases, noun phrase structural disambiguation and machine translation with a specific concern for the translation of idioms, compounds and terms.",
        "When designing any NLP system with large linguistic resources, there is tension between tractability and descriptive power.",
        "Finite state automata are efficient tools for lexical extraction.",
        "But their lack of convenience for information description makes the testing of different methodological choices difficult.",
        "Such a limitation is specifically problematic during the development stage.",
        "Symmetrically, unification-based parsers offer rich and conceptually tractable formalisms, but their computational cost is very high.",
        "The approach taken in FASTR is to use a convenient grammatical description stemming from PATR-II (Shieber 1986) associated with an optimized computational engine.",
        "Efficiency and constraint-based grammar formalism have motivated the acronym of the application (FAST + PATR-II) that stands for FAST TERM RECOGNIZER.",
        "When terminology extraction is applied to automatic indexing, two measures are important : recall and precision.",
        "Precision is crucial for applications using acquisition methods which are subject to an excessive recall, blurring terminological entries with syntactic recurrences or semantic preferences.",
        "Conversely, in a knowledge-based method like FASTR, recall is a decisive evaluation of the coverage of the extraction.",
        "The recall rate mainly depends on the ability of the processor to extract term occurrences which differ from their description in the terminological base.",
        "With the purpose of enhancing the recall rate, FASTR includes a metagrammar used to generate term variant rules from term rules.",
        "Such an addition of robustness does not entail a degradation of precision because variations are restricted to a \"safe\" window bordered by the term components.",
        "The formalism of FASTR is organized into three levels : a single word lexicon, a terminological grammar and a metagrammar for term variations.",
        "The initialization of FASTR consists of the description of the inflectional system of the language under study, the generation of a lexicon and a grammar from a list of terms with an on-line lexicon and the handcrafted creation of a set of paradigmatic metarules (about a hundred) which are refined according to the experimental results.",
        "Processing in FASTR starts with segmentation and stemming.",
        "During stemming, a few term rules are activated through a bottom-up filtering.",
        "Then, metarules are applied to these rules and yield transformed rules used to extract terms and their variants.",
        "For example, from the preceding sentence and from a grammar including term variant, the sequence terms and their variants would be extracted as a variation of term variant.",
        "The data required by FASTR consist of a declension file, an initial terminological database and an on-line dictionary to transform terms into compilable linguistic data.",

        "From these works, we have adopted the constraint of LTAG which states that rules must have at least one lexical frontier node together with the logical representation of Vijay-Shanker (1992) where rules are not restricted to immediate dependency.",
        "The lexicalized tree grammar is motivated by the domain to be described : terms mainly consist of compounds with an internal structure and lexical constituents.",

        "These authors advocate the systematic generation of syntactic term variants in query processing.",
