      "text": [
        "Although general purpose natural language processing (NLP) is beyond current state-of-the-art, limited domains have frequently been amenable to NLP using specific techniques because the domains use a \"sublanguage,\" a fairly restricted subset of a general natural language, which may have its own syntax and peculiarities.",
        "In this case, an analysis of one thousand three hundred and forty sample location descriptions from the Bishop Museum's Herbarium Pacificum collection (accumulated by about two hundred different collectors over a period of 160 years) shows a highly restricted use of language that is amenable to understanding using specialized techniques.",
        "Because these descriptions are meant to be read later by a reader who is not at the site, they contain very few observer relative descriptions (e.g., behind).",
        "Also, there",
        "are limits to the scale of the descriptions.",
        "For example, out of a thousand descriptions that were located manually, about half of the descriptions were judged to be accurate to within 1/3 of a mile and 73% accurate to within 1 mile.",
        "At the other end, there were no descriptions with accuracy in the meter range and the best descriptions were only accurate to within several tens of meters.",
        "A typical location description is: \"Punaluu Valley; Castle Trail from Punaluu to Kaluanui Valley + stream, on E. side of Northern Koolaus.\" Associated accession information typically includes the date, collector name(s), genus, elevation, the museum's collection number, and the collector's accession number.",
        "This sublanguage is made up mostly of named objects (e.g., \"Punaluu Valley\" and \"Castle Trail\") and prepositional phrases (e.g., from Punaluu to Kaluanui Valley + stream, on E. side of Northern Koolaus).",
        "The relation of the collection location to the unmodified named objects is almost always \"within,\" that is, the collection location is within the area designated by the named geographic object.",
        "The interpretation of the prepositions is somewhat simpler than the general case because the sublanguage deals only with a two dimensional cartographic space supplemented by elevation markings.",
        "This sublanguage is relatively simple syntactically, but there are still many problems for automatic interpretation of the sublanguage.",
        "One of the most common problems in interpreting this sublanguage is the inconsistent use of names.",
        "For example, Waikane-Schofield Trail also appears as Schofield-Waikane Trail, Schofield-Waikane Ditch Trail, Schofield Trail, W-S Ditch Trail, Schofield Waikane Trail, and Waikane Ditch Trail.",
        "A mountain like Kaala may be referred to as Mt Kaala, Mt.",
        "Kaala, Kaala Mts., Kaala Mountain(s), Mount Kaala, Kaala Puu (puu is the Hawaiian word for mountain), Kaala Summit, or Kaala Range.",
        "Another problem is that names are often not unique.",
        "For example, Manoa is the name for Manoa Falls, Manoa Valley, Manoa Valley Park, Manoa Triangle Park, Manoa Stream, Manoa Elementary School, Manoa Japanese Language School, Manoa Tunnel, and Manoa Falls.",
        "When Manoa appears by itself, which Manoa is meant is usually clear from the context.",
        "In many cases, the same name is even used for the same type of object (e.g., many cities have Elm Streets and Main Streets).",
        "Luckily, similar objects with shared names tend to be geographically separated, otherwise confusion would result.",
        "Another very frequent problem is missing names.",
        "Collectors often use generic terms like stream and gulch to refer to landmarks that do have names.",
        "As before, the context is usually enough to find the correct object reference even without knowing the name.",
        "This heavy reliance on context for disambiguation is also a frequent problem for general purpose NLP systems.",
        "A difficult problem is the interpretation of ordinal numberings, which are used to differentiate forks of streams and branches of valleys.",
        "For example, \"3rd branch S of S fork of Kahanaiki Stream,\" refers to the third branch after the main South fork of Kahanaiki Stream counting from the head of the stream.",
        "Unfortunately, this description could also refer to the 3rd branch following the path of the collector going up the stream.",
        "Similarly, \"Honolulu Valley, 4th small gulch,\" refers to 4th small gulch counting from the open head of the valley, although this could easily be interpreted as the 4th small gulch along some trail that might enter the valley from some pass over the mountains at the tail end of the valley.",
        "Another problem is the occasional use of land coverage types such as \"middle Metrosideros forest,\" \"wooded gulch,\" and \"Fern Forest.\" Not only do most geographical databases lack land coverage information, but such information changes frequently over time.",
        "Also, descriptions sometimes refer to rainfall frequency, sun exposure or other ephemeral attributes of the area: \"in dryish for-est,\" \"wet valley,\" \"deep shade in wet gulch,\" and \"shady hillside.\" Even after converting the location descriptions into the appropriate spatial relations, there are still many problems in the correct interpretation of the relations.",
        "For example, \"along a stream\" does not mean that the collection site was in the stream, but within some distance of the stream.",
        "The problem is what exactly is the value of that distance.",
        "Even cardinal directions like \"north of\" are fuzzy concepts.",
        "The region north of a point can be bounded by two vectors pointing NE and NW (the triangular model), but this model fails when computing north of an object that is elongated in the E-W direction.",
        "Some spatial relations like \"in front of,\" \"behind,\" and \"beyond\" are relative to the observer's direction.",
        "Although these are not very frequent (only 25 cases in the 1340 sample descriptions), they still appear.",
        "Other spatial relations like \"above\" are dependent on understanding the slope of elevation around the object.",
        "To solve some of these problems, we have developed and implemented the LEI system to partially automate interpretation of this sublanguage.",
        "LEI is described in the following section."
