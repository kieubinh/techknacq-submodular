        "Most Japanese texts are made with Japanese word processors.",
        "As Japanese texts consist of phonograms, KANA, and ideograms, KANJI, Japanese word processors always use KANA-KANJI conversion in which KANA sequences (i.e. readings) input through the key board are converted into KANA-KANJI sequences.",
        "Therefore, Japanese texts suffer from homophone errors caused by erroneous KANA-KANJI conversion.",
        "A homophone error occurs when a KANA sequence is converted into the wrong word which has the same KANA sequence (i.e. the same reading).",
