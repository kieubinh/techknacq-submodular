        "When working with a MT(machine translation) system, users compile user dictionaries for the words which are not registered in the system dictionaries or for those with inappropriate translations [1].",
        "But when registering new words in a dictionary, there is a need to give not just the index word and translated word, but also syntactic, semantic and various other information.",
        "Systems aiming at higher levels of translation quality require more detailed and accurate information [2,3], and it is no simple task for laymen to give such information.",
        "In particular, semantic information usually requires the skill of professionals.",
        "In this paper, attention has been focused on the characteristics of user defined words.",
        "A method is proposed where for index words (noun words or compound nouns) in the original language that users seek to register, one need give only the translation in the target language to permit the system apply the knowledge held in the system dictionaries, automatically judge the type of noun and determine the SAs of the word for the noun types."

        "Manual determination achieved an accuracy rate of 94.8%.",
        "Similar results were obtained for the software specification documents.",
        "Translation experiments were conducted for the 4 cases (3 cases shown in the section 4 plus the case without SAs) using the same texts used in the above section.",
        "It can be seen in table 4 that using the automatically determined SAs improved the translation quality by 6-13%.",
        "This improvement is almost the same as that achieved with manually determined SAs.",
        "The translation success rate is 2-3% lower than that achieved with the correct attributes.",
        "This is, however, satisfactory if we consider the high cost needed to obtain the correct attribute by repeatedly tuning them.",
