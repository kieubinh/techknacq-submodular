        "Adverbs' have various complex grammatical functions in sentences but they do not construct the main parts of sentence meaning.",
        "In natural language processing, therefore, the study of adverbs has not developed very far to date.",
        "Linguists have examined adverb grammatical functions and meanings in detail (Quirk et al., 1985) (Greenbaum, 1969).",
        "Our method is based on these studies about adverb grammatical functions and meanings.",
        "Other adverb studies by linguists include studies which handle the meanings of specific adverbs, such as \"even\", \"still\" and \"already\" and temporal adverb studies which handle temporal semantics in sentences.",
        "The main problems in adverb processing in Japanese to English machine translation (Ogura et al., 1993) are as follows:",
        "1. the multiplicity of adverb meanings 2. differences in expression between Japanese and English for adverbial meaning 3. word ordering of English adverbs in English generation 4. representation of adverbs in a computer",
        "In this paper, we focus our attention on the 3rd problem."
