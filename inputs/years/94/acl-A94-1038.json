        "When we speak a foreign language, we use not only grammatical rules but also memorized expressions.",
        "Namely, translations are sometimes produced by mimicking translation examples.",
        "Example-Based Machine Translation(EBMT) adopts this strategy as follows: 1) Retrieves the translation example whose Source Expression (SE) is the same as or most similar to the input sentence, 2) Translates the input sentence using the Target Expression (TE) of the retrieved translation example.",
        "Since it is impossible to memorize all possible sentence patterns, the \"chunking + best-matching + recombination\" method is practical from the point of view of coverage.",
        "It provides translation examples at various linguistic levels, and decomposes an input sentence into chunks.",
        "For each chunk, the translation example is retrieved by best-matching.",
        "The output sentence is obtained by recombining the TE parts of the retrieved translation examples.",
        "However, this method suffers from translation quality lapses at the boundaries of the recombined chunks.",
        "These lapses are caused by serious gaps between languages, such as between English and Japanese, that differ widely in their syntactic features.",
        "This paper proposes a method to solve the problem of the structural gap by introducing a new generation module to the model of (Furuse, 92), that is able to handle the entire translation process within the example-based framework.",
        "This integrated method has been implemented in a prototype English-to-Japanese translation system.",
        "Figure 1 shows the proposed integrated method between example-based transfer and rule-based generation.",
        "The transfer module decomposes an input sentence using the SE(English) part of translation examples, and converts each piece of the input sentence into the equivalent piece in the TE(Japanese) using translation examples.",
        "The rule-based generation part of the integrated method consists of a composition module and an adjustment module.",
        "The composition module composes a structure from fragmentary examples by using Japanese grammatical constraint, and checks whether the structure is grammatically appropriate or not.",
        "The adjustment module refines the sentence output of the composition module so that the final output is as natural as colloquial Japanese."

        "The transfer module outputs the TE structure from an input sentences by using translation examples.",
        "In the proposed translation method, translation examples are classified based on the string pattern of their SE and are stored as empirical transfer knowledge, which describes the correspondence between an SE and its TEs.",
        "The following is an example of the transfer knowledge about \"X to Y\" at the verb-phrase level.",
        "X to Y Y' e X' ((go, Kyoto)...) Y' ni X' ((pay, account)...) Y' wo X' ((refer, announcement)...) The first possible TE is \"Y' e X'\" , with the example set ((go, Kyoto)...).",
        "Within this pattern, X' is the TE of X, which expresses a variable corresponding to some linguistic constituent.",
        "(go, Kyoto) are sample bindings for \"X to Y\" , where X =\"go\" , and Y =\"Kyoto\" .",
        "Patterns in transfer knowledge are classified into different levels according to the scale of their linguistic structure in order to restrict the explosion of structural ambiguity, and an input sentence is decomposed into chunks by applying SE parts of transfer knowledge in a top-down fashion.",
        "Suppose that an input sentence is \"Please come to our company.\" SE parts of transfer knowledge are applied in the order, \"please X\" (simple sentence), \"X to Y\" (verb phrase), \"our X\" (compound noun), \"come\" , \"company\" (surface word), yielding the following SE structure: (Please ((come) to (our (company)))) For each chunk of the SE structure, the most appropriate TE is selected according to the calculated distance between the input words and the example words.",
        "The distance calculation method of (Sumita, 91) is adopted here.",
        "The distance between words is defined as the closeness of semantic attributes in a thesaurus.",
        "The SE structure chunks of \"Please come to our company\" are transferred to \"X' tekudasai\" , \"Y'",
        "e X\"', \"watashi-tachi no X\"', \"kuru[come] 1\" and \"kaisha[company]\" .",
        "By combining these TE chunks, the following TE structure is obtained, which will be the input of the composition module of the rule-based generation model: (((watashi-tachi no (kaisha)) e (kuru)) tekudasai) In the above structure, the honorific word \"irassharu[come]\" is more adequate than the neutral word \"kuru\" from the point of view of politeness.",
        "The replacement of \"kuru\" with \"irassharu\" will be done in the adjustment module of the rule-based generation model."
