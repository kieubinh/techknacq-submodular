        "To evaluate the generation of rewriting candidates in terms of rewriting positions and rewriting expressions, the precision ratio and the recall ratio of these two have been calculated for the target text, focusing on the sentences for which the tool produced rewriting candidates (i.e., type 1) in Section 3.2.",
        "The precision ratio and the recall ratio for identifying division points are 63% and 100% respectively; the ratios for the rewriting candidates are 105% and 93% respectively.",
        "The recall ratios for both division points and rewriting expressions exceed 90%, which means that the probability of obtaining the correct positions and candidates are sufficiently high.",

        "For others whose recall ratio is low when the tool was not used, the rate of reduction in time does not change much, but the recall ratio improved by far.",
