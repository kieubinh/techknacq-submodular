        "Industrial applications of a reversible, string-based, unification approach called Humor (High-speed Unification Morphology) is introduced in the paper.",
        "It has been used for creating a variety of proofing tools and dictionaries, like spelling checkers, hyphenators, lemmatizers, inflectional thesauri, intelligent bilingual dictionaries and, of course, full morphological analysis and synthesis.",
        "The first industrialized versions of all of the above modules work and licensed by well-known software companies for their products' Hungarian versions.",
        "Development of the same modules for other agglutinative (e.g. Turkish, Estonian) and other (highly) inflectional languages (e.g. Polish, French, German) have also begun."

        "The morphological analyser is the kernel module of the system: almost all of the applications derived from Humor based on it.",
        "It provides all the possible segmentations of the word-form in question covering inflections, derivations, prefixations, compounding and creating basic lexical forms of the stems.",
        "Morphological synthesis is based on analysis, that is, all the possible morphemic combinations built by the core synthesis module are filtered by the analyzer.",
        "Lemmatizer is a simplified version of the morphological analysis system.",
        "It provides all the possible lexical stems of a word-form, but does not provide inflectional and derivational information."

      "text": [
        "Spelling checking of agglutinative languages cannot be based on simple wordlist based method because of the incredibly high number of possible word-forms of these languages.",
        "Algorithmic solutions, that is morphology based applications, are the only way to solve the problem (Solak and Oflazer 1992).",
        "The spelling checker based on our unification morphology method provides a logical answer whether the word-form in question can be constructed according to the actual morphological descriptions of the system, or not.",
        "In case of negative answer a correction strategy starts to work.",
        "It is based on orthographic, morpho-phonological, morphological and lexical properties of the words.",
        "This strategy also works in real corpus applications where automatic corrections of some typical mistypings have to be made."

        "There are languages in which 100% hyphenation cannot be made without exact morphological segmentation of the words.",
        "Hungarian is a language of this type: boundaries between prefixes and stems, or between the components of compounds override the main hyphenation rules that cover around 85% of the hyphenation points.",
        "Our unification based hyphenator guarantees, in principle, perfect hyphenation (including the critical Hungarian hyphenation of long double consonants where new letters have to be inserted while hyphenated)."

        "Both are dictionaries with morphological knowledge: Helyette is monolingual, while MoBiDic – as its name suggests' – bilingual.",
        "Having analyzed the input word both systems look for the lemma in the main dictionary.",
        "The inflectional thesaurus stores the information encoded in the analyzed affixes, and adds to the synonym chosen by the user.",

        "The whole software package is written in standard C using C++ like objects.",
        "It runs on any platforms where C compiler can be found.",
        "The Hungarian morphological analyzer which is the largest and most precise implementation needs around 100 Kbytes of core memory and 600 Kbytes disk space for spell-checking and hyphenation (plus 300 Kbytes for full analysis and synthesis).",
        "The stem dictionary contains more than 90.000 stems which cover all (approx.",
        "70.000) lexemes of the Concise Explanatory Dictionary of the Hungarian Language.",
        "Suffix dictionaries contain all the inflectional suffixes and the productive derivational morphemes of present-day Hungarian.",
        "With the help of these dictionaries Humor is able to analyze and/or generate around 2.000.000.000 well-formed Hungarian word-forms.",
        "Its speed is between 50 and 100 words/s on an average 40 MHz 386 machine.",
        "The whole system can be tuned3 according to the speed requirements: the needed RAM size can be between 50 and 900 Kbytes.",
        "The synonym system of Helyette contains 40.000 headwords.",
        "The first version of the inflectional thesaurus Helyette needs 1.6 Mbytes disk space and runs under MS-Windows.",
        "The size of the MoBiDic packages vary depending on the applied terminological collection.",
        "E.g. the Hungarian-English Business Dictionary needs 1.8 Mbytes space.'"
