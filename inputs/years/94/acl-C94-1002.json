        "Correctly determining number is a difficult problem when translating from Japanese to English.",
        "This is because in Japanese, noun phrases are not normally marked with respect to number.",
        "Japanese nouns have no equivalent to the English singular and plural forms and verbs do not inflect to agree with the number of the subject (Kuno 1973).",
        "In addition, there is no grammatical marking of countability.' In order to generate English correctly, it is necessary to know whether a given noun phrase is countable or uncountable and, if countable, whether it is singular or plural.",
        "Deciding this is a problem even for humans translating from Japanese to English, but they have their own knowledge of both languages",
        "to draw on.",
        "A machine translation system needs to have this knowledge codified in some way.",
        "As generating articles and number is only important when the rest of the sentence has been correctly generated, there has not been a lot of research devoted to it.",
        "Recently, Murata and Nagao (1993) have proposed a method of determining the referentiality property and number of nouns in Japanese sentences for machine translation into English, but the research has not yet been extended to include the actual English generation.",
        "This paper describes a method that extracts information relevant to countability and number from the Japanese text and combines it with knowledge about countability and number in English.",
        "First countability in English is discussed at the noun phrase and then the noun level.",
        "As a noun phrase's countability in English is affected by its referential property (generic, referential or ascripti ve) we present a method of determining the referential use of Japanese noun phrases.",
        "Next the process of actually determining noun phrase countability and number is described.",
        "This is followed by some examples of sentences translated by the proposed method and a discussion of the results.",
        "The processing described in this paper has been implemented in NIT Communication Science Laboratories' experimental machine translation system ALT-J/E (Ikehara et al.",
        "1991).",
        "Along with new processing for the generation of articles, which is not discussed in detail in this paper, it improved the percent",

        "As it is not always possible to explicitly determine this when translating from Japanese to English, we divide these nouns into two groups: 'strongly countable', those that are more often used to refer to discrete entities, such as cake, and 'weakly countable', those that are more often used to refer to unbounded referents, such as beer.",
        "The last major type of countability preference is pluralia tanta': nouns that only have a plural form, such as scissors.",
