        "Transfer-Driven Machine Translation[D,[21(91, (TDMT) is a translation technique which utilizes empirical transfer knowledge compiled from actual translation examples.",
        "The main part of translation is performed by the transfer module which applies the transfer knowledge to each input sentence.",
        "Other modules, such as lexical processing, analysis, and generation, cooperate with the transfer module to improve translation performance.",
        "With this transfer-centered translation mechanism together with the example-based framework[3],[4].",
        "(51, which conducts distance calculations between linguistic expressions using the semantic hierarchy, TDMT performs efficient and robust translation.",
        "TDMT is especially useful for spoken language translation, since spoken language expressions tend to deviate from conventional grammars and since applications dealing with spoken languages, such as automatic telephone interpretation[6],[7],[8], need efficient and robust processing to handle diverse inputs.",
        "A prototype system of TDMT which performs bidirectional translation (Japanese to English and English to Japanese) has been implemented.",
        "This bidirectional translation system simulates the dialogues between two speakers speaking in different languages (Japanese and English) using an interpreting telephone system.",
        "Experimental results have shown TDMT to be promising for spoken dialogue translation."

        "We adopt the calculations of Sumitalfd.",

        "The first transfer knowledge, \"X no Y Y' of X' (ronbun {paper}, daimoku {title})\" represents the translation example that a set (ronbun{paper}, daimoku{title}) in structure \"X no Y\" is transferred into structure \"Y' of X'.\" Thus, pattern selection is conducted using such examples.",
        "When the source pattern \"X no Y\" is applied to an input, the transfer module compares the actual words for X and Y with the sets of examples, searches for the nearest example set with its distance score, and provides the most appropriate transferred pattern.",
        "For example, if the Japanese input is \".Kyoto no haigi\" and the nearest example set (X, Y) would be (Tokyo, kaigi), then the transfer module selects no in X'\" as the translation pattern and outputs \"conference in.",
        "Kyoto.\" Thus, bilingual transfer knowledge consisting of patterns and translation examples is used in TDMT to select the most appropriate translation.",
        "To analyze a whole source sentence and to form its target structure, the transfer module applies various kinds of bilingual transfer knowledge to the source sentence[91.",

        "The numbers in brackets represent the transfer knowledge pairs in Figure 3.",
        "As we have seen, the example-based framework is employed in the transfer module of the TDMT system, in which bilingual transfer knowledge is used for both analyzing and transferring the input sentence cooperatively.",
