        "Dilemma is intended to enhance quality and increase productivity of expert human translators by presenting to the writer relevant lexical information mechanically extracted from comparable existing translations, thus replacing - or compensating for the absence of - a lexicographer and standby terminologist rather than the translator.",
        "Using statistics and crude surface analysis and a minimum of prior information, Dilemma identifies instances and suggests their counterparts in parallel source and target texts, on all levels down to individual words.",
        "Dilemma forms part of a tool kit for translation where focus is on text structure and overall consistency in large text volumes rather than on framing sentences, on interaction between many actors in a large project rather than on retrieval of machine-stored data and on decision making rather than on application of given rules.",
        "In particular, the system has been tuned to the needs of the ongoing translation of European Community legislation into the languages of candidate member countries.",
        "The system has been demonstrated to and used by professional translators with promising results."

        "The design of translation aids beyond ordinary text processing and database accession and maintenance tools is mostly based on the same simplified view which for compelling reasons â€“ has been the working hypothesis of machine translation: that the source text has a well-determined meaning and that there exists in the target language at least one correct and adequate ways of expressing that meaning.",
        "When these assumptions are reasonably well justified, translation is relatively easy, fast and cheap with traditional methods and mechanization not rarely feasible with methods now known or envisaged.",
        "Typically, however, the translator must do more than retrieve and operate on pre-established and in principle pre-storable correspondences.",
        "Thus, lexical correspondences do not exist for all items; it is an essential part of translation to establish them.",
        "Legal texts, factual and stereotype though they may seem, regularly represent thoughts, attitudes and argurnents which do not have any counterparts in the target language prior to translation.",
        "This is particulary true in the huge project to translate the European Community legislation into the languages of countries which are not yet members of the Community and which currently have a partly different legal conceptual framework.",
        "What human translators need is decision support.",
        "Tlie most important tools are telephones, electroni-cal conforencing systems and good and relevant dictionaries.",
        "Unfortunately, there are not, always at every point, of time knowledgable and cooperative colleagues or other experts to call, electronical networks are only recently being established in some domains, and the intelligent and comprehensive dictionaries, which can serve as a writer's digest to the cumulative literature in a field are few and far between.",
        "Answers are often to be found in a text translated late at night the day before - or in the preceding sections of the text at hand.",
        "Rather than an automated writer, we need an instant lexicographer."

        "In practice, existing translations are being used as a major sourc.e (Shgvall Hein et al., 1990; Merkel 1993).",
        "Often in the hope to be able to avoid duplication of costs - or of getting paid twice for the same effort by finding identical or near-identical texts or passages, hut, more importantly, to ensure consistency or getting good suggestions, to follow or argue against.",
        "Synonyniy variation for the same concept is not appreciated in technical and legal prose and avoided as anxiously as homonymy.",
        "The ideal is I:I correspondences between expressions at least within one pair of documents and to eliminate \"forks\", i.e., one expression being translated into or being the translation of more than one counterpart, in the other language (Karlgren, 1988).",
        "We shall call a coupled pair of source and target text a bitext (Isabelle, 1992).",
        "What is said here about, bitexts can be generalized to n-tuples of parallel texts, claimed to differ \"only\" in language.",
        "Such n-tuples exist: in the European Community, a major part of the legislation is available in 9 \"authentic\" versions, which in (legal and political) theory are equivalent, and according to plans the number of \"authentic\" will soon rise Lo 12 or more.",
        "Little efforts have previously been made to systematically exploit this redundancy by means of po",
        "tent multilingual procedures for retrieving facts or expressions, even when surprisingly sitnple methods show promise of surprisingly useful results (Daldqvist, 1994).",

        "Empirically, good economy is achieved if about the same proportion of work is put into each of the stages Preparation, Text pro.",
        "duction and Verification, a trichotomy reminiscent of the classical person-time breakdown of software development (Brooks, 1975).",
        "The Dilemma tool is useful for some tasks in each of the three stages.",
        "Functionality A typical question for translators while actually writing is how a word or phrase has been used or translated previously processed texts.",
        "Conversely, they may ask for the source languages counterparts of given target language expression, to make sure that homonymy is not introduced.",
        "Similarly, during the preparation and verification phases, a translator or editor scans through the text for words and phrases that need to be resolved or treated specially.",
        "Text Production Phase Navigating in Bitexts 'fire first service is to enable tile translator to browse through the bitext and look at text elements pailiwise, to check for conventions of usage that are unfamiliar or unexpected.",
        "Pointing at a shorter or longer string in either language the user can find successively larger contexts and their counterparts or couniertexls in the other language version.",
        "'Phis service is available to the user froin within a word processor, the answer presented in a separate window.",
        "Comitcr words 'The second service is to assess the word-level counterparts or \"counterwords\" so far used for a given word.",
        "Here the system performs, crudely but instantly, the job of a terminologist or lexicographer.",
        "It uses a statistical matching process which offers the translator a list of candidate counterparts.",
        "Verification phase Translation Verification In this phase a revisor reads the text to detect inadequacies and inconsistencies.",
        "Often, there is no true answer to a terminological question: either one of a few options may be equally good per se hut unintended variation is disturbing and may be misleading.",
        "Verification, therefore, is not a matter of local correctness or of compliance with a given dictionary or other norm, and reading one passage at a tune will trot reveal the deficiency of the translation (Karlgren, 1988).",
        "One way of resolving or detecting dubious cases is to compare how a word or phrase has been used in a multitude of previous contexts and how it was rendered in their respective countertexts."
