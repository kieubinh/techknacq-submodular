        "Modal verbs belong to the most frequent English words.",
        "Clauses with modal expressions make up a considerable part of the clauses of any text, why any MT-system which is claimed to cover empirical texts with reasonable quality must include solutions to the problems discussed in this paper (cf. An et al., 1993 for a corpus based approach).",
        "One of the problems connected with the analysis of such clauses is the fact that the distinction between auxiliaries and modals is not clear.",
        "Verbs like ought to and dare (to) are often labelled semi-auxiliaries, begin and continue are called aspectual verbs etc.",
        "A common denominator of auxiliaries, semi-auxiliaries, modals and several perception verbs is their \"auxiliary mean-ing\" including tense, modality and aspectual perspective (cf. Gawrotiska, 1993).",
        "In the following, the term \"auxiliary \"will be used even when referring to verbs traditionally called modals and perception verbs.",
        "The typical \"auxiliary\" meanings, e.g. modality, aspectual perspective and tense show great encoding variation between languages.",
        "And even within one language one may often choose between several different lexical-grammatical modes.",
        "In English one may choose between X may come, It is possible that X comes, and X possibly comes with only minor stylistic differences.",
        "Swedish kan has both a root meaning (equivalent to is able to) and an epistemic meaning (equivalent to may), while English can only has the first meaning.",
        "The mode of encoding auxiliary meanings may be even more differentiated in other languages.",
        "Thus, He must come, has to be rendered by the passive construction Il est oblige de venir or the impersonal construction Il fruit qu'il vienne in French.",
        "In Russian one would have had to render this sentence using an an adjective (dollen) or an adverb (nado, neobxodimo).",
        "Japanese would have to use konakereba narimasen (literally: \"It won't do if X does not come\").",
        "MT-systems dealing with a certain pair of languages may tailor the meaning representations of auxiliaries ad hoc, but multi-language systems such as Swetra, the Swedish Computer Translation Project (Sigurd & Gawroitska, 1990), must choose more universal representations and suitable restructuring transfer rules as will he demonstrated.",
        "The problem of modality is also of general interest for linguistic, semantic and cognitive theory (Sweetser, 1990)."

        "There are two basic types of verb phrases in English (cf Sigurd, 1992), one (1) consisting only of a finite main verb (with possible complements), e.g. Bill jumps, the other (2) consisting of a finite auxiliary verb followed by a non-finite main verb (with possible complements), e.g. Bill must jump.",
        "The non-finite main verb in the second type may be in the infinitive, without to as illustrated, or in an infinitive with to as in Bill began to jump.",
        "The non-finite verb may also be a past participle as in Bill has jumped or a present participle as in Bill began jumping.",
        "The choice between non-finite forms is an automatic consequence of the preceding verb.",
        "We note that the have meaning perfect tense takes the perfect participle as in Bill has jumped, while the have which is an equivalent of must takes the infinitive with to as in Bill has to jump.",
        "The verb begin may take an infinitive with to (Bill began to jump) or alternatively a present participle (Bill began jumping).",
        "The auxiliaries in other languages, e.g. German and Swedish display similar combinatorial properties.",
        "The second type of verb phrase mentioned may be expanded to include further non-finite auxiliaries, as illustrated in: Bill must begin to jump, Bill must dare to begin to jump and Bill must dare to begin to be able to jump.",
        "Occasionally there may be a short adverb between the non-finite forms as in Bill must",
        "Aare not to jump and even after a to as in Bill must dare to not jump, although the so called split infinitive construction is condemned by prescriptive grammarians."

        "This is the approach taken by Swetra.",
        "The lexical meaning representations or semantic markers in Swetra are of the form m(S, G), where m denotes meaning, S is the main meaning of the word denoted by a kind of Machinese English and G the grammatical meaning.",

        "Linguists have often talked about the meanings of auxiliaries using words and concepts such as: compulsion, obligation, permission, ability, necessity, probability and possibility.",

        "A distinction between a root meaning and an epistemic meaning has been observed for a number of auxiliaries, e.g. must, where the two meanings are illustrated by the following two examples (from Sweetser, 1990, p, 49).",
        "Bill must be home by ten; Mother won't let him.",
        "stay Out any longer Bill must be home already; I see his coat The epistemic meaning may also he rendered by sentence adverhials as illustrated by: Bill is evidently/seemingly home or an impersonal expression with an adjective as in It is clear/ obvious that Bill is home.",
        "It would he an advantage if the semantic representations of auxiliaries could be related in a simple way to the meaning representations of such equivalent adverbs and adjectives.",
        "The simplest way to represent the meanings of auxiliaries is illustrated by m(can, pres).",
        "It is then logical to choose m(can, nonf) for the assumed infinitive be able to.",
        "Similarly, one may represent the meaning or present must by m(must, pees) and and the meaning of the corresponding infinitive be obliged to by m(must, nonj).",

        "With this representation in mind one may represent present must as I m(oblige, nonf), m(passive, pees)/ instead andcan as Im(able, nonf), m(passive, pres)J which directly gives us the synonym is able to.",
        "There are further semantic arguments in favour of representing constructions with modal verbs in a way similar to passive clauses.",
        "The referent of the subject in a sentence with a modal verb is not as \"agentive\" as the referent of the subject of a typical active content verb.",
        "If the term agent is to be understood as the element of the event-situation that is actively involved in and responsible for the triggering of the event-situation in question (Gawrmiska 1993), it becomes clear that the subject of a modal construction is not a typical agent.",
        "Its responsibility for triggering the event-situation is reduced by the obligation, allowance or compulsion component.",
        "In Russian and Polish, this property of the subject referent is overtly expressed by the dative case in several modal construction.",
