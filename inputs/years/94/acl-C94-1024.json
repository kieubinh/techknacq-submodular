        "In a lexicalized grammar such as the Lexical-ized Tree-Adjoining Grammar (LTAG), each lexical item is associated with at least one elementary structure (tree).",
        "The elementary structures of LTAG localize dependencies, including long distance dependencies, by requiring that all and only the dependent elements be present within the same structure.",
        "As a result of this localiza,tion, a lexical item may be (and, in general, almost always is) associated with more than one elementary structure.",
        "We will call these elementary structures supertags, in order to distinguish them from the standard part-cif-speech tags.",
        "Note that even when a word has a unique standard part-of-speech, say a verb (V), there will usually be more than one supertag associated with this word.",
        "Since when the parse is complete, there is only one supertag for each word (assuming there is no global ambiguity), an LTAG parser (Schabes, 1988) needs to search a large space of supertags to select the right one for each word before combining them for the parse of a sentence.",
        "It is this problem of supertag disambiguation that we address in this paper.",

        "As in standard part-of-speech disambiguation, we can use local statistical information in the form of n-gram models based on the distribution of supertags in a. L'I'AG parsed corpus.",
        "Moreover, since the sit-pertags encode dependency information, we can also use information about the distribution of distances between a, given supertag and its dependent supertags.",
        "Note that as in standard part-of-speech disambiguation, supertag disambiguation could have been clone by a parser.",
        "however, carrying out part-of-speech disambiguation prior to parsing makes the job of the parser much easier and therefore speeds it up.",

        "Lexicalized grammars associate with each word richer structures (trees in case of L'I'AC.s and categories in case of Combinatory Categorial Grammars (CCGs)) over which the word specifies syntactic and semantic constraints.",
        "Hence every word is associated with a much larger set of more complex structures than in the case where the words are associated with standard parts-or-speech.",
        "However, these more complex descriptions allow more complex constraints to be imposed and verified locally on the contexts in which these worths appear.",
        "'Phis feature of lexicalized grammars can be taken advantage of, to further reduce the disambiguation task of the parser, as shown in supertag disambiguation.",
        "Hence supertag disambiguation can be used as a general pre-parsing component of lexicalized grammar parsers.",
        "The degree of distinction between supertag disambiguation and parsing varies, depending On the lexicalized grammar being considered.",
        "For both LT AG and flCel, supertag disambiguation serves as a pre-parser filter that effectively weeds out inappropriate elementary structures (trees or categories) given the context of the sentence.",
        "It also indicates the dependencies among the elementary structures Ina not the specific operation to be used to combine the structures or the address at which the operation is to be performed • • \"an almost parse''.",
        "In cases whore the supertag sequence for the given input string cannot be",
        "combined to form a complete structure, the \"almost parse\" may indeed be the best one can do.",
        "In case of LTAG, even though no explicit substitutions or ad junctions are shown, the dependencies among LTAG trees uniquely identify the combining operation between the trees and the node at which the operation can be performed is almost always unique.",
        "Thus supertag disambiguation is almost parsing for LT-AGs.",
        "In contrast, the dependencies among the CCG categories do not result in directly identifying the combining operations between the categories since two categories can often be combined in more than one way.",
        "Hence for CCG further processing needs to be performed to obtain the complete parse of the sentence, although without any supertag ambiguities.",
        "The supertag disambiguation, dependency model in particular, is even closer to parsing in dependency grammar formalism.",
        "Dependency parsers establish relationships among words, unlike the phrase-structure parsers which construct a phrase-structure tree spanning the words of the input.",
        "Since LTAGs are lexicalized and each elementary tree is associated with at least one lexical item, the supertag disambiguation for LTAG can therefore be viewed as establishing the relationship' among words as dependency parsers do.",
        "Then the elementary structures that the related words anchor are combined to reconstruct the phrase-structure tree similar to the result of phrase-structure parsers.",
        "Thus the interplay of both dependency and phrase-structure grammars can be seen in LTAGs.",
        "Rainbow and Joshi (Thambow and Jos 1993) discuss in greater detail the use of MG in relating dependency analyses to phrase-structure analyses and propose a dependency-based parser for a phrase-structure based grammar.",
        "hi summary, we have presented a new technique that performs the disambiguation of supertags using local information such as lexical • preference and local lexical dependencies.",
        "This technique, like part-of-speech disambiguation, reduces the disambiguation task that needs to be 51n some cases, the dependency information between an auxiliary and an elementary tree may be insufficient to uniquely identify the address of adjunction, if the auxiliary tree can adjoin to more than one node in the elementary tree, since the specific attachments are not shown.",
