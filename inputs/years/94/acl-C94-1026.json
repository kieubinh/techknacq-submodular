        "Recently, many researchers further claiin that \"two languages are more informative than one\" (Dagan, 1991).",
        "They show that two languages could disambiguate each other (Gale et al., 1992); bilingual corpus could form a bilingual dictionary (Brown et at, 1988) and terminology correspondence bank (Eijk, 1993); a refined bilingual corpus could be formed the examples for machine translation systems (Sumita et a!., 1990).",
        "To do such kinds of researches, the most important task is to align the bilingual texts.",
        "Many length-based alignment algorithms have been proposed (Brown et al., 1991; Gale and Church, 1991a).",
        "The correct rates arc good.",
        "However, the languages they processed belong to occidental family.",
        "When these algorithms are applied to other running texts from different families, will the performance keep on the same level?",
        "Other translation-based alignments (Kay, 1991; Chen, 1993) show the difficulty in determining the word correspondence and arc very complex.",
        "In this paper, we will introduce a part-of-speech (POS)-based alignment algorithm.",
        "Section 2 will touch on the level of alignment and define the sentence terminators.",
        "In Section 3, we will propose the criterion of critical POSes and investigate the distribution of these POSes in the Chinese-English texts.",
        "Section 4 will describe a fair and rigorous method for evaluating performance.",
        "Then, we apply simulated annealing technique to conducting experiments and show the experimental results in Section 5.",

        "Paragraph level is sometimes called discourse level.",
        "Many efforts are involved in sentence level and fewer researchers touch on the word level (Gale and Church, 199 lb).",
        "To do sentence alignment, we should first define what a sentence is.",
        "In English, the sentence terminators arc full stop, question mark, and exclamation mark.",
        "However, the usage of punctuation marks is unrestricted in Chinese and the types of punctuation marks arc numerous (Yang, 1981).",
        "Nevertheless, in order to parallel the languages, we define that the sentence markers arc full stop, question mark, and exclamation mark over all languages.",
        "Therefore, an alignment of two texts is to find a best sequence of sentence groups, which arc ended with one of the sentence terminators.",

        "Now, the problem is what forms the critical POSes.",
        "Following many grammar formalisms (Sells, 1985), the content words will he the good indicators.",
        "Therefore, we think nouns, verbs, and adjectives as the critical POSes.",
        "In addition, we include numbers and quotation marks in the critical POSes clue to intuition.",
        "The English tagging system used in this work follows that of the LOB Corpus (Johansson, 1986).",
        "The Chinese tagging system follows that of the BDC Corpus (131)C, 1992) but with sonic modifications.",
        "The BDC Corpus does not assign tags to punctuation marks.",
        "We adopt the same philosophy of 1,0B Corpus to assign the tags of the punctuation marks as themselves.",
        "These critical POSes in English and in Chinese are listed in Table 1.",

        "For oriental languages like Chinese, the correspondence with its aligned counterpart in occidental languages is not so manifest like alignment of two languages within the same family.",
        "On the one hand, the POSes may be changed within an alignment; on the other hand, a sequence of English words may correspond to a Chinese word.",
        "These phenomena make the alignment much harder.",
