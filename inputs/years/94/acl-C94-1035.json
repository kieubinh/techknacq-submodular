        "There are two linguistic phenomena that are interested in the processing of computational morphology.",
        "They are morphological transformation and morpheme identification.",
        "Two-level model and syllable--based formalism focussed on the problem of morphological transformation (13ear88, Cahi90, Kosk83].",
        "Morpheme identification is an important issue in some languages where two or inure morphemes are combined to make a word, a compound word, or a sentence without any delimiters between morphemes [Abe86, Chen92, Pach92].",
        "The goal of morphological analysis is to find the base form of morphemes in a word.",
        "It consists of a generation of analysis candidates and the selection of correct candidates.",
        "Analysis candidates are generated as a reverse process of word formation rules: morpheme isolation and morphological transformation.",
        "Then, correct candidates are selected by the coherence restrictions among",
        "adjacent morphemes and dictionary confirmation.",
        "The morphological analyzer tries to generate all the possible candidates only to accept the correct candidates.",
        "Two-level model is widely known to be a computationally efficient method for the practical system on the condition that the number of rules is small[Dart86, Kosk88].",
        "lIowever, when the size of the rulebase is large it causes an exponential problem.",
        "In case of the Korean language, it is common that a stem is succeeded by grammatical morphemes.",
        "If we use the two-level model for a practical system, a small set of phonological rules and a large set of morpheme isolation rules are required because there are several thousand combinations of grammatical morphemes[Zhan90].",
        "In order to solve the problem, we can try a 2-pass algorithm.",
        "All the possible morphemes are isolated, and then do a phonological processing.",
        "It is also possible to do a phonological processing first and morphemes are isolated at the second pass.",
        "However, this kind of solution causes another serious problem that occurs from the conditional restrictions: (1) 50100 morphological transformation occurs not only at a stem but also at a functional morpheme, (2) there are cooccurrence restrictions between two morphemes, (3) morphological transformation occurs only for the special word group."

        "In addition, only a very small set of syllables, 1 to 46 syllables for each type of irregular verbs, are tied to the morphological transformation[Kang93].",
        "This kind of information is very useful to improve the efficiency of the morphological analyzer.",
