        "Maybe a lot more than 'several'.",
        "So, to make the segmenting system useful, we have to consider how to pick up the right segmented sentences from all the possible seems-like-segmented sentences.",
        "This system is to use statistical information between morphemes to see how `sentence-like'(how 'likely' to happen as a sentence) the segmented string is.",

        "In this paper MI is used to calculate the relationship between words found in the given sentence.",
        "A corpus of sentences is used to gain the Ml.",
        "To implement this method, we implemented a system MSS(Morphological Segmentation using Statistical information).",
