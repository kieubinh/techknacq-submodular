        "The dictionary construction project at the Japan Electronic Dictionary Research Institute, Ltd. (EDR) in Tokyo began in 1986 and is almost certainly the largest lexicon construction project for computational purposes in the world.",
        "This paper describes some aspects of the construction of the English language dictionary, in particular a project to verify and enhance information on noun phrases in the English Word Dictionary undertaken by the Computing Research Laboratory at New Mexico State University and the University of Sheffield.",
        "We believe the work so far raises issues of wider linguistic interest which require practical solutions so that the large scale lexicon project can proceed.",
        "We hope that this paper will show the complexity, diversity, and richness of the content of the [DR English Word Dictionary.",
        "The key idea has been to construct a system of features, categories and structures for encoding English words and phrases that is, at the same time, universal, or at least sufficiently universal to code both English and Japanese, two very different languages indeed.",
        "This is particularly evident in the use of left and right \"adjacency attributes\" in both the English and Japanese dictionaries.",
        "This general idea is a very natural outcome of the general state of linguistic theory, at least in the generative tradition, in its broadest sense: one which emphasises universality in its feature sets and structural constraints, but which has also evolved by a long and tortuous route to the current position where the lexicon is primary in a linguistic system, and all other levels of linguistic analysis can be seen as a projection from that level.",
        "The alphabet-soup grammar theories that are now current all share that assumption to some degree.",
        "Thus, a practical attempt to construct a lexicon on principles as universal as possible for computational use, is indeed a project broadly consistent with the state of generative theory.",
        "Almost all other lexicon construction projects under way with computation as a main goal (e.g. COMLEX, CUP, Procter 1992 and see Wilks, Stator and Guthrie, in press) are designed principally for English, although CUP intends to augment its structures from non-English corpora as soon as is feasible, and a COMIi for Spanish is already under discussion.",
        "Nonetheless, the sheer scale of the EDR enterprise (see below) and its explicitly universalist assumptions do make it unique.",
        "We will now outline briefly the general structure of the dictionaries in the project and then proceed directly to some of the theoretical and computational choices that have been made in the English lexicon."

        "The EDR Electronic Dictionary (EDR, 1993; Yokoi, 1990) is designed as the first true machine-readable dictionary that contains, in a readily accessible form, the information required for a computer to understand and generate natural language.",
        "As such, the EDR Electronic Dictionary is intended to be universally applicable and is not restricted to a particular application system.",
        "The part of the dictionary that handles surface information is kept separate from the section that handles semantic information: surface information that is heavily dependent upon a particular language is stored in the Word Dictionary, and semantic information is stored in the Concept Dictionary.",
        "There are four different dictionaries that comprise the EDR Electronic Dictionary: the Word Dictionary, the Concept Dictionary, the Co-Occurrence Dictionary and the Bilingual Dictionary.",
        "The different dictionaries that make up the EDR Electronic Dictionary and the EDR Corpus arc set in a structure of mutual interrelatedness.",
        "Four types of constituent data are contained in the EDR electronic dictionaries: word entries, concept entries, co-occurrence entries and bilingual entries.",
        "Word entries consist of headwords, grammatical information that indicates the grammatical characteristics of the word, and concept identifiers that indicate the concepts represented by a given word in different contexts.",
        "Concept entries represent the relationship between two dif",
        "ferent concepts.",
        "Co-occurrence entries use co-occurrence relation labels to describe the possible co-occurrence relations between headwords.",
        "Bilingual entries describe the word correspondences between headwords in different languages.",
        "Thus, each of the EDR electronic dictionaries is related to the others, and by using the different component dictionaries as a single entity, they can usefully be applied to many forms of natural language processing."

        "(iii) traveling post office (iv) dead letter box The adjective \"traveling\" modifies the noun phrase \"post office\" in the phrase \"traveling post office\" while the noun phrase \"dead letter\", composed of an adjective and a noun, modifies the noun \"box\" in the phrase \"dead letter box.\" For building a source of lexical information to he used in language processing, indication of the head noun of a phrase is useful as hypernym information.",
        "Location of the head noun cannot he determined automatically from the phrase structure.",
        "That is to say, it is often the case that the head noun is the noun occurring in the final position of a phrasal composed of two (or more) lexical items, but this rule does not always apply as there are also cases in which the head noun is the first noun of the phrasal e.g., court martial.",
        "During the actual task, the distinction between the syntactic relationship between constituents was carried out by indicating the intra-phrasal syntax by parenthesizing the immediate constituents with categorical labels.",
        "'the categorical labels used to mark the grouping of the phrasal are shown in the example below: EAJ(traveling)/ENI(post)/ENI(office) -> EM(traveli rig)/EN1(EN I (post)/ENI(@office)) In this syntactic notation a slash (/) divides constituents at the same level, EN1 is an English CO1111110111101111, E/V1 an English adjective, etc.",

        "The example given in the previous section, \"traveling post office\", was coded as a common countable noun that may be preceded by both the definite and indefinite articles and is referred to by the pronoun 'it'.",
        "Since the phrase \"traveling post office\" does not have any special requirements on verb agreement, that is, when the noun is used in the singular form it is followed by a singular verb and conversely, when it is used in the plural form it is followed by a plural form verb, the verb agreement marking is left blank for the entry.",
        "Although decisions for the descriptions of the intra-phrasal syntax structure were based on initial coding phases of the EDR Word Dictionary development, verification and correction of that morphological information during the verification project was essential.",

        "The decisions regarding the morphological information including segmentation and part of speech of the constituents could be made with more precision if the syntactic structure of the phrase was taken into consideration.",
        "The basic principles of headword determination and segmentation are as follows: (1) a headword unit should be determined on the basis of whether the phrasal expression comprises a single unit of meaning; (2) phrasal headwords should be segmented into those constituents which are also found as single headwords in EDR's English Word Dictionary.",
        "In view of the second basic principle, the part of speech of a phrasal constituent is decided according to the lexical part of speech consistent with the part of speech of the constituent as a single word entry in the dictionary.",

        "A decision on segmentation for some hyphenated words in phrasal entries is difficult to judge purely by intuition from looking at the individual phrasal entries.",

        "For example, a decision to correct \"yellow/-/green\" to \"yellow-green\" cannot be made purely by intuition.",
        "The decision here is more an issue of the selection of headwords rather than one of hyphenation.",
        "The verification task of morphological information also included raising possible additional headwords to be added to the EDR English Word Dictionary through the analysis of the entries.",

        "As mentioned earlier one of the tasks of the coding was to indicate the grammatical attributes of the constituents.",
        "The data show that of the adjective + noun pattern (EA,R)/ EN 10), the adjective constituent of the noun phrase did not inflect to form the superlative or comparative degree forms, but rather most often occurred in the positive degree form.",
        "The grammatical attributes for nouns other than the head noun also showed some interesting results.",
        "Nouns other than those designated as the head noun do not inflect in most of the cases.",
        "One of the exceptional cases is \"the time of w#one's life,\" where \"w#one's\" is a word class name for any noun in the possessive form.",
        "In this example, \"life\" inflects in accordance with the content of \"wifone's\" word class, though it is not the head noun of the phrase.",
        "Since phrases like this are very rare, it is also possible to treat \"the time of w#one's life\" and \"the time of witone's lives\" as individual headwords and not as the inflected forms of the same headword.",
        "Another exceptional case in which more than one constituent could inflect would be phrases containing the conjunction 'and.'",
        "however, most of the phrasal entries in the form of 'A and B' are uncountable and the final noun inflects if the phrase is countable, such as \"gin and tonics.\" Therefore, we can assume that the grammatical behavior of constituents of noun phrase entries can be properly described by indicating the head noun and coding the inflection information and grammatical attributes of the head noun.",
        "The coding of grammatical attributes for the entire noun phrase unit also provided some interesting results on countability and the usage of articles with the noun phrase.",
        "If the noun is countable it may be preceded by the definite article or the indefinite article; If the noun is uncountable it may be preceded by the definite article or no article.",
        "Approximately 10e/0 of the nouns coded as countable showed a variation on the foretnentioned pattern.",
        "These countable nouns were coded as allowing the definite article, indefinite article as well as no article.",
        "Nouns with this type of coding included mass nouns, names of plants and animals, metals, food, titles etc.",
        "or other nouns which could refer to both the group or a member of the group.",
        "Examples of such nouns included \"Leconte's sparrow\", \"Madagascar jasmine\", \"assembler language\", and \"atomic weight\".",
        "Though this held for the majority of these types of nouns, it was not universally applicable; the use of no article with \"Nubian goat\", \"Oregon grape\" and \"arctic loon\" is questionable.",
        "The significance of this data is that it implies perhaps a new code is necessary to cover cases of countable (ENC) nouns becoming uncountable (ENU) nouns and vice versa.",
        "Instead of coding a single entry as both, or providing two entries which correspond to the ENC and ENU usage we might better express the grammatical behaviors which are commonly shared by particular types of nouns by using a new code."
