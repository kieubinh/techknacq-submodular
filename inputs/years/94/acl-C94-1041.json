        "Only hy-peronymous definitions are dealt with here, for which systematic processing has been devised and implemented in the initial version of the system.",
        "The paper describes how KASSYS builds a taxinomic hierarchy by extracting the hyperonyms from these definitions.",
        "It also explains the way in which the system can answer closed questions (yes/no), thus enabling the user to check very quickly that a definition has been assimilated correctly.",
        "The underlying formalism is that of conceptual graphs, with which the reader is assumed to be familiar."

        "t The formalism which has been adopted for the representation of the definitions is that of conceptual graphs, 2 that the reader is assumed to understand.",

        "This gives the following corollary: the set of semantic features that make up the elements of A is included in the set of semantic features that make up the elements of B; the elements of B are said to inherit the semantic features that are common to the elements of A.",

        "From this definition it is possible to extract the following statement, in which insect is the hyperonym of bee: (4) All bees are insects.",
        "In formal terms a hyperonymous definition can be written as in (5), in which the defining statement is split into two fundamental components: the hyperonym, followed by a conjunction of semantic features which distinguish the defined from this hyperonym; this conjunction of semantic features is called specific difference.",

        "KASSYS carries out a certain number of checks on the proposed hyperonym.",

        "This example shows that it is sometimes almost inevitable to have recourse to a circular definition and it is for this reason that KASSYS can be configured to accept such definitions.",
        "However, the danger is that, when the knowledge base is consulted, certain algorithms which are used in this consultation and which, at the present time, are unable to check their own evolution, may lead to infinite loops with a consequent loss of information that has not previously been memorised."
