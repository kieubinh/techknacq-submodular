        "As part of the process of refining the dictionary and assuring its quality, we have spent considerable resources on reviewing dictionary entries and on occasion have had sections coded by two or even four of the elves.",
        "This process has allowed us to make some analysis of the sources and types of error in the lexicon, and how these errors might be reduced.",
        "We can divide the sources of error and inconsistency into four classes: 1. errors of classification: where an instance of a word is improperly analyzed, and in particular where the words following a verb are not properly identified with regard to complement type.",
        "Specific types of problems include misclassifying adjuncts as arguments (or vice versa) and identifying the wrong control features.",
        "Our primary defenses against such errors have been a steady refinement of the feature descriptions in our manual and regular group review sessions with all the elves.",
        "In particular, we have developed detailed criteria for making adjunct/argument distinctions [6].",
        "A preliminary study, conducted on examples (drawn at random from a corpus not used for our concordance) of verbs beginning with \"j\", indicated that elves were consistent 93% to 94% of the time in labeling argument/adjunct distinctions following our criteria and, in these cases, rarely disagreed on the subcategorization.",
        "In more than half of the cases where there was disagree-rnent, the elves separately flagged these as difficult, ambiguous, or figurative uses of the verbs (and therefore would probably not use them as the basis for assigning lexical features).",
        "The agreement rate for examples which were not flagged was 96% to 98%.",
        "2. omitted features: where an elf omits a feature because it is not suggested by an example in the concordance, a citation in the dictionary, or the elf's introspection.",
        "In order to get an estimate of the magnitude of this problem we decided to establish a measure of coverage or \"recall\" for the subcategorization features assigned by our elves.",
        "To do this, we tagged the first 150 \"j\" verbs from a randomly selected corpus from a part of the San Diego Mercury which was not included in our concordance and then compared the dictionary entries created by our lexicographers against the Lagged corpus.",
        "The results of this comparison are shown in Figure 3.",
        "The \"Complements only\" is the percentage of instances in the corpus covered by the subcategorization tags assigned by the elves and does not include the identification of any prepositions or adverbs.",

        "is it considers the correct identification of the complement plus the specific prepositions and adverbs required by certain complements.",
        "The two columns of figures under \"Complements I Prepositions/Particles\" show the results with and without the enumeration of directional prepositions.",
        "We have recently changed our approach to the classification of verbs (like \"run\", \"send\", \"jog\", \"walk\", \"jump\") which take a long list of directional prepositions, by providing our entering program with a P-DIR, option on the preposition list.",
        "This option will automatically assign a list of directional prepositions to the verb and thus will save time and eliminate errors of missing prepositions.",
        "In some cases this approach will provide",
        "a preposition list that is a little rich for a given verb but we have decided to err on the side of a slight overgeneration rather than risk missing any prepositions which actually occur.",
        "As you can see, the removal of the P-Dllts from consideration improves the individual elf scores.",
        "The elf union score is the union of the lexical entries for all four elves.",
        "These are certainly numbers to be proud of, but realistically, having the verbs done four separate times is not practical.",
        "However, in our original proposal we stated that because of the complexity of the verb entries we would like to have them done twice.",
        "As can be seen in Figure 5, with two passes we succeed in raising individual percentages in all cases.",
        "We would like to make clear that even in the two cases where our individual lexicographers miss 18% and 13% of the complements, there was only one instance in which this might have resulted in the inability to parse a sentence.",
        "This was a missing intransitive.",
        "Otherwise, the missed complements would have been analyzed as adjuncts since they were a combination of prepositional phrases and adverbials with one case of a subordinate conjunction \"as\".",
        "We endeavored to make a comparison with LDOCE on the measurement.",
        "This was a bit difficult since LDOCE lacks some complements we have and combines others, not always consistently.",
        "For instance, our PP roughly corresponds to either 1.9 (our PP/ADVP) or prep/adv -1-'1'1 (e.g. \"on\" + TI) (our IT/PA ItT-NP) lull, in some cases a preposition is mentioned but, the verb is classilied as intransitive.",
        "The straightforward comparison has LDOCE finding 73% of lie tagged complements but a softer measure eliminating complements that 1,DOCE seems to be lacking (PA ItT-NP-PP, P-POSSINC, PP-PP) and allowing for a PP complement, for \"joke\", although it is not specified, results in a percentage of 79.",
        "We have adopted two lines of defense against.",
        "the problem or omitted features.",
        "First, critical entries (particularly high frequency verbs) have been done independently by two or more elves.",
        "Second, we ;we developing a more balanced corpus for the (dyes to consult.",
        "Recent studies (e.g., [1]) confirm our observations that, features such as subcategorization patterns may differ substantially between corpora.",
        "We began with a corpus from a single newspaper (San Jose Mercury News), but have since added the Brown corpus, several literary works from the Library of America, scientific abstracts from the U.S. Department of Energy, and an additional newspaper (the Wall Street .tour-nal).",

        "Because of our desire to obtain relatively complete feature sets, even for infrequent verbs, we have perinit",
        "ted elves to extrapolate from the citations found.",
        "Such a process is bound to be less certain than the assignment of features from extant examples.",
        "However, this problem does not appear to be very severe.",
        "A review of the \"j\" verb entries produced by all four elves indicates that the fraction of spurious entries ranges from 2% to 6%.",
        "4. fuzzy features: feature assignment is defined in terms of the acceptability of words in particular syntactic frames.",
        "Acceptability, however, is often not absolute but a matter of degree.",
        "A verb may occur primarily with particular complements, but will he \"acceptable\" with others.",
        "This problem is compounded by words which take on particular features only in special contexts.",
        "Thus, we don't ordinarily think of \"dead\" as being gradable (\"Fred is more dead than Mary.",
        "\"), but we do say \"deader than a door nail\".",
        "It is also compounded by our decision not to make sense distinctions initially.",
        "For example, many words which are countable (require a determiner before the singular form) also have a generic sense in which the determiner is not required (\"Fred bought apple.\"",
        "but \"Apple is a wonderful fla-vor.\").",
        "For each such problematic feature we have prepared guidelines for the elves, but these still require considerable discretion on their part.",
        "These problems have emphasized for us the importance of developing a tagged corpus in conjunction with the dictionary, so that frequency of occurrence of a feature (and frequency by text type) will be available.",
        "We have done some preliminary tagging in parallel with the completion of our initial dictionary.",
        "We expect to start tagging in earnest in early sumrnmer.",
        "Our plan is to begin by tagging verbs in the Brown corpus, in order to be able to correlate our tagging with the word sense tagging being done by the Word-Net group on the same corpus [7].",
        "We expect to tag at least 25 instances of each verb.",
        "If there are not enough occurrences in the Brown Corpus, we will use examples from the same sources as our extended corpus (see above)."
