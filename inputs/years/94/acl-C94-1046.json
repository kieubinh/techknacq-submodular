        "1.1 A need for making linguistic knowledge accessible to the user, in Personal MT A current trend in Personal Machine Translation tends towards opening to the user the linguistic data that the system is operating upon [1] .",
        "Such `discoverable' environments should allow some free, self-planned, or coached investigation to users, and provide these in a suitable explanatory form with a large part of the linguistic material embodied in the personal lingware: lexical data bases, syntactic patterns or syntactic rules modules, semantic contrastive aspects, etc.",
        "Our work is oriented towards a particular aspect of such 'open lingware': the grasp, eventually the learning, by monolingual writers or editors of a document who are working in a language they know imperfectly, of the lexical properties of the language to he used.",
        "1.2 A new resource different from dictionaries In the context of lexical properties we may at first consider dictionaries to be a straight response to such a demand.",
        "They usually require of the user some premodelled view of the very organization of the lexical data, a pragmatic know-how of their legibility, or real mastery in order for the searcher user to perform a sensible pruning of the available information.",
        "'Ibis is particularly true with the lexical properties of the languages we are concerned with in this project, Chinese and Japanese.",
        "Users may experience the complexity of the process when, starting from uncertain or incomplete chunks of recollected knowledge, they wish to investigate a word to he ascertained, a nuance to be expressed, an ideogram to be remembered.",
        "Such situations clearly demand a reshaping of dictionaries as interactive knowledge bases, and the proposal of components and cooperative interfaces which could offer alternate access schemes to lexical data bases, or views of them [n].",
        "Some integrated systems for Dialogue Based Machine Translation intend to provide the author with the means for interactive consulting of linguistic facts or rules, for instance in the context of lexical or syntactical disambiguation or indirect pre-editing of contextual semantic features, specific to the text to be composed.",
        "The LIDIA architecture [21 and the NADIA model [91 certainly illustrate this approach.",
        "1.3 Discovery Assistants, Cooperative Observatories Te development of interactive environments for monolingual writers leads to modelling new functions for documentation, self-documentation, self-learning and management of individualized personal knowledge bases, to he pooled into open encyclopaedic 'discovery environments', specific components for NIT systems.",
