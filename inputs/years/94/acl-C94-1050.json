        "The difficulty of semantic disambiguation in natural language processing originates with the complexity of defining disambiguating knowledge contexts (Barwise J. and Perry J., 1983).",
        "These knowledge contexts must provide unique interpretations for codependent words, and help resolve \"semantic garden path\" sequences.",
        "For example, in \"John shot some bucks,\"a unique reading requires semantic agreement on \"shot\" and \"bucks,\" suggesting either a hunting or gambling context.",
        "The semantic garden path can be illustrated by prefixing the above sentence with \"John travelled to the woods,\" which might suggest the hunting context, but then appending \"The illegal casino was hidden far from town,\" to dramatically change the interpretation suggested by the first two sentences.",
        "The core of the problem is the disciplined and dynamic construction of a disambiguating knowledge context.",
        "While it might be possible to write static rules which provide disambiguating information in the context of complete knowledge, such rule-based models are both time and space inefficient.",
        "Recognizing these problems, Waltz D.L. and Pollack J.B.(1985) and Cottrell G.W. (1989) proposed a fascinating connectionist approach, which uses early ideas from semantic networks to resolve semantic ambiguity by dynamic spreading activation.",
        "This spreading activation construction of disambiguating context is based on a high density associative cognitive model, but still has problems: (1) no automated learning method to adaptively construct the model, (2) non-scalable, and (3) no method of confirming hypothesized disambiguation.",
        "Shastri L.(1988) proposes a similar structure, which uses a statistical semantic network.",
        "Sharkey N.E.",
        "(1989) has proposed a system for processing script-based narratives based on combining local representation and relaxation techniques with parallel distributed learning and snapping mechanisms.",
        "Mi-ikkulainen's system DISCERN(Miikkulainen R., 1993) is also suggestive of adaptive processing, and uses self-organizing representation of words and memory depending on semantics.",
        "However, all of these models share the problems enumerated above.",
        "Research directions for improvements suggest the use of existing collections of machine-readable dictionaries.",
        "Recently, Nishikimi M. et al.",
        "(1992) has proposed a new relationship between language acquistion and learning based on scene analaysis.",
        "Furthermore, Bookman L.A.(1993) has proposed a scalable architecture for integrating associative and semantic memory using a thesaurus.",
        "Based on this idea of using existing sources of word meanings, Veronis and Ide (Veronis.1.",
        "and Ide N.M., 1990; Ide N.M. and Veronis J., 1993) use several dictionaries and to improve the ratio of words disambiguated to ambiguous words.",
        "In addition to ideas for the source of disambiguating knowledge, many researchers have incorporated some kind of preference heuristics for improving the efficiency of determining disambiguating constraints.",
        "Although these methods are essential for semantic processing they lack any coherent method for (1) evaluating performance, and (2) acquiring new disambiguating knowledge from real-world sensors.",
        "Of course all of these problems result from the complexity of defining appropriate disambiguating knowledge contexts.",
        "To help control and reduce this complexity, Kohonen T.(1984) has suggested the classification of disambiguating information into four types: (1) spatial contact, (2) temporal contact, (3) similarity, (4) contrast.",
        "Kohonen also emphasizes the existence",
        "of a contextual background in which primary perceptions occur, but we claim that this kind of information can be expressed in the existing four types.",
        "The previous approaches noted above can all be interpreted as using a complex mixture of the information types proposed by Kohonen.",
        "This complexity makes it very difficult to identify or create a stable model of learning the appropriate disambiguating knowledge from the real world.",
        "Our original contribution here is to propose a basic method of word disambiguation based on spatial scene identification, and to provide a detailed analysis of its performance.",
        "The disambiguating knowledge is represented in the form of a stochastic associative memory, constructed from the Oxford Pictorial English Dictionary (OPED).",
        "This pictorial dictionary claims to provide word sense meanings for most ordinary life scenes.",
        "The process of disambiguation is modelled as determining a unique mapping from ambiguous input words to a particular pictorial dictionary scene as modelled in the associative memory.",
        "The simple representation of pictorial knowledge based on the OPED makes analysis simpler, and provides a potentially smooth connection to visual sensory data."
