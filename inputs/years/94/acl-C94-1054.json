        "Over the last decade, the research goals in natural language generation have shifted from the generation of isolated sentences to the production of coherent multi-sentence paragraphs.",
        "Two major aspects of the generation process have been focused on: deciding 'what to say' (the strategic level) and deciding 'how to say it' (the tactical level).",
        "In 1985, McKeown designed one of the first systems to produce paragraphs using so-called schemata to describe conventional text structures in terms of patterns.",
        "Schemata are used to determine the content and order of the clauses in paragraphs (McKeown, 1985).",
        "However, these structures have a major limitation (Moore and Paris, 1988): schemata do not contain a description of the intentional and rhetorical role that each part of the paragraph plays with respect to the whole paragraph.",
        "In 1988, Hovy first employed RST (Rhetorical Structure Theory) relations, which state the relationships between individual elements of a text, to control the construction of texts (Hovy, 1988).",
        "In developing this RST-based method, Hovy has discovered that RST relations are a powerful tool for planning paragraphs.",
        "They support reasoning about the intentions of writers and readers in a very natural way.",
        "Planning with rhetorical relations affords more flexibility than schemata.",
        "This method of planning paragraphs builds a tree structure that represents the internal organisation and rhetorical dependencies between clauses in a text.",
        "But there is a cost: it is more difficult to assemble an RST paragraph tree from a set of independent relations than it is to instantiate and traverse a schema (Hovy, 199 I ).",
        "In 1992, Hovy et.",
        "al.",
        "described a new text planner (Hovy et.",
        "al., 1992) that identifies the distinct types of knowledge necessary to generate coherent discourse in a text generation system.",
        "These knowledge resources are integrated under a planning process that draws from appropriate resources whatever knowledge is needed to construct a text.",
        "Though Hovy et.",
        "al.",
        "do not claim to have identified all the knowledge sources required to produce coherent discourse, their planner sets a trend for applying multi-knowledge resources for more complete and flexible planning of text.",
        "So far, planning techniques have developed from the direct application of schemata toward the wider implementation of multi-knowledge resources and diverse planning architectures (McKeown, 1985; Paris, 1987; Hovy, 1988; Moore, 1989; McKeown et al., 1990; Smilers, 1991; Hovy et.",
        "al., 1992).",
        "When these planning mechanisms are implemented in a working system, efficiency is still an important factor in developing a workable model.",
        "One of the problems in generation is that of designing a planning architecture that can achieve a good balance between the efficiency of the schema-based approach and the flexibility of the RST-based one.",
        "This paper presents such a hybrid architecture."

        "Both schema-based and RST-based planning paradigms have advantages and disadvantages.",
        "A hybrid of the two approaches that preserves their best aspects – the efficiency of the schema-based paradigm and the flexibility of the RST-based one – would clearly be useful.",
        "What are the possibilities for such a hybrid approach?",
        "Though the two paradigms seem very different, the fact is that a close relationship exists between them.",
        "Schemata are nothing other than stereotypically occurring collections of plans, whereas the plans and their plan elements are simply the elementary building blocks of schemata (Mann, 1987).",
        "Schemata can be viewed as the result of a process where the plans for all of the steps in the process have been compiled into a single structure (Moore and Swartout, 1991).",
        "Schemata can be used for planning relatively invariant aspects of text content and structure.",
        "RST-based plans can cope with less predicable and more volatile.",
        "Both planning paradigms can be implemented if they are properly represented and manipulated in a hybrid architecture.",
        "Two features are of importance in this hybrid approach: (1) different planning mechanisms are required to deal with different textual phenomena and (2) explicit use of multi-knowledge resources indispensable to these mechanisms.",
        "In knowledge resources, there are two types of prescriptive knowledge: domain-dependent and the domain-independent knowledge.",

        "In the hybrid planning mechanism advocated here, top-down hierarchical expansion is used as the basic planning mechanism.",
        "It retrieves as much information as possible from relevant knowledge resources.",
        "In general it does this • in a domain-dependent-to-domain-independent order.",
        "This order reflects the idea that an efficient planning mechanism should seek to exploit, whenever possible, stereotypical domain-dependent knowledge resources.",
        "This top-down planning mechanism is combined with other heuristic mechanisms such as an augmented transition network traversal, constructive critics and focus modules.",

        "domain-independent.",
        "The criteria for the division between the domain-dependent and the domain-independent operators is based on the stereotypic patterns of our analysed texts.",
        "For example, Fig. 2 represents a domain-dependent intentional operator, Persuade.",
        "In our system, this operator may be instantiated as an attempt by an agent X to persuade a client Y to take an Action such as buying the agent's Products.",
        "This is achieved by making the client aware or the products and increasing his desire to take the action of buying the product.",

        "The constraints, in this case that the client Y is not competent to fulfil Action, need to be satisfied at this stage of processing.",
        "When the constraints happened not to be satisfied within the existing knowledge resources, the constraints are then set as a new subgoal for later expansion.",

        "There are about thirty of them described to date (Mann and Thompson 1987).",
        "Planning with these operators affords more flexibility than schemata, because individual operators typically control less of a paragraph than schemata do; Domain-dependent rhetorical operators are derived from our RST analysis of our task-oriented data.",
        "Having analysed our sales letters we have identified those rhetorical operators that seem particular to such computer product sales texts.",
        "Often they are rather schematic in that one can expect certain material to be expressed in particular ways at certain parts in the text.",

        "The intentional network can be used for giving possible development of communicative goal(s) with heuristic ordering for an efficient schema-based approach.",
        "The rhetorical network is derived from several main sources: the relations defined in RST (Mann and Thompson 1989), which were extended in Hovy's taxonomization of relations (Hovy et.",
        "al.",
        "1992), and others as determined by our sales-letter domain.",
