        "The availability of technical documents in multiple languages is a problem of increasing significance.",
        "Not only do consumers demand adequate documentation in their mother tongue; there are also legal requirements, e.g., with respect to the upcoming European common market: the product reliability act forces merchants to offer complete technical documentation in the consumer's native language.",
        "The need to provide such a massive amount of multilingual material is likely to exceed both the capacities of human translators as well as those of machine translation technology currently available.",
        "Our work in the TECIIDOC project is motivated by the feeling that this situation calls for investigating a potential alternative: to ex-plod natural language generation technology in order to help overcoM e the documentation problem.",
        "TECHDOC operates in the domain of technical 'manuals, which was selected for two principal reasons.",
        "On the one hand, they represent \"real-world\" texts that.",
        "tin' actually useful: the domain is practical instead of a \"toy world\".",
        "On the other hand, the language that is used in such manuals tends to be relatively simple; one mostly finds straightforward instructions that have been written with the intention to produce text that can be readily understood by a person who is executing some maintenance activity.",
        "Moreover, as our initial analyses in the first phase of TECIIDO(l had shown, the structure of manual sections is largely uniform and amenable to formalization."

        "The macrostructure of a manual section is captured by schemas saying that (if appropriate) one first talks about, the location of the object to be repaired/maintained, then about possible re-placenient parts/substances; next, the activities are described, which fall into the three general categories of checking some attribute (e.g., a fluid level), adding a substance and replacing a part/substance.",
        "These actions are represented as plans in the traditional Al",
        "sense, i.e. with pre and postconditions, and with recursive structure (steps can be elaborated through complete refinement plans).",
        "These representations are mapped onto a language-independent document representation that also captures its microstructure by means of RST relations [Mann and Thompson, 1987] with a number of specific annotations (e.g., a proposition is to be expressed as an instruction, giving rise to imperative mood).",
        "This document representation is successively transformed into a sequence of sentence plans (together with formatting instructions in a selectable target format; SGML, Zmacs and for screen output – slightly formatted ASCII are currently supported), which are handed over to sentence generators.",
        "For English, we use 'Penman' and its sentence planning language (SPL) as input terms.",
        "To produce German and French text, we have implemented a German version of Penman's grammar (NIGEL), which is enhanced by a morphology module, and a fragment of a French grammar in the same way.",
        "For a more detailled description of the system architecture see [Wisner and Steele, 199213].",
        "2 The Knowledge Base The Knowledge Base is encoded in LOOM.",
        "In addition to the standard KL-ONE functionality (structured inheritance, separation of terminological and assertional knowledge), LOOM supports object-oriented and also rule-based programming.",
        "In addition to the 'Upper Model' of the Penman generator (a basic ontology that reflects semantic distinctions macle by language, [Bateman, 1990]) more than 1000 concepts and instances constitute the TECHDOC KB.",
        "They encode the technical knowledge as well as the plan structures that serve as input to the generation process.",
        "The domains currently modeled are end consumer activities in car maintenance and some technical procedures from an aircraft maintenance manual.",
        "One of the central aims in the design philosophy of the TECIIDOC knowledge base is the separation of domain-independent technical knowledge and specific; concepts pertaining to the particular domain: the portability of general technical knowledge has been a concern from the beginning.",
        "For instance, knowledge about various types of tanks (with or without imprinted scales, dipsticks, drain bolts) is encoded on an abstract, level in the inheritance network (the 'middle model'), and the particular tanks found in the engine domain are attached at the lower end.",
        "Similarly, we have an abstract model of connections (plugs, bolts, etc.",
        "), their properties, and the actions pertaining to them (plug-in connections can be merely connected or disconnected, screw connections can be tightly or loosely connected, or disconnected).",
        "Objects with the functionality of connections (e.g., spark plugs) appear at the bottom of the hierarchy.",
        "Thus, when the system is transferred to a different technical domain as experienced recently when we moved to aircraft manuals – , large parts of the abstract representation levels are reusable."

        "The first task undertaken in TECHDOC was a thorough analysis of a corpus of pages from multilingual manuals in terms of content as well as structure of the sections.",
        "A text representation level was sought that captured the commonalities of the correponding sections of the German, English and French texts, i.e. that was not tailored towards ono of the specific languages (I'or a discussion of representation levels in multilingual generation, see [Grote et al., 1993]).",
        "Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) turned out to be a useful formalism: for almost every section we investigated, the RST trees for the different language versions were identical.",
        "Our work with RST gave rise to a number of new discourse relations that we found useful in analyzing our texts.",
