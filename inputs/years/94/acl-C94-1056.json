        "Abstract generation is, like Machine Translation, one of the ultimate goal of Natural Language Processing.",
        "However, since conventional word – frequencybased abstract generation systems(e.g. [Kuhn 58]) are lacking in inter-sentential or discourse-structural analysis, they are liable to generate incoherent abstracts.",
        "On the other hand, conventional knowledge or script – based abstract generation systems(e.g. [Lehnert 80], [Film 86]), owe their success to the limitation of the domain, and cannot be applied to document with varied subjects, such as popular scientific magazine.",
        "To realize a domain-independent abstract generation system, a computational theory for analyzing linguistic discourse structure and its practical procedure must be established.",
        "Hobbs developed a theory in which he arranged three kinds of relationships between sentences from the text coherency viewpoint [Hobbs 79].",
        "Grosz and Sidner proposed a theory which accounted for interactions between three notions on discourse: linguistic structure, intention, and attention [Grosz et al.",
        "86].",
        "Litman and Allen described a model in which a discourse structure of conversation was built by recognizing a participant's plans [Litman et al.",
        "87].",
        "These theories all depend on extralinguistic knowledge, the accumulation of which presents a problem in the realization of a practical analyzer.",
        "Cohen proposed a framework for analyzing the structure of argumentative discourse [Cohen 87], yet did not provide a concrete identification procedure for 'evidence' relationships between sentences, where no linguistic clues indicate the relationships.",
        "Also, since only relationships between successive sentences were considered, the scope which the relationships cover cannot be analyzed, even if explicit connectives are detected.",
        "Mann and Thompson proposed a linguistic structure of text describing relationships between sentences and their relative importance [Mann et al.",
        "87].",
        "Ilowever, no method for extracting the relationships from superficial linguistic expressions was described in their paper.",
        "We have developed a computational model of discourse for Japanese expository writings, and implemented a practical procedure for extracting discourse structure[Sumita 92].",
        "In our model, discourse structure is defined as the rhetorical structure, i.e., the compound of rhetorical relations between sentences in text, Abstract generation is realized as a suitable application of the extracted rhetorical structure.",
        "In this paper we describe briefly our discourse model and discuss the abstract generation system based on it."

        "Rhetorical structure represents relations between various chunks of sentences in the body of each section.",
        "In this paper, the rhetorical structure is represented by two layers: intra-paragraph and inter-paragraph structures.",
        "An infra-paragraph structure is a structure whose representation units are sentences, and an inter-paragraph structure is a structure whose representation units are paragraphs.",
        "In text, various rhetorical patterns are used to clarify the principle of argument.",
        "Among them, connective expressions, which state inter-sentence relationships, arc the most significant.",
        "The typical grammatical categories of the connective expressions are connectives and sentence predicates.",
        "They can be divided into the thirty four categories which are exemplified in Table 1.",
        "The rhetorical relation of a sentence, which is the relationship to the preceding part of the text, can be extracted in accordance with the connective expression in the sentence.",
        "For a sentence without any explicit connective expressions, extension relation is set to the sentence.",
        "The relations exemplified in Table 1 are used for representing the rhetorical structure.",
        "Fig.",
        "1 shows a paragraph from an article titled \"A Zero-Crossing Rate Which Estimates the Frequency of a Speech Signal,\" where underlined words indicate connective expressions.",
        "Although the fourth and fifth sentences are clearly the exemplification of the first three sentences, the sixth is not.",
        "Also the sixth sentence is the concluding sentence for the first five.",
        "Thus, the rhetorical structure for this text can be represented by a binary-tree as shown in Fig. 2.This structure is also represented as follows:",
        "1: In the context of discrete-time signals, zero-crossing is said to occur if successive samples have different algebraic signs.",
        "2: The rate at which zero crossings occur is a simple measure of the frequency content of a signal.",
        "3: This is particularly true of narrow band signals.",
        "4: For example, a sinusoidal signal of frequency Fn, sampled at a rate F,, has Fo 1,, samples per cycle of the sine wave.",
        "5: Each cycle has two zero crossings so that the long-term average rate of zero-crossings is Z 2P0/F3.",
        "6: Thus, the average zero-crossing rate gives a reasonable way to estimate the frequency of a sine wave.",
        "(1,.11.1tabiner and R.W.Schafer, Digital Processing of Speech Signals, Prentice – Hall, 1978, p.127.)",
        "The rhetorical structure is represented by a binary tree on the analogy of a syntactic tree of a natural language sentence.",
        "Each sub tree of the rhetorical structure forms an argumentative constituent, just as each sub-tree of the syntactic tree forms a grammatical constituent.",
        "Also, a sub--tree of the rhetorical structure is sub-categorized by a relation of its parent node as well as a syntactic tree."

        "that case the system cuts out terminal nodes from the last sentences, which are given the same penalty score.",
        "If the text is written loosely, the rhetorical structure generally contains many BothNucleus relations (e.g., parallel(mata(and, also)), and the system cannot gradate the penalties and cannot reduce sentences smoothly.",
        "After sentences of each paragraph are reduced, inter-paragraph structure reduction is carried out in the same way based on the relative importance judgement on the inter-paragraph rhetorical structure.",
        "If the penalty calculation mentioned above is accomplished for the rhetorical structure shown in Fig. 2, each penalty score is calculated as shown in Fig. 3.",
        "In Fig. 3 italic numbers are the penalties the system imposed on each node of the structure, and broken lines are the boundary between the nodes un-posed different penalty scores.",
        "The figure shows that sentence four and five have penalty score three, that sentence three has two , that sentence one and two have one, and that sentence six has no penalty score.",
        "In this case, the system selects sentence one, two, three and six for the longest abstract, and and also could select sentence one, two and six as a shorter abstract, and also could select sentence six as a still more shorter abstract.",
        "After the sentences to be included in the abstract are determined, the system alternately arranges the sentences and the connectives from which the relations were extracted, and realizes the text of the abstract.",
        "The important feature of the generated abstracts is that since they are composed of the rhetoricaly consistent units which consist of several sentences and form a rhetorical substructure, the abstract does not contain fragmentary sentences which cannot be understood alone.",
        "For example, in the abstract generation mentioned above, sentence two does not appear solely in the abstract, but appears always with sentence one.",
        "If sentence two appeared alone in the abstract without sentence one, it would be difficult to understand the text."

        "The generated abstracts were evaluated from the point of view of key sentence coverage.",
        "30 editorial articles of \"Asahi Shinbun\", a Japanese newspaper, and '12 technical papers of \"Toshiba Review\", a journal of Toshiba Corp. which publishes short expository papers of three or four pages, were selected and three subjects judged the key sentences and the most important key sentence of each text.",

        "As for the technical papers, they were 60% and 80 % respectively.",
        "Then the abstracts were generated and were compared with the selected key sentences.",
        "The result is shown in Table 3.",
        "As for the technical papers, the average length ratio( abstract/original ) was 24 %, and the coverage of the key sentence and the most important key sentence were 51% and 74% respectively.",
        "Whereas, as for the editorials, the average length ratio( abstract/original ) was 30 %, and the coverage of the key sentence and the most important key sentence were 41% and 60% respectively.",
        "The reason why the compression rate and the key sentence coverage of the technical papers were higher than that of the editorials is considered as follows.",
        "The technical papers contains so many rhetorical expressions in general as to be expository.",
        "That is, they provide many linguistic clues and the system can extract the rhetorical structure exactly.",
        "Accordingly, the structure can be reduced further and the length of the abstract gets shorter, without omitting key sentences.",
        "On the other hand, in the editorials most of the relations between sentences are supposed to be understood semantically, and are not expressed rhetorically.",
        "Therefore, they lack linguistic clues and the system cannot extract the rhetorical structure exactly.",
        "text , and can be used for texts of any domain , so long as they contain enough rhetorical expressions to be expository writings.",
        "Fourth, the generated abstract is composed of rhetoric* consistent units which consist of several sentences and form a rhetorical substructure.",
        "so the abstract does not contain fragmentary sentences which cannot be understood alone.",
        "The limitations of the system are mainly clue to errors in the rhetorical structure analysis and the sentence-selection-type abstract generation.",
        "the evaluation of the accuracy of the rhetorical structure analysis carried out previously( [Sumita 92] ) showed 74%.",
        "Also, to make the length of the abstract shorter, It is necessary to utilize an inner-sentence analysis and to realize a phrase-selection-type abstract generation based on it.",
        "The anaphora-resolution and the topic-supplementation must also be realized in the analysis.",

      "text": [
        "We have developed an automatic abstract generation system for Japanese expository writings based on rhetorical structure extraction.",
        "The rhetorical structure provides a natural order of importance among sentences in the text, and can be used to determine which sentence should be extracted in the abstract, according to the desired length of the abstract.",
        "The rhetorical structure also provides the rhetorical relation between the extracted sentences, and can be used to generate appropriate connectives between them.",
        "Abstract generation based on rhetorical structure extraction has four merits.",
        "First, unlike conventional word-frequency-based abstract generation systems(e.g. [Kuhn 58]), the generated abstract is consistent with the original text in that the connectives between sentences in the abstract reflect their relation in the original text.",
        "Second, once the rhetorical structure is obtained, various lengths of generated abstracts can be generated easily.",
        "This can be clone by simply repeating the reduction process until one gets the desired length of abstract.",
        "Third, unlike conventional knowledge or script-based abstract generation systems(e.g. [Lehnert 80], [Fum 86]), the rhetorical structure extraction does not need prepared knowledge or scripts related to the original"
