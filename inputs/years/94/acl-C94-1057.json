        "Interlingual MT has typically come to include a syntactic analysis of source language (SL) text followed by its semantic interpretation and representation in terms of a text meaning representation (TMR) scheme, an interlingua.",
        "Recently two distinct views of the nature of the interling tin have become current â€“ one based on a world model (e.g., Nirenburg et al., 1992) and another one based on the notion of lexical conceptual structure (LCS) (e.g., Dorr, 1992).",
        "In this paper we analyze the role of LCS in the extraction of text meaning and argue that, though it cannot be considered an interlingua when used by itself, it contributes significantly to the specification of an actual interlingua.",
        "The task of an interlingual MT system builder is, then, to find a way to integrate the information provided in LCS into an Ontology-motivated text meaning representation serving as interlingua.",
        "In this paper, we propose a model for this integration and illustrate the processes and static knowledge sources involved, centrally including the lexicon.",
        "In Section 2 we propose a model of MT that involves both an LCS-based lexical semantic structure and a TMR that is not based on LCS.",
        "Because our lexicon formalism does riot represent LCSs, but semantic role names that serve as labels for LCS variables, we will use the abbreviation SDLS (for syntax-driven lexical semantics, Nirenburg and Levin, 1992) in reference to our system instead of LCS.",
        "We argue that TMR and SDLS are both necessary and that they are distinct.",
        "This model forms the basis of lexical-semantic treatment of texts in the !milli-lingual MT project Mikrokosmos.",
        "In Section 3 we present specific examples as analyzed in Mikrokosmos.",
        "We illustrate the static knowledge sources (primarily the lexicon) and the representations that are produced (syntax, lexical semantics, and TMR).",
        "The Mikrokosmos model is based on a theory of form-to-meaning correspondence which relies on the concept of a society of microtheories integrated in a non-stratificational manner.",
        "We briefly sketch the Main points of this theory in the final section of this paper."

        "In Mikrokosmos, we propose a different model, as illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "Lexical-conceptual structures (LCSs) have been suggested as atoning representations for natural language sentences produced in accordance with the semantic theory developed by 1 !ale and Jackend-off (e.g., Jackendoff, 1953) and used in MT-related experiments by Dorr (Dorr, 1993).",

        "Attempts have been made to use LCSs as interlinguas for MT (notably, Dorr, 1993).",
        "The impetus for such work is provided by observations that in many cases LCSs for translation equivalents are, in fact, identical.",
        "The ninny cases in which LCSs are not identical across languages pose problems for this approach.",
        "Methodologically, therefore, the type of work in LCS-as-interlingual projects is finding ways of resolving each such case, based on observing cross-linguistic divergences in realizing meanings.",
        "There is a danger that some of the divergences will prove untreatable at the LCS level and, alternatively, that solutions for Mlle, problems will necessitate changes to the nature of the representation which will make the resulting structure resemble the original LCS in progressively smaller ways.",
        "The problematic cases will be those in which translation equivalents can",
        "have different lexical semantics.",
        "We will mention two such cases here.",
        "The first problem arises in the context of a complex event, such as a merger of two companies, which can be described by mentioning any of its parts (bids, negotiations., etc.).",
        "This is particularly problematic when different languages, by convention or for ease of expression, refer to different parts of the complex event.",
        "In fact, such divergences exist even within one language.",
        "For example, you can go to a meeting (directed 'notion), attend a meeting (activity), or he at a meeting (state).",
        "Similarly, while in English one takes a taxi, using a transitive verb, the corresponding Japanese for the same event it takusi ni noru (get on, hoard, ride in a taxi), using an intransitive verb with a goal argument.",
        "Even seemingly atomic events and states can be broken down into their aspectual components to consist of events leading up to changes of state that result in new states.",
        "For example, the situation of knowing something can be expressed in English using the stative verb know or in Japanese using a non-stative verb situ (come to know) in its resultative form site iru (Lit: have come to know).",
        "In examples such as these, there will he no direct correspondence at the level of lexical semantics in individual languages.",
        "The second circumstance in.",
        "which translation equivalents have different lexical semantics is that an element of meaning that is expressed as an argument-taking predicate in one language might not be expressed as an argument-taking predicate in another language.",
        "Well-known examples from MT literature include like vs. germ, venir de vs. just, etc.",
        "However, this phenomenon is much more widespread than normally acknowledged in the MT literature.",
        "Things that are expressed as main or auxiliary verbs in English, but are not verbs at all in Japanese include many high-frequency meaning elements such as phase (begin, continue, finish), modality (musashould, plan, expect, try), and evidentiality (seem, appear, look like).",
        "In fact, the syntactic means for encoding these types of meaning vary wildly among languages, going far beyond the well-known verb-adverb divergences.",
        "This is why in the Mikrokosmos interlingua we represent such elements of meaning as features or operators that scope over clauses and propositions.",
        "2.2. flow is an Interlingua Different front an SDLS Output?",
        "In the cases described above in which a single event is described with different lexical semantics the meaning shared by each member in the set of paraphrases makes a better candidate for the intedingual semantic representation than does the lexical semantics; and it is this type of meaning that we are striving to extract and represent in the interlingua text in Mikrokosmos.",
        "Additionally, while SDLS concentrates on the \"who-did-what-to-whom\" aspect of text meaning, TMRs contain additional meaning facets, such as aspect, modality, evidentiality, speech act, reference, etc.",
        "Finally, as TMRs are not based on the lexical semantics of one particular language, there is no special benefit to be accrued from the imposition of the requirement to preserve predicate-argument structures."
