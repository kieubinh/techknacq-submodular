        "The previously proposed semantic-head-driven generation methods run into problems if none of the daughter constituents in the syntacto-semantic rule schemata of a grammar fits the definition of a semantic head given in [Shieber et a/., 1990].",
        "This is the case for the semantic analysis rules of certain constraint-based semantic representations, e.g. Underspecified Discourse Representation Structures (UDItSs) [Frank and Reyle, 1992].",
        "Since head-driven generation in general has its merits, we simply return to a syntactic definition of 'head' and demonstrate the feasibility of synlaclic-head-driven generation.",

        "This puts a strong restriction on the shape of semantic analysis rules: one of the leaves must share its semantic form with the root node.",
        "However, there are composition rules for semantic representations which violate this restriction, e.g. the schemata for the construction of Underspecified Discourse Representation Structures (U1)11.Ss) [Drank and Reyle, 1992] where, in general, the root of a tree is associated with a strictly larger semantic structure than any of the leaves.",
        "In order to make a generation method available for grammars which do not follow the strict notion of a semantic head, a syntactic-head-driven generation algorithm is presented, which can be specialized to generate from UDRSs.",
        "In a second step, the method will be extended in order to handle the movement of (syntactic) heads in a logically well-defined manner.",
        "The (tactical) generation problem is the task to generate a string from a semantic representation according to the syntax-semantics-relation defined in a given grammar.",
        "Let's assume that the latter relation 'The research reported here has been funded by the Sunder-forschungsbereich 340 \"Sprachtheoretische Grundlagen far die Cornputerlinguistik\", a project of the Cerman National Science Foundation DFC.",
        "is stated by pairs of trees.",
        "The left tree states a local syntactic dependency, i.e. the dominance relation between a root node and a set of leaf nodes and the linear precedence relation among the leaves.",
        "The right tree defines the relation among the semantic representation of the root and the semantic representations of the leaves.",
        "We assume that there is a one-to-one map from the nonterminal leaf nodes of the (local) syntax tree on the leaf nodes oldie (local) semantic derivation tree.",
        "Example: / s NP(VP) A np vp NP VP If one assumes a pairwise linking from left to right then the links between the two trees can be omitted.",
        "Although such pairs of trees are reminiscent of synchronous trees in TAG 's [Shieber and Schabes, 1991], they are simpler in various ways, in particular because we will not make use of the adjunction operation later on.",
        "In essence, pairs of trees are just a graphical notation for what has been put forward as the `rule-to-rule'-hypothesis, cf. [Gazdar el al., 1985], the fact that in the grammar each syntax rule is related with a semantic analysis rule.",
        "However, on the long run, the tree notation suggests a more general relation, e.g. more internal structure or additional, terminal leaf nodes in the local syntax tree.",
        "An obvious way to implement a generation procedure (see Fig.1) is to relate the input semantics with the start symbol of the grammar and then to try to expand this node in a top-down manner according to the rules specified in the grammar.",
        "This node expansion corresponds to an application of the (predict)-rule in the following abstract specification of a top-down generator.",
        "Generation terminates successfully if all the leaf nodes are labeled with terminals (success).",
        "The question is which method is used to make two, possibly complex symbols equal.",

        "X0 are matched by (feature) term unification with the corresponding mother nodes in the grammar rule.",
        "However, for the semantic form X0, a decidable variant of higher order unification might be used instead, in order to include the reduction of \\-expressions.",
        "Of course, the necessary precautions have to be taken in order to avoid the confusion between object and meta-level variables, cf. [Shieber el al., 1990].",
        "A depth-first realization of this abstract top-down algorithm would work fine as long as the semantic rep",
        "resentations of the leaves are always strictly smaller in size as the semantic form of the root node.",
        "But, if the actual semantic decomposition takes place in the lexicon, the semantic representations of some subgoals will be variables, which stand for semantic representations of any size:",
        "A strict left-to-right, depth-first expansion of subgoals might run into problems with the grammar fragment in (2) if a left-recursive np-rule exists, because the semantics of the np is only instantiated once the 'semantic head' of the vp has been looked up in the lexicon."

        "A top-down, semantic-structure-driven generation algorithm has been defined by [Wedekind, 1988] which gives a basis for dynamic subgoal-reordering guided by the semantic input.",

        "Obviously, a bottom-up component is required.",
        "One solution is to keep to a top-clown strategy but to do a breadth-first search, cf. [Kohl, 1992], which will be fair and not delay the access to the lexicon forever, as a pure depth-first strategy does.",
        "Alternatively, one could adopt a pure bottom-up strategy like the one which has been proposed in [Shieber, 1988] and which is presented in Fig.2 in a highly schematic manner.",
        "A lexical entry qualifies as a potential leaf node if its semantic form is a non-trivial substructure of the input semantics (rule (lex)).",

        "Generation finally succeeds if the root node of the current syntax tree is labeled with the start symbol of the grammar and the root of the semantic analysis tree with the input semantics.",
        "Due to the exclusion of phrases with 'empty' semantics (which would be trivial substructures of the input semantics), the method always terminates.",
        "However, the lack of top-down guidance will lead, in general, to a lot of non-determinism.",
        "The strong substructure condition means that the algorithm will be incomplete for grammars which cover semantically void phrases like expletive expressions, particles, and subphrases of idioms.",
        "The head-corner generator in [van Noord, 1993] is an illustrative instance of a sophisticated combination of top-clown prediction and bottom-up structure building, see Fig.3.",
        "The rule (lex) restricts the selection of lexical entries to those which can be 'linked' to the local goal category (visualized by a dotted line).",
        "According to van Noord, two syntax-semantics pairs are linkable if their semantic forms are identical, i.e. link((x, X), (xi, X)).",
        "The rule (hc-complete) performs a 'head-corner' completion step for a (linked) phrase xi„ which leads to the prediction of the head's sisters.",
        "A link marking can be removed if the linked categories resp.",
        "the linked semantic forms are identical (rule (local-success)).",
        "Generation succeeds if all the leaves of the syntax tree are labeled with terminals and if no link markings exist (rule (global-success)).",
        "In order to obtain completeness in the general case, the inference schemata of the head-corner generator roust be executed by a breadth-first interpreter, since a depth-first interpreter will loop if the semantic analysis rules admit that subtrees are associated with semantic forms which are not proper substructures of the input semantics, and if these subtrees can be corn-posed recursively.",
        "Such an extreme case would be a recursive rule for semantically empty particles: ('empty' semantics is represented by the empty list symbol ❑ ):",
        "However, if we assume that structures of that kind do not occur, a depth-first interpreter will be sufficient, e.g. the inference rules of the algorithm can be encoded and interpreted directly in Prolog.",
