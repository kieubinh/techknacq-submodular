        "From an investigation of the corpus, and from the terminologists' point of view (for example [Nkwenti-Azeh, 1992]), it appears that most of the terms encountered in technical fields are noun phrases corresponding to a limited number of syntactic patterns.",

        "assemblage et desassemblage de paquets packet assembly/disassembly Overcomposition and modification do not always preserve the base-MWU structure: in French, an adjective modifier is often inserted inside a base-MWU of N1 prep N2 structure; for example, national (domestic) can be inserted inside reseau a satellites (satellite network) to produce reseau national a satellites (domestic satellite network) (notice that in English, the adjective precedes the base MWU most of the time); in English, the Adj N structure is altered when two base-MWU, one of Adj N1 structure and one of N2 N1 structure, are overcomposed: geostationnary satellite and telecommunication satellite yield geostationnary telecommunication satellite.",
        "Coordination, which requires two base-MWU, always breaks the structure of one of them.",
        "These operations are not used with the same frequency, composition and modification being more frequent than coordination.",

        "For this purpose, we have implemented finite automata associated to regular expressions covering most occurrences of morphosyntactic structures, including modifications due to the afore mentionned operations.",
        "The output of the program is a list of pairs composed of two lemmas.",
        "Under each pair are stored all occurrences of the base MWU extracted from the corpus: for example, for the pair (interference, level), we get the following sequences:",
        "Unfortunately, the pairs obtained through tins method are not always \"good\" terms; we therefore have to introduce additional filters: statistical scores which use the number of occurrences of the pairs as input.",
        "3 Statistical scores to select good monolingual candidates Since the MWU extracted after the linguistic specifications still contain noise, we use statistical scores as an additional filter in order to choose the \"good\" ones among the candidate base MWU (or candidates for short).",
        "These scores apply on candidate lemma pairs for a given morphosyntactic pattern.",
        "We computed different scores:.",
        "frequencies, association criteria, Shannon diversity and distance measures.",
        "We discuss frequencies and association criteria below.",
        "Informations provided by Shannon diversity and distance measures are presented in [Daille, 1994].",
        "Most of the association criteria can be found in the classic literature, such as [Clifford and Stephenson, 1975], and are based on the so-called \"contingency ta-bles\".",
        "In the field of computational linguistics, mutual information [Brown et al.,, 1988], 02 [Church and Hanks, 1990], or a likelihood ratio test [Dunning, 1993] are suggested.",
        "Our testing method consists in comparing our result list, sorted according to a specified score, with a reference list containing only valid terms.",
        "In order to build the reference list, we augmented an existing terminology database (EURODICAUTOM) with hand work: we selected those candidates for which at least two judges out of three agreed on their goodness, and included them in the reference list.",
        "A candidate will be considered \"good\" when it is found in this reference list.",
        "The program for the extraction of candidates was run on a 240,000 words French corpus, divided into 9,541 sentences.",
        "It yielded 2,400 candidates that appear at least three times in the text.",
        "After sorting the candidates according to the particular score examined, we build a graphic representation of the proportion of \"good\" candidates per range of score values, in the form of a histogram.",
        "Figure 1 shows the histograms obtained on the French N1 de N2 can-dictates with two different scores: the likelihood ratio and mutual information.",
        "The vertical axis, which represents the proportion of good candidates, is bounded between 0 and 1.",
        "But, since we do not pretend to have built an exhaustive reference list, we can't actually expect values of more than 0.8.",
        "The horizontal axis grows with the score.",
        "The likelihood ratio test (LOG) (the use of a likelihood ratio test leads to a log likelihood statistics, which explains the LOG abbreviation) shows a curve that grows slowly at first, and then decidedly.",
        "There is a true opposition in the behaviours of small and big values, the representativity of good candidates approaching 0.8 in that case.",
        "On the contrary, mutual information (MI) is quite uniformely distributed, and the representativity never exceeds 0.5.",
        "Thus, if one had to choose between these two scores, the first one would undoubtedly be selected.",
        "The outcome of the study of the histograms is that very few scoring methods will meet our objective.",
        "The most significant seem to be the likelihood ratio test, and the number of occurrences of the pair.",
        "If it were for the sole histograms, one could be tempted to keep only the frequency of the pair, but due to its definition unfrequent terms won't stand out; therefore, we have to keep several methods.",
        "Anyhow, the performance of our scoring functions indicate the best method to follow: start any task (human post-editing for example) with the highest frequency values on monolingual candidates previously identified via linguistic patterns, thus maximizing the odds that the candidates will indeed be \"good\" candidates.",
        "Is the best score a combination of scores?",
        "An extra data analysis method To complete the evaluation and comparison of the different scores used to select actual terms from our candidates list, we have applied to these scores specific data analysis methods.",
        "In our case, the techniques of data analysis can provide at least two things: a probabilistic study of the correlations between scores, in order to select the relevant ones, and the possibility of combining scores, in order to improve the results.",
        "We carried out Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with a set of fifteen variables, i.e. the scores, on a set of 1,230 individuals, i.e. the can",
        "didates.",
        "The first objective of PCA is to reduce the number of variables with as little loss of information as possible., Doing so should enable us to visualize our data more easily.",
        "From the study of the correlation matrix of variables and their part in the principal axis, it appeared that variables could be divided into four classes.",
        "In each class, we wanted to retain the most significant variable with regard to our task.",
        "This was done by selecting in each class the variable with the best score-histogram.",
        "All other variables can be confidently connected to one of these.",
        "With the remaining four variables we tried to investigate the set of candidates.",
        "The difficulty of this task comes from the high number of candidates, so we decided to work on smaller sets.",
        "We divided the whole set of candidates into six subsets depending on the number of occurrences of the candidate (respectively with a number of occurrences in the text equal to 2, 3, 4, 5, between 6 and 10, and over 10).",
        "This division was used to counterbalance the fact that most scores tend to privilege low frequencies.",
        "We then visualized the candidates graphically (with different tick marks distinguishing terms and non-terms) on several two-dimensional diagrams, the axis of which are linear combinations of the different variables.",
        "The results show series of marks overlapping each other, without any clear separation between terms and non-terms.",
        "The PCA allowed us to go further in the study of the statistical scores, and confirmed that only a few are relevant to our task; moreover, we found no satisfactory combination of variables that could account for termhood."
