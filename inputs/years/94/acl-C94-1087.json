        "The two-level morphology model (Koskenniemi, 1983; Antworth, 1990; Barton, 1986; Ritchie, 1991; Sproat, 1992) is a well-known computational model of morphology, winch has adaptability as well as simplicity.",
        "In practice, this model has been successfully applied to several languages including Finnish, English, Japanese, Russian, and French.",
        "However, the two-level model has been considered to be inappropriate for Korean (Kang, 1992; Kwon, 1991).",
        "That is, the two-level morphological analysis of Korean is believed to be difficult and infeasible because the complex conjugation (inflection) and agglutination in word formation, and the syllable-based representation of words may lead to a huge number of two-level morphological rules.",
        "In this paper, we show that the two-level model can be successfully applied to Korean and its rule size is limited to only 52.",
        "This paper presents a successful two-level system for Korean morphological analysis.",
        "The system was based on a shareware PC-KIMMO (Antworth, 1990); however, we extended the I/O component of PC-KIMMO to handle Korean alphabet IIANGUL; we constructed a Korean dictionary and a Korean morphological grammar (i.e., morphotactics and spelling rules) for the PG-KIMMO; we also used a shareware 'WEN (Miles, 1991) to translate the linguistic spelling rules into the executable automata (i.e., finite state transducers (FSTs)).",
        "This paper focuses on tile dictionary and the morphological grammar for Korean."

      "text": [
        "The two level model is concerned with directly mapping between two representations of a word: (1) the surface form (SF) as it appears in the text, and (2) the lexical form (LE) which is represented as a sequence of basic morphs and diacritics (e.g., `+' to mark morpheme boundary and `#' for word boundary).",
        "As a result, an input word in the two-level model is analyzed by mapping the word itself (SF) to a sequence of lexical forms in dictionary without intermediate stages.",
        "in this section, we present a two-level representation of Korean words.",
        "To understand the two-level description for Korean morphology, one should be properly familiar with Korean alphabet and their transcription system.",
        "So we first describe them.",
        "For ordinary writing system, the Korean alphabet consists of 40 letters: 10 pure vowels, 11 compound vowels, 14 basic consonants and 5 double consonants.",
        "A Korean word is represented with a sequence of syllables; a syllable can be made up of a consonant, a vowel, and a consonant; there are several forms of syllables (e.g., CV, CVC, VC, V, and C forms); and initial consonant letter may riot be distinguished from final consonant letter.",
        "However, the initial consonant and the final consonant must be distinguished from each other for successful two-level",
        "system; if not, it might cause a lot of useless work (i.e., invalid mapping) and incorrect results because i-th consonant in a word is not clear whether it is an initial consonant or a final consonant.",
        "Furthermore, to write two-level spelling rules for PC-KIMMO, each of Korean alphabet must be mapped to ASCII character on the keyboard.",
        "Therefore, we devised a transcription system for Korean alphabet as shown in Table 1, which has the following features:",
        "• There is no letter corresponding to the initial consonant 0'.",
        "We did not consider the letter because it is a sort of an orthographic filler for the ordinary writing system and is not pronounced.",
        "• The initial consonant letters arc not the same as the final consonant letters.",
        "(To see this, compare the initial consonants MYCODE(I) with the final consonants MYCODE(F) in Table 1.)",
        "• Each of compound vowels is represented by a pair of two letters: a semi-vowel letter (i.e., y or w) and one of pure vowel letters excluding '41' and 'SI ; here cql' and '-91' arc treated as the compound vowels.",
        "• There are two archiphoneme letters: (1) the archiphoneme A for the proper treatment of vowel harmony', which can be changed into NULL",
        "1Modern Korean has a \"diagonal\" vowel harmony (Alm, 1985) kept in only one area of word formation, that is, between the final vowel of a verbal stem and the following a-initial suffix.",
        "This system works in the n-initial suffix symbol 0, a vowel letter a, or a vowel letter 9 by context; and (2) the archiphoneme I for the Proper treatment of predicative postposition '01' which can be changed into either 0 or a vowel letter i by context.",
        "We believe that our transcription system makes it simple and clear to describe two-level spelling rules of Korean, and it enables the two-level processor to handle efficiently the complex spelling changes.",
        "Here, three special symbols are used properly to treat lexical irregularities of Korean verbal morphology: + for regularity, X for 'le-irregularity, and $ for all irregularities excluding the `le'-irregularity; X must be differentiated from $ because of the following reasons.",
        "In Korean morphology, most of verbal stems ending in the syllable /6/ are irregular.",
        "The final syllable /11/ of the stem, when followed by the vowel '01' /a/ and preceded by any vowel other than the light vowels ('01-' /a/ and 'S.' /o/), is changed into and the consonant '0 ' Ill is added to the preceding syllable.",
        "We call it `L'-irregularity.",
        "For example, the verb stem /hi-Ii/ (to flow) plus the suffix `01' /a/ (INFINITIVE) becomes the verbal word /hil-14.",
        "However, there is `le'-irregularity which oc-harmony where a has an alternation a if the final vowel of a verbal stem is a light vowel a or o.",
        "For example, the verb stein `3?..' lbol (to see) plus the suffix /a/ (INFINITIVE) becomes the verbal word `3'.01\" lbo-al .",
        "However, the verb stein /cu/ (to give) plus the suffix '01' /a/ (INFINITIVE) becomes the verbal word `i.or /cu-n/.",
        "As a result, the archiphoneme A is used for the initial vowel a of suffixes, which is to distinguish it from a elsewhere.",
        "curs in the same context as '1J-irregularity: it causes only to be changed the following vowel 'or /a/ into aj' /b/; for example, the verb stem '01.!.-J (to arrive) plus the suffix ',I' /a/ (INFINITIVE) becomes the verbal word '01E:31' /i-/i-14.",
        "Therefore, a mechanism is needed to treat them properly.",
        "One of the special symbols is used to represent a specific lexical form, and is almost placed at the end of the lexical form.",
        "For example, the verbal stem gull has two meanings, i.e., \"curved\" as an adjective and \"grill\" as a verb.",
        "In this case, the problem is on the difference between the variation forms for adjective and those for verb; when it is combined with a suffix A, the surface form becomes either the guile as adjective, or the guwe as verb.",
        "To distinguish between them, the following lexical forms can be listed in dictionary: gull+ for regular adjective, and gull$ for 'if-irregular verb."

        "In Korean, sonic verbals ending in the final consonant B are irregular.",
        "The final consonant B of the stein, when followed by a vowel, is changed into w. But it is not changed when followed by a consonant.",

        "In the two-level system, it is represented as follows:",
        "This shows a correspondence between lexical representation and surface representation.",
        "In PC-KIMMO, such a correspondence is represented with the notation lexical character:surface-character like d:d, 0:0, B:w, $:0, +:0, and A:a.",
        "Here the lexical character $ is a signal indicating that a basic word or stem followed by it is irregular, and it corresponds to a surface 0 (the NULL symbol) which is not printed in the output form.",
        "The lexical (a morpheme boundary symbol) also corresponds to a surface 0.",
        "The above alternation may be described as the following two-level rule: B:w tn> $:0 +:0 A:0 (13 Variation Rule) This rule states that a lexical B is realized as a surface w if and only if it is followed by the conjugation information $, the morpheme boundary +, and a linking suffix A.",
        "A surface @ in the above rule stands for any alphabetic character that constitutes a feasible pair with a lexical A.",

        "We have shown that the two-level morphology model, which has been claimed to be inappropriate for Korean, can be successfully applied to Korean.",

        "This system was based on PC-KIMMO which is a shareware.",
        "However, we modified the I/O component of PC-KIMMO to handle Korean alphabet HANGUL; we have constructed a Korean dictionary for the PC-KIMMO, which contains about 12,000 entries; we represented a Korean morphotactics for the PC-KIMMO, which indicates the morphological structures of known words; we wrote 52 two-level spelling rules for the PC-KIMMO, which recover almost all spelling alternations in Korean morphology.",
        "Our two-level system has been experimented with 2,172 randomly words selected from Korean textbooks (413,975 words) for elementary education.",
        "For this test set, the system produces the correct outputs although it includes about 5% extra incorrect analyses (i.e., overgeneration).",
        "here the overgeneration is ascribed to the fact that it results from the weak expressive power of morphotactic information in PC-KIMMO."
