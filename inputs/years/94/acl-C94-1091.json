        "Basically, there is no exact rule for classifier selection.",
        "As far as we can do in the rule-based approach is to give a default rule to pick up a corresponding classifier of each noun.",

        "A classifier has a significant use in Thai language for construction of noun or verb to express quantity, determination, pronoun, etc.",
        "By far the most common use of classifiers, however, is in enumerations, where the classifiers follow numerals and precede demonstratives (Noss,1964).",
        "Not all types of classifier have a relationship with noun or verb as a unit classifier does.",
        "A unit classifier is any classifier which has a special relationship with one or more concrete nouns.",
        "For example, to enumerate members of the class of /rya/ 'boats', the unit classifier /lam/ is selected as in the phrase below:",
        "/rya nung lam/ boat one <boat> 'one boat'.",
        "Other than the unit classifier, there are collective classifier, metric classifier, frequency classifier and verbal classifier.",
        "A collective classifier is any classifier which shows general group or set of mass nouns, un 4YU4 dl /nok Soong fung/ 'two flocks of bird'.",
        "A metric classifier is any classifier which occurs in enumerations that modify predicates as well as nouns, 11-1 mu /nam saam kaew/ 'three glasses of water'.",
        "A frequency classifier is any classifier which is used to express the frequency of event that occurs, Ciu .amu Thin sii roob/ 'fly four rounds'.",
        "A verbal classifier is any classifier which is derived from a verb and usually used in construction with mass nouns, fInfilli 'i /kradaad has muan/ 'five rolls of paper'.",
        "The unit classifier has a special relationship with concrete noun.",
        "The member of this class of classifier is closed for each noun.",
        "Most of the unit classifiers are used with a great many concrete nouns of very different meaning, but few are restricted to a single noun.",
        "Except for the unit classifier, the members of classifier for a noun or predicate are open.",
        "Especially for the metric classifier, the number of classifiers for numeral expression of distance, size, weight, container and value is large.",
        "The use of classifier in Thai is not limited to the numeral expression but is extended to other expressions such as ordinal, determination, relative pronoun, pronoun, etc.",
        "The detail of each classifier phrase is described in the next section.",
        "In many existing natural language processing systems, the list of available classifiers for each noun is attached to a lexicon base.",
        "Rules for classifier selection from the list can somehow provide the",
        "default value but does not guarantee the appropriateness.",
        "However, the problems on classifier phrase construction still remain unsolved.",
        "To overcome the problems of using classifiers, we propose a method of classifier phrase extracting from a large corpus.",
        "As a result, Noun-Classifier Associations (described in Section 3) is statistically created to define the relationship between a noun and a classifier in a classifier phrase.",
        "With the frequency of the occurrence of a classifier in a classifier phrase, we can propose the most appropriate use of a classifier.",
        "Furthermore, we introduce a hierarchy of semantic class for the induction of a classifier class when they are employed to construct with nouns which belong to the same class of meaning.",
        "Section 3 and Section 4 describe the generation and the implementation of the NCA, respectively."
