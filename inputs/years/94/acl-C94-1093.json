        "Recently, many natural language processing researchers have concentrated on corpus-based approaches.",
        "Linguistic corpora can be classified as word-segmented corpora, part-of-speech tagged corpora, and parsed corpora.",
        "I3ecause a part-of-speech tagged corpus is the most important corpus, much corpus-based natural language processing research has been performed using part-of-speech tagged corpora.",
        "However, building a large part-of-speech tagged corpus is very difficult.",
        "It is even more difficult to build a corpus for languages without explicit word boundary characters, such as Japanese.",
        "Therefore, researchers always complain of the scarcity of data in the corpus.",
        "To solve this data scarcity problem, previous works proposed methods of increasing the productivity of the labor required for building a part-of-speech tagged corpus.",
        "[1].",
        "This paper proposes another method of acquiring large part-of-speech tagged corpora: restructuring tagged corpora by using morpheme adjustment rules.",
        "This method assures good use of the sharable part-of-speech tagged corpora that are already available such as the ATR Dialog Database (ADD) [2; 3].",
        "Ideally, these corpora could be used by all researchers and research groups without any modifications.",
        "However, actual part-of-speech tagged corpora have the following problems:",
        "• Diversity of orthography:",
        "A word can be spelled in various ways.",
        "In Japanese, there are three types of character sets: kanji hiragana z)::&), and katakana ()2 )2'31.",
        "Also, people can use these character sets at their discretion.",
        "• Diversity of word segmentation:",
        "Because the Japanese language has no word boundary characters(i.e. blank spaces), there are no standards of word segmentation.",
        "A single word in a certain corpus may be considered multiple words in other corpora, and vice versa.",
        "• Diversity of part-of-speech systems:",
        "There are no standards for part-of-speech systems.",
        "IL is true that a detailed part-of-speech system can help the application of part-of-speech information, but the labor required for building corpora will continue to increase.",
        "This problem is language-independent.",
        "Diversities of word-segmentation and part-of-speech systems are fatal problems.",
        "The simplest way to solve these problems is to perform a morphological analysis on the raw text in the corpus, with no regard to the word-segmentation and part-of-speech information.",
        "tIowever, making a high-quality morphological analyzer demands much time and care.",
        "Additionally, it is wasteful to ignore the word-segmentation and part-of-speech information that has been acquired with much effort.",
        "In restructuring tagged corpora with morpheme adjustment rules, the word-segmentation and part-of-speech information of the original corpus is rewritten, making good use of the original corpus information.",
        "This method is characterized by reduced manual effort.",
