        "Self-repair (Levelt 1988) is a repair of utterance by speaker him/herself.",
        "A human speaker makes self-repairs very frequently in spontaneous speech.",
        " (Blackmer and Mit-ton 1991) reported that self-repairs are made once every 4.8 seconds in dialogues taken from radio talk shows.",
        "Self-repair is one kind of \"permissible ill-formedness\", that is a human listener can feel ill-formedness in it but he/she is able to recognize its intended meaning.",
        "Thus your partner does not need to interrupt dialogue.",
        "How do you feel if your partner interrupts dialogue every 5 seconds to ask \"What do you mean?\"",
        "or so?",
        "You will give up dialogue or choose means of writing.",
        "Speaking without self-repair is the most difficult modality of natural language communication.",
        "The goal of our work is to make a dialogue system coping with self-repaired utterances.",
        "In this paper we propose a parser called SERUP (SElf-Repaired Utterance Parser), which plays a major part in understanding a self-repaired utterance.",
        "That is, because our approach is to translate a self-repaired utterance (Ex.1) into a well-formed version that does not contain self-repair (Ex.2) and parse the well-formed one, we do not need to change the subsequent processes.",
        "SERUP uses some linguistic clues to translate utterances, those include a repetition, an unknown word and/or an isolated word.",
        "We describe how SERUP uses these clues.",
        "To evaluate SERUP, we analyze a large corpus that contains spontaneous dialogues over telephone.",
        "From the result, we estimate that SERUP works well with 88.1 % of 1,082 self-repairs in the corpus."

        " (Hindle 1983) and (Langer 1990) proposed parsers coping with self-repaired utterances.",
        "But they assumed that an interruption point has already been detected.",
        "Hindle thought prosodic; cues can be used in detection, but it is not clear if they can always succeed.",
        "Langer thought editing expressions can be used, but they are not always used in self-repair.",
        "Recently, (Shriberg, Bear, and Dowding 1992) proposed a pattern matching method and used it in GEMINI system (Dowding et al.",
        "1993).",
        "This is similar to our method, but the corpus (MADCOW 1992) used is less spontaneous than ours.",
        " (Subjects pressed a button to begin speaking to the system) (Nakata.ni and Hirschberg 1993) proposed a speech-first method in which prosodic cues are used mainly.",
        "We also think prosodic cues are important.",
        "But we think people use linguistic cues mainly because they can understand self-repaired utterances in transcripts.",
        "All these works are done on English.",
        " (Langer also treats Germany) Because there are many syntactic differences (e.g., left branching v.s.",
        "right branching), it is not",
        "clear if their approach is applicable to Japanese."

        "Fig. 1 shows the outline of SERUP.",
        "Normal Parser is a parser that parses well-formed utterances.",
        "When Normal Parser fails to parse an utterance, the utterance is passed to SR-reconstructor that detects a self-repair in it and translates it into well-formed version.",
        "The translated utterance is returned to Normal Parser and parsed again.",
        "Because an utterance can contain two or more self-repairs, translation is repeated until Normal Parser succeeds in parsing or translation fails.",
        "In the latter case, the utterance has another ill-formedness or self-repair that the SR-reconstructor cannot cope with.",
        "There are two main problems in translation.",
        "One is to determine an interruption point, and the other is to determine a reparandum.",
        "If these two problems can be solved, then the process of translation is carried out as follows.",
        "1..",
        "Remove editing expressions such as en, no, I mean.",
        "2.",
        "Supersede the reparandum with repair part.",

        "Categories printed in italics have no clue, i.e., SERUP fails to parse utterances in those categories.",
        "with repetition A self-repair is mostly made in a way to repair a word or a phrase just before an inter-ruption (Levelt 1988).",
        "So words or phrases around an interruption are in the same category.",
        "For example, in [Ex.1.]",
        "speaker repairs a prepositional phrase \"from green left to pink\" to \"from blue left to pink\", It is rare that he/she just repairs a noun \"green\" to \"blue\".",
        "In such self-repairs, a repetition of a word or a phrase often exists.",
        "In self-repairs which are intended to correct an error (such as [Ex.i]), words or phrases around the error may be repeated.",
        "In [Ex.",
        "fl, \"from\" and \"left to pink\" are repeated.",

        "[Ex.3] I want a light, one way flight (from (Shriberg, Bear, and Dowding 1992)) In this example a word \"flight\" is repeated.",
        "A repetition is made with the same constituent or an item in the same category, such as \"orange\" with \"apple\".",
        "There are four possible structures around an interruption of a self-repair with a repetition.",

        "SERUM can cope with cases A, II and C. with syntactic break A self-repair comes with an interruption of utterance.",
        "Because an interruption may occur anywhere in an utterance (even within a word), self-repaired utterance can contain a syntactic break.",

        "same fragment repetition When a speaker interrupts an utterance within a word, a fragment of the interrupted word is left.",
        "But lie/she sometimes starts the repair with a word that begins with the same fragment as in [Ex A].",
        "This can be treated as A repetition, but to investigate a within-word interruption, we treated it as a separate category.",
        "In this case, an interruption point is just after a repeated fragment.",
        "And if within-word interruptions are only made to repair an interrupted word, a reparandum can be identified as the repeated fragment.",

        "In this case, an interruption point is just after an unknown word.",
        "And the reparandum can be determined if the same condition as the above case is sufficed.",
        "with isolated word A fragment left by a within-word interruption is not always detected as the same fragment repetition or an unknown word.",
        "For example, a fragment \"lion\" can be left when \"hontou\" (real) is interrupted, but this string can be a word meaning \"book\".",
        "But such a word is always \"isolated\", that is, both two subtrees in fig3 fail.",
        "fn tins case, an interruption point is just after an isolated word.",
        "And reparandum can be determined if the same condition as the above case is sufficed.",
        "without repetition of a stem Because Japanese inflectional morphology is complicated, speakers often make inflection errors.",
        "To repair such errors a speaker often starts a. repair without repetition of a stern as in [Fx.rd not as in [Ex.6].",
        "In these examples, \"itada\" is a Stein and the speaker first tries to say \"itada i ta\" or \"itada.",
        "i te\" and then changes to \"itada kern\".",
        "In the case of [Fx.6], a repetition of a stern can be used as a clue.",
