        "The main purpose of this paper is to describe the CLAWS4 general-purpose grammatical tagger, used for the tagging of the 100-million-word British National Corpus, of which c.70 million words have been tagged at the time of writing (April 1994).",
        "We will emphasise the goals of (a) general-purpose adaptability, (b) incorporation of linguistic knowledge to improve quality and consistency, and (c) accuracy, measured consistently and in a linguistically informed way.",
        "The British National Corpus (BNC) consists of c.100 million words of English written texts and spoken transcriptions, sampled from a comprehensive range of text types.",
        "The BNC includes 10 million words of spoken language, c.45% of which is impromptu conversation (see Crowdy, forthcoming).",
        "It also includes an immense variety of written texts, including unpublished materials.",
        "The grammatical tagging of the corpus has therefore required the 'super-robustness' of a tagger which can adapt well to virtually all kinds of text.",
        "The tagger also has had to be versatile in dealing with different tagsets (sets of grammatical category labels â€“ see 3 below) and accepting text in varied input formats.",
        "For the purposes of the BNC, the tagger has been required both to accept and to output text in a corpus-oriented TEI-confonnant mark-up definition known as CDIF (Corpus Document Interchange Format), but within this format many variant formats (affecting, for example, segmentation into words and sentences) can be readily accepted.",
        "In addition, CLAWS allows variable output formats: for the current tagger, these include (a) a vertically-presented format suitable for manual editing, and (b) a more compact horizontally-presented format often more suitable for end-users.",
        "1 The BNC is the result of a collaboration, supported by the Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC Grant No. GR/F99847) and the UK Department of Trade and Industry, between Oxford University Press (lead partner), Longman Group Ltd., ChambersHarrap, Oxford University Computer Services, the British Library and Lancaster University.",
        "We thank Elizabeth Eyes, Nick Smith, and Andrew Wilson for their valuable help in the preparation of this paper.",
        "Alternative output formats are also allowed with (c) so-called 'portmanteau tags', i.e. combinations of two alternative tags, where the tagger calculates there is insufficient evidence for safe disambiguation, and (d) with simplified 'plain text' mark-up for the human reader.",
        "(See Tables 1 and 2 for examples of output formats.)",
        "CLAWS4, the BNC tagger,2 incorporates many features of adaptability such as the above.",
        "It also incorporates many refinements of linguistic analysis which have built up over 14 years: particularly in the construction and content of the idiom-tagging component (see 2 below).",
        "At the same time, there are still many improvements to be made: the claim that 'you can put together a tagger from scratch in a couple of months' (recently heard at a research conference) is, in our view, absurdly optimistic."

      "heading": "2 THE DESIGN OF THE GRAMMATICAL TAGGER (CLAWS4)",
      "text": [
        "The CLAWS4 tagger is a successor of the CLAWS 1 tagger described in outline in Marshall (1983), and more fully in Garside et al. (1987), and has the same basic architecture.",
        "The system (if we include input and output procedures) has five major sections: (a) segmentation of text into word and sentence units (h) initial (non-contextual) part-of-speech assignment [using a lexicon, word-ending list, and various sets of rules for tagging unknown items]",
        "(c) rule-driven contextual part-of-speech assignment (d) probabilistic tag disambiguation [Markov process] [(c') second pass of (c)] (e) output in intermediate form.",
        "The intermediate form of text output is the form suitable for post-editing (see 1 above; also Table 1), which can then be converted into other formats according to particular output needs, as already noted.",
        "The pm-processing section (a) is not trivial, since, in any large and varied corpus, there is a need to handle unusual text structures (such as those of many popular and technical magazines), less usual graphic features (e.g. non-roman alphabetic characters, mathematical symbols), and features of conversation transcriptions: e.g. false starts, incomplete words and utterances, unusual expletives, unplanned repetitions, and (sometimes multiple) overlapping speech.",
        "Sections (b) and (d) apply essentially a Hidden Markov Model (IIMM) to the assignment and disambiguation of tags.",
        "But the intervening section (c) has become increasingly important as CLAWS4 has developed the need for versatility across a range of text types.",
        "This task of rule-driven contextual part-of-speech assignment began in 1981 as an 'idiomtagging' program for dealing, in the main, with parts of speech extending over more than one orthographic word (e.g. complex prepositions such as according to and complex conjunctions such as so that).",
        "In the more fully developed form it now has, this section utilises several different idiom lexicons dealing, for example, with (i) general idioms such as as much as (which is on one analysis a single coordinator, and on another analysis, a word sequence), (ii) complex names such as Dodge City and Mrs Charlotte Green (where the capital letter alone would not be enough to show that Dodge mid Green are proper nouns), (iii) foreign expressions such as annus horribilis.",
        "These idiom lexicons (with over 3000 entries in all) can match on both tags and word-tokens, employing a regular expression formalism at the level both of the individual item and of the sequence of items.",
        "Recognition of unspecified words with initial capitals is also incorporated.",
        "Conceptually, each entry has two parts: (a) a regular-expression-based 'template' specifying a set of conditions on sequences of word-tag pairs, and (b) a set of tag assignments or substitutions to be performed on any sequence matching the set of conditions in (a).",
        "Examples of entries from each of the above kinds of idiom lexicon entry are:",
        "(i) did/do/does, ([XXO/AVO/ORD])2, [VVB] VVI (ii) Monte/Mount/Mt NPO, ([WIC1)2 NPO, [WIC] NPO (iii) ad AV021 AJ021, hoc AV022 AJ022 Explanatory note: (a) Symbolic formalism:",
        "Let TT be any tag, and let ww be any word.",
        "Let n,ni be arbitrary integers.",
        "Then: ww TT represents a word and its associated tag , separates a word from its predecessor [TI'] represents an already assigned tag [WIC] represents an unspecified word with a Word Initial Capital TT/TT means 'either TT or IT'; ww/ww means 'either ww or ww' ww rrrr represents an unresolved ambiguity between TT and TT TT* represents a tag with * marking the location of unspecified characters ([11])n represents the number of words (up to n) which may optionally intervene at a given point in the template TTnin represents the 'ditto tag' attached to an orthographic word to indicate it is part of a complex sequence (e.g.so that is tagged so CJS21 , that CJS22).",
        "The variable n indicates the number of orthographic words in the sequence, and m indicates that the current word is in the mth position in that sequence.",
        "(b) Examples of word lags (in the C5 'basic' tagsct): AD adjective (unmarked)",
        "AVO adverb (unmarked) CJS subordinating conjunction NEU proper noun ORI) ordinal number VVB finite base form of lexical verb VVI infinitive of lexical verb XXO negative marker: not or n't",
        "(c) Explanation of the three rules above:",
        "Rule (i) ensures that following a finite form of do and (optionally) up to two adverbs, negators or ordinals, a base form of the verb is tagged as an infinitive.",
        "Rule (ii) ensures that in complex names such as Monte Alegre, Mount Pleasant, Mount Palomar Observatory, Mt Rushmore National Memorial, all the words with word-initial caps are tagged as proper nouns.",
        "Rule (iii) ensures that the Latin expression ad hoc is tagged as a single word, either an adjective or an adverb.",
        "We have also now moved to a more complex, two-pass application of these idiomlist entries.",
        "It is possible, on the first pass, to specify ambiguous output of an idiom assignment (as is necessary, e.g., for as much as, mentioned earlier), so that this can then be input to the probabilistic disambiguation process (d).",
        "On the second pass, however, after probabilistic disambiguation, the idiom entry is deterministic in both its input and output conditions, replacing one or more tags by others.",
        "In effect, this last kind of idiom application is used to correct a tagging error arising from earlier procedures.",
        "For example, a not uncommon result from Sections (a)-(d) is that the base form of the verb (e.g. carry) is wrongly tagged as a finite present tense form, rather than an infinitive.",
        "This can be retrospectively corrected by replacing VVB (= finite base form) by VVI (= infinitive) in appropriate circumstances.",
        "While the HMM-type process employed in Sections (b) and (d) affirms our faith in probabilistic methods, the growing importance of the contextual part-of-speech assignment in (c) and (c') demonstrates the extent to which it is important to transcend the limitations of the orthographic word, as the basic unit of grammatical tagging, and also to selectively adopt non-probabilistic solutions.",
        "The term 'idiom-tagging' originally used was never particularly appropriate for these sections, which now handle more generally the interdependence between grammatical and lexical processing which NLP systems ultimately have to cope with, and are also able to incorporate parsing information beyond the range of the one-step Markov process (based on tag bi-gram frequences) employed in (d).3 Perhaps the term 'phraseological component' would be more appropriate here.",
        "The need to combine probabilistic 3We have experimented with a two-step Markov process model (using tag trigrams), and found little benefit over the one-step model (using tag bigrams).",
        "and non-probabilistic methods in tagging has been widely noted (see, e.g., Voutilainen et al.",
        "1992:14)."

      "heading": "3 EXTENDING ADAPTABILITY: SPOKEN DATA AND TAGSETS",
      "text": [
        "The tagging of 10 million words of spoken data (including c.4.6 million words of conversation) presents particular challenges to the versatility of the system: renderings of spoken pronunciations such as 'avin' (for having) cause difficulties, as do unplanned repetitions such as I el; mean, I mean, I mean to go.",
        "Our solution to the latter problem has been to recognize such repetitions by a special procedure, and to disregard, in most cases, the repeated occurrences of the same word or phrase for the purposes of tagging.",
        "It has become clear that the CLAWS4 resources (lexicon, idiomlists, and tag transition matrix), developed for written English, need to be adapted if certain frequent and rather consistent errors in the tagging of spoken data are to be avoided (words such as I, well, and right are often wrongly tagged, because their distribution in conversation differs markedly from that in written texts).",
        "We have moved in this direction by allowing CLAWS4 to 'slot in' different resources according to the text type being processed, by e.g. providing a separate supplementary lexicon and idiomlist for the spoken material.",
        "Eventually, probabilistic analysis of the tagged BNC will provide the necessary information for adapting datastructures at run time to the special demands of particular types of data, but there is much work to be done before this potential benefit of having tagged a large corpus is realised.",
        "The BNC tagging takes place within the context of a larger project, in which a major task (undertaken by OUCS at Oxford) is to encode the texts in a TEI-conformant mark-up (CDIF).",
        "Two tagscts have been employed: one, more detailed than the other, is used for tagging a 2-million-word Core Corpus (an epitome of the whole BNC), which is being post-edited for maximum accuracy.",
        "Thus tagscts, like text formats and resources, are among the features which are task-definable in CLAWS4.",
        "In general, the system has been revised to allow many adaptive decisions to be made at run time, and to render it suitable for non-specialist researchers to use."

        "For example, is horrifying in a horrifying adventure, or washing in a washing machine an adjective, a noun, or a verb participle?",
        "Only if this is specified independently, by an annotation scheme, can we feel confident in judging where the tagger is 'correct' or 'incorrect'.",
        "For the tagging of the LOB Corpus by the earliest version of CLAWS, the annotation scheme was published in some detail (Johansson et al. 1986).",
        "We are working on a similar annotation scheme document (at present a growing in-house document) for the tagging of the BNC.",
        "4,1'he error rate and ambiguity rate are less favourable if we take account of errors and ambiguities which occur within major categories.",
        "E.g. the portmanteau tag NPO-NN1 records confidently that a word is a noun, but not whether it is a proper or common noun.",
        "If such cases are added to the count, then the estimated error rate rises to 1.78%, and the estimated ambiguity rate to 4.60%.",
        "5One reasonable attempt to evaluate competing accuracy of different loggers is that in Voutilainen et al. (1992:11-13), where it is argued, on the basis of the tagging of sample written texts, that the performance of the Helsinki constraint grammar parser ENGCG is superior to that of CLAWS 1 (the earliest version of CLAWS, completed in 1983), which is in turn is somewhat superior to Church's Parts tagger.",
        "While recognizing that the accuracy of the Helsinki system is impressive, we note also that the method of evaluation (in terms of 'precision' and `recall') employed by Voutilainen et al. in not easy to compare with the method employed here.",
        "Further, a strict attempt at measuring comparability would have to take fuller account of the `consistency' and 'quality' criteria we mention, and of the need to compare across a broader range of texts, spoken and written.",
