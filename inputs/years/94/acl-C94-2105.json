        "Text interpretation research has recently come to focus on data extraction the problem of producing structured information from free text, usually to populate a database.",

        "Data extraction is at the center of the problem of managing large vol II nes of text.",
        "Our group has led data extraction work for a number of years, developing new architectures and lexicons for natural language processing and testing these methods in a variety of applications [Jacobs and Rau, 1993; Jacobs, 1990; Jacobs and Kau, 1990].",
        "In the last two years, as part of the U.S. government's ARTA TIPSTER, program, we have extended this research to handle broader domains, with higher accuracy, and to process texts in multiple languages [Jacobs el al., 1993].",
        "The goal of processing texts in a new language is not only to show that lire basic algorithms are language-independent, brit also to preserve as much knowledge as possible across languages, and, where applicable, across domains.",
        "Ifor example, in adapting an English system to handle Japanese texts, it, is important that the Japanese system configuration makes use as mach as possible of the general knowledge, and oven the English vocabulary, that the system has.",

        "51100 UN is unique in a number of ways, but it is particularly distinguished by the sharing of knowledge resources in different languages.",
        "The approach to multilingual interpretation involves two key elements: First, the system includes a core ontology of about 1,000 concepts that support word sermon in the core Eliglish and 'Japanese lexicons, which are also identical in structure.",
        "Second, our system acquires much of its domain-specific knowledge, including combinations of words and phrases, front corpus data, easing the mapping of word class information into a new language.",
        "For example, the Eitglish verb establish corresponds very closely to the Japanese word SOSTITIISU (AA).",
        "In the TIPSTER domani of joint ventures, both establish and scisurittat are used to describe the creation of companies (\"establish a joint, venture\"), products (\"establish a telecominunicat ions and data network\"), facilities (\"establish a factory\"), and other more abstract concepts (e.g. \"establish a, stronger foothold in Europe\").",
        "'Jibe TIPSTER, task, which requires distinct information for companies, facilities, activities, and products, In alws it crucial to distinguish these different word usages regardless of language.",
        "Slf00 U VS results on the final TI PS'Ilat benchmark compared very favorably to those of other systems [Jacobs et al., 1993].",
        "There are many different ways to view and analyze the many different benchmark statistics, but the area in which S 00-UN's approach was most clearly distinguished was hr recall – the percentage of data from each test set that was correctly extracted by the program.",
        "On this measure, 5110GUN extracted, on average, 37% more correct in-fOrmation than any other system in any configuration.",
        "SHOGUN had somewhat lower precision (13% lower on average) than the highest; precision system in each configuration, meaning that S1100 UN also produced a somewhat larger amount, of incorrect information than other systems.",
        "The system, in both languages, often identified information that was not, found by any other system, a result that we attribute to having better coverage in its knowledge base than other systems.",

        "TIPSTER is a program of the U.S. government Advanced Research Projects Agency (A RPA).",
        "** To emphasize portability across languages and domains, the teams in TIPSTER, data extraction were required to develop capabilities and perform benchmark tests in two languages English and Japanese and two domains – microelectronics and joint ventures-resulting in four sets of benchmark results in each evaluation.",
        "The final evaluation, known as MUC-5 [Sundheim, 1993], was held in August, 1993, and included the four TIPSTER data extraction contractors as well as 13 other sites from four countries.",
        "Figure I illustrates the basic TIPSTER data extraction task.",
        "In each configuration, systems process a set of texts and produce a set of database entries, or templates.",
        "The templates arc specified as part of each domain; thus the Japanese templates in the joint venture domain are almost identical in structure to the English joint venture templates.",
        "The task, for each text, combines the recognition of high-level concepts (such as the identification of a joint venture in a text)",
        "with the discrimination of the meaning of individual phrases (such as descriptions of products) and the resolution of references.",
        "For example, Figure 2 shows a very simple example of a production joint venture between two companies.",
        "For each of these texts, the data that must be extracted includes the generation of typed objects (such as entities and relationships) and slot fills that incorporate information, either directly or through inferences, from the texts.",
        "Much of this information comes from the recognition of high-level entities and relationships such as that shown in Figure 1.",
        "The rest, includes much more detailed information, such as the activity, facilities and financing involved in a joint venture.",
        "Figure 3 shows this part of the information for the sample text, in the format of the actual correct responses, with italicized annotations to show where the information conies from in the example.",
        "The slot fills in '.1.IPS1.'FR templates include \"set fills\"--drawn from a fixed list, such as the text code PRODUCTION for manufacturing arid the numerical code 20 (\"Food and kindred products\")*** for processed food production, \"string fills\"- drawn from the ac-***The numerical codes for the PRODUCT/SERVICE slot (and the comparable WA 'A slot in Japanese) use the major groupings of the U. S. government Standard Industry Classification (SIC) scheme.",
        "tual text, such as \"SOY SAUCE\", pointers to other objects such as <ENTITY-0659-1> and a variety of \"normalized\" fills such as Taiwan (COUNTRY).",
        "The set fills often capture local information in the text, while the objects (consisting of au identifier with a related template fills) often involve inferences from many different parts of the text.",
        "Kr example, in this case, the object ACTIVITY-0659-1 reflects the fairly subtle distinction that the venture will he manufacturing soy sauce at President Enterprises' plant (the result of reference resolution) but that the sales will be carried oat somewhere else in Taiwan (the result of a real inference), In this part of the task, major object-level decisions often hinge on the interpretation of the individual words, making the task very lexicon-intensive.",
        "Interpreting the activity information; that is, identifying what each venture is doing along with the appropriate products and codes, requires knowledge about word usage in context.",
        "Activity words like build, esiablish, and create are just as common as words like produce and manufacture.",
        "In many cases, whether something is a joint venture activity or not.",
        "depends on a fairly detailed analysis of these words `'building a factory\" is different from \"building a new plane\", \"building a business\", and of course, from \"building a presence\".",
        "These similar phrases can not only evoke different product, codes, but also can often affec, the high-level construal of a. story.",
        "The interpretations of word senses come together with domain_ and task knowledge in extracting the appropriate Utformation from these phrases.",
        "Because one of the goals of this project.",
        "was to develop methods of handling new donittins and Ian - guages, it, was important to cope with these crucial differences in word usage in a general way.",
        "This meant partitioning the knowledge of the system into four components: (I) generic, (2) domain-dependent, (:i) language--dependent, and (4) domain-and-language-dependent.",
        "With the detail of analysis that parts of the task require, such as those described above, it, is essential not only to minimize the amount of knowledge that, is dependent, on either language or domain, but also to minimize the effort of acquiring knowledge that, is dependent on either domain or language, and, especially, knowledge that, is dependent, on both.",

        "We also presented our approach to the task by explaining the synergistic objectives of creating generic resources and developing knowledge acquisition methods.",
        "This section will focus on the generic resources, while the next section will concentrate on acquisition methods.",
        "The main generic resource of SHOGUN is its core ontology of about 1,000 concepts, which was developed to support GE's NIlloolset lexicon [Jacobs and Rau, 1993; McRoy, 1992] and had been tested fairly thoroughly on a variety of data extraction tasks prior to TIPSTER.",
        "We augmented the core ontology using the CMU ontology from machine translation [KI3M, 1989] and used the extended ontology as the basis for Japanese lexicon development.",
        "The idea of this effort was that the Japanese lexicon would mirror the existing English lexicon, allowing for sharing of the domain-independent components of the knowledge base across languages as well as the sharing of any domain-specific knowledge that would be added.",
        "For example, the following is the English entry for the verb establish and its related forms:",
        "The Japanese lexicon now consists of about 13,000 words.",
        "This is somewhat more than the 10,000 unique roots of the English lexicon, but the English lexicon is still much richer in morphology and more thoroughly tested than the Japanese.",
        "Nevertheless, the two lexicons are roughly comparable and certainly compatible.",
        "For example, the Japanese entry for seisuritsu",
        "The main link between the English and Japanese lexicons is through the : PAR field (for parent) in each word sense, which joins that sense to its parent in the ontology.",
        "In this case, the common parent between establish and setsu•itsu, c-causal-event (the bringing about of events or effects), is a fairly general category that includes two senses of open as well as a variety of others like duplicate and bridge.",
        "The reason that establish ends up in this general class is that it is very hard to confine any sense of the word to creation events.",
        "Having a shared ontology and lexicon format has certain advantages.",
        "It is a requirement for using a common language processing framework across languages, and it ensures that words with similar meanings in different languages end up with similar representations and ontological restrictions.",

        "Because many of these facts are at the intersection of world knowledge and word knowledge (that is, they are patterns of language use that reflect real-word concepts).",
        "even the most specific pieces of knowledge often seem to apply across languages.",
        "The degree to which ontology contributes to interpretation in any particular domain was, in general, somewhat less than we might have expected.",
        "For example, the category c-causal-event includes not only words that don't have anything to do with joint ventures, but also words that in the joint venture domain could be misinterpreted.",

        "As we have pointed out, words like establish and selsuritsu are so critical to the understanding of joint ventures that knowledge about such words can be hand coded for each language and domain.",
        "However, doing this hand-coding for many aspects of the TIPST:10.1i, task would not only involve an extraordinary amount of effort, hut it would thwart one of the main objectives of the project to develop methods that ease portability across languages and domains.",
        "Our \"middle ground\" solution to capturing the more specialized knowledge, relying neither on generic knowledge nor on language-specific encodings, was to create word classes to represent the information needed in the TIPSTER, data extraction task, to apply these word classes across languages, and to expand them using automated corpus analysis.",
        "We observed that, although Japanese and English had different vocabularies and properties, the usage of words in each Japanese corpus was very similar to the usage of comparable English words in corpora from the same domani.",
        "Iror example, the word equipmcnt in English joint ventures is very similar to the word souchi (V) in Japanese, and the task-specific distinctions are the same in English and Japanese (e.g., the distinctions among medical equipment, transportation equipment„ and electrical equipment).",
        "We took advantage of this observation in developing a two--stage process of developing word groupings across languages.",
        "Once the utak)r groupings were defined (manually), the automated process of corpus analysis consisted of (I) expanding word classes by associating comiion, relatively unambiguous words with other classes, and (2) further expanding and identifying ambiguities using a \"bootstrapping\" process.",
        "The bootstrapping process used the knowledge that had already been encoded to classify a chunk of text.",

        "For example, if \"eyeglasses\" appeared in an activity teat, that text would be assigned to group tI8, along with whatever other categories also appeared.",
        "Then, for each word appearing in every text in the corpus, we again applied the mutual information statistic to find the significant relationships between words and groups.",
        "When a word could be associated with more than one group, this process identified phrases that could help to distinguish the word sense, and collected such ambiguous words in a separate list so that they could be dealt with manually, if necessary.",

        "The portions of the joint venture template shown in Figure 3 are examples of such coin-Ponents.",
        "Because these were the most knowledge-intensive components of the task, we believe that, the results validate SHOGUN's approach to knowledge acquisition.",
        "Certainly the system had much better coverage than other systems, and we attribute this result to the representation and automation used in word sense interpretation.",
