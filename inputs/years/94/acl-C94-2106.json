        "Various machine translation systems have approached the stage of being put to practical use.",
        "However, the quality of the finished translation is not satisfactory in any of these systems.",
        "This is due to difficulties in limiting linguistic phenomena that are handled by machine translation systems.",
        "In particular, the analysis of linguistic expressions such as ellipsis and anaphoric references, which require contextual analysis, is imperfect.",
        "To introduce constraints brought about by context requires an enormous volume of knowledge of word meanings that can be used to determine the semantic relationships between one sentence and another.",
        "To avoid an explosion in the volume of knowledge, a technique is proposed for classifying word meanings and determining the relationships between words or between sentences using the typical attribute values of each word.",
        "Particularly in the case of context processing, the verbal semantic attributes that become the key factors in analyzing the flow of sentences constitute important knowledge.",
        "Various efforts have been made in researching verb classification.",
        "Muraki (1985) suggested a method for grouping Japanese verbs using their word meanings and their syntactic features.",

        "(1986) proposed a method for representing the meaning of verbs divided into fundamental meanings and reasoning rules.",

        "(1989; EDR 1990) proposed a method for verb classification based on relations between verbs and co-occurring elements.",
        "Various efforts have been made to classify English verbs.",
        "For example, Levin (1993) proposed a method for the classification of 3000 English verbs that uses the relationship between syntactic behavior and shared meaning.",
        "The research about verb classification still tends to be limited solely to classification of the semantics of verbs per se.",
        "It does not take into account the relationship between word meanings and their usage within sentences and is not aimed at natural language processing.",
        "Thus, the full benefits that could be achieved in the analysis of tracking semantic relationships between sentences and eliminating the polysemy of verbs have not been realized.",
        "This paper focusses on the relationship between word meanings of verbs and their usage, and seeks to classify the semantic attributes of verbs.",
        "These semantic attributes are used in defining the method of use of each verb in Japanese to English transfer pattern dictionaries.",

        "In machine translation systems, it is well known that the translation pattern pairs of source",
        "language and target language sentence are effective in determining the meaning of verbs.",
        "Our machine translation system, ALT-J/E, uses two types of Japanese to English transfer pattern dictionaries based on verbs: the semantic valence pattern transfer dictionary and the idiomatic expression transfer dictionary (Fig.",
        "1).",
        "These dictionaries consist of pairs made of",
        "(The semantic constraints arc shown in parenthesis, * indicates there is no semantic constraint.)",
        "Japanese unit sentence patterns derived from Japanese verbs2 with semantic constraints to their case elements and English patterns which correspond to the Japanese expressions.",
        "For example, pattern(1) in Fig. 1 shows how, if the Japanese verb is \"taberu\" and the noun phrase with a \"ga\" particle, which shows a subject, has the semantic attribute SUBJECTS and the noun phrase with a \"wo\" particle, which shows a direct object, has the semantic attribute FOOD then the verb should he translated as \"eat\".",
        "The noun phrase with the \"ga\" particle is translated as the English subject.",
        "The noun phrase with the \"wo\" particle is translated as the English direct object.",

        "Japanese verb \"tsutsumu\".",
        "This verb has three patterns.",
        "The first example shows a pattern pair indicating that the equivalent of the Japanese expression \"N1 (SUBJECTS) ga N2 (CONCRETE OBJECTS or PEOPLE) wo N 3(c LOTI1ES or PAPERS) de tsutsumu\" is the English expression \"N1 wrap N2 in/with N3\".",
        "When the Japanese verb \"tsutsumu\" was used with these cases, this sentence gives the impression that N1 really does the wrapping action.",
        "So, in this case, this pattern has the verb meaning \"N1 conducts bodily action.\".",
        "The second example shows a pattern pair indicating that the equivalent expression of the Japanese expression \"N I (FIRE, ATMOSPHERE or AIR) go N2(CONCRETE OBJECTS, CULTURE or PLACES) wo tsutsumu\" is the English expression \"NI envelop N2\".",
        "This sentence gives the impression that the state of N2 which isn't usually enveloped by N1 changes to the enveloped state.",
        "So, even though the same Japanese verb \"tsutsumu\" was used with these cases, in this case, the pattern has a verb meaning of \"N1 changes N2's attributes.\".",
        "The third example shows a pattern pair indicating that the equivalent of the Japanese expression \"N I (FOG) ga N2(CONCRETE OBJECI'S or PLACES) wo tsutsumu\" is the English expression \"N1 veil NT'.",
        "In this case, this sentence gives the impression that a natural",
        "phenomenon, 'fog', has occurred.",
        "So, this pattern has the meaning \"Natural Phenomena have arisen\".",
        "As shown in these examples, maintaining expressions in pairs which indicate both the common meaning and their usage between the Japanese and English, enables us to eliminate many conceptual ambiguities and makes it possible to give detailed and accurate attribute values to the Japanese verb \"tsutsumu\".",
        "As in the case of the Japanese verb \"tsutsumu\", one verb normally has several kinds of conceptual structures.",
        "But one verbal pattern which indicates common word meanings and their use between the Japanese and English (which differ so vastly in syntactic structure) corresponds to one conceptual structure.",
        "So, it is possible to eliminate the conceptual ambiguity of verbs by selecting verbal patterns in syntactic semantic analysis.",
        "In Japanese to English machine translation, we estimate there are tens of thousands of verbal patterns which need to be defined.",
        "If the usage of these patterns can be expressed by a small number of verbal semantic attributes, it is possible to track the semantic relationships of verbs easily.",
        "When giving verbal semantic attributes to a pair of individual Japanese and English patterns, it is possible to refer to the meaning of verbs not only in Japanese but also in English."
