        "One important, and task t I 1 necessary ic (.0110, When a parser processes ;1 discourse in Japanese, is the so called zero anaphora resolution.",
        "All of syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic constraints are to be involved to resolve zero anaphora.",

        "02,,,bi is, in GB term, [ anaphoric, I pronominal 'or pro.",

        "In fact this fact is well known among Japanese linguists, i.e. [Sells 85, Takubo 87].",
        "As a result, zero anaphora resolution of complex sentence is not only to be done syntactically, but also to he done pragmatically and/or semantically.",
        "One of the promising candidate for this is the centering theory [Brennan et id 87, Walker 90].",
        "To apply the centering theory that is originally for a sequence of sentences, namely discourse, we regard the subordinate clause and the main clause as a segment of discourse respectively.",

        "Hanako is the strongest candidate for the backward center of the subordinate clause.",

        "In her theory, since the both of zero subjects share the subjecthood, both of them finally are known to refer to Hanako that is the topic for both of these clauses.",
        "Therefore the property sharing theory also fails to account for the intuitive interpretations.",
        "Then we shift our attention to more microscopic one, in which ,roughly speaking, the important part of semantics of complex sentence is formalized as relations among semantic roles that appear in the main clause or the subordinate clause.",
        "At the first glance, the constraints about these relations are not local in terms of main or subordinate clauses.",
        "In other words, semantic roles that appear in subordinate clause and semantic roles that appear in the main clause seem to be directly constrained by the constraints of complex sentence.",
        "However, looking more carefully, we find that the constraints of subordinate clause and the constraints of main clause are represented as local constraints by introducing the new notion of mo-livaled which is characterized as a person who has enough reason to act as the main clause describes.",
        "More precisely, molivated is one of the pragmatic roles that appear in a subordinate clause, and the constraints in subordinate clause are stated as identity relations between molivaled and other sernantic/pragmatic roles appearing in subordinate clause.",
        "Therefore these constraints are local in subordinate clause.",
        "The constraints in main clause are stated as identity relations between litotivaled which comes from subordinate clause, and other semantic roles appearing in main clause.",

        "In this sense, the constraints in the rnain clause can be treated as almost local constraints of the main clause.",
        "The next question is how to represent the tics of complex sentence iii feature structure( called FS henceforth ).",
        "For this, we should write down the constraints about these relations arming semantic/pragmatic roles in a feature structure formalism.",

        "In other words, primarily a constraint satisfaction process of a subordinate clause can be done within the analysis of subordinate clause, and that of the main clause can be done within it except for using motivated whose value has already been constrained in the subordinate clause."

        "Many Japanese linguists have already done the enormous amount of basic observations and proposed linguistic theories about the phenomena we deal with in this paper [Mikami 53, Kuno 73, Kuno 78, ()bye 75, Minami 74, Takubo 87, Teramura 84, Teramura 9(), Saito 92].",

        "In [Ohye 75], it is said that if' eery is used in a subordinate clause, the subject of the main clause is not the experiencer of the subordinate clause, In [Saito 92], she says that 1) a cognizer that corresponds to our observer is introduced if earn is used, and 2) if an observer is introduced in the subordinate clause, the mentally responsible person appearing in the main clause is identical with the observer.",

        "The answer is that: 1) We explicitly state the semantics of complex sentence as the relations among semantic roles.",
        "Namely, since we use semantic/pragmatic roles instead of grammatical roles in constraints, our constraints can account for zero anaphora in a sentence where the main clause is passive where an agent or an experiencer is not necessarily the subject, like the following exaitrwle.",

        "3) We find that the constraints of complex sentences are actually local ones.",
        "This localization of constraint was found by introducing new pragmatic roles observer and motivalvd, and is extremely important for efficiency of UG based parsing.",
        "This localization also makes the proposed constraints be compositional ones, because in the case of deeply embedded complex sentence to identify the referent of each rootivaied that bridges between a subordinate clause and its main clause, the constraints WO proposed are resolved with computation confined within each clause.",
