        "Three orientations have formed the basis of the design of the Functional-Semantic Processor: (i) the focus of analysis is on discourse; (u) the purpose is to discover those elements that contribute to the overall meaning conveyed by a text; (iii) the approach is modular, with each module corresponding to a structural representation from one of several dimensions of meaning.",
        "'In order to provide insights into the meaning and effectiveness of a text', states Halliday (1985), 'a discourse grammar needs to be functional and semantic in its orientation, with the grammatical categories explained as the realisation of semantic patterns'(xvii).",
        "SFG provides this functional-semantic orientation."

        "Ilalliday's systemic-functional grammar (SFG) identities the structures at clause level and above that contribute to the meaning of a text.",
        "An SFG analysis reveals 'how and why' a text means what it does.",
        "The clause, as constituent of the text, is the complex realisation of three functional-semantic components: textual, interpersonal and ideational.",
        "[Melt component contributes in its own way to the form of the clause.",
        "Corresponding to each component are various kinds of structural representation.",
        "In English, textual meaning is represented by theme-rheme and information structures; interpersonal meaning by mood-residue or exchange structure; and ideational or propositional meaning by transitivity structure.",
        "While Halliday identities the clause as Ilic most basic lexico-grammatical unit, nevertheless he also recognises and includes in his grammar other discourse units besides the clause.",
        "For example, Halliday's notion of information unit in English is similar to what Tsao (1979) calls topic-chains in Chinese where a topic extends its semantic domain over several sentences."

        "This particular work of I lalliday's differs from his previous work in that the emphasis is on the structural rather than the systemic portion ola description of English.",
        "The FSP includes a separate module for each kind of structural analysis.",
        "The modules arc independent of one another, each has its own unique terminology and organisation.",
        "Transitivity structure, for example, includes elements not found in information, mood-residue or theme-rheme structures.",
        "Each module assembles a partial solution to the larger question Of what is the meaning which the text as a whole conveys.",

        "Whenever a clause is analysed, by whichever !nodule, that analysis is saved to the blackboard.",
        "Each module must then look to the blackboard, pulling relevant information from the blackboard to assist in completing its ONVII analysis.",
        "The blackboard also plays an active role by alerting modules to any updates to its contents made by other modules.",
        "At present the PSI' does Iwo things: (1) it assists Pie user in doing the analysis; (2) it facilitates the subsequent retrieval of information about the text by collecting all the clause analyses into a global database.",
        "In its present Inrin the user must still do the analysis.",
        "The user, not the machine, identifies meaningful clause elements, and enters Mont in the appropriate data field.",
        "The computer records the user's interpretation in terms of a functional-semantic analysis.",
        "The FSP has up until now been only a tool - a processor, not a parser.",
        "As discussed below (Section 5), a parser is being added to the FSP lo",

        "The output from the parser will permit certain fields to be preset.",
        "Implementation of a bilingual version of the FSP will assist in the advancement of research into the similarities and differences between Chinese and English text stmctures.",
        "While Halliday maintains that the three components of meaning â€“ ideational, interpersonal and textual are universal to all languages, the structures corresponding to these components are, nevertheless, language specific.",
        "Thus this bilingual implementation of the FSP includes structures and fields relevant to Chinese and English.",
        "Certainly there is some overlap.",
        "Transitivity analysis, .for example, facilitates comparison on a generally shared level of meaning.",
        "But there is also a great deal of difference between Chinese and English, particularly noticeable with respect to exchange or Mood-residue structure.",
        "McDonald (1992), in his outline of a FG for Chinese, does not recognise a separate Mood-Residue structure for Chinese, The Functional-Semantic Processor (FSP) has been developed in the MS Windows 3.11 environment.",

        "The FSP includes three linked components: (i) MS Word for Windows v.6.0 (WinWord) as text-editor; (ii) the Analyst's Interface (Al); and (iii) a database facility.",
        "From WinWord, the analyst can view the text, and select clauses for analysis.",
        "The Al, a Visual Basic application, is linked by means of OLE automation with WinWord.",
        "Working within the AI, the analyst can view, edit, and save the contents of fields on .forms for each of the different kinds of structural analysis.",

        "The database entries may be retrieved from within the Al, or separately using MS Access.",
