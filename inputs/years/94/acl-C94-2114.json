        "Improvement of coverage in practical domains is one of the most important issues in the area of example-based systems.",
        "The example-based approach [6] has become a common technique for natural language processing applications such as machine translation and disambiguation (e.g. [5, 10]).",
        "However, few existing systems can cover a practical domain or handle a broad range of phenomena.",
        "The most serious obstacle to robust example-based systems is the coverage of example-bases.",
        "It is an open question how many examples are required for disambiguating sentences in a specific domain.",
        "The Sentence Analyzer (SENA) was developed in order to resolve attachment, word-sense, and conjunctive ambiguities by using constraints and example-based preferences [11].",
        "It has about 57,000 disambiguated head-modifier relationships and about 300,000 synonyms and is-a binary-relationships.",
        "Even so, lack of examples (no relevant examples) accounted for 46.1% of failures in a experiment with SENA [12].",
        "Previously, it was believed to be easier to collect examples than to develop rules for resolving ambiguities.",
        "However, the coverage of each example is much more local than a rule, and therefore a huge number of examples is required in order to resolve realistic problems.",
        "There has been some corpus-based research on how to acquire large-scale knowledge automatically in order to cover the domain to be disambiguated, but there are still major problems to be overcome.",
        "First, semantic knowledge such as word-sense cannot be extracted by automatic corpus-based knowledge acquisition.",
        "The example-base in SENA is developed by using a bootstrapping method.",
        "However, the results of word-sense disambiguation must be checked by a human, and word-senses are tagged to only about a half of all the examples, since the task is very time-consuming.",
        "A second difficulty in the example-based approach is the algorithm itself, namely, the best-match algorithm, which was used in earlier systems built around a thesaurus that consisted of a hierarchy of is-a or synonym relationships between words (word-senses).",
        "This paper proposes two methods for itnprov-ing the coverage of example-bases.",
        "The selected domain is that of sentences in computer manuals.",
        "First, knowledge that represents a type of similarity other than synonym or is-a relationships is acquired.",
        "As one measurement of the similarity, interchangeability between words can be used.",
        "In this paper, two types of the relationship reflect such interchangeability.",
        "First, the elements of coordinated structures are good clues to the interchangeability of words.",
        "Words can be extracted easily from a domain-specific corpus, and therefore the example-base can be adapted to the specific domain by using the domain-specific relationships.",
        "If there are no examples and relations in the thesaurus, the example-base gives no information for disambiguation.",
        "However, the text to be disambiguated provides useful knowledge for this purpose [7, 3].",
        "The relationships between words in the example-base and an unknown word can be guessed by comparing that word's usage in extracted examples and in the text."

        "(Si) A managed AS/400 system can store a new program in the repository.",
        "There are two candidates for the attachment of the prepositional phrase \"in the repository.\" They are represented by the following head-modifier relationships:",
        "(R1) (\"stored-V\" (PP \"in\" ) \"repository+N\") (112) (\"program-EN\" (PP \"in\") \"repository-EN\")",
        "In 111 the noun \"repository\" modifies the verb \"store\" with \"in,\" while in 112, it modifies the noun \"program.\" First, SENA searches for examples whose heads match the candidate.",
        "Figures 1 and 2 show the relevant examples for 111 and 112.",
        "They represent the head-modifier relationships, including word-senses, a relation label between the word-senses, (e.g. 'in\"), and a frequency.",
        "If a relationship identical to either of the candidates R1 and R2 is found, a high similarity is attached to the candidate and the example (exact matching).",
        "Word-sense ambiguities are resolved by using the same framework [12].",
        "In this case, each candidate represent each word sense.",
        "For example, the word-sense *storel is preferred among the examples shown in Fig. 1.",
        "If no examples are obtained by the exact-matching process, the system executes the best-matching process, winch is the most important mechanism in the example-based approach.",
        "For the comparison, synonym or is-a relationships described in a thesaurus are used.",
        "For example, if synonym relations are found between \"repository\" and \"disk\" in the first example for the 11.1, a similarity whose value is smaller than that for exact matching is given to the examples.",
        "The most preferable candidate is selected by comparing all examples in Fig. 1 and computing the total similarity value for each candidate.",
        "If multiple candidates have the same similarity values, the frequency of the example and some heuristics (for example, innermost attachment is preferred) are used to weight the similarities.",
        "Experience with SENA reveals two problems that prevent an improvement in the performance of the best-snatching algorithm.",
        "First, the approach is strongly dependent on the thesaurus.",
        "Many systems calculate the similarity or preference mainly or entirely by using the hierarchy of the thesaurus.",
        "However, these relationships indicate only a certain kind of similarity between words.",
        "To improve the coverage of the example-base, other additional types of knowledge are required, as will be discussed in the following sections.",
        "Another problem is the existence of unknown words; that is, words that are described in the system dictionary but do not appear in the example-base or the thesaurus.",
        "In SENA, the New Collins Thesaurus [1] is used to disambiguate sentences in computer manuals.",
        "Many unknown words appear, especially nouns, since the thesaurus is for the general domain.",
