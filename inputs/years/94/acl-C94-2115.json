        "However the direct manipulation method is not always better than other ways.",
        "The direct manipulation method is not particularly applicable, when mentioning several operations together and operating an object which is not displayed.",
        "Also, it compels a user to point to a target object correctly with a pointing device.",
        "On the other hand, voice inputs have some advantages, since a user can feel free to speak at any time, and the user can use the voice input while simultaneously using other devices.",
        "A combination of such different modalities offers an interface which is easy for the user to use.",
        "Many multimodal systems, which integrate natural language inputs and pointing inputs, have been developed [2][1][5][4].",
        "In those systems, the user uses natural language mainly supported by the pointing inputs.",
        "However, when the user has to communicate with the computer frequently, in such a system as drawing tool, it is not effective for the user to always speak while working.",
        "A prototype system for a multimodal drawing tool has been developed, whereby the user can use voice inputs unrestrainedly and effectively, that is, the user can choose a modality unrestrainedly, and can use the voice inputs only when the user wants to do so.",
        "In such a system, input data come in at random with multiple modalities.",

        "In addition, some drawing tools assign functions to some keys on a keyboard to reduce inconvenience in menu operations.",
        "Issues regarding such interfaces are as follows:",
        "• It is troublesome to input a function.",
        "Because a user uses a mouse, both to select a menu and to draw a figure, the user has to move a cursor many times from a menu area to a canvas on which figures are placed.",
        "• It is troublesome to look for a menu item.",
        "In proportion to increasing functions increment, menu items also increase.",
        "So, it becomes increasingly difficult to look for a specific objective menu item.",
        "• It is troublesome to continuously move a hand from a mouse to a keyboard.",
        "• It is not possible to express plural requirements simultaneously.",
        "For example, when a user wants to delete plural figure objects, the user has to choose the objects one by one.",
        "• The user has to point to an object correctly.",

        "example, when the user wants to choose a line object on a display, the user has to move a cursor just above the line and click the mouse button.",

        "For overcoming the rest of these issues, more contrivance is needed.",
        "The authors attempted to develop a multimodal drawing tool, operable with both voice inputs and pointing inputs, which has the following functions.",
        "• A user can choose a modality (mouse or voice) unrestrainedly, which means that the user can use the voice inputs only when the user wants to do so.",
        "Also, the user can use both modalities in various combined ways.",
        "For example, tie user says \"tins\", while pointing to one of several objects.",
        "• Plural requests can be expressed simultaneously ( ex.",
        "\"change the color of all line objects to green\").",
        "So, the operation efficiency will be improved.",
        "• A user can shorten voice inputs (ex.",
        "\"move here\") or omit mouse pointing events based on the situation, if the omitted concepts are able to be inferred from context.",
        "For example, the user can utter \"this\", as a reference for previously operated objects, without a mouse pointing.",
        "• Ambiguous pointings are possible.",
        "When a user wants to choose an object from among those on a display, the user can indicate it roughly with a brief description, using the voice input.",

        "Therefore, a pointing event should be basically handled as an independent event.",

        "However, when the function becomes more sophisticated, it is difficult for the user to outline the user's intention in detail verbally.",
        "So, it is necessary to be able to interpret the ambiguous user's input.",
