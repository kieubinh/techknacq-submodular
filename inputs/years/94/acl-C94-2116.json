        "We have been developing an English-to-Japanese machine translation (MT) system for news reports in English (Aizawa T., 1990) (Tanaka H., 1991) and have so far studied the translation selection problem for common English verbs (Tanaka II., 1992).",
        "Recently, we examined the problem of multiple translations for common English verbs (Tanaka 1-1., 1993).",

        "We begin by preparing a tagged bilingual corpus seeking detailed knowledge in target domain texts.",
        "The annotation described in the corpus is the syntactic information of the texts and the translation.",
        "They are assigned manually since human translators can do such jobs as syntactic tagging and translation with far more consistency than writing case frames directly.",

        "Translation selection is performed without considering the context.",
        "Our new case frames are designed to follow the same protocol.",
        "There are three factors to consider at this point.",
