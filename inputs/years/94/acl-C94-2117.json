        "Although there is no clear rule to account for zero anaphora, nevertheless, as pointed out by Li and Thompson, zero anaphora commonly occur in the situation of a \"topic chain,\" where a referent is referred to in the first clause, and then several more clauses follow talking about the same referent but with it omitted.",
        "In [Chen 87], Chen proposed the notion of \"continuity\" of referent in discourse to give a more specific account of zero anaphora.",
        "In this paper, we aim at deciding when to generate zero anaphors from some internal semantic structure.",

        "The initial result showed that zero anaphors were over-generated to a large extent in the text produced by employing Rule I. Consequently, we considered other well-known factors namely, syntactic constraints [Li and Thompson 81], discourse structure [Grosz and Sidner 86] and the salience of objects in utterances [Sidner 83], to get better results."

        "For each anaphor, its antecedent's position is one of the following categories: topic, direct object or the NP following a presentative verb and others.",
        "We thus classify the following types, A to F, of antecedent-anaphor pairs: the antecedents of Types A and C are in topic position, of B and D are in direct object position or are the NP following a presentative verb, and of F and are in other positions; the anaphors of Types A, B and E are in topic position, and of C, D and F are in non-topic positions.",
        "Since in the new rule conditions on topic and non-topic will only be considered after the conditions in Rule 2, in investigating the antecedent-anaphor pairs, we have to exclude the ones with either their anaphors violating syntactic constraints on zero anaphor or at the beginning of discourse segments.",
        "hi other words, the new condition will be attached under the Z-node in the decision tree of Fig. 2.",
        "In the Set I testing data, there are 239 such pairs, among which anaphors of 49 pairs arc zeroed by the algorithm of Rule 2 but appear in non-zero forms in the text.",

        "For the Set 1 data in Table 3, the over-generated cases of both Types A and B, 15 and 14 out of 1.73 and 41, respectively, are the minorities of the respective types, while on the contrary, the number of over-generated cases of Types C and E are greater that their counterparts.",

        "The numbers for Types D and F do not conclusively support either using zero or non-zero in this case.",
        "In Chen's study [Chen 87], he found a higher percentage of zero anaphors occurring in the topic position with their antecedent roost frequently in the topic or object positions of the immediately previous utterance, which strongly supports the idea of letting anaphors of Types A and 13 be zero and others non-zero.",
