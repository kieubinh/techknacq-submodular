        "Following the work of, for example, Marslen-Wilson (1973), Just and Carpenter (1980) and Altmann and Steelman (1988), it has become widely accepted that semantic interpretation in human sentence processing can occur before sentence boundaries and even before clausal boundaries.",
        "It is less widely accepted that there is a need for incremental interpretation in computational applications.",
        "In the 1970s and early 1980s several computational implementations motivated the use of incremental interpretation as a way of dealing with structural and lexical ambiguity (a survey is given in Haddock 1989).",
        "A sentence such as the following has 4862 different syntactic parses clue solely to attachment ambiguity (Stabler 1991).",
        "1) I put the bouquet of flowers that you gave me for Mothers' Day in the vase that you gave me for my birthday on the chest of drawers that you gave me for Armistice Day.",
        "Although some of the parses can be ruled out using structural preferences during parsing (such as Late Closure or Minimal Attachment (Frazier 1979)), extraction of the correct set of plausible readings requires use of real world knowledge.",
        "Incremental interpretation allows on-line semantic filtering, i.e. parses of initial fragments which have an implausible or anomalous interpretation are rejected, thereby preven",
        "ting ambiguities from multiplying as the parse proceeds.",
        "However, on-line semantic filtering for sentence pm-cessing does have drawbacks.",
        "Firstly, for sentence processing using a serial architecture (rather than one in which syntactic and semantic processing is performed in parallel), the savings in computation obtained from on-line filtering have to be balanced against the additional costs of performing semantic computations for parses of fragments which would eventually be ruled out anyway from purely syntactic considerations.",
        "Moreover, there are now relatively sophisticated ways of packing ambiguities during parsing (e.g. by the use of graph-structured stacks and packed parse forests (Tomita 1985)).",
        "Secondly, the task of judging plausibility or anomaly according to context and real world knowledge is a difficult problem, except in some very limitecl domains.",
        "Itr contrast, statistical techniques using lexeme co-occurrence provide a relatively simple mechanism which can imitate semantic filtering in many cases.",
        "For example, instead of judging bank as a financial institution as more plausible than bank as a riverbank in the noun phrase the rich bank, we can compare the number of co-occurrences of the lexemes rich and banks (= riverbank) versus rich and bank2 (= financial institution) in a semantically analysed corpus.",
        "Cases where statistical techniques seem less appropriate are where plausibility is affected by local context.",
        "For example, consider the ambiguous sentence, The decorators painted a wall with cracks in the two contexts The mom was supposed to look rundown vs.",
        "The clients couldn't afford wallpaper.",
        "Such cases involve reasoning with an interpretation in its immediate context, as opposed to purely judging the likelihood of a particular linguistic expression in a given application domain (see e.g. Cooper 1993 for discussion).",
        "Although the usefulness of on-line semantic filtering during the processing of complete sentences is debatable, filtering has a more plausible role to play in interactive, real-time environments, such as interactive spell checkers (see e.g. -Winin (1990) for arguments for incremental parsing in such environments).",
        "Here the choice is between whether or not to have semantic altering at all, rather than whether to do it on-line, or at the end of the sentence.",
        "The concentration in early literature on using incremental interpretation for semantic filtering has perhaps distracted from some other applications which provide less controversial applications.",

        "Visual feedback could be used to provide confirmation (fin example, by highlighting an object referred to by a successhil definite description), or it could be used to give the user an improved chance of achieving successful reference.",
