        "The interpretation of noun sequences (henceforth NSs, and also known as noun compounds or complex nominals) has long been a topic of research in natural language processing (NLP) (Finin, 1980; Sparck Jones, 1983; Leonard, 1984; Isabelle, 1984; Lehnert, 1988; and Riloff, 1989).",
        "The challenge in analyzing NSs derives from the semantic nature of the problem: their interpretation is, at best, only partially recoverable from a syntactic or a morphological analysis of NSs.",
        "To arrive at an interpretation of plum sauce which specifies that plum is the Ingredient of sauce, or of knowledge representation, specifying that knowledge is the Object of representation, requires semantic information for both the first noun (the modifier) and the second noun (the head).",
        "In this paper, we are concerned with interpreting NSs which are composed of two nouns, in absence of the context in which the NS appears; this scope is similar to most of the studies mentioned above.",
        "The algorithm for interpreting a sequence of two nouns is intended to be basic to the algorithm for interpreting sequences of more than two nouns: each pair of NSs will be interpreted in turn, and the best interpretation forms a constituent which can modify, or be modified by, another noun or NS (see also Finin, 1980).",
        "There is no doubt that context, both intra and inter-sentential, plays a role in determining the correct interpretation of a NS, since the most plausible interpretation in isolation might not be the most plausible in context.",
        "It is, however, a premise of the present system that, whatever the context is, the interpretation of a NS is always available in the list of possible interpretations.",
        "A NS that is already listed in an on-line dictionary needs no interpretation because the meaning can be derived from its definition.",
        "In the studies of NSs mentioned above, the systems for interpreting NSs have relied on hand-coded semantic information, which is limited to a specific domain by the sheer effort involved in creating such a semantic knowledge base.",
        "The level of detail made possible by hand-coding has led to the development of two main algorithms for the automatic interpretation of NSs: concept dependent and sequential rule application.",
        "The concept dependent algorithm (Finin, 1980) requires each lexical item to contain an index to the rule(s) which should be applied when that item is part of a NS; it has the advantage that only those rules are applied for which the conditions arc met and each noun potentially suggests a unique interpretation.",
        "Whenever the result of the analysis is a set of possible interpretations, the most plausible one is determined on the basis of the weight which is associated with a role fitting procedure.",
        "The disadvantage of this approach is that this level of lexical information cannot he acquired automatically, and so this approach cannot be used to process unrestricted text.",
        "The algorithm for sequential rule application (Leonard, 1984) focuses on the process of determining which interpretation is the most plausible; the fixed set of rules are applied in a fixed order and the first rule for which the conditions are met results in the most plausible interpretation.",
        "This algorithm has the advantage that no weights are associated with the rules.",
        "The disadvantage of this approach is that the degree to which the rules are satisfied cannot be expressed, and so, in some cases, the most plausible",
        "interpretation of an NS will not be produced.",
        "Also, section 4 will show that this algorithm is suitable only when the sense of each noun is a given, a situation which is not true for processing unrestricted text.",
        "This paper introduces an algorithm which is specifically designed for analyzing NSs in unrestricted text.",
        "The task of processing unrestricted text has two consequences: firstly, hand-coded semantic information, and therefore a concept dependent algorithm, is no longer feasible; and secondly, the intended sense of each noun can no longer be taken as a given.",
        "The algorithm described here, therefore, relies on semantic information which has been extracted automatically from an on-line dictionary (see Montemagni and Vanderwende, 1992; Dolan et al., 1993).",
        "This algorithm manipulates a set of general rules, each of which has an associated weight, and a general procedure for matching words.",
        "The result of this algorithm is an ordered set of interpretations and partial sense-disambiguation of the nouns by taking note of which noun senses were most relevant in each of the possible interpretations.",
        "We will begin by reviewing the classification schema for NSs described in Vanderwende (1993) and the type of general rules which this algorithm is designed to handle.",
        "The matching procedure will be described; by introducing a separate matching procedure, the rules in Vanderwende (1993) can be organized in such a way as to make the algorithm more efficient.",
        "We will then show the algorithm for rule application in detail.",
        "This algorithm differs from Leonard (1984) by applying all of the rules before determining which interpretation is the most plausible (effectively, a parallel rule application), rather than determining the best interpretations by the order in which the rules are applied (a serial rule application).",
        "In section 4, we will provide examples which illustrate that a parallel algorithm is required when processing unrestricted, undisambiguated text.",
        "Finally, the results of applying this algorithm to a training and a test corpus of NSs will be presented, along with a discussion of these results and further directions for research in NS analysis."

        "(All examples are from the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English, Longman Group, 1978.)",
        "The values of this PURPOSE attribute are bird and animal.",

        "Firstly, the rules have been divided into those that test attributes on the head, as rules HI and 1-12 do, and those that test attributes on the modifier.",
        "Secondly, associated with each rule is a weight.",
        "Unlike in Vanderwende (1993), this rule weight is only part of the final score of a rule application; the final score of a rule application is composed of both the rule weight and the weight returned from the matching procedure, which will be described in the next section."

        "Now the matching procedure investigates the senses of cat attempting to find a match.",

        "In the definition of cage (1, n, I ): 'a framework of wires or bars in which animals or birds may be kept or carried', a LOCATION-OF attribute can be identified, with as its value the verbs keep and carry and a nested HAS-OBJECT attribute, with animal and bird as its value; it is the HAS-OBJECT attribute which can match the modifier noun bird.",
        "A match using the HAS-OBJECT or IIAS-SUBJECT attribute carries a weight of 0.2.",
        "Even when alternate matches are being investigated, such as a match using IIAS-OBJECT, the senses of the lemma can still be examined.",
        "In this way, a `What for?' interpretation can also be determined for the NS canary cage, shown in Fig. 3; the weight for this type of link is 0.1.",
        "In Vanderwende (1993), the rules themselves specified how to find the indirect matches described above.",

        "Only after all of the rules have applied are the possible interpretations ordered according to their scores.",
        "It may seem that we have made the task of interpreting NSs artificially difficult by taking into consideration each noun sense in the modifier and head; one might argue that it is reasonable to assume that these nouns could be sense-disambiguated before NS analysis.",
        "We are not aware of any study which describes sense-disambiguation of the nouns in a NS.",
        "On the contrary, Braden-Harder (1992) suggests that the results of disambiguation can be improved when relations such as verb-object, purpose, and location, are available; these relations are the result of our NS analysis, not the input."

        "A training corpus of 100 NSs was collected from the examples of NSs in the previous literature, to ensure that all known classes of NSs are handled in this system.",

        "Of the remaining 46 NSs, the most likely interpretation was presented second for 21 NSs 'Although LDOCE includes some semantic information in the form of box codes and subject codes, these were not used in this system.",
        "This approach is designed to work with semantic information from any dictionary.",
        "(22 %); when first and second interpretations were considered, the system was successful approximately 74% of the time.",
        "A wrong or no interpretation was given for 25 NSs (26 %).",
        "Upon examination of these results, several areas for improvement are suggested.",
        "First is to improve the semantic information: Dolan et al.",
        "(1993) describes a network of semantic information, given not only the definition of the lexical entry but also all of the other definitions which have a labeled relation to that entry.",
        "Secondly, while the NS classification proposed in Vanderwende (1993) proves, to be adequate for analyzing NSs in unrestricted text, an additional 'What about?' class, suggested in Levi (1978), may be justified.",
        "In the current classification schema, NSs such as cigarette war-and history conference have been considered `Whom/what?' NSs given the verbs that are associated with the head, fight and confer/talk about respectively.",
        "In unrestricted text, similar NSs are quite frequent, for example university policy, prevention program, care plan, but the definitions of the heads do not always specify a related verb.",
        "The head definitions for policy, program and plan, however, do allow a HAS-TOPIC semantic feature to be identified, and this HAS-TOPIC can be used to establish a 'What about?' interpretation.",
        "Applying this algorithm to previously unseen text also produced a very promising result: the verbs that are associated with nouns in their definitions (i.e., role nominals in Finin, 1980) are being used often and correctly to produce NS interpretations.",
        "While some rules had been developed to handle obvious cases in the training corpus, how often the conditions on these rules would be met could not be predicted.",
        "In fact, such NS interpretations are frequent.",
        "For example, the NS wine cellar is analyzed as a `What for?' relation with a high score, and the system provides as a paraphrase: cellar which is for storing wine, given the definition of cellar (L 11,1): 'an underground room, usu.",
        "used for storing goods; basement'.",
        "This result is promising for two reasons: first, by analyzing the &Bunions (and later also the example sentences) in an on line dictionary, we now have access to a non-handcoded source of semantic information which includes the verbs and their relation to the nouns, essential for determining role nominals.",
        "Second, the related verbs are used to construct the paraphrases of a NS, and doing so makes a general interpretation such as 'What for?' more",
        "specific, e.g., a service office is not an office for service, but an office for providing service, and a vegetable market is not a market for vegetables, but a market for buying and selling vegetables.",
