        "Functional anaphoric expressions are referring expressions whose references are identified with respect to references of other objects in a discourse.",
        "Among a few types of functional anaphoric expressions such as Wh expressions and pronouns (Cooper 1979, Engdahl 1984, Kamp 1984, Chierchia 1993), definite descriptions provide a locution for functional expressions.",
        "A typical example is as follows:",
        "(1) Every book about Picasso made the author rich.",
        "In (1), 'the author' does not have its usual sense of the antecedent, such as 'an author', anywhere in the discourse.",
        "Instead, the reference of 'the author' is determined with respect to the reference of 'book'.",
        "In other words, the description, 'author', works as a function that takes a referent for 'book as an argument and returns a value that is the referent for 'author'.",
        "Kamp (1984) calls this kind of expressions Functional Definite Descriptions (hence, we follow him here, and call them FDD for short, and DD for definite descriptions).",
        "In this paper, I will call 'book' a functional antecedent of FDD 'author' and its resulting anaphoric link between 'book' and 'author' a functional anaphoric link.",
        "This paper describes a classification of Functional Definite Descriptions and proposes an analysis of FDD based on a claim that FDD behave more like pronominals than definite descriptions.",

      "text": [
        "When we process real texts, it is apparent that FDD is a non-trivial part of the use of definite descriptions.",
        "FDD constitutes a large portion of DD use among so-called first mention use.",
        "In a recent study of a Swedish corpus, Fraurud (1990) reports that 60.9% of total DO occurrences are first mention use, and such complex DD as the ones in the form of 'the X of Y' in corresponding English structures (a typical form of MD) accounts for 41.2% among the first-mention use.",
        "Since FDD can be found among simple DD, the percentage of FDD further increases.",
        "Although Fraurud's study reveals its importance in Swedish, it is easy to assume a comparable situation in English.",
        "In literature, FDD is usually regarded as a limited phenomenon that is difficult to formalize.",
        "However, such a view toward FDD is shortsighted since it not only undermines the importance of FDD with respect to other use of DD, but also misses the important relations to functional anaphoric expressions in other cat egories.",
        "Hawkins (1978) studies various usage of definite descriptions and proposes an analysis based on the theory of Familiarity.",
        "Two of his usage of the first-mention defmites are MD under consideration here: an associative use such as 'a car' - 'the steering wheel', and a larger situation use such as 'a town' - `the church'.",
        "He claims that in these cases common knowledge shared by a speaker and the hearer is very general and inferable from lexical information without pragmatic information.",
        "Hawkins' study signifies the importance of Familiarity presupposition of definite descriptions as well as the range of definite descriptions although his study covers only the major usage and misses some important issues, which we will examine below.",
        "Kamp (1984) provides the first but very insightful formal semantic analysis of FDD.",
        "In Kamp's Discourse Representation theoretic treatment of FDD, a head noun of FDD always introduces a new reference marker for the individual that it denotes and a functional anaphoric referent into a universe of the DRS.",
        "Ile notes that FDD ranges over types of functional referents.",
        "That is, if the functional referent of FDD is pronominal, the FDD needs to utilize pronominal resolution mechanism, and if demonstrative, then demonstrative resolution mechanism.",
        "Kamp' s work suggests the range of FDD distribution is wider than that suggested by Hawkins and shows us a point of departure.",
        "Lobner(1985) proposes an analysis of DD based on a lexical distinction among nouns; sortal nouns, functional nouns, and non-functional relational nouns.",
        "Sortal nouns are typical nouns that denotes individuals.",
        "Functional nouns are relational nouns with situational arguments.",
        "Ile studies a wide range of FDDs and classifies many of them into a bag of functional nouns.",
        "As a result, functional nouns include 'weather', 'sun', 'speaker', 'hearer', 'president', 'referee', 'bride', 'head', 'top', 'surface', 'height', 'weight', 'birth', 'death', 'beginning', 'end', etc.",
        "He points out that functional nouns allow modifications with pp, adjectives and adverbs, but non-functional nouns do not.",
        "Thus, the fact that 'the present wife' is acceptable but 'the present son' is not indicates the difference between functional nouns and nonfunctional relational nouns.",
        "However, even seemingly noncontroversial relational noun such as 'daughter' can find certain situation where it is modified by a pp.",
        "For example, a man has two daughters, one studying in L.A. and the other working in Seattle.",
        "We may refer to his daughters 'the daughter in L.A. and the daughter in Seattle'.",
        "This difficulty",
        "gum of the DR conditional in the first sentence.",
        "In other words, the second sentence is under the quantification of the situation in the first sentence due to the fitct that the modality appears in the second sentence.",
        "Notice that even in (15), an incidence of MD is apparent: 'the banquet' is functionally linked to 'convention'.",
        "In (14-a), we can safely assume that the consequent sentence is subordinate to the DR conditional's consequent, while in (14-b) such explanation does not seem to be available.",
        "Once again, we see a certain similarity between pronominal anaphora and situational role FDD.",
        "4.3.",
        "FDD based on Temporanocational Relations The third group to consider here consists of the following kinds of expressions.",
        "(16) a. the morning of December 31 the spring of 1988 b. the midst of Ramadan the beginning of the war (17) a. the top of the house the edge of the bridge the side of the car the bottom of the bottle b. the north of London C. the middle of the bridge Note that all of the head nouns in the above MD denote either temporal as in (16) or locational points as in (17) with respect to other temporal or locative points.",
        "What makes these HA) distinctive from the two other relational FDDs examined so far is 1) that they cannot be paraphrased by possessive construction of the form \"X's Y\" although \"the Y of X\" lone is acceptable as shown above; that is, they are not lexical relations, and 2) that they are not situational roles.",
        "Furthermore, as a group, these nouns typically link to functional antecedents that are anchored expressions.",
        "Note that this observation allows us to consider certain close relationship between this subclass and expressions such as follows: (18) the city of New York the port of Los Angeles Expressions in (18) are usually considered as proper names, i.e., anchored expressions.",
        "Nonetheless, it is possible to consider 'the city ol' as a function.",

        "The number of arguments depend upon relations lexically specified in the lexicon for relational nouns.",
        "For example, most of kinship terms are dyadic predicates but wine derived nominals will have the same number of arguments as the number of arguments that their verbal counterparts possess.",
        "Nonetheless, at the time of translating a relational noun, whether or not the noun is used anaphorically, functional anaphorically, or non-anaphorically is not known.",
        "Therefore, we cannot select an appropriate DRS construction principle at the time of translation of FDD.",
        "What I would like to propose is that we translate EDD into non-monadic relation predicates but do nothing more than the translation at this time.",
        "I hypothesize that any uninstantiated referential argument introduces an anaphoric type reference marker.",
        "This reference marker can be processed further in three ways: finding its antecedent, finding its functional antecedent, and finding neither its antecedent nor its functional antecedent.",
        "The following MD construction rule states the above senario.",
        "(19) FDD CR Given a relational FDD phrase 'the N', 1) Introduce a relational condition, R, with an appropriate argument structure in ConK.",

        "(20) Usually if John buys an interesting book, he writes to the author.",
        "At the time of translating the phrase, `to the author', we have the following DRS under construction.",
        "(21-1) Since 'au hor' is a relational noun, the lexicon provides information concerning its lexical denotation of the relation, namely a predicate 'author' with two argument position.",
        "The above MD construction rule produces a DRS as follows: (21-2) At this moment, three things must be done: 1) resolve 'x', which is for the pronoun, 'he', 2) resolve the1 ' , which stands for the entity of 'author', and 3) resolve y', that stands for the functional antecedent for 'author'.",

        "Such relations are represented by non-monadic predicates.",
        "For example, 'mother' will be translated by a dyadic predicate 'mother' such as follows: (6) Rmotber]] = bay finother(x,y)] When a possessec is not a relational noun, then the possessive denotes a relation based on general ownership or some sort of closeness relations, and Barker calls such relations an extrinsic relation.",
        "I leproposes the following two semantic translations for possessive determiners corresponding to the above distinction.",
        "a' \"[possill = XRUZI b. RO[poss] 1] = XPbay[p(x,y) & P(y)] The translation in (7-a) is used in the case of a lexical relation, while p in (7-b) denotes an extrinsic relation such as ownership.",

        "[[John's human]] = p(j,y) & human(y)]",
        "Note that 'mother' is a relational noun while 'human' is not.",
        "The above translations explain why the \"human of John\" is ungrammatical as opposed to the grammatical counterpart, \"the mother of John\".",
        "A noun, 'Y' in the form of \"X's Y\", can be either relational or non-relational, but 'Y' in the form of \"the Y of X\" must be relational.",
        "Therefore, a non relational noun such as 'human' cannot form an expression \"the human of X\".",
        "Barker's analysis provides a good foundation for our insight on relations in functional descriptions in general.",
        "Now, we say a noun X is relational if and only if it allows both \"Y's X\" and \"X of Y\".",
        "All relational nouns are translated into non-monadic predicates.",
        "In the above discussion, we did not inquire on the status of definite articles in the form of \"the Y of X\".",
        "One may ask whether or not all relational ROMs in the form of \"Y of X\" require definite articles, and the answer is obviously NO.",
        "It seems that only a certain set of relations possess the uniqueness presupposition on the arguments of the relations.",
        "For example, a relation `mother-of(X,Y)' that means that Y is the mother of X possesses the uniqueness presupposition on the second argument but not on the first argument.",
        "In contrast, a relation `son-of(X,Y)' that means Y is a son of X has the uniqueness presupposition on the first argument but not on the second.",
        "Relations generally describe property/character istic of one individual that occupies one argument of the relation.",
        "Let us call this argument the primary argument of a relation as oppose to the referential argument that links to a referent of the functional antecedent.",
        "In `mother-of(X,Y)' Y is the primary argument and in 'son-of(X,Y)' Y is the primary argument.",
        "Thus, if a primary argument of a relation Y is presupposed as unique, a definite article is required in the form of \"Y of X\".",
        "ibis is the reason why 'mother' in 'mother of' requires a definite article but not 'son' in 'son of'.",
        "Uniqueness presuppositions on certain arguments of relations are clearly lexical in nature.",
        "Definite articles in MD reflect this lexically marked presupposition.",
        "Cases without uniqueness presupposition such as 'son-of' should be called Functional Indefinite Descriptions (HD) (See Wada (forthcoming) for further discussion on this type of Functional Anaphora).",
        "Accessibility Now, we extend the scope of our examination from possessive-based structures to other cases such as 'a book' - 'the author'.",
        "Since 'author' is a relational noun, we anticipate that the same kind of analysis is possible to the analysis of 'the author'.",
        "From the previous discussion, we know that the relational functional anaphoric link between 'a book' and the author' is possible provided that \"the author of the book\" and \"the book's author\" are both legitimate expressions.",
        "In other words, 'author' is a relational noun that denotes a dyadic lexical relation 'author'.",
        "The two arguments of the relation are a referent for a salient book in a discourse and a referent that is the uniquely identifiable author of the book.",
        "However, the expression \"the author\" needs to be linked anaphoric* to its functional antecedent, namely 'a book'.",

        "This paper examined Functional Definite Descriptions and proposed two types of IDD, relational and non-relational.",
        "The analysis presented here was based on claims that FDD introduce discourse referents of pronominal type, and that functional anaphoric links obey the same accessible conditions that pronominal anaphoric links obey.",
        "FDD is closely related to functional anaphoric expressions in other categories such as Functional Indefinite Descriptions.",
        "To understand FDD better, more research on functional anaphoric expressions in general will be needed in the future."

        "The pronominal possessive, 'its' , appears in exactly the same location in the above sentences as the FDDs in (10).",
        "It seems unarguable to assume that the two obey the same constraint.",
        "Indeed, it is more consistent to treat FDD as pronominal anaphora than to treat it as definite anaphora when we consider that referential arguments introduce regular discourse referents such as pronominals.",
        "In sum, we observed that lexical relational FDD is licensed by lexical relations of the head nouns.",
        "The relations force uniqueness presupposition on the primary arguments of the relations.",
        "Furthermore, like pronominal anaphoric links, functional anaphoric links obey accessibility condition.",
        "In the following section, we examine other relational FDDs and see whether the above observed characteristics hold."
