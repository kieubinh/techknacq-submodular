        "In task-oriented dialogues two speakers work in cooperation with the purpose of carrying out a plan.",
        "This type of interaction has a start and a development structured by the restrictions of space, time, transaction object and role of the participants.",
        "A number of researchers [Grosz and Sidner, 86; Litman and Allen, 87; Ramshaw, 91; Lambert and Carberry, 921 have suggested that a coherent discourse consists of segments that are related to one another through some type of structuring relation.",
        "Our dialogue model tries to capture the goal-oriented nature of discourse, identifing the discourse structure by providing the details of a computational mechanism for recognizing the structural relationships.",
        "The model enables the incremental recognition of communicative goals using rewriting rules and functional equations.",
        "The grammar constructs the structural tree capturing the dialogical functions of the discourse using functional subcategorization.",
        "The subcategorization process improves on previous approaches [Ferrary et al., 88; Bilage, 91; JOnsson, 911, increasing the expresive power of the traditional dialogue models by modeling the relationships among the communicative actions enabling the task of connecting discourse.",
        "The different parts of the system have been implemented using a blackboard architecture.",
        "The process starts obtaining the f-structure associated to the intervention making use of a lexical-functional grammar [Abaitua et al., 911.",
        "In a second phase the f-structure is refined providing the correct explanation, essentially it solves the verbal interpretation and obtains referential",
        "information.",
        "Then, the planner and/or the dialogue module start to work.",
        "In the remainder of this paper, we will present our dialogue model in a top-down manner.",
        "Firstly, we show the exchange structure adopted and the subcategorization process using two samples.",
        "Then, we explain the retroactive and proactive nature of the interaction and we conclude by presenting two kinds of special interventions, the complex and compound interventions."

        "We assign to the constituents of the exchange level initiative and reactive ilocutive functions.",
        "These functions qualify constituents which arc in the same level of structuration.",

        "The reactive functions constitute the generic class of the answers and they try to satisfy the obligations assumed for the interpretation of the initiative functions.",
        "Analyzing the corpus that we dispose we have detected the following initiative functions : Frog, Frery prell, Freq-aux, Freq-fic, Fqinform, Fqrcf and Fqif.",
        "Freq is a function associated with a petition of achievement a physical action.",
        "Fmnform inquires information about the plan in progress.",
        "Frirof and Fqif demand referential and polar information.",
        "The above initiative functions are completed with the following reactive functions : Finfonnrori, Finform, Finfref and Fief.",
        "We assign to the initiative functions, with directrice characteristics, one exchange schema with similar performance to the semantic forms of the verbs in a lexical-functional context.",
        "This exchange schema will be identified from now with the word SCHEMA.",
        "An schema specification will exhibit the subcategorizations detected inside an exchange.",
        "Therefore, an exchange with an initiative function of type F-qin form, inside which a nested exchange has been produced, will have the following schematic representation : SCHEMA = Tqinformli < Ecomp) (T Finform)> Freq_i„,i, Freq-„n, and Freq-fie are functions subcategorized by Freq and represent preliminaries, auxiliar forms of the request and fictitious executions of actions.",
        "SCHEMA = '<( [Sugcategorized by])> # Fx# <( [Sugcate gorize Jo] )>Just like in a lexical-functional grammar, the initiative function Fqinform subcategorizes to the reactive function Finform and to a subexchange identified by Ecomp• This subexchange has, at the same time, a specific initiative function which subcategorizes to the appropriate reactive function and which is subcategorized by the Fqinform function.",
        "One example of dialogue sequence where this schema could be applied is the following : S1.- How does it modify the camera's diafragm ?",
        "In the model which we are going to present both the exchange structure and the intervention structure are going to be definied using rewriting rules.",

        "(1) D --> El Ei En ( T EF1) ( T EP) = ( T EFn) = D represents a dialogue, Ei the exchange i and EFi the functional specification of the exchange i.",

        "Ij represents the intervention j of exchange E. Both Fx and F represent speech acts of the form F(p).",
        "That is to say, every node Ii will not reflect only the referential and predicative aspect of the interation but also will express the ilocutive force associated to every speech act.",
        "A single exchange will be constituted for an initiative intervention and we could suggest nuclear to the exchange, an initiative-reactive intervention and optionaly for a closure reactive intervention of the exchange.",
        "The functions Fx and F associated with every constituent will be instantiated for some of the initiative and reactive functions introduced before.",
        "The rule (2) formulated above handles balanced conversational sequences, that is to say, sequences of the following form :",
        "S2(I2).- Press the key XY23 and move the lever.",
        "The structural-functional tree which would correspond to this dialogue piece would be the one showed in Fig. 1.",
        "Structuraly the dialogue fragment would be constituted by two exchanges which inform about the physical actions performed by the speaker and which are connected with a high level task.",
        "Let us imagine that instead of the previous dialogue piece we produce another one modified a little :",
        "This second dialogue illustrates a very common phenomena, the speaker departs, momentarily, from the main direction of the conversation, in order to start a secondary exchange which, in most cases, will have a subgoal to be achieved, and then returns to the main axis of the conversation.",
        "In order to manager these cases we propose a rule like this :",
        "(3) Ei --> 11 E'i 12",
        "Fig.",
        "2 shows the dialogue structure obtained by means of the aplication of the above rule.",
        "We associate the schema 2.a to an exchange which has, like initiative intervention, a request function of achievement physical actions.",
        "At the same time, this function subcategorizes to an subordinate exchange - Ec 0 p - and a reactive intervention.",
        "We emphasize that the subordinate exchange Emu has a retroactive nature so that it would not appear at the moment of the initial formulation of the schema.",
        "The schema 2.b is a bit different from the standard notation of a lexical-functional grammar, it specifies an element in the left hand side of the nuclear function.",
        "This element will be at the same time the nuclear function of another exchange and reflects the subcategorization that exists between this element and the nuclear constituent of the subordinate exchange.",
        "The subexchange E'i especified above like F'i --> 1'2, can have, of course, nested dialogues defined with the rule E'i--> (E\"i) 1'2.",
