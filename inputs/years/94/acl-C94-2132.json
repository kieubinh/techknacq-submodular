        "In order to construct systems which can process natural language in a sophisticated fashion it is highly desirable to be able to represent linguistic meanings in a computationally tractable fashion.",
        "One approach to the problem of capturing meanings at the lexical level is to use a form of distributed representation where each word meaning is converted into a point in an n-dimensional space (Sutcliffe, 1992a).",
        "Such representations can capture a wide variety of word meanings within the same formalism.",
        "In addition they can be used within distributed representations for capturing higher level information such as that expressed by sentences (Sutcliffe, 1991a).",
        "Moreover, they can be scaled to suit a particular tradeoff of specificity and memory usage (Sutcliffe, 1991b).",
        "Finally, distributed representations can be processed conveniently by vector processing methods or connectionist algorithms and can be used either as part of a symbolic system (Sutcliffe, 1992b) or within a connectionist architecture (Sutcliffe, 1988).",
        "In previous work we have shown how such representations can be constructed automatically by the method of taxonomic traversal, using the Merriam Webster Compact Electronic dictionary (Sutcliffe, 1993) and the Irish-Irish An FoclOir 13eag (Sutcliffe, McElligott and 0 Neill, 1993).",
        "However our efforts so far have been limited by our parsing technology to lexicons of a few thousand words.",
        "We describe here how we can generate a lexical entry for any of the 71,000 nouns' in the Princeton WordNet (13eckwith, Fellbaum, Gross and Miller, 1992), and the initial tests we have conducted on the representations.",
        "Our method is closely related to other work which exploits the taxonomic nature of dictionary definitions (Amsler, 1980; Hiedorn, Byrd and Cliodorow, 1986; Vossen, 1990; Guthrie, Slator, Wilks and Bruce, 1990; Nutter, Fox and Evens, 1990).",
        "In addition there have already been some very interesting approaches to the construction of distributed semantic representations either front dictionaries (Wilks et al., 1990) or from corpora (Schuetze, 1993)."

        "ing of a set of feature-centrality pairs.",
        "The features are semantic attributes each of which says something about the concept being defined.",
        "The centrality associated with each feature is a real number which indicates how strongly the feature contributes to the meaning of the concept.",
        "The use of centralities allows us to distinguish between important and less iinpor-tont features in a semantic representation.",
        "By scaling the centralities in a particular noun-sense representation so that the sits of their squares is one we call use the dot product operation to compute the semantic similarity of a pair of concepts.",
        "A word compared to itself always scores cm' while a word compared to another word is always less thaii or equal to one.",
        "'''his is equivalent to saying that each word representation is a vector of length one in an u-dimensional space, where n is the monber of features which are used in the lexicon as a whole.",
        "Our algorithm for constructing the representations is based on two well-known observations.",
        "Firstly, a word definition in a dictionary provides attribute information about the concept Ca mastiff is a LARGE dog').",
        "Secondly a word definition also provides taxonomic information about the concept ('a mastiff is a large DOG').",
        "We use the former to derive attributes for our representation, and the latter to obtain other definitions higher up in the taxonomy from which farther attributes can be obtained.",
        "In assigning central-dies to features, we use the same value for each attribute added at, a particular level in the taxonomic hierarchy, and we reduce the value used as we move up to higher levels.",
        "This corresponds to the intuition that a feature which is derived from a definition winch is close to the word of' interest in the taxonomy contributes more to its meaning than one which is derived from a more distant definition.",
        "'Ile Princeton WordNet is very suitable for use in implementing our extraction algorithm because taxonomic links are represented explicitly by pointers.",
        "In roost MRDs such links have to be deduced by syntactic and semantic analysis of sense definitions.",
        "Nouns in WordNet are organised around synsels.",
        "Each synset may include a list of synonyms, pointers to hyponym and hypernyim synsets, and a gloss corresponding to a conventional dictionary definition.",

        "The extraction algorithm starts with the synset corresponding to the word-sense for which we wish to create a lexical entry.",
        "The gloss is tokenised, function words are removed and the remaining content words are converted to their root, inflection.",
        "All such words are considered to be features of the word-sense, and are given a centrality of 1.0.",
        "We then chain upwards using a hypernymic link (if any)'1.",
        "At the next level up, features are extracted from the hypernyin's gloss, using a centrality of 0.9.",
        "The process is repeated, reducing the centrality by 0.1 at, each level, until either the top of the hierarchy is reached or the centrality falls to zero.",
        "Finally, the representation, consisting of a set of feature-centrality pairs, is normalised."
