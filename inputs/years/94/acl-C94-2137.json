        "Applicative Universal Grammar (AUG) is a linguistic theory that uses the formalism of categorial grammar as a means for representing the structure of language.",
        "AUG has two levels: 1) the study of the grammatical structure in itself (genotype grammar), and 2) the study of the linear representation of the grammatical structure (phenotype grammar).",
        "AUG includes a system of combinators (Curry and Keys, 1958) and formulates semiotic concepts, principles, and laws that determine the functioning of natural languages as sign systems (for a complete description of AUG, see Shaumyan, 1974, 1977, 1987; Desclés, 1990; Segond, 1990a; some applications of AIM are discussed in Shaumyan 1989, 1991).",
        "AUG is based on the relation operator-operand, which corresponds to the relation Junction-argument in categorial grammar.",
        "We prefer the terms operator-operand for reasons similar to those given by Ilindley and Seldin (1986, pp.",
        "44-45).",
        "In AI JG categories are generated recursively by the type-forming operator 0, and arc called 0-types.",
        "AUG recognizes two primitive types – terms (nouns and noun-phrases) and sentences, denoted by t and s, respectively.",
        "The rule for generating 0-types is: 1) The primitive types t and s are 0-types.",
        "2) If x and y are 0-types, then Oxy is an 0-type.",
        "(1) For the sake of brevity, we use the term type in the sense of the 0-type.",
        "Taking t and s as primitives, we generate the inductive class of types: t, s, Ott, Oss, Ots, Ost, OtOts, 001sOts, and so on.",
        "In representing the types we use the parentheses-free Polish notation, which is more convenient than Curry's notation with internal parentheses.",
        "The basic rule of combination of phrases is the Rule of Phrase Application, which is defined as follows: Phrase A of type Oxy, called an operator, combines with phrase B of type x, called its operand, to form phrase AB of type y, called its resultant:",
        "Under definition (5) various degrees of relative closeness of syntactic and semantic connection between immediate constituents are distinguished depending on the complexity of a phrase.",
        "In phenotype grammar the application operation is constrained by two principles: the Principle of Adjacency of Operators and Their Operands and the Principle of Uniqueness of Immediate Constituents.",
        "An operator and its operand must be adjacent elements of a sequence, so that the operator either directly precedes or directly follows its operand.",
        "(6) Under the Adjacency Principle we have two new rules the notational variants of operator application: one for forward combination and one for backward combination:",
        "These rules are called the linear Precedence Rules.",
        "An alternative notation for these rules splits the type-forming operator 0 into indexed type-forming operators °r and 01 which generate types of the form 0,xy and Oixy.",
        "The operator of type 0,xy has its operand on its right, and the operator of type Oixy has its operand on its left.",
        "So the Linear Precedence Rules may be presented as follows:",
        "Given the Rule of Phrase Application and Linear Precedence Rules, we can combine the two rule formats into one system, as is done with the corresponding rule formats in Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (Gazdar et al., 1985: 44-50)."

        "In terms of algebra, the Principle of Uniqueness of hnine-diate Constituents corresponds to non-associativity: AUG is a non-associative system.",
        "To make the AUG notation compact, we introduce recursively defined adjoined symbols (Shaumyan 1987: 199): A type symbol is called adjoined if it is introduced into the type system by a definition of the form: z Oxy where z denotes an adjoined type and Oxy denotes a type where x and y are either other adjoined type symbols, or t, or s. (13) This type of definition is called definitional reduction.",
        "By this process all adjoined type symbols are defined in terms of the ultimate definientia t and s. We can introduce as many adjoined type symbols as we need.",
        "here arc examples of the definitional reduction for adjoined type symbols that will be used below:",
        "AUG clahns that a typology of word order must be based on a comparison of specific word orders in individual languages with a canonical word order as defined in genotype grammar.",
        "The canonical word order requires that an operator precedes its adjacent operand.",

        "There is no conclusive psychological evidence that the hearer's recognition of the sentence structure corresponds to the CCG method that disposes with the normal constituency analysis.",
