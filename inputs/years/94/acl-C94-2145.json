        "Recent years have seen the appearance of a number of grammar formalisms' sharing a strong family resemblance, which we have characterised elsewhere [Rupp et al., 1994] as the property of being constraint-based.",
        "As well as having in common many formal properties, these formalisms also support, often by explicit design, descriptions from a similarly convergent range of linguistic theories, which we might reasonably label \"HPSG-like\".",
        "Given the considerable common ground between such formalisms, it is reasonable to begin to ask questions about their intertranslatability, or, in programming language terms, the relative ease with which it is possible to \"port\" a grammar from one such formalism to another.",
        "Such questions are clearly of interest for the enterprise of recovering as much as possible of the existing stock of already encoded linguistic knowledge, perhaps for reuse in a more rnodern theoretical framework.",
        "They are also of relevance for any attempts to build in portability from the start in ongoing new grammar writing.",
        "At present, the criteria for determining whether a particular translation is successful arc extremely fuzzy.",
        "Apart from anything else, they will presumably depend to some extent on external goals, such as, for example, whether the results will be used in a practical, running system or just in a laboratory experiment to show the feasibility of a particular theoretical approach.",
        "In our work, we have, assumed that, if the translation is intended as more than a sterile exercise, then the information in the source description must be worth conserving and hence worth translating.",
        "Moreover, we suppose that the resulting target grammar will need to be maintained and extended, and hence should be well-understood and well-behaved.",
        "Given these assumptions, we can begin to impose some conditions on what constitutes a \"good\" translation; in effect, in a translation from grammar A to grammar 13: 'Currently affiliated to the Institute for Computational Linguistics, University of Stuttgart, Azenbergstr.12, 70174 Stuttgart, Germany, cj©iins.uni-stuttgart.de In the interests of brevity, we shall often use the term grammar to refer to the collection of formal devices which comprise all aspects of a linguistic description, encompassing both grammatical and lexical information.",
        "This is purely a notational convenience and in no way implies a commitment to the primacy of syntax.",
        "• B and A should have the same input-output behaviour.",
        "• 13 should conserve as much as possible of the conceptual shape of A.. • B should have comparable or better runtime performance with respect to A.",
        "The first condition is a consequence, if somewhat oversimplified, of the assumptions we made above, that the main purpose of the exercise is to preserve useful information.",
        "The second condition has to do with the relative expressivity of the two formalisms involved.",
        "In effect, how much of the conceptual and organisational structure of a linguistic description can pass over unchanged, and to what extent do conceptual changes that may have to be made obscure our subsequent understanding of the description as a whole?",
        "The question of performance is not limited to the relative execution speed of source and target grammars, though its importance for subsequent maintenance and development cannot be overstated.",
        "How do we approach the case, for example, where the source grammar runs normally in its native environment but the translated form fails to terminate unless the description is completely restructured?",
        "And what if the two systems use conflicting criteria for the apportionment of procedural control between the linguist and the implementation?",
        "Over the past year, we have been engaged on a number of experiments designed to investigate these portability issues, and in particular to bring out the implications behind the two related sets of questions about expressivity and performance.",
        "In some ways, our work is similar in spirit to the reusability experiments reported in [Arnold et al., 1993], though these appear to have been limited to translation to a single, rather general formalism, and to have been concerned almost entirely with questions of relative expressivity.",
        "The remainder of this paper discusses our own experiments and comments on some of our more important findings so far."

        "The consequences of these distinctions are explored in more detail below.",

        "Each of the formalisms we consider permits the definition of feature structure types, but the form and expressivity of these type definitions differ quite considerably, as does the significance of type defini-Lions in the description as a whole.",
        "The extreme cases are TIN, in which the type system is virtually all there is, and UD, where type definitions simply constrain the attributes which can occur on a feature structure.",
        "At this point we should note that a type system in the \"true\" or IIPSG sense, requires a notion of type inheritance which can he further subdivided into three concepts:",
        "• subtype/supertype relations • feature appropriateness conditions • closure conditions",
        "Type definitions which form a type system usually encode iinmediate subtypes and feature appropriateness conditions, which specify, at least, the attributes which",
        "are licensed by the type and the types of their values, as in Figure 1.",
        "Closure is usually a derived notion, in that only attributes licensed by the type or one of its supertypes may occur, an unlicensed attribute incurring either further subtyping or inconsistency.",

        "They give an entirely flat system with the most absolute closure and the most minimal appropriateness conditions.",
        "The type definitions of the other formalisms, TFS, CUF and ALE, differ mainly in the expressivity of their appropriateness conditions, in order of decreasing expressivity, cf [Man-andhar, 1993] for a more detailed comparison of these type systems.",
        "Evidently, one of the most basic hurdles to translating any of the other formalisms into UD is the reconstruction of the type system.",
        "This was the problem posed in our initial experiment of porting an IIPSG grammar encoded in TFS into UD.",
        "Our solution to this problem, cf Figure 2, consists of separating out the hierarchies of sub and supertype dependencies from those of feature appropriateness, so that each node in the type hierarchy is represented by two unary abstraction definitions in the UD encoding.",
        "UD types are only utilised on the terminal nodes of the type hierarchy to ensure ultimate closure.",

        "in general, we expect that, other things being equal, a formalism whose implementation contains dedicated processors for phrase structure parsing and/or string processing will have better runtime performance than one which does not, and this is indeed borne out empirically in the behaviour of the systems we considered.",
        "The presence or absence of an explicit parser also has obvious consequences for porting experiments.",

        "Portability in the other direction poses considerably greater problems, since not only must the phrase structure description be encoded, but some parsing strategy must also be defined.",

        "Of course, this apparent dichotomy is to some extent illusory.",

        "Where local control information is specified in the ordering of statements in definitions, we are effectively requiring that the grammar writer be an accomplished logic programmer.",
        "Where local control information is added to supplement an existing grammar description the implicit assumption is even more demanding: that there are individuals capable of appending local control information to descriptions that other people have written or worse still translated -- and of getting it right.",
        "Both of these approaches ultimately assume that it is not only possible but relatively easy to retain a detailed picture of the behaviour of a complex constraint solver.",
        "When translating to a formalism which permits local control from one which does not, the issue may come down simply to a question of relative speed of computation, which is important enough in itself in practical situations, as we have already pointed out.",

        "Nonetheless, our experience already suggests, in keeping with [Arnold el al., 1993], that from the point of view of relative expressivity it is possible to move grammars from one formalism to another, and even perhaps to conceive of new grammars which are designed from the start to be portable across a range of related formalisms.",
