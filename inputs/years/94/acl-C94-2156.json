        "'the majority of speech synthesis systems use two techniques: concatenation and formant-synthesis.",
        "Building a comprehensive and intelligible concatenative-based speech synthesis system relies heavily on the successful choice of concatenative units.",
        "Our results contribute to the task of developing an efficient and effective methodology for reducing the potentially large set of concaten-tive units to a manageable size, and to chosing the optimal set for recording and storage.",
        "The paper is aimed primarily at two audiences: one consists of those concerned with research on the automatic use of MRD data; the other are 'TTS system designers who require linguistic and lexicographic resources to improve and streamline system-building.",

        "Several problems are addressed in this paper; one concerns the subtle complexities and idiosyncrasies involved in parsing dictionaries and extracting data.",
        "Added to this is the lack of consistency both within the same dictionary and across dictionaries which often requires ad hoc procedures for each.",
        "resource.",
        "Another issue relates to the structure of the modules of a TTS system, specifically in the grapheme-to-phoneme component; dictionary lookup depends on several factors including size, machine power and storage, factors that have important consequences for the extraction of concatenative units.",
        "Another consideration concerns the nature of the language itself: a language with irregular grapheme-to-phoneme mapping and lexically determined stress assignment (such as English) benefits most from the large exception list which a dictionary can provide, There is also the practical issue of dictionary availability, and of pronunciation field accuracy within an available dictionary.",
        "Thus, decisions on the use of MRD data depend on many factors, and can significantly impact efficiency and accuracy of a speech system.",
        "Since a dictionary entry consists of several fields of information, naturally, each will be useful for different applications [1].",
        "Among the standard fields are pronunciation, etymology, subject field notes, definition fields, synonym and antonym cross references, semantic and syntactic comments, run-on forms, conjugational class and inflectional information where relevant, and translation for the bilingual dictionaries.",
        "Each of these fields has proven useful for different applications, such as for building semantic taxonomies [3], [13] and machine translation [12].",
        "The most directly useful for TTS is the pronunciation field [4], [11].",
        "Equally useful for `1\"[S, but less directly acces",
        "sible, are data from run-on fields, conjugational class information, and part-of-speech.",
        "1 To illustrate, the following partial entries from Webster's Seventh (W7) [15] illustrate typical pronunciation, definition, and run-on fields:",
        "(3) ha.ven th.a-van/ n 1: HARBOR, POW!'",
        "2 : a place of safety : ASYLUM â€“ haven vt (2) bi.son this-an, n (3) ho.mo.ge.neous -nyas/ (4) den.tie.u.late /den-'tik-yo-lat/ or den.tic.u.lat.ed /-,lat-ad/ adj",
        "The entry for \"haven\" contains one full pronunciation.",
        "The entry for \"bison\" has one alternative, but the user must figure out that the /an/ should he appended after 'biz-/, as in the first pronunciation, in order to obtain the correct variation.",
        "Correct pronunciation for \"homogeneous\" relies on the pronunciation of the previous en-try,\"homogeneity\" , and requires the user to separate and bring the prefix \"homo-\" from one entry to another.",
        "To complicate matters, the alternative pronunciation for the suffix /ne-os/-nyas/ must also be correctly interpreted by the user.",
        "Finally, \"denticulate\" has a morphologically related run-on form \"denticulated\" in the early part of the entry, and the pronunciation of that run-on is related to the main entry, but the user must decide how to strip and append the given syllables.",
        "2 While these types of reasoning are not difficult for humans, for whom the dictionary was written, they are quite difficult for programs, and thus are not straighforward to perform automatically.",
        "2.1 Using the MRD pronunciation field Extracting the pronunciation field from an MRD is one of the most obvious uses of a dictionary.",
        "Nevertheless, parsing dictionaries in general can be a very complex operation ([16]) and even the extraction of one field, such as pronunciation, can pose problems.",
        "Similar to W7, in the Robert French dictionary [9], which contains about 89,000 entries, several pronunciations can be given for a headword and the choice of one must be made.",
        "Moreover, because of the rich morphology of French I Notice, however, that the full Collins Spanish-English dictionary [7], as opposed to the other bilinguals, does not contain any pronunciation information.",
        "Although this is rather surprising taking into account that the smaller versions such as the paperback and gem ([8], POD do have a phonetic field, it could be attributed to the fact that pronunciation rules in Spanish are relatively predictable.",
        "2 [2] reports on the need to resyllabify entries already syllabified in LDOCE [18], since syllable boundaries for written forms usually reflect hyphenation conventions, rather than phonologically motivated syllabification conventions necessary for pronunciation.",
        "which has a rough ratio of eight morphologically inflected words for one baseform, Robert lists only the non-inflected forms of the lexical entries.",
        "However, if pronunciation varies during inflection of nouns and adjectives, the pronunciation field reflects that variation which makes the information difficult to extract automatically.",
        "For example, in",
        "(5) and (6), one needs to know the nature of the rule to apply in order to relate both forms of the adjective.",
        "(5) blanc, blanche big/ adj.",
        "et n. (6) vif, vivo /vif, viv/ adj.",
        "et n.",

        "In (6), the form masculine form /vif/ (\"sharp, quick\") is formed by stripping the affix /ye/ and substituting the phoneme /f/.",
        "Notice that the rules are different in nature, the first being a addition/deletion relation, and the second being a substitution.",
        "In this project, the dictionary pronunciation field was used to start building the phonetic inventory of a speech synthesis system.",
        "For the French TTS system [?",
        "], the set of diphones was established by taking most of the thirty-five phonemes for French and coupling them with each other (352 = 1225 pairs).",
        "Then, the diphones were extracted from the pronunciation field for headwords in the Robert dictionary.",
        "A program was written to search through the dictionary phonetic field and select the longest word where the phoneme pairs would be in mid-syllable position.",
        "For example, the phonemic pair /lo/ was found in the pronunciation field /zoolo3ik/ corresponding to the headword zoologique \"zoologic.\" Out of 1225 phonemic pairs, 874 words were found with at least one occurence of the pair.",
        "The pair [headword_orth, headword_phon] was extracted and headword_orth was placed in a carrier sentence for recording.",
        "For instance, the speaker would utter the following sentence: \"C'est so-ologique que je dis\" where \"C'est que je dis\" is the carrier sentence.",
        "Due to the lack of explicit inflectional information for nouns and adjectives, only the non-inflected forms of the entries were extracted during dictionary lookup for building the diphone table.",
        "Similarly for verbs, only the infinitive forms were used since the dictionary does not list the inflected forms as headwords.",
        "This exemplifies the most simple way to use pronunciation field data, which we have completed.",
        "A pronunciation list of around 85,796 phonetic words was obtained from the original list of almost 89,000 entries, i.e. 96% of the entries.",
        "The remaining 4% consist primarily of prefixes and suffixes which are listed in the dictionary without pronunciations,",

        "The most straightforward way, but in the long run not the most flexible, is to parse the phonetic information out of the pronunciation field.",
        "The pronunciation field information can generally be .onsulted by a TTS system within the grapheme-o-phoneme module.",
        "Additional rules for pro-esses such as inter-word assimilation, juncture, nd prosodic contouring need to be added, since solated word pronunciation could already be han-led by lookup table.",
        "Although appealing, there re two major drawbacks to this approach: (a) dictionary pronunciation fields are often not honetically fine-grained enough for acceptable speech output.",
        "For example, the pronunciation for \"inquest\" is given in W7 as tin-,kwesti, but of course the nasal will assimilate in place to the velar, giving /in-kwest/.",
        "Without assimilation, the perceptual effect is of two words: \"in quest\" and would be misleading.",
        "Again, the human user will assimilate naturally, but a text to speech system must figure out such details, since articulatory ease is not a factor in most synthesis systems.",
        "One way to solve this problem is to impose such assimilation on input from the pronunciation field by a set of post-processing rules.",
        "Although this solution would be correct in the majority of cases, blanket application of such rules is not always appropriate for lexical exceptions.",
        "For example, assimilation is optional for words like \"uncaring\", in this case related to the morphological structure of the lexical item.",
        "A TTS system will probably already have such rules since they are inherent in the grapheme-to-phoneme approach.",
        "Thus, it could be argued that there is no need for the dictionary pronunciation, since with a complete and comprehensive grapheme-to-phoneme conversion system, a list which requires post-processing is simply inadequate and unnecessary.",
        "This is the approach taken, for example, by [14], who makes use of small word lists (the main dictionary being 25K stored forms) and several affix tables to recognize graphemic forms, which are then transformed into phonemic representations; (b) only a small percentage of possible words are listed with pronunciations in a dictionary.",
        "For example, Webster's Seventh contains about 70,000 headwords, but is missing words like \"computerize\" and \"computerization\" since they came into frequent use in the language after the 1963 publication date.",
        "Two solutions to this problem present themselves.",
        "One is to expand the word list from the dictionary to include run-on's, as illustrated in examples (3) and (4), and discussed in Section 2.3.",
        "The other is to build a morphological generator,",
        "using headwords, part of speech, and other information as input, discussed in Section 2.2 that would be invoked when the word does not figure in the headword list."

        "For speech synthesis, the data is not always perfect, and often must be post-processed.",
