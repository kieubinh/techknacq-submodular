        "Most dialogue understanding studies have focused on the mental states, plans, and intentions of the participants (Cohen et al., 1990).",
        "These studies have presumed that utterances can be analyzed syntactically and semantically and that the representation of the speech acts performed by those utterances can be obtained.",
        "Spontaneously spoken utterances differ considerably from written sentences, however, so it is not possible to analyze them syntactically and semantically when using a grammar for written sentences.",
        "Spontaneous speech, a sequence of spontaneously spoken utterances, can be distinguished from well-planned utterances like radio news and movie dialogues.",
        "Much effort has been put into incorporating grammatical information into speech understanding (e.g., Hayes et al.",
        "(1986), Young et al.",
        "(1989), Okada (1991)), but because this work has focused on well-planned utterances, spontaneously spoken utterances have received little attention.",
        "This has partly been due to the lack of a grammar and processing technique that can be applied to spontaneous speech.",
        "Consequently, to attain an understanding of dialogues it is necessary to develop a way to analyze spontaneous speech syntactically and semantically.",
        "There are two approaches to developing this kind of analysis method: one is to develop a grammar and analysis method for spontaneous speech that do not depend on syntactic constraints as much as the conventional methods for written sentences do (Den, 1993), and the other is to augment the grammar used for written sentences and modify the conventional analysis method to deal with spontaneous speech.",
        "The former method would fail, however, when new information is conveyed in the utterances; that is, when the semantic characteristics of the dialogue topic are not known to the hearer.",
        "In such cases, even in a dialogue, the syntactic constraints are used for understanding utterances.",
        "Because methods that disregard syntactic constraints would not work well in these kinds of cases, we took the latter approach.",
        "We analyzed more than a hundred dialogue transcripts and classified the distinctive phenomena in spontaneous Japanese speech.",
        "To handle those phenomena, we develop a computational model called Ensemble Model (Shimazu et al., 1993b), in which syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic processing modules and modules that do combination of some or all of those processing analyze the input in parallel and independently.",
        "Even if some of the modules are unable to analyze the input, the other modules still output their results.",
        "This model can handle various kinds of irregular expressions, such as case particle omission, inversions, and fragmentary expressions.",
        "We also developed Grass 3 (Grammar for spontaneous speech in Japanese), which enables the syntactic and semantic processing modules of the Ensemble Model to deal with some of the phenomena peculiar to spontaneous speech.",
        "Since Grass-J is all augmentation of a grammar used to analyze written sentences (Gnat-J, Grammar for texts in Japanese), Grass J-based parsers can be used for syntactically complex utterances.",
        "There are two distinctive features of Grass-J.",
        "One is that its focus is on the short units in spontaneous speech, called utterance units, An utterance unit instead of a sentence as in Grat-J is used as a grammatical category and is taken as the start, symbol.",
        "A Grass-J-based parser takes an utterance unit as input and outputs the representation of the speech act (illocutionary act) performed by the unit.",
        "The other distinctive feature is a focus on expressions peculiar to spontaneous speech, and here we explain how to augment Graf- J so that it can handle them.",
        "Previous studies of spontaneous speech analysis have focused mainly on repairs and ellipses (Bear et al., 1992; Langer, 1990; Nakatani Sr, Hirschberg, 1993; Otsuka k Okada, 1992), rather than expressions peculiar to spontaneous speech.",
