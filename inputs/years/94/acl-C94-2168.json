        "Aims of the project",
        "The general aim of our project is to improve the quality of existing systems extracting knowledge from texts by introducing refined lexical semantics data.",
        "The contribution of lexical semantics to knowledge extraction is not new and has already been demonstrated in a few systems.",
        "Our more precise aims are to: - propose and show feasability of more radical semantic classifications which facilitate lexical descriptions by factoring out as much information as possible, enhancing re-usability of linguistic ressources.",
        "We show how the different linguistic ressources can be organized and how they interact, - investigate different levels of granularity in the semantic descriptions and their impact on the quality of the extracted knowledge.",
        "In our system, granularity is considered at two levels: (1) linguistic: linguistic knowledge representations may be more or less precise, (2) functional: most modules of our system can work independently and thus can be used separately, - evaluate different algorithms for extracting knowledge, taking into account efficiency aspects, - evaluate the costs of extending our system to larger sets of texts and to different application domains.",
        "Our project is applied to research projects descriptions (noted hereafter as RPD) where the annual work of researchers at the DER of EDF (Direction des Etudes et des Recherches, Electricit√≥ de France) is described in terms of research actions.",
        "The extracted knowledge must be, sufficiently accurate to allow for the realization of the following purposes: (1) evaluation of the importance of the use of techniques, procedures and equipments, (2) automatic distribution of documents in different services, (3) interrogation, e.g. who does what and what kind of results are available, (4) identification of relations of various types between projects, (5) construction of synthesis of research activities on precise topics, and (6) creation of the 'history' of a project.",
        "About 2.",
        "()00 RPD are produced each year, each of about 200 words long.",
        "The total vocabulary is about 50.000 different words.",
        "Texts include fairly complex linguistic constructs.",
        "We also use the EDF thesaurus (encoding for nouns: taxonomies, associative relations, and synonyms, in a broad sense).",
        "In this document, we first introduce the linguistic organization of our project, present the general form of texts and identify the type of information which must be extracted out of them.",
        "Next, we present a semantic representation for the extracted knowledge, and study in more depth the extraction of information under the form of predicate-argument and predicate-modifier structures (Jackendoff 87a, Katz and Fodor 63)."

        "Here are the different linguistic components of our system:",
        "Thematic roles (Dowty 89), (Dowty 91) paired with selectional restrictions and semantic information allow for the production or recognition of surface forms corresponding to 'basic' sentential forms.",
        "More complex forms will be treated by a system of alternations, derived from the semantic classification of verbs defined by (Levin 93).",
        "In our approach, we consider a set of primitive elements, either general or related to our application domain, which includes notions such as being in contact with, being in spatial motion, or being the cause of.",
        "This set of primitives is designed so that it corresponds to those needed for the definition of the semantic classes of verbs, where the syntactic behavior of a verb (and thus the different ways the arguments can he distributed and should he analysed by the parser and put at the right place in the semantic representation) essentially depends on the verb's semantic nature.",
        "This approach allows for a really comprehensive treatment of predicate-argument structures because it complements the basic syntactic mappings realized from thematic roles specifications.",
        "Furthermore, this approach requires very economical lexical means",
        "since it removes a lot of idiosyncracies previously encoded in lexical entries.",
        "We are reformulating B. Levin's work for a subset of verbs of French.",
        "Although our study is quite general, we focus primarily on verbs found in applications.",
        "Verbs of a given class have almost identical thematic distributions which are predictable from their semantics.",
        "For each of the semantic classes we have considered, we have defined a relatively small set of thematic grids, which define the 'regular' thematic distributions.",
        "From a different perspective, we also consider that a subset of the semantic primitives we have identified are those used in the LCS, which we use in a slightly simplified way, since we do not consider for our application its deepest refinements.",
        "The efficient use of LCS for practical applications has been shown in a number of works, including (Doff 93)."

        "For this level, we have implemented a method which permits the identification of the different articulations of a text.",
        "This problem is divided into two sub-problems: (1) identification of the articulations, and (2) extraction of relevant sentence fragments from the original text.",
        "A study of the RPD texts has shown that these four articulations can relatively easily be identified by means of specific terms or constructions.",
        "Let us call these terms or constructions articulation triggers.",

        "(1) lexical, where triggers are just words, e.g. 'devoted to', 'in the context of', 'propose', for THEME, (2) grammatical, where triggers can be phrases, or related to grammatical information (such as tense and aspect, e.g. 'in the past years', 'since 1989', for THEME), or verbs or nouns of certain semantic class, e.g. verbs of volition, of creation (Levin 93), (3) discursive, where triggers are mainly propositional connectors such as 'therefore', 'because', etc., (4) pragmatic, where the relative positions of sentences and more generally, the physical form of texts (e.g. enumerations) can determine articulations.",
        "The next stage is to extract those portions of text which are relevant for the articulation considered.",
        "Since the linguistic treatements of this first level are necessarily superficial, we must carefully discard irrelevant portions of texts.",
        "This approach has been modelled by means of extraction rules, which specify words and constructions to skip and which delimit zones of texts to be extracted.",

        "Roughly speaking, the first class identifies arguments, the second class defines predicates, while the third one introduces the notion of semantic roles such as thematic roles.",
        "This latter level is of a crucial importance in knowledge extraction because it avoids making incorrect interpretations on the role of an argument with respect to the action or state being described.",
        "This level is called the linguistic level.",

        "meaning into a class and to represent them by the same predicate name, viewed as a primitive term.",
        "For example, we have terms which express the notion of definition (e.g. define, specify, describe, identify, qualify, represent) or the notion of building (e.g. assemble, build, compile, develop, forge) as defined in B. Levin's work.",
        "However, for a relatively small number of classes, in particular for those classes of predicates which denote complex actions and for those which exhibit a high degree of incorporation (Baker 88), where incorporated knowledge needs to he made more explicit, it may be necessary to use a more conceptual type of representation.",
        "We want to investigate the use the Lexical Conceptual Structures (LCS) (Jackendoff 87, 90) which match very well with the planned uses of the extracted knowledge on the one hand, and with the notion of thematic roles on the other hand.",
