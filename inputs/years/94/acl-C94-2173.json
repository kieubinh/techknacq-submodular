        "In information extraction systems, finite-state pattern matchers are becoming popular as a means of identifying individual pieces of information in a sentence.",

        "Among seventeen systems presented in the Fifth Message Understanding Conference (MUC-5), three systems used a pattern matcher as the main component for identifying patterns to be extracted [MUC-5 93].",
        "A pattern matching architecture is appropriate for information extraction from texts in narrow domains since identifying information does not necessarily require full understanding of the text.",
        "The pattern matcher can extract information of inter",
        "est by locating specific expressions defined as key words and phrasal patterns obtained by corpus analysis.",
        "This paper describes a. pattern matching method that first identifies concepts in a sentence and then links critical pieces of information that map to a pattern.",
        "The first step in pattern matching is a concept search applied in the TEXTRACT system of the TIPSTER, Japanese microelectronics and corporate joint ventures domains [Jacobs 93a], [Jacobs 93b].",
        "In this step, key words representing a concept are searched for within a sentence.",
        "The second step is a. template pattern search applied in the TEXTRACT joint ventures system.",
        "A complex pattern to be searched for usually consists of a few words and phrases, instead of just one word, as in the concept search.",
        "The template pattern search recognizes relationships between matched objects in the defined pattern as well as recognizing the concept itself.",
        "From the viewpoints of system performance and portability across domains, the TIPSTER/MUC-5 evaluation results suggest that pattern matching described in this paper is an appropriate architecture for information extraction from Japanese texts."

        "It is also equipped with a discourse processor, as shown in Fig.",

        "(j g) or (DISSOLVED dissolve terminate cancel).",
        "The concept search module recognizes the concept when a word in the list exists in the sentence.",
        "Using such a simple word list sometimes generates an incorrect concept.",
        "For example, a dissolved concept is erroneously identified from an expression \"cancel a hotel reservation\".",
        "However, when processing text in a narrow domain, concepts are often identified correctly from the simple list, since key words are usually used in a. particular meaning of interest in the domain.",
        "During the Japanese segmentation process in the preprocessor, a key word in the text tends to be divided into a few separate words by MAJESTY, when the word is not stored in the dictionary, For example, the compound noun \"MAfiff:/[1\" consists of two words, \"tar (joint venture) and \"fffM\" (dissolve).",
        "It is segmented into the two individual nouns using the current MAJESTY dictionary.",
        "Thus, when the compound word \"tunrim\" is searched for in the segmented sentence, the concept search fails to identify it.",
        "To avoid this segmentation problem, adjacent nouns are automatically put together during the concept search process.",
        "This process allows, by default, partial word matching between a key word and a word in the text.",
        "Therefore, \"ifi'A\" and \"IA nvij\" both meaning \"a joint venture\" can be identified by a single key word \"Vitt!;\".",

        "Moreover, since patterns are often searched using case markers such as \"a\", \"Ai.\", and \" which frequently appear in Japanese texts, even a single pattern can match the sentence in snore than one way when several of the same case markers exist in a sentence.",
        "however, since the template generator accepts only the best snatched pattern, choosing a correctly matched pattern is important.",
        "The selection is done by applying three heuristic rides in the following order:",
        "• select patterns that include the most number of matched company-name variables in which there is at least one company name, • select patterns that consume the fewest input segments (the shortest string match), and • select patterns that include the most number of variables and defined words.",
        "Another important feature of the pattern snatcher is that rules can be grouped according to their concept.",
        "A rule name \"JointVenturel\" in Fig. 2, for example, represents a concept \"JointVenture\".",
        "Using this grouping, the best matched pattern call be selected from snatched patterns of a particular concept group instead of choosing front all the matched patterns.",
