        "Various methods have been proposed for aligning texts in two or more languages such as the Canadian Parliamentary Debates (Hansards).",
        "Some of these methods generate a bilingual lexicon as a by-product.",
        "We present an alternative alignment strategy which we call K-vec, that starts by estimating the lexicon.",
        "For example, it discovers that the English word fisheries is similar to the French peches by noting that the distribution of fisheries in the English text is similar to the distribution of peches in the French.",
        "K-vec does not depend on sentence boundaries."

        "There have been quite a number of recent papers on parallel text: Brown et al. (1990, 1991, 1993), Chen (1993), Church (1993), Church et al. (1993), Dagan et al. (1993), Gale and Church (1991, 1993), Isabelle (1992), Kay and ROsenschein (1993), Klavans and Tzoukermann (1990), Kupiec (1993), Matsumoto (1991), Ogden and Gonzales (1993), Shemtov (1993), Simard et al. (1992), Warwick-Armstrong and Russell (1990), Wu (to appear).",
        "Most of this work has been focused on European language pairs, especially English-French.",
        "It remains an open question how well these methods might generalize to other language pairs, especially pairs such as English-Japanese and English-Chinese.",
        "In previous work (Church et al., 1993), we have reported some preliminary success in aligning the English and Japanese versions of the AWK manual (Aho, Kernighan, Weinberger (1980)), using char align (Church, 1993), a method that looks for character sequences that are the same in both the source and target.",
        "The char_align method was designed for European language pairs, where cognates often share character sequences, e.g., government and gouvernement.",
        "In general, this approach doesn't work between languages such as English and Japanese which are written in different alphabets.",
        "The AWK manual happens to contain a large number of examples and technical words that are the same in the English source and target Japanese.",
        "It remains an open question how we might be able to align a broader class of texts, especially those that are written in different character sets and share relatively few character sequences.",
        "The K-vec method attempts to address this question."

        "K-vec starts by estimating the lexicon.",
        "Consider the example: fisheries peches.",
        "The K-vec algorithm will discover this fact by noting that the distribution of fisheries in the English text is similar to the distribution of peches in the French.",
        "The concordances for fisheries and peches are shown in Tables 1 and 2 (at the end of this paper).1",
        "There are 19 instances of fisheries and 21 instances of peches.",
        "The numbers along the left hand edge show where the concordances were found in the texts.",
        "We want to know whether the distribution of numbers in Table 1 is similar to those in Table 2, and if so, we will suspect that fisheries and peches are translations of one another.",
        "A quick look at the two tables suggests that the two distributions are probably very similar, though not quite identical.2 We use a simple representation of the distribution of fisheries and peches.",
        "The English text and the French text were each split into K pieces.",
        "Then we determine whether or not the word in question appears in each of the K pieces.",
        "Thus, we denote the distribution of fisheries in the English text with a K-dimensional binary vector, Vir, and similarly, we denote the distribution of peches in the French text with a K-dimensional binary vector, Vp.",
        "The bit of yf indicates whether or not Fisheries occurs in the piece of the English text, and similarly, the ill' bit of V p indicates whether or not peches occurs in the ilh piece of the French text.",
        "If we take K be 10, the first three instances of fisheries in Table 1 fall into piece 2, and the remaining 16 fall into piece 8.",
        "Similarly, the first 4 instances of peches in Table 2 fall into piece 2, and the remaining 17 fall into piece 8.",
        "Thus,",
        "Now, we want to know if V fis similar to V p, and if we find that it is, then we will suspect that fisheries – > peches.",
        "In this example, of course, the vectors are identical, so practically any reasonable similarity statistic ought to produce the desired result.",
        "3. fisheries is not the translation of lections",
        "Before describing how we estimate the similarity of V fand V p, let us see what would happen if we tried to compare fisheries with a completely unrelated word, eg., lections.",
        "(This word should be the translation of elections, not fisheries.)",
        "2.",
        "At most, fisheries can account for only 19 instances of peches, leaving at least 2 instances of peches unexplained.",
        "As can be seen in the concordances in Table 3 , for K=10, the vector is <1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0>.",
        "By almost any measure of similarity one could imagine, this vector will be found to be quite different from the one for fisheries, and therefore, we will correctly discover that fisheries is not the translation of lections.",
        "To make this argument a little more precise, it might help to compare the contingency matrices in Tables 5 and 6.",
        "The contingency matrices show: (a) the number of pieces where both the English and French word were found, (b) the number of pieces where just the English word was found, (c) the number of pieces where just the French word was found, and (d) the number of peices where neither word was found.",
        "In general, if the English and French words are good translations of one another, as in Table 5, then a should be large, and b and c should be small.",

        "By this definition of significance, we need to see the two words in at least 3 different pieces before the result would be considered significant.",

        "However, we can only increase K up to a point.",
        "If we set K to a ridiculously large value, say the size of the English text, then an English word and its translations are likely to fall in slightly different pieces due to random fluctuations and we would miss the signal.",
        "For this work, we set K to the square root of the size of the corpus.",
        "K should be thought of as a scale parameter.",
        "If we use too low a resolution, then everything turns into a blur and it is hard to see anything.",
        "But if we use too high a resolution, then we can miss the signal if",
        "it isn't just exactly where we are looking.",
        "Ideally, we would like to apply the K-vec algorithm to all pairs of English and French words, but unfortunately, there are too many such pairs to consider.",
