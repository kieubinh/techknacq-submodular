        "Although we analyse mainly Japanese sentences, the results can be applied to other languages.",
        "The dichotomy of a Japanese sentence is represented by the postpositions wa and ga. For example, the following two sentences are different in dichotomy, and used in diffrent situations: (a) Taroo wa Cakusei dean.",

        "(b) Tarim ga Gakusei dean.",

        "The NP (noun phrase) of (a) marked with wa functions as a theme, i.e., it should have already appeared in the preceding discourse and thus can be considered as an old information.",
        "Therefore, in the discourse, sentence (a) should be preceded by a sentence that contains Taroo as a rheme (new information).",
        "For example, Taroo in the following sentence can be considered as a new information: (c) 'Taroo ga imasu.",

        "To explain the difference between (a) and (b) in the utterance level, we annotate Ax.student(x) of (a) and (b) by different typed A-terms.",
