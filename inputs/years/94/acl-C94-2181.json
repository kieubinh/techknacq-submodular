        "Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) due to Kamp (1981) provides a promising framework for discourse semantics.",
        "DRT is in fact successul in formalizing several challenging topics, e.g. anaphora, tense and belief; see Asher (1986, 1993) and Heim (1982).",
        "Due to its clear semantics with the construction algorithm, DRT is also used as a background theory in computational linguistics; see Wada and Asher (1986) and Ishikawa and Akama (1992).",
        "However, DRT lacks a deductive (proof-theoretic) formulation to serve as an abstract interpreter for discourse understanding, since it is formalized by means of the notion of partial models.",
        "This prevents us from utilizing DRT in various ways for natural language understanding systems.",
        "To make DRT more flexible for computational linguistics, we need to generalize a formal basis in a proof-theoretic fashion.",
        "If this is su&;essful, computational linguists will be able to reconstruct DRT for their own systems using programming languages like Prolog and LISP.",
        "There are perhaps several ways to give an operational semantics of DRT.",
        "One of the attractive approaches is to investigate consequence relations associated with DRT.",
        "It is thus very useful to study some consequence relations in DRT to develop different versions of DRT.",
        "The purpose of this paper is to explore consequence relations in DRT, one of which exactly produces Kamp's original semantics.",
        "We incorporate some consequence relations defined by partial semantics into DRT using sequent calculi.",
        "Our attempt enables us to display several versions of DRT by employing different consequence relations.",
        "We also show some connections of the proposed consequence relations and partial logics in the literature."

        "In this section, we give a brief introduction to DRT.",
        "For a detailed exposition, the reader should consult Asher (1993).",
        "The basic idea of DRT is to formalize a dynamic representation of partial interpretations by means of classical models using a construction algorithm of discourse representation structures (DRSs).",
        "Observe that DRSs can be regarded as such abstract objects as partial models, mental representations, or (partial) possible worlds.",
        "But,",
        "such identifications do not seem essential to the significance of DRT.",
        "The language of DRT is called Discourse Representation Language (DRL), which is like a standard quantifier-free first-order language except discourse referents and conditions.",
        "The logical symbols of DRL include = (identity), (conditional), V (disjunction) and (negation).",
        "A discourse representation (DR) K is expressed as a pair (UK, ConK), where UK is a set of discourse referents, and Conic is a set of conditions.",
        "Each condition is either atomic or complex.",
        "Complex conditions are of the form: K1 => K2, K1 V K2 or -,K1, where both K1 and K2 are DRs.",
        "A discourse representation structure (DRS) is a partially ordered set of DRs, which can be constructed by means of DRS construction rules whose application reflects the syntactic composition of the sentences in the discourse.",
        "When each DR of a DRS is maximal, the DRS is called a complete DRS.",
        "Intuitively speaking, each stage in the construction algorithm can be viewed as a partial possible worlds, hi which more information resulting from the processing of a further bit of the discourse changes it into a more precise description of the world.",
        "A model for DRL is an ordered pair (Dm, Fm), where DM is the domain of M and FM is an interpretation function of constants and predicates.",
        "An embedding function for a DR K in a model M is a mapping from discourse referents in UK into the domain of M. An extension of an embedding function f for Kul M to an embedding function g for K' in M is defined as g: (Dorn(f) U UK,) DM.",
        "We write f CK g to mean that g extends an embedding function f to an embedding of K'.",
        "The notaion M C abbreviates that M satisfies C under f for K. A proper embedding of Kin M is an embedding function such that f UK g and for any condition C in K, M=gC.",
        "The notions of proper embedding and satisfaction can be extended to general cases by simultaneous recursion; see Asher (1993).",
        "A DR K is shown to be true in a model M ilf there is a proper embedding of K in M. A DR K implies a DR K' if every model in which K is true is also a model in which K' is true.",
        "This definition induces a consequence relation in DRT, but we have no reason to consider it as the only plausible for DRT.",
        "in fact, it is our job hi this paper to seek alternate definitions."

        "Calculi A partial semantics for classical logic is implicit in the so-called Beth tableaux.",
