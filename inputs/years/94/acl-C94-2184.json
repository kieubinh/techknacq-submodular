        "Pronominal anaphora resolution, as part of a more general process of anaphora resolution, is a determinant step in constructing a semantic representation of a text.",
        "Although \"general cognitive processes DO play a role in establishing anaphoric dependencies (...)\" (Kempson, 1990 p.14), inference is, in computational terms, a very expensive process, both for the amount of processing involved and for the extension of the knowledge bases required.",
        "Therefore, any system aiming at efficiency in anaphora resolution should minimize the role of inference.",
        "As far as DRT is concerned, the construction rule for pronouns states that the referent introduced by the pronoun should be bound to a suitable referent, chosen among those that are accessible (Kamp and Reyle, 1993 p.122).",
        "The accessibility is based on semantic constraints and is expressed by the structure of DRS representing the text.",
        "However the suitability of referents is ill-defined.",
        "Another perspective for anaphora resolution is founded on the principle of relevance, i.e. on \"the presumption that every utterance is selected to convey the intended interpretation while imposing to the hearer the least amount of processing effort in constructing that interpretation\" (Kempson 1990 p.17).",
        "Focusing/ centering theories (Grosz; Sidner; Brennan, Friedman and Pollard et al.)",
        "can be considered as having this perspective.",
        "They try to keep track of the focus of attention along the text and bind pronouns preferentially to focused entities.",
        "The choice of antecedents is based on pragmatic constraints, which put an ordering on preferences between antecedent candidates.",
        "Cormack proposes the integration of focusing and DRT, \"(...) adding semantic constraints to a model of attention in discourse\" (Cormack, 1992 p.5).",
        "This integration compensates for two shortcomings of DRT: it considers too many possibilities for anaphoric binding and doesn't provide an ordering between antecedent candidates.",
        "From the focusing point of view, the addition of semantic constraints, provided by DRT, to the pragmatic ordering further restricts the determination of possible antecedents.",
        "We analyzed Cormack's proposal, and found out that it was lacking some features that we consider more adequate, as it will be shown in the next few sections.",
        "Therefore we adapted it, and applied the modified version to the processing of texts written in Portuguese.",
        "The scope of those methods was widened to cover sentences containing restrictive relative clauses and subject ellipsis.",
        "Tests were conceived and applied to probe the adequacy of proposed modifications when dealing with processing of current texts."

        "This means that it is no longer included in the referents of the DRS representing the text after processing of the second sentence, becoming unavailable as antecedent candidate for pronouns in following sentences.",
        "This claim may seem a little strange if we look at (lc) as an acceptable third sentence: (lc) lie didn't like their color.",
        "Two other aspects of Cormack's representation led us to prefer to keep to the original DRT formalism.",
        "First, Cormack's representation is too conditioned by pronominal anaphora resolution.",

        "Eliminating them from the representation would be a limit to the possibilities of expanding the system in the future.",
        "Second, \"forgetting\" conditions introduced by previous sentences leads to a situation where the DRS representing the text at a given moment will contain little information about the text, and no information at all about some of the \"surviving\" referents.",
