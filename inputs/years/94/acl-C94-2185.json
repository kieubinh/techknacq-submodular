        "Although there have been studies of reference resolution for various noun phrases in Japanese (Shibata et al.",

        "In this paperi, we determine the referents of dousha and their locations by hand, and then propose one simple and two heuristic methods which use semantic information in text such ;is company names and their patterns, so as to test these three methods on how accurately they find the correct referents.",
        "Dousha is found with several particles such as \"ha\", \"ga\", \"no\", and \"to\" in newspaper articles.",

        "It is also based on SCM except the following points:",
        "• if there is a company name immediately followed by ha, ga, delta, or nigorulo somewhere before dousha, use the closest such company name as the referent.",

        "The third method is in fact a set of the second method, and both of them use semantic information (i.e. company ntune, human panne, title), syntactic patterns (i.e. where a company name, a human name, or a title appears in a sentence) and several specific lexical items which come immediately after the company names."

      "heading": "4 DISCUSSION",
      "text": [
        "The second and third heuristic methods show high accuracy in finding the referents of dousha with ga and ha.",
        "This means that partial semantic parsing (in which key semantic information such as company name, human name, and title is marked) is sufficient for reference resolution of important referential expressions such as dousha in Japanese.",
        "Moreover, since the two modified methods are simple, they will be easily implemented by computationally inexpensive finite-state pattern matchers (Hobbs ei al.",
        "1992; Cowie et al.",
        "1993).",
        "Therefore, they will be suitable for large scale text processing (Jacobs 1992; Chinchor el al.",
        "1993).",
        "One important point to realize is that the second and third methods, although they are simple to implement, achieve something that is rather complicated and may be computationally expensive otherwise.",
        "For example, in order to find the correct referent of a given dousha, you may have to skip one entire paragraph and find the referent two paragraphs before, or you may have to choose the right company name from several possible company names which appear before the given dousha.",
        "The modified methods do this correctly most of the time without worrying about constructing sometimes complicated syntactic structures of the sentences in the search window for the possible referent.",
        "Another important point is that the modified methods make good use of post-nominal particles, especially ha and ga. For example, if the referent is located two sentences or more before, then the referent (the company name) comes with ha almost all the time (35 out of 38 such cases for both dousha).",
        "It seems that if the referent of the dousha in consideration is more than a certain distance before, two sentences in this case, then the referent is marked with ha most of the time.",
        "Kitani also uses this ha or ga marked company names as key information in his reference resolution algorithm for dousha (Kitani 1994)."

        "The locations and contexts of the referents of dousha in Japanese Joint-Venture articles are determined by hand.",

        "The high success rates suggest that a semantic pattern-matching approach is not only a valid method but also an efficient method for reference resolution in the newspaper article domains.",
        "Since the Japanese language is highly case-inflected, case (particle) information is used effectively in these methods for reference resolution.",
        "-How much one can do with semantic pattern matching for reference resolution of similar expressions such as \"the company\" or \"the Japanese company\" in English newspaper articles is a topic for future research."
