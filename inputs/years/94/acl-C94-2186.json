        "Resolving reference or anaphora is of great interest in computational linguistics and formal semantics.",
        "Research on reference began with the development of models to account for nominal reference brought about by the usage of nominal expressions such as definite noun phrases and pronominals (Grosz, Joshi and Weinstein 1983; Kameyama 1986).",
        "Recently a number of researchers have indicated that temporal expressions such as tense morphemes and temporal adverbials can be regarded as referring expressions and have proposed models for temporal reference resolution (Hinrichs 1986; Hwang and Schubert 1992; Kameyama, Passonneau and Poesio 1993; Lascarides 1992; Partee 1984; Song and Cohen 1991; Webber 1988).",

        "The time of an eventuality described by a sentence is interpreted as temporally related to the times of other eventualities that were introduced into the context earlier in the dialogue.",
        "Temporal expressions are regarded as referring expressions since they convey information about the time of an eventuality, which is interpreted relative to the times of other eventualities in the context.",
        "Resolving temporal reference means determining what temporal relationships exist between an eventuality described by a sentence of a dialogue and eventualities that have been introduced into the context earlier in the dialogue.",
        "2 Resolving temporal reference is requisite to many tasks, such as designing a natural language interface to a planning system in which temporal information is crucial (Crouch and Pullman 'An eventuality is the general term for an event, process or state, due to Bach (1986).",
        "2 The chief concern here is temporal reference to intersen-tential context.",
        "Thus this paper does not address the problem of determining what temporal relationships an eventuality described by a clause of a sentence has with eventualities described by other clauses of the same sentence.",
        "This problem is covered by Brent (1990), Hwang et al., (1992), and Reichenbach (1947).",
        "1993).",
        "To understand the notion of temporal reference, consider the following dialogue, (dl).",
        "3 Assume that dialogue participants, Bill and John, mutually know that John received an email message from Mary.",
        "(s4) John: Sochira niwa tensoushi-ta-hazuda-yo.",

        "you GEN mail box in be-PAST.",
        "It was in your mail box, wasn't it?.",
        "Sentence (s2) describes an eventuality of deleting, Ed, and sentence (s4) describes an eventuality of forwarding, Ef .",
        "Both eventualities are past ones, since the matrix verbs, \"tensousuru (forward)\" and \"kesu (delete)\", 4 describe momentary acts and are accompanied with the past-tense morpheme \"ta\".",
        "Although the tense morphemes of sentences convey information about the times of eventualities described by the sentences, the context also imposes restrictions on the times of the eventualities.",
        "In dialogue (di), the time of Ef described by (s4) is interpreted as relative to the time of Ed in the context: i.e. the time of E./ is before the time of Ed.",
        "In this sense, the time of Ed is referred to in uttering sentence (s4).",
        "Existing models of temporal reference account for the parallel between temporal and nominal reference.",
        "However, as I will state in sec. 2, existing models fail to explain the interaction between temporal reference and nominal reference (reference interaction for short).",
        "Reference interaction is a phenomenon in which the process of resolving nominal reference in",
        "teracts with the process of resolving temporal reference, when an utterance involves temporal and nominal reference at the same time.",
        "Due to an insufficient account of the reference interaction, existing models cannot show how the process of resolving nominal reference affects the process of resolving temporal reference, The chief concern of this paper is to describe the role that the reference interaction plays in resolving temporal reference and demonstrate that the reference interaction serves to clarify how a restricted set of world knowledge contributes to the resolution process.",
        "I focus on sentences with past-tense morphemes in Japanese dialogues.",
        "Previous work also used past-tense sentences as a touchstone to show the validity of a model (Hinrichs 1986; Kameyama et al.",
        "1993; Lascarides 1992; Parted.",
        "1984; Webber 1988).",
        "As I will state in sec. 2.2, the reference interaction is not a domestic phenomenon in Japanese dialogues.",
        "In sec. 2, I argue that existing models do not account for the reference interaction, that the reference interaction plays an important role in an account of how temporal reference is resolved, and that exploiting the reference interaction clarifies how a restricted set of world knowledge serves to resolve temporal reference.",
        "In sec. 3, a framework is presented, within which the reference interaction is exploited in resolving temporal reference.",
        "In sec. 4, 1 demonstrate how the framework works.",

        "This paper has made a twofold contribution to research on temporal reference resolution.",
        "First, an account of the role played by the reference interaction in resolving temporal reference is given.",
        "As stated in sec. 2, existing models cannot account for how the process of resolving nominal reference affects the process of resolving temporal reference since they do not explain the reference interaction.",
        "Second, it is shown that exploiting the reference interaction clarifies how a restricted set of world knowledge (knowledge of the temporal relationships between eventualities and the existential status of individuals) contributes to the resolution process.",
        "As stated in sec. 2, existing models resort to the entire set of causality knowledge.",
        "I do not entirely deny the validity of the existing approach.",
        "However, when a restricted set of world knowledge is sufficient to resolve temporal reference, immediate recourse to the entire set of world knowledge of causality can be avoided.",
        "A framework is also presented, within which temporal reference is resolved by exploiting the reference interaction.",
        "Future work will first extend the framework to deal with eventualities specified by various tense morphemes, whereas this paper focuses on eventualities specified by the past-tense morpheme \"ta\".",
        "Next, to explore the notion of reference interaction in more detail, the way resolving temporal reference affects the resolution of nominal reference must be investigated, whereas this paper concentrates on the converse process.",
        "Finally, the coverage of this framework must be evaluated.",
        "Evaluation will require an exhaustive listing of possible cases of the existential status of individuals that are used to resolve reference.",
        "This paper accounts for cases where an individual exists at a certain space-time location of the physical world.",
        "We can allow for other kinds of existential status, such as a status where an individual exists in the mental state of a dialogue participant.",
