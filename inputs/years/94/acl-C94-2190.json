        "In this paper, we propose a dynamic theory of belief-sharing which deals with certain processes of forming and revising shared beliefs during cooperative dialogues.",
        "Since Clark & Marsha11(1981) the problem of determination of the referents of referring expressions has been discussed in relation to mutual knowledge.",
        "In natural language processing, there have also been several studies treating this problem of referent-determination in terms of mutual knowledge (Perrault & Cohen, 1981; Joshi, 1982; Nadathur Joshi, 1983; Appelt, 1985).",
        "In this paper, we conceive referent-determination as a process of belief-sharing in dialogues, and propose a formal theory of dialogue in which referent-determination can be characterized as part of belief-sharing processes.",
        "We use Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) to model the characteristics of referents in discourse (Kamp, 1981, 1990; Asher, 1993), and propose a model of dynamic maintenance of the mutual beliefs of the participants in dialogues based on Clause Maintenance System (CMS) (Doyle, 1979; Levesque, 1989; Poole, 1988; Reggia, 1983; de Kleer, 1986; Reiter & de Kleer, 1987).",
        "By this model, we characterize the relationships between a dialogue process and its successfulness, which is mainly illustrated by examples of referent-determination but can be applied to any type of belief-sharing."

        "However cooperative, real-world dialogues are fraught with hedges, understatements, or even white lies, which would necessitate introducing a distinction between what is literally conveyed by an utterance, and its real intent on the part of both speaker and hearer.",
        "In this study, however, we restrict ourselves to those cases without such complications, and assume that an utterance reflects the speaker's intent in a straight manner, and is taken as such by the hearer.",
        "The content of an utterance is represented in the following style:",
        "We call K discourse representation structure (DRS), {a, b, K's domain (UK), the elements of UK discourse referents, the boxed area below the unbroken line K's condition part (CK), and Cg's elements conditions.",
        "K is represented as (UK, CK).",
        "The broken line divides CK into the self-referential part SRP (above the line), and the dialogue database DB(K) (below the line).",
        "A condition is the result of an n(> 0) times application of Bel(a, .)",
        "to a first-order formula p. Bel(a, .)",
        "is called a belief operator, where a designates the utterer.",
        "Given (1) as a condition, Bel(a, 0) reads \"the participant a believes 0.\"",
        "n is called the rank of 0 with regard to its embedding within belief operators.",
        "Conditions of rank 0 are called bare formulas, while those with a rank greater than 0 belief formulas.",
        "K represents the shared beliefs formed through a dialogue between the two participants a and b.",
        "The conditions in SRP indicate a recursive embedding of self-referential belief sturucture with regard to common knowledge, and are assumed throughout the dialogue.",
        "By contrast, DB(K) is empty when a dialogue starts off.",
        "Thus, at the outset of a dialogue, the DRS K0 = ({a, b}, {Bel(a, K0), Bel(b, K0)1).",
        "As an utterance is made, new discourse entities may be introduced, making it necessary to add new conditions to DB(K) and sometimes to retract or negate part of the conditions in DB(K).",
        "With the progress of the dialogue, the DRS changes from K0 Kn.",
        "Since only cooperative dialogues are considered, the goal is to arrive at a DRS in which no contradictory beliefs are held by the participants.",
        "But this goal is not always achieved.",
        "We also assume that at certain points of a dialogue, the participants can hold contradictory beliefs, and that the same pariticipant",
        "can hold contradictory beliefs at different points of a dialogue, whereas the same participant cannot hold contradictory beliefs at any particular point.",

        "First, discourse referents are taken to be epistemological entities without counterparts in surface sentences, but introduced into the DRS by the participants of a dialogue, and of which properties corresponding to surface linguistic expressions are predicated.",
        "Thus, an utterance",
        "(2) a: Sato is a student is not analyzed as (3) student(Sato) but as (4) Sato(y), student(s)",
        "with the discourse referent a: introduced into UK by a, and the predicates corresponding to expressions in the utterance.",
        "Second, an utterance is registered not in the form of a bare formula, but in the form of a belief formula indicating the belief agent.",
        "(4), for example, is registered as",
        "(5) ./.1 el (a, Sato(y)), .8 el (a, stah:10.W) because at (2), b has not agreed with or opposed a's utterance.",

        "DB(K) can be derived from DB(K') without using this axiom, since K has the self-referential part SRP.",
        "But the converse does not hold.",
        "The axiom of shared belief allows the rank of shared beliefs to be zero, while the conditions in general are initially registered with a rank higher than zero.",
