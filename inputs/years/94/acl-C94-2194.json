        "'Die rise of spoken language NLIP applications has led to increased interest in such issues as real time processing and on-line error recovery.",
        "But dialogue is an inherently online process; this manifests in such linguistic phenomena as turntaking [Sacks et al., 1974], repair [Schegloff et a/., 1977], and content grounding [Clark and Schaefer, 1989].",
        "Grounding is the phenomenon that establishes shared beliefs, for which simply making or hearing an utterance does not suffice.",
        "It makes hearers into full participants who actively signal success or failure of communication, as in this exchange: Stepp: that's friday at seven then.",
        "Lynn: at seven.",
        "Our long term goal is to show how, from the perspective of a participant, one plans and acts in an environment with other communicating individuals, even when those other individuals are not perfectly reliable, and even when the groups involved may be large enough that it is impractical to model all participants.",
        "For example, consider this familiar exchange, [ruin the point of view of someone who remembers that the next group meeting is on tuesday: Jan : so we should drop the min cancel the meeting on thursday.",
        "Here both o in subject and another participant offer a correction, which is confirmed by Lou and by the original speaker.",
        "Other participants may be present.",
        "In this paper, we focus on the effects of communicative actions on the participant's model of the situation.",
        "In contrast with previous dialogue work, we are *The work underlying this paper was supported.",
        "by a research grant, FKZ I'FW 9002 0, from the German Bmicksministerium fiir Forschung mid Technologic to the DFKI project DISCO.",
        "interested in cases where there are more than three agents.",
        "In a group of ten or more, it is hard to imagine how a participant can track the beliefs and disbelief's of others accurately; it may not even be practical to track who they all are.",
        "The advantages of analysing natural language utterances as communicative actions are by now well understood; they serve to summarise conversations for long-term storage [Schupeta, 1993], as a basis for generation [Moore and Paris, 1989], in top-clown prediction of utterance function and structure [Alexandersson et al., 1994], and most importantly, to provide a representation of natural language utterances that is uniform with that used in general facilities for planning and action [Allen, 1983].",
        "We follow [Traum and llinkelman, 1992] in regarding speech acts as fully joint actions between conversational participants.",
        "Not only are joint speech acts cooperatively undertaken, but they have at least nominally joint effects: if they complete but still fail to result in shared goals or shared beliefs, this should be attributable to politeness, dishonesty (cf. [Perrault, 1.990]), or other social functions.",
        "This perspective on speech act processing forces us to deal with issues of jointly held goals and beliefs at a very basic level.",
        "These matters are by now quite well-studied, but, analytic solutions from logical first principles tend to be relatively complex, yielding neither perspicuous notations nor plausible computational or cognitive models.",
        "In short, normative analyses are not necessarily descriptive ones.",
        "Aside from relatively involved calculations, there are several sources of difficulty:",
        "• when multiple participants are involved, the number of 'belief spaces' (patterns of modal embedding) tends to blow up rapidly; • when the actual state of affairs regarding the extent of others' knowledge is unknown (as is the case for an online conversational participant) the number of cases to be considered can become large; • when dealing with large organisations, some form of aggregate modelling becomes an absolute necessity.",
        "Consider, for instance, the case in which you believe that the government knows your income from last year.",
        "What.",
        "you believe is not that each individual government employee knows it, but that anyone from the tax department, whose business it is to know, and who actually wants to, will.",

        "We want to abstract; away from the communi",
        "cation channels that make this possible while retaining the availability of the conclusion; and we would ideally like to do so in a manner consistent with the needs of online dialogue processing.",
        "In the next section we describe a method of representing the information necessary for processing multiparticipant speech acts, one which treats groups as agents in their own right, and does so in such a way that speech acts can operate on them naturally and directly."

        "The basis of our model is the corporate agent.",
        "These `agents' represent groups, but, like individual agents, they may have beliefs (which we write Bag„tp) and goals (Gagentp) ascribed to them directly.",
        "Thus, they can be thought of as intermediate in status between sets of component agents and prototypical group members.",
        "They differ from simple sets in three striking ways: first, they are intensional structures that may be distinct even when coextensive (as, for example, when the members of the marketing department form a volleyball team on tuesday nights); second, attitudes are ascribed to them directly, and potentially at variance with any attitudes we might ascribe to their members, or other subagents (see the discussion section); and third, that (other than perhaps in the case of a 'real', singleton agent) subsethood is not a sufficient condition for subagency – some intramural volleyball teams are clearly, as social entities, agents of the company, and others rather the reverse.",
        "While not in a position to make detailed psychological claims, we believe that structures of this kind are compatible with what we know about the linguistic and cognitive handling of aggregates in other contexts.",
        "These corporate agents will be used to represent both long-term social groups and transient groups of conversational participants.",
        "In the remainder of this paper we illustrate relationships between agents with diagrams such as that in figure 1.",
        "Here the playing-card shapes represent agents and the heavy lines connecting them the subagent relation (E): the agents include the system itself (sec.Jan), the system's boss (Jan), Jan's office, their coworker Les, their common corporate employer (WidgetCorp), and another 'random' person, Steph, who does not belong to WidgetCorp.",
        "Later we will represent attitudes ascribed to agents by small shapes within the playing cards and their propagation by thin curved arrows between them.",
        "Note that since we are discussing the system's own representation of the world, the double-bordered playing card really represents the system's self-model and the whole diagram the system; but we shall not belabour the point here, assuming that information passes freely between the two.",
        "The model we use to compute the transfer of attitudes between agents is approximate, partly to simplify computation and partly because it is in any case unusual to have enough empirical data to compute an exact solution.",
        "The same model (with parametric variation in the domain knowledge) is applied to all the attitudes the system ascribes to agents; in our present implementation, these may be either beliefs or goals.1 Unlike representations based on conventional logics of belief, it does not introduce nested contexts unless they are explicitly represented in the content of utterances (as would be the case with a sentence like \"But Lynn thinks we should have the meeting anyway.\" ), though extended reasoning processes may compatibly do so.",
        "In this simplified model, the propagation of attitudes is performed lazily, as determined by their semantic relevance to the various agents involved.",
        "Ideally, this judgment would derive from social world-knowledge and information about the purposes of groups; in our current implementation it is approximated using a simple classification of corporate agents, participant roles and message topics into the domain ontology.",
        "Delays and chance are not modelled; all relevant attitudes are presumed to propagate between agents, subject to the following constraints:",
        "1Since our model is not, analytic we do not want or need a notion of 'knowledge': the system lacks direct access to empirical truth and to social consensus, and does not have the cognitive sophistication to validate arguments against some independent notion of rationality.",
        "In short, none of the usual theories of truth can in principle be made to apply.",
        "1.",
        "Attitudes propagate only between superagent and subagent (or vice-versa).",
        "This stipulation amounts to saying that communication only occurs between agents in the presence of some common social context.",
        "Of course, new corporations can be introduced when new social groups form.",
        "Thus in figure 2, beliefs ascribed to WidgetCorp can propagate to the subagents, Jan and Jan's electronic secretary; but they do not reach Steph, who is not a subagent of WidgetCorp.2 We use the convention that attitudes are drawn filled in if they are known by direct evidence, hollow otherwise; and that dotted structures are 'negated'--they do not arise as drawn because they violate some constraint under discussion.",
        "2.",
        "Attitude propagation is only a default (the particular choice of default logic need not concern us here).",
        "If there is direct evidence for ascribing a contrary attitude to an agent, propagation from an external source is inhibited.",
        "This property is crucial to modelling dishonesty, negotiation, compromise, and atypical group members in general.",
        "Such blocking is illustrated in figure 3.",
        "In this case our model of Jan fails to inherit a goal from office.Jan because it conflicts with another goal (the square box) for the ascription of which to Jan we have prior independent evidence.",
        "3.",
        "The system may never assume that its own attitudes automatically propagate upwards to a superagent.",
        "The upward attitude propagation path models the effect of external agents independently attending to their various communicative goals, but the system must still plan – and execute – its own actions.",
        "Thus, in figure 4 the system– -sec.Jan – is prohibited from simply assuming that its own beliefs are shared by its employer, though those of fellow employees would be propagated when otherwise consistent.",
        "(Some humans seem to relax this constraint.)",
        "2 In order to place some limit on the promiscuity of attitude propagation, it seems best to insist that indirect transfer must occur through a single agent that is a transitive super or sub agent of both terminal agents.",
        "Thus, even if Jan and Steph both belonged to some peer of WidgetCorp with a similar semantic domain, propagation would still be not permitted along the resulting N-shaped path.",
        "Common membership in Everyone will not transmit beliefs either, because its relevance filter is maximally restrictive.",
        "4.",
        "Nonce corporations, introduced dynamically to represent the temporary grouping of participants in an active conversation, never inherit attitudes from their subagents, but must acquire them as the effects of observable actions.",
        "The idea here is that while participating in (or directly observing) a conversation, the system is in a position to observe the construction of the public record of that conversation [Lewis, 1983] directly, and this record consists exactly to the attitudes we wish to ascribe to the conversational group itself.",
        "In conversation even a new 'unspoken understanding' should be based on inference from observed communication, and not just the system's private beliefs about other participants' views.",
        "The fact that we still permit conversational groups to inherit from superagents allows us to place a discussion within a social context that supplies shared background assumptions.",
        "The fact that we permit their subagents to inherit from them models the actual adoption of information from the public record by individual participants, including the system itself, without additional mechanism.",
        "Figure 5 depicts this situation: noncel, the conversational grouping, represents a shared social construct distinct from our understanding of Jan's private views.",
        "This allows us to deal gracefully with time situation in which we, sec.Jan, catch (or perhaps even conspire with) Jan in telling a lie.",
        "The most important property of this model of attitude ascription is that the only belief spaces it introduces are those that are independently motivated",
        "by identified social groupings or the records of the actual conversations in winch the system participates.",
        "This reduces the chance that the system will become mired in irrelevant structural detail, and specifically avoids the 'spy novel' style of belief space nesting that is characteristic of classical normative models.",
        "Attribution by default inference allows an individual to be represented as a member of several different groups holding conflicting beliefs, and inheriting only those beliefs consistent with those represented as being held privately.",
        "The results are thus substantially different from those obtained in classical logics [Allen, 1983; Kraus and Lehmann, 1988; Appelt, 1985; Cohen and Levesque, 1990].",
        "They differ from other path-based algorithms [Ballim and Wilks, 1991] in the provision of semantic relevance conditions and in addressing the need for shared attitudes by ascribing them directly to groups, rather than by maintaining complex accounts of which agents believe what.",
        "Tins allows us to describe and process conversational mechanics without recourse to nested (x believes that y believes that... belief spaces, though such structures may remain necessary for other, less routine feats of cognition.",
