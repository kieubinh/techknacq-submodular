        "Consider a situation in which an agent A wants an agent B to accept a proposal P. If B is a 'helpful' agent (nonautonomous), B will accept A's proposal without a warrant.",
        "Alternatively, if B deliberates whether to accept P, but B knows of no competing options, then P will be the best option whether or not A tells B the warrant for P. Since a warrant makes the dialogue longer, the Explicit-Warrant strategy might be inefficient whenever either of these situations hold.",
        "Now consider a situation where B is an autonomous agent I Gathers, 19911.",
        "B always deliberates every proposal and B probably knows of options which compete with proposal P. Then B cannot decide whether to accept P without a warrant.",

        "These already-known warrants are a type of INFORMATIONALLY REDUNDANT UTTERANCE, henceforth IRU, which are surprisingly frequent in naturally-occurring dialogue I Walker, 19931.",
        "A Warrant IRU such as that in 2 suggests that B's cognitive limitations may be a factor in what A chooses to say, so that even if B knows a warrant for adopting A's proposal, what is critical is whether the warrant is salient for B, i.e. whether the warrant is already accessible in B's working memory [Prince, 1981; Baddeley, 1986].",
        "If the warrant is not already salient, then B must either infer or retrieve the warrant information or obtain it front an external source in order to evaluate A's proposal.",
        "Thus A's strategy choice may depend on A's model of B's additional state, as well as the costs of retrieval and inference as opposed to communication.",
        "In other words, A may decide that it is easier to just say the warrant rather than require B to infer or retrieve it.",
        "Finally, the task determines whether there are penalties for leaving a warrant implicit and relying on B to infer or retrieve it.",
        "Some tasks require that two agents agree on the reasons for adopting a proposal, e.g. in order to ensure robustness in situations of environmental change.",
        "Other tasks, such as a management/union negotiation, only require the agents to agree on the actions to he carried out and each agent can have its own reasons for wanting those actions to be done without affecting success in the task."

        "The use of the method and the focus of this work are novel: previous work has focused on determining underlying mechanisms for cooperative strategies rather than on investigating when a strategy is effective.",
        "lb my knowledge, no previous work on dialogue has ever argued that conversational agents' resource limits are a major factor in determining effective conversational strategies in collaboration.",
        "The results presented here suggest that cooperative strategies cannot he defined in the abstract, but cooperation arises from the interaction of two agents in dialogue.",
        "If one agent has limited working memory, then the other agent can make the dialogue go more smoothly by adopting a strategy that makes deliberative premises salient.",
        "In other words, strategies are cooperative for certain conversational partners, under particular task definitions, for particular communication situations.",
        "Here we compared two discourse strategies: All-Implicit and Explicit-Warrant.",
        "Explicit-Warrant is a type of discourse strategy called an Attention strategy in [Walker, 19931 because its main function is to manipulate agents' attentional state.",
        "Elsewhere we show",
        "that ( t) some IRU strategies are only beneficial when inferential complexity is higher than in the Standard 'Risk [Rainbow and Walker, 1994; Walker, 1994a1; (2) 1RUs that make inferences explicit can help inference limited agents perform as well as logically omniscient ones 1Walker, 19931.",
        "Although much work remains to be done, there is reason to believe that these results are domain independent.",
        "The simplicity of the Design-World task means that its structure is a subcomponent of many other tasks.",
        "The model of limited resources is cognitively based, but the cost parameters support modeling different agent architectures, and we explored the effects of different cost parameters.",
        "'Flue Explicit-Warrant strategy is based on simple relationships between different facts which we would expect to occur in any domain, i.e. the fact that some belief can be used as a WARRANT for accepting a proposal should occur in almost any task.",
        "Future work should extend these results, showing that a 'cooperative strategy' need not always he 'cooperative', and investigate additional factors that determine when strategies are effective."
