        "Collocations present specific problems in translation, both in human and automatic contexts.",
        "If we take the construction heavy smoker in English and attempt to translate it into French and German, we find that a literal translation of heavy yields the wrong result, since the concept expressed by the adjective (something like ' excessive ' ) is translated by grand (large) in French and stark (strong) in German.",
        "We observe then that in some sense the adjectives stark, grand and heavy are equivalent in the collocational context, but that this is of course not typically the case in other contexts, cf grande hoite, starke Schachtel and heavy box, where the adjectives could hardly be viewed as equivalent.",
        "It seems then that adjectives which are not literal translations of one another may share meaning properties specifically in the collocational context.",
        "How then can we specify this special equivalence in the machine translation dictionary?",
        "The answer seems to lie in addressing the concept which underlies the union of adjective and noun in these three cases, i.e., intensification, and hence establish a single meaning representation for the adjectives which can be viewed as an interlingual pivot for translation.",
        "Collocations have been studied by computational linguists in different contexts.",
        "For instance, there is a substantial body of papers on the extraction of \"frequently co-occurring words\" from corpora using statistical methods (e.g., (Choueka et al., 1983), (Church and Hanks, 1989), (Smadja, 1993) to list only a few).",
        "These authors focus on techniques for providing material that can be used in other processing tasks such as",
        "word sense disambiguation, information retrieval, natural language generation and so on.",
        "Also, the use of collocations in different applications has been discussed by various authors ((McRoy, 1992), (Pustejovsky et al., 1992), (Smadja and McKeown, 1990) etc.).",
        "However, collocations are not only considered useful, but also a problem both in certain applications (e.g. generation, (Nirenburg et al., 1988), machine translation, (Heid and Raab, 1989)) and from a more theoretical point of view (e.g. (Abeille and Schabes, 1989), (Krenn and Erbach, to appear)).",
        "We have been concerned with investigating the lexical functions (1.7s) of MeHuk (Mel' Ouk and Zolkovsky, 1984) as a candidate interlingual device for the translation of adjectival and verbal collocates.",

        "One way to emulate such a mapping might be through the use of Mel'euk's lexical paraphrasing rules.",
        "For instance, one could conceive of a lexical paraphrasing rule as follows': W 1 Mult(W) ri //Mult(W).",
        "If we assume that in our monolingual knglish lexicon, we assign the collocate bunch as the Mult value of keyword key, and that accordingly in the Dutch lexical entry ['or sleutel we instantiate sleutelbos as the value of the merged IV //Mull, then we call use the paraphrasing rule to effect a mapping between the two LP's and hence arrive at an interlingual approach to the translation of the example, despite structural mismatches, i.e., key + hunchlMult(key)] –> sleutelbosIllMult(s/ente/) Further examples exist where productive morphological processes (e.g., affixation\") lead to the lexicalisation in one language of concepts that exist as syntagmatic constructs in another.",
