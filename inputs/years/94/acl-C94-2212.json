        "A construction consists of a set of features of form and a description of meaning in a context.",
        "A grammar is a set of constructions.",
        "This kind of grammar is the key element of MINCAL, an implemented natural language speech-enabled interface to an on-line calendar system.",
        "The architecture has two key aspects: (a) the use of constructions, integrating descriptions of form, meaning and context into one whole; and (b) the separation of domain knowledge (about calendars) from application knowledge (about the particular on-line calendar).",
        "1 Introduction: an overview of the system We present an approach to natural language understanding based on a computable grammar of constructions.",
        "A construction consists of a set of features of form and a description of meaning in a context.",
        "A grammar is a set of constructions.",
        "This kind of grammar is the key element of MINCAL, an implemented natural language speech-enabled interface to art on-line calendar system.",
        "The system consists of a NL grammar, a parser, an on-line calendar, a domain knowledge base (about dates, times and meetings), an application knowledge base (about the calendar), a speech recognizer, a speech generator.",
        "In this paper we describe two key aspects of the system architecture: (a) the use of constructions, where instead of separating NI, processing into the phases of syntax, semantics and pragmatics, we integrate descriptions of form, meaning and context into one whole, and use a parser that takes into account all this information (see [101 for details); (b) the separation of the domain knowledge (about calendars) and the application knowledge (about the particular on-line calendar).",
        "*M. Szummer and S. Jarecki are also from MIT.",
        "The dialogs The system allows users to engage in dialogs like: - Schedule a meeting with Bob!",
        "At what time and date?",
        "- On August 80th.",
        "At what time?",
        "-- At 8.",
        "- Morning or afternoon?",
        "- In the evening.",
        "The parser recognizes Schedule a meeting with Bob as an instance of sent(imp), the imperative construction consisting of a verb and an NP, here np (event).",
        "The context is used to prevent another reading in which with Bob modifies schedule, as in Dance a tango with Bob!.",
        "That is, a contextual rule is used which says that for calendar applications, people do not modify actions or places.",
        "Context also plays art important role in understanding answers, e.g. At 8.",
        "This is understood as a time expression (and not place or rate or something else) only because of the context.",
        "The parameters of a meeting can he given in many ways, e.g. synonyms or different constructions can be used, users can include as many parameters in a sentence as they wish, and the parameters can be given in any order.",
        "As a result there are about 10,000 ways of scheduling meetings (with a given set of parameters).",
        "How are the dialogs understood With respect to parsing, grammars of constructions can be parsed like \"standard\" grammars, except that the set of features is richer.",
        "Given a string (representing a sentence, a fragment of a discourse or a paragraph), the parser assigns it a construction.",
        "From this viewpoint, the situation is similar to \"regular\" parsing, and the possible algorithms are similar.",
        "We have implemented a prototype chart parser for construction grammars, discussed further in Section 3.",
        "But, clearly, having understood the sentence as a linguistic entity in isolation is not the ultimate goal.",
        "Here the message of an utterance must be understood in the context of an intended action.",
        "This is done in two steps.",
        "First, the system determines the intended",
        "action and its parameters, using domain knowledge (meetings+time+places).",
        "Second, once all the parameters have been extracted from the dialog, the system executes the action.",
        "To do this, the program uses application-specific knowledge to translate the action and its parameters into a form that can be executed by the application (Xdiary)."

        "A construction is given by the matrix:",
        "The vehicle V consists of formulas describing presence (or perhaps absence) of certain taxemes, or features of form, within the structure of the construction.",
        "Such a structure is given by a list of subconstructions and the way they have been put together (in all our examples this is concatenation, but there are other possibilities, e.g. wrapping).",
        "The context, C , consists of a set of semantic and pragmatic constraints limiting the application of the construction.",
        "It can be viewed as a set of preconditions that must be satisfied in order for a construction to be used in parsing.",
        "The message, M , describes the meaning of the construction, via a set of syntactic, semantic and pragmatic constraints.",
        "To make this concrete, let us consider a few examples.",
        "We begin with a simple \"command con-struction\" consisting of an action verb followed by its argument.",
        "The context of the construction describes all situations in which the the hearer hr (human or machine) is paying attention to the speaker sr (a \"ready\" state).",
        "The feature struc is a list of variables and/or words/tokens; it is used to describe the structure of a construction, and its role is similar to a rule in a generative grammar.",
        "(We will write names of variables in capital letters, e.g. NP, inside matrices of constructions).",
        "The attribute cons_n gives the name of a construction that could be assigned to a string.",
        "We use it here to say that the form of the construction can be described as a concatenation of two strings, of which one is a verb (construction) and the other an rip (construction).",
        "Furthermore, the verb type < V M v_type > is \"action_verb\", (The expression < V M v_type > should be read \"the v_type of the message of V\").",
        "The message M describes the meaning of the construction as that of a command in which the type of action is described by the meaning of the verb, and the object of the action is given by the meaning of the 11011I1 phrase.",
        "The attribute sem_type stands for the \"semantic type\" and we identify it currently with the word sense.",
        "Thus \"erase the file\" is understood as a command to delete the file, if < erase M sem_type >= delete, but \"erase the picture\" might refer to the type of action associated with rub_out.",
        "In both cases the hearer hr is supposed to be the agent of the action.",
        "Constructions: from words to discourse Words, phrases, and fragments of discourse can be analyzed as constructions.",
        "We view languages as collections of constructions which range from words to discourse.",
        "We claim that the same representation scheme can be used for all constructions.",
        "The examples we are going to present have been developed with a specific purpose in mind, namely for scheduling calendar events.",
        "In other papers ([10] and [6]), we have presented examples showing that we can give a good descriptions of non-standard constructions.",
        "However, in either case descriptions of meanings and contexts are general, and hence applicable to other tasks.",
        "We now turn our attention to words.",
        "The verb \"cancel\" can be represented as follows: N : verb(cancel)",
        "Notice that even simple words require context to be (properly) interpreted.",
        "In C we say that English text is expected (but in other cases it could also be French text, or French speech, etc.).",
        "Some aspects of context do not have to be explicitly specified and can be replaced by defaults.",
        "Although the vehicle and the message are both very simple in this example, the simplicity of the message is a result of deliberate simplification.",
        "We have restricted it to the specification of the semantic type, identified with one sense of the word, and to describing the verb type of \"cancel\" as a verb of action.",
        "Notice that the other sense of \"cancel\" \"offset, balance out\" -- would appear in another entry.",
        "Of course, in reality, the lexical meaning of arty word is a much more complicated matter [1].",
        "For instance, in our lexicon the messages of words may contain many of the attributes that appear in the",
        "explanatory combinatorial dictionary of Melcuk [7].",
        "Discourse constructions: To illustrate discourse constructions, we consider the following dialog: Have you arranged the MOM yet?",
        "No, but I'll do it right away.",
        "We view the pattern of the answer no.but.S as a discourse construction.",
        "It can represented by the following array of features: As we can see, the construction applies only in the context of a previously asked question, and its message says that the answer to the question is negative, after which it elaborates the answer with a sentence S."

        "tit covers the basic forms of assertive sentences, but it emphasizes commands.",
        "Thus a command can, for example, be given either by v.np (also with \"please\", or \"kindly\"), or by an assertive sentence recognized as an indirect speech act (\"I'd like to ...\", \"Leora wants you to ...'', etc.).",
        "The next large group of constructions covers PPs, with particular emphasis on time and places.",
        "Finally, it covers a few discourse constructions, since it is important to deal with sentence fragments in dialogs, e.g. understanding \"evening\" as \"in the evening\", when it is an answer to the question \"when?\".",

        "be dealt with in a similar fashion, and we plan to extend the interface to deal with them.",
        "At this point the application knowledge base is very simple.",
        "It consists of rules that say how to interpret the data given by the semantic interpreter, for instance the rules for formatting parameters and renaming slots (e.g. event_duration - duration).",
        "Such rules are necessary, if the distinction between application and domain knowledge is to be maintained.",
        "The domain knowledge base: This has two kinds of facts: (I) background ontology, i.e., is, basic facts about time and places, and (2) linguistic knowledge associated with the domain.",

        "'[he latter includes facts about how the language is used.",

        "At this point, however, this formal model has only been iinplemented very crudely.",
        "Still the model is worth briefly discussing, because the conceptual distinctions made guide our work and have important practical consequences.",
        "The most important thing about it is that we discard the model of background knowledge as a logical theory, and replace it by a model consisting of collection of theories and mechanisms for putting them together depending on circumstances.",
        "Thus, the usual, two-part logical structures, consisting of a metalevel and an object level , are augmented by a third level a referential level.",
        "The referential level is a partially ordered collection of theories; it encodes background knowledge in a way resembling a dictionary or an encyclopecha.2 Parser, construction grammar and linguistic knowledge Parser: The parser does riot produce (syntactic) structural descriptions of sentences.",
        "Instead, it computes meaning representations.",
        "For example, it converts adjuncts directly into attributes of place, time, participant etc., once they can be computed, arid thus the message of the sentence does not contain any information about how these attributes where expressed or about; the attachment of PPs that appear in it.",
        "For example, the sentence I want you to arrange a conference in my office at 5 is analyzed as sent(assert, svoc), an assertive sentence consisting of a subject, a verb, an object and a complement.",
        "2 As usual, current situations are described on the object level, and the metalevel is a place for rules that can eliminate some of the models permitted by the object level and the referential level.",
        "The latter and the message of the imperative that is passed to sent(assert, svoc) does not contain any structural information about the attachment of the PPs.",
        "This message is combined with the messages of the verb and the noun, yielding",
        "This result of parsing is then interpreted by the domain interpreter to produce:",
        "Application-specific defaults then produce yet another interpretation where, in addition to filling the slots of Xdiary, [ hour [ 5 am_or_pm] ] is interpreted as [ hour [ 17 ]1.",
        "The parser is a chart parser, working left to right, with no lookahead.",
        "The grammar is L-attributed, i.e., has has both synthesized and inherited attributes, but each inherited attribute depends only on inherited attributes of the parent or attributes of the sisters to the left.",

        "The most important difference has to do with the presence of the context field in our version of the construction grammar.",
        "This allows us to account for the importance of pragmatics in representing many constructions, and to deal with discourse constructions.",
        "Secondly, while Jurafsky acknowledges the need for abstract constructions (pp.43-51), his abstract constructions (weak constructions) are not first class citizens they are defined only extensionally, by specifying the set of constructions they abstract over, and their abstract meaning (e.g. entity for NOUN).",
