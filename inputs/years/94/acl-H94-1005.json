        "The Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) is currently involved in a major effort to expand its multilingual text resources, in particular for machine translation, message understanding and information retrieval research.",

        "This paper describes some of the research that is being done to identify potential resources, discusses some of the process involved in negotiating the broadest possible access to the material for the human language technology research community, and identifies key issues and considerations in transducing the text into common and well documented formats."

        "The LDC has acquired a five-year electronic text archive of English, French and Spanish documents of public record from the United Nations.",
        "The documents include the proceedings, resolutions and reports of the General Assembly, the Security Council, UNICEF, the Economic and Social Council, and numerous othe committees, commisions and councils within the UN.",
        "The UN has also agreed to provide its Russian, Arabic and Chinese archives for the same period.",
        "Russian and Arabic text have been received from the United Nations in Geneva; the LDC has yet to receive Russian and Arabic from the UN in New York, and no Chinese has been delivered to date.",
        "About 60% of the 2.5 gigabytes of English, French and Spanish data that was delivered to the LDC was identified as being parallel in all three languages; the remaining 40% is made up of material that exists in only one or two of the three languages.",
        "The LDC has not yet begun to determine the extent to which the Russian and Arabic archives are parallel with the material already received and processed.",
        "The UN texts were created and archived on Wang VS computer systems, using an obsolete Wang word processing program.",
        "The tapes delivered to the LDC were copied from 80 megabyte removable disk packs by means of Wang BACKUP.",
        "Each of the Wang programs used its own file formatting scheme, which had to be reverse-engineered at the LDC so that programs could be written to extract the actual text data from the tapes.",
        "The LDC's efforts to decipher the WP character encoding, format control codes and file structure were helped substantially by Dominique Petitpierre of ISSCO, as well as by the technical support at Wang Office Systems.",
        "The process of sorting the text files into parallel sets and assigning index numbers that identified each document in each of its translations consisted of the following steps.",
        "1) Complete document lists were compiled for each year, containing all entries from all languages for that year.",
        "2) Each list was sorted with respect to the UN \"job-number\" associated with every document in the list.",
        "The UN assigns job-numbers to documents in roughly chronological order.",
        "Each translation of a document is supposed to have a unique job-number, although this convention breaks down in a significant number of cases.",
        "It is generally the case that the various language versions receive their numbers in a fixed sequence, with English being first, French second and Spanish fourth.",
        "As a result, within a given year a 3-way",
        "parallel set for a given document should have job numbers of the form yy-<x> (English), yy-(<x+l) French, and yy-(x+3) Spanish.",
        "There were numerous files in the archives that had received no numbers; there were some cases where the numeric sequence had nothing to do with parallel relations across languages, and there were even some cases where very different files were assigned the same number.",
        "For this reason, we have derived only a 60% yield of parallel data from the archives at this point.",
        "3) Each list was passed through a procedure that assigned a sequence number to every English entry in the list; the sequence number started at 00001 for each year, and was simply incremented for each English file.",
        "A corresponding numeric field of 00001 was applied to every French and Spanish entry in the list.",
        "4) A specialized string-matching process was applied to each list to pull out the clear cases of parallel entries: for each English entry in the list, its sequence number was copied into the corresponding field of a subsequent French or Spanish entry if such an entry was found to be parallel to the English.",
        "Parallel entries were moved to a list of \"matches,\" English entries for which no parallels were found, and other entries that did not match an adjacent English entry, were moved to a residual list.",
        "5) Each residual list was passed through an interactive process in which a user inspected likely candidates for parallel sets that had failed the previous string-matching method.",
        "The user had the option of inspecting the actual contents of the text files listed in the candidate sets.",
        "If, after inspecting the list entries (and possibly the files themselves), the user determined that two or three of the candidate entries constituted a parallel set, these entries were selected for addition to the lists of matches.",
        "The remainder was again left in a residual file.",
        "6) The lists of matches were used to drive a process that copied each parallel file into its appropriate place in the directory tree shown above, according to its language, year, and sequence number.",
        "Note that because some English documents did not have any parallels in French or Spanish, there are gaps in the sequence numbers within each year.",
        "In other words, only those English files having parallels have been included in this release.",
        "Additional parallels are likely to be found as the source data are examined more closely, and these will be distributed later to fill in some portions of gaps in the numeric sequence.",
        "To aid users of this corpus in finding the parallels for each English file in this release, a table has been provided for each year for each of the three language directories.",
        "The tables list every English file present in the release by its sequence number, and indicate whether the French or Spanish (or both) versions are also present for that file.",
        "For the years 1988-1993, 22,110 English documents, 20,350 French documents, and 14,773 Spanish documents are included.",
        "The English, French and Spanish texts were transliterated to the ISO 8859-1 (Latinl) character set, an 8-bit encoding system in which accented characters of European languages (and some specialized symbols) are provided in the upper half of the 256-character table.",
        "Common 7-bit ASCII, or ISO 646, occupies the lower half of the table.",
        "In addition, the various WP text formatting control codes (such as line-centering, underlining, indentation, tab-stop settings, etc.)",
        "were preserved in the form of Standard General Markup Language (SGML) tags.",
        "Considerable care was taken to ensure that the resulting text files are fully SGML compatible and parsable.",
        "Important assistance in this effort was received from David Mckelvie of the HCRC in Edinburgh, Scotlant, for providing a critique and verification of some extracted samples, and for creating a complete SGML Document Type Definition (DTD) and character set specification, which will be distributed with the data when it is published.",
        "It is not clear at present what solution will be adopted for character encloding in the other three languages.",
        "The LDC is currently looking for widely used methods for encoding Arabic, Russian and Chinese that also contain roman characters as a proper subset.",
        "If these are available, SGML markup on these three sets of files can probably be accomplished in a fairly normal way.",
        "If not, then we will have to look at ways for revising SGML for use in each context, or we will have to use a different method of markup.",
        "We welcome suggestions from users of this type of material as to ways of moving ahead with this.",
        "As a final task, the LDC returned two text archives to the United Nations, one to Geneva and one to New York, composed of the entire set of documents in three languages organized in a manner directly parallel to the organization of the original WANG archives, but converted to WordPerfect format.This was a service the LDC performed for the UN in exchange for their contribution of the archives for research purposes.",
        "The Geneva archive was converted from WANG WP to WordPerfect by Dominique Petitpierre at ISSCO in Geneva, using a utility program called Aladdin Transfer.",
        "The New York archive was converted to WordPerfect by running WordPerfect's Intellitag software against the files once they had been tagged with SGML.",
        "Once the processing of the last three languages is complete, the LDC intends to return to the United Nations to negotiate for access to other data resources.",
        "These include the archives from the UN Publications Department and UNESCO archives in Paris."

        "The ban was formulated in the Smith-Mundt Act that created the USIA in 1948, in a period of time when many congressional representatives and the public still remembered the power and influence of state run propoganda organizations built in countries like Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.",
        "Fearful of what might happen should an agency like the USIA be allowed to operate within the United States without restriction, Congress forbade distribution of any of its materials within the United States.",
        "A procedure was put into place, however, that allowed for the release of individual movies, videos, photographs or scripts; it requires that Congress pass an amendment authorizing the release of such materials.",
        "In the forty-four years since Smkith-Mundt was passed, thirty-two exceptions to the dissemination ban have been allowed.",
        "None of the previously passed exceptions is as all encompassing as the exception that the LDC is requesting, however.",
