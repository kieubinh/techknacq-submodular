        "Non-time-aligned word level transcription involves producing an orthographic representation of the utterance, including indications of extra-speech events such as breathes or lip smacks, without time markings.",
        "Time-aligned word level transcription provides the same orthographic transcription augmented with time alignment markings.",
        "Time-aligned phonetic transcription involves aligning phonetic symbols to the acoustic signal.",

        "In these experiments, CSLU staff and professional phoneticians are using Worldbet [5] to transcribe the same intervals of speech.",
