        "In this paper, we introduce the new paradigm used in the most recent ARPA-sponsored Continuous Speech Recognition (CSR) evaluation and then discuss the important features of the test design.",
        "The 1993 CSR evaluation was organized in a novel fashion in an attempt to accomodate research over a broad variety of important problems in CSR while maintaining a clear program-wide research focus.",
        "Furthermore, each test component in the evaluation was designed as an experiment to extract as much information as possible from the results.",
        "The evaluation was centered around a large vocabulary speaker-independent (SI) baseline test, which was required of every participating site.",
        "This test was dubbed the 'Hub' since it was common to all sites and formed the basis for controlled inter-system comparisons.",
        "The Hub test was augmented with a variety of problem-specific optional tests designed to explore a variety of important problems in CSR, mostly involving some kind of mismatch between the training and test conditions.",
        "These tests were known as the 'Spokes' since they all could be informatively compared to the Hub, but were otherwise independent.",
        "In the first trial of this evaluation paradigm in November, 1993, 11 research groups participated, yielding a rich array of comparative and contrastive results, all calibrated to the current state of the art in large vocabulary CSR."

        "Since 1986, ARPA has sponsored periodic formal evaluations of CSR technology.",
        "From the beginning, these evaluations were distinguished by a well-defined test that was required of all participants within a specified window of time.",
        "Most importantly, the test definition remained stable over several years so that sustained effort could be made toward improved performance and so that any improvement made over time could be demonstrated convincingly.",
        "These were important features of a series of evaluations based on the well-known Resource Management (RM) corpus.",
        "Those evaluations were highly regarded for the competitive stimulus they produced, resulting in the rapid assimilation of new techniques across the CSR community worldwide.",
        "When the ARPA CSR community began designing a testbed corpus for large-vocabulary recognition to replace RM, one of the shortcomings addressed was its lack of support for the variety of important research interests that existed within the community at the time.",
        "Active research was already underway in adaptation to speaker, domain, dialect, and in compensation for mismatch in microphone, environment, and spealcing style, but none of this was supported by the RM corpus.",
        "The ARPA-chartered CSR Corpus Coordinating Committee (CCCC) was given the task of defining a corpus and specifying an evaluation scheme that would take advantage of this diversity and drive it to produce enabling technology for eventual application to real-world CSR problems.",
        "The Hub and Spoke evaluation paradigm was conceived to accomodate the research requirements of this diverse community and produce convincing demonstrations of technological capability.",
        "Tests were defined, to exercise the primary interests of all participants, and to include important comparisons needed to make informed descisions about the efficacy of a particular algorithm or general approach.",
        "At the same time, the evaluation preserved the important controlled baseline test, characteristic of past ARPA-sponsored evaluations, that permitted direct comparison of CSR technology across different systems.",
        "In the next section, we describe the general design of the Hub and Spoke evaluation paradigm.",
        "Each component test in the 1993 evaluation is then described in detail in section 3."

        "The Spoke tests, on the other hand, are abstractions of problems of somewhat less central importance in CSR and evaluation on them is optional.",

        "They are specifically designed to permit intra-system comparisons of algorithms and methods for problems that often involve a mismatch between training and test data.",
        "The Spoke tests can all be informatively compared to the Hub test but they are otherwise independent.",

        "As in Spoke S6, use of the stereo microphone-adaptation data was permitted to adapt to the channel.",
        "The primary test demonstrated a noise compensation algorithm and the required S8-C1 contrast ran the same system with the compensation disabled.",
        "A second required test, S8-C2, ran the 58-PO system (compensation enabled) on the stereo Sennheiser data to calibrate the compensation algorithm on the matched channel with most of the noise suppressed.",
        "An additional optional test, S8-C3, ran on the Sennheiser data again but with the SS-CI system (compensation disabled) to set the baseline.",
        "All data was run for each noise source and SNR, but separate error rates are reported for each of six noise-level combinations.",
        "The data sets were calibrated by adjusting the noise source levels with the subject in place until a sample set of utterances produced the specified SNR levels as measured by software supplied by NIST.",
        "But due to the variability of the sources themselves and the observed tendency of the subjects to drift in the level of their response over the session, the SNR levels measured on the test data differ considerably in places from the target SNR."

        "In the first trial of the Hub and Spoke evaluation paradigm in November, 1993, 11 research sites participated, including 5 sites outside the ARPA community.",
        "The result was a rich array of comparative and contrastive results on several important problems in large vocabulary CSR, all calibrated to the current state-of-the-art performance levels.",
        "A complete listing of the numerical results can be found in [2].",
        "For interpretive results, the interested reader should consult the comtemporary papers of the participating sites.",
        "Two cautions are in order when attempting to interpret these results.",
        "First, since the acoustic training and development test data were distributed quite late, and since the Hub and Spoke paradigm was under development up to two months prior to the evaluation, a considerable burden was imposed on the participants who were rushed through the data processing and system training steps and were often denied a complete understanding of the rules.",
        "Some anomalies in the results did occur due to these undesirable circumstances.",
        "Secondly, it's important to remember that the only tests for which fair and informative direct comparisons can be made across systems (and sites) are the controlled Cl contrasts for either of the two Hub tests.",
        "All other tests are designed to produce informative comparisons only within a given system run in two contrastive modes.",
        "So in general, only intra-system comparisons should be made on the Spoke tests.",
        "The Hub and Spoke evaluation paradigm appears to have met the competing requirements of supporting the variety of important research interests within the ARPA CSR community while providing a mechanism to focus that work into well-defined and competitively charged evaluations of enabling technology.",
        "It is a flexible framework that encourages work in diverse problems in CSR.",
        "It is also a very structured framework that treats all tests conducted in an evaluation as if they were scientific experiments, specifying controls where appropriate to maximize the amount of information contained in the results.",
        "This structure also helps keep the effort of the participating research community focused around a productive core of problems.",
        "If the Hub and Spoke paradigm is to be truly successful, however, it will need to sustain that focus over time in a manner analogous to the very successful Resource Management based evaluations of the late 1980's."
