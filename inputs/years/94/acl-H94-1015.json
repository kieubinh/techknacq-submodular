        "At present, word N-gram models [1], especially bigram (N = 2) or trigram (N = 3) models, are recognized as effective and are widely used as language models for speech recognition.",
        "Such models, however, represent only local constraints within a few successive words and lack the ability to capture global or long distance dependencies between words.",
        "They might represent global constraints if N were set at a larger value, but it is not only computationally impractical but also inefficient because dependencies between non-contiguous words are often independent of the contents and length of the word string between them.",
        "In addition, estimating so many parameters from a finite number of text corpora would result in sparseness of data.",
        "Recently some papers treat long distance factors.",
        "In the long distance bigrams by Huang et al.",
        "[2] a linear combination of distanced bigrams is used.",
        "All the preceding words in a window of fixed length are considered, and bigram probabilities are estimated for each distance d between words respectively.",
        "The extended bigram model by Wright et al.",
        "[3] uses a single word selected for each word according to a statistical measure as its \"parent.\" The extended bigrams are insensitive to the distance between the word and its parent, but this model does not utilize multiple information.",
        "The trigger pairs described in [4, 5] also represent relationships between non-contiguous words.",
        "They are also extracted automatically and insensitive to the distance.",
        "The way of combining the evidence from trigger pairs with local constraints (\"the static model\" in their term) is also given.",
        "But this approach has the disadvantage that it is computationally expensive.",
        "Another approach is a tree-based model [6], which automatically generates a binary decision tree from training data.",
        "Although it could also extract similar dependencies by setting binary questions appropriately, it has the same disadvantage as the trigger-based model.",
        "We therefore proposed a new language model based on function word N-grams and content word N-grams [7].",
        "Global constraints are captured effectively without significantly increasing computational cost nor number of parameters by utilizing simple linguistic tags.",
        "Function word N-grams are mainly intended for syntactic constraints, while content word N-grams are for semantic ones.",
        "We already showed their effectiveness for Japanese speech recognition by applying them to sentence candidate selection from phrase lattices obtained by a phrase speech recognizer.",
        "We also gave a method to combine these global constraints with local constraints similar to conventional bigrams, and demonstrated that it improves performance.",
        "In this paper, we extend and modify this model so that it can be incorporated directly into the search process in continuous speech recognition based on the time-synchronous Viterbi decoding algorithm.",
        "The new model uses the conventional word N-grams for local constraints with N being a small value, and uses function and content word N-grams as global constraints, where N can again be small.",
        "These constraints are treated statistically in a unified manner.",
        "A similar approach is found in [8], where, to compute a word probability, the headwords of the two phrases immediately preceding the word are used as well as the last two words.",
        "Our model is different from this method in that the former also takes function words into consideration, and treats function words and content words separately in computing the probability to extract more effective syntactic and semantic information, respectively.",
        "In the following sections, we first explain the proposed language model, where we also show that the number of parameters can be reduced by assuming an independence between local and global constraints.",
        "Then we describe how it is incorporated into the time-synchronous Viterbi decoding algorithm.",
        "Finally, results of speaker-dependent sentence recognition experiments are presented, where our model is compared with the word bigram and trigram models in the viewpoints of number of parameters, perplexity, and recognition rate."
