        "We attemped to improve recognition accuracy by reducing the inadequacies of the lexicon and language model.",
        "Specifically we address the following three problems: (1) the best size for the lexicon, (2) conditioning written text for spoken language recognition, and (3) using additional training outside the text distribution.",
        "We found that increasing the lexicon 20,000 words to 40,000 words reduced the percentage of words outside the vocabulary from over 2% to just 0.2%, thereby decreasing the error rate substantially.",
        "The error rate on words already in the vocabulary did not increase substantially.",
        "We modified the language model training text by applying rules to simulate the differences between the training text and what people actually said.",
        "Finally, we found that using another three years' of training text - even without the appropriate preprocessing, substantially improved the language model.",
        "We also tested these approaches on spontaneous news dictation and found similar improvements."

        "Speech recognition accuracy is affected as much by the language model as by the acoustic model.",
        "In general, the word error rate is roughly proportional to the square root of the perplexity of the language model.",
        "In addition, in a natural unlimited vocabulary task, a substantial portion of the word errors come from words that are not even in the recognition vocabulary.",
        "These out-of-vocabulary (00V) words have no chance of being recognized correctly.",
        "Thus, our goal is to estimate a good language model from the available training text, and to determine a vocabulary that is likely to cover the test vocabulary.",
        "The straightforward solution to improving the language model might be to increase the complexity of the model (e.g., use a higher order Markov chain) and/or obtain more language model training text.",
        "But this by itself will not necessarily provide a better model, especially if the text is not an ideal model of what people will actually say.",
        "The simple solution to increase the coverage of the vocabulary is to increase the vocabulary size.",
        "But this also increases the word error rate and the computation and size of the recognition process.",
        "In this paper we consider several simple techniques for improving the power of the language model.",
        "First, in Section 3, we explore the effect of increasing the vocabulary size on recognition accuracy in an unlimited vocabulary task.",
        "Second, in Section 4, we consider ways to model the differences between the language model training text and the way people actually speak.",
        "And third, in Section 5, we show that simply increasing the amount of language model training helps significantly."

        "The November 1993 ARPA Continuous Speech Recognition (CSR) evaluations was based on speech and language taken from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ).",
        "The standard language model training text was estimated from about 35 million words of text extracted from the WSJ from 1987 to 1989.",
        "The text was normalized (preprocessed) with a model for what words people use to read open text.",
        "For example, \"$234.56\" was always assumed to be read as \"two hundred thirty four dollars and fifty six cents\".",
        "\"March 13\" was always normalized as \"March thirteenth\" – not \"March the thirteenth\", nor \"March thirteen\".",
        "And so on.",
        "The original processed text contains about 160,000 unique words.",
        "However, many of these are due to misspellings.",
        "Therefore, the test corpus was limited to those sentences that consisted only of the most likely 64,000 words.",
        "While this vocabulary is still quite large, it has two beneficial effects.",
        "First, it greatly reduces the number of misspellings in the texts.",
        "Second, it allows implementations to use 2-byte data fields to represent the words rather than having to use 4 bytes.",
        "The \"standard\" recognition vocabulary was defined as the most likely 20,000 words in the corpus.",
        "Then, the standard language model was defined as a trigram language model estimated specifically for these 20K words.",
        "This standard model, provided by Lincoln Laboratory, was to be used for the controlled portion of the recognition tests.",
        "In addition, participants were encouraged to generate an improved language model by any means (other than examining the test data)."

      "text": [
        "We find that, typically, over 2% of the word occurrences in a development set are not included in the standard 20K-word vocabulary.",
        "Naturally, words that are not in the vocabulary cannot be recognized accurately.",
        "(At best, we might try to detect that there is one or more unknown words at this point in a sentence, and then attempt to recognize the phoneme sequence, and then guess a possible letter sequence for this phoneme sequence.",
        "Unfortunately, in English, even if we could recognize the phonemes perfectly, there are many valid ways to spell a particular phoneme sequence.)",
        "However, in addition to this word not being recognized, we often see that one or two words adjacent to this missing word are also misrecognized.",
        "This is because the recognition, in choosing a word in its vocabulary, also now has the wrong context for the following or preceding words.",
        "In general, we find that the word error rate increases by about 1.5 to 2 times the number of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.",
        "One simple way to decrease the percentage of OOV words is to increase the vocabulary size.",
        "But which words should be added?",
        "The obvious solution is to add words in order of their relative frequency within the full text corpus.",
        "There are several problems that might result from this:",
        "1.",
        "The vocabulary might have to be extremely large before the OOV rate is reduced significantly.",
        "2.",
        "If the word error rate for the vast majority of the words that are already in the smaller vocabulary increased by even a small amount, it might offset any gain obtained from reducing the OOV rate.",
        "3.",
        "The language model probabilities for these additional words would be quite low, which might prevent them from being recognized anyway.",
        "We did not have phonetic pronunciations for all of the 64K words.",
        "We sent a list of the (approximately 34K) words for which we had no pronunciations to Boston University.",
        "They found pronunciations for about half (18K) of the words in their (expanded Moby) dictionary.",
        "When we added these words to our WSJ dictionary, we had a total of 50K words that we could use for recognition.",
        "The following table shows the percentage of OOV words as a function of the vocabulary size.",
        "The measurement was done on the WSJ1 Hubl \"20K\" development test which has 2,464 unique words with the total count of 8,227 words.",
        "Due to the unavailability of phonetic pronunciations (mentioned above), the final vocabulary size would be the second column.",
        "We were somewhat surprised to see that the percentage of OOV words was reduced to only 0.17% when the lexicon included the most likely 40K words – especially given that many of the most likely words were not available because we did not have phonetic pronunciations for them.",
        "Thus,",
        "it was not necessary to increase the vocabulary above 40K words.",
        "The second worry was that increasing the vocabulary by too much might increase the word error rate due to the increased number of choices.",
        "For example, normally, if we double the vocabulary, we might expect an increase in word error rate of about 40%!",
        "So we performed an experiment in which we used the standard 20K language model for the 5K development data.",
        "We found, to our surprise, that the error rate increased only slightly, from 8.7% to 9.3%.",
        "Therefore, we felt confident that we could increase the vocabulary as needed.",
        "We considered possible explanations for the small increase in error due to a larger vocabulary.",
        "We realized that the answer was in the language model.",
        "In the first case, when we just increase the vocabulary, the new words also have the same probability in the language model as the old words.",
        "However, in this case, all the new words that were added had lower probabilities (at Least for the unigram model) than the existing words.",
        "Let us consider two possibilities that we would not falsely substitute a new word for an old one.",
        "If the new word were acoustically similar to one of the words in the test (and therefore similar to a word in the original vocabulary, then the word would be correctly recognized because the original word would always have a higher language model probability.",
        "If, on the other hand, the new word were acoustically very different from the word being spoken, then we might expect that our acoustic models would prevent the new word from being chosen over the old word.",
        "While the argument makes some sense, we did not expect the loss for increasing the vocabulary from 5K words to 20K words to be so small.",
        "Finally, the third question is whether the new words would be recognized when they did occur, since (as mentioned above) their language model probabilities were generally low.",
        "In fact, we found that, even though the error rate for these new words was higher than for the more likely words, we were still able to recognize about 50% to 70% of them correctly, presumably based largely on the acoustic model.",
        "Thus, the net effect of this was to reduce the word error rate by about 1% to 1.5%, absolute."

        "However, in the WSJ1 corpus, subjects were instructed to read the original texts and to say whatever seemed most appropriate to them.",

        "This resulted in a mismatch between the language model and the actual word sequences that were spoken.",

        "It turns out that people didn't verbalize most punctuation.",
        "However, they regularly verbalized quotation marks in many different ways that were all different than the ways predicted by the standard preprocessor.",

        "We used two methods to model the ways people actually read text.",
        "The simpler approach was to include the text of the acoustic training data in the language model training.",
        "That is, we simply added the 37K sentence transcriptions from the acoustic training to the 2M sentences of training text.",
        "The advantage of this method is that it modeled what people actually said.",
        "The system was definitely more likely to recognize words or sequences that were previously impossible.",
        "The problem with this method was that the amount of transcribed speech was quite small (about 50 times smaller) compared to the original training text.",
        "We tried repeating the transcriptions several times, but we found that the effect was not as strong as we would like.",
        "A more powerful approach was to simulate the effects of the different word choices by simple rules which were applied to all of the 35M words of language training text.",
