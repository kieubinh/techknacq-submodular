        "The paper is based on Galliers and Sparck Jones (1993), which offers a comprehensive analysis of what is involved and needed in NLP evaluation, supplemented by an extensive review of methodologies that have already been proposed or applied, and also refers to evaluation experience in the neighbouring information retrieval (IR) field."

      "heading": "2. Background",
      "text": [
        "There is generally growing interest and activity in NLP system evaluation, stimulated partly by the fact that NLP technology is now solid enough to be of interest for real applications and partly by the (D)ARPA initiatives (cf Thompson, 1992; HLT1; MUC; S&NLW; TREC).",
        "But evaluation practice is still uneven, and sound methodologies need to be developed, both for laboratory experiments and working system investigations.",
        "There are many difficult matters to be considered in NLP evaluation, and some significant points seem not to be sufficiently recognised.",
        "Thus there are dangers in seeking to apply 'closed problem' approaches, exemplified by the use of 'word error rate', outside their legitimate bounds; in attaching prime importance to internal objects like parse trees; or in reifying important but ultimately arbitrary processing devices, for instance specific sets of case labels.",
        "The IR community's hard-won experience shows there are no easy ways of evaluating systems, no magic numbers encapsulating performance, no 'core' functions that can be pursued far in isolation, no fixed meaning-representation devices any system must have.",
        "Further, the lesson of IR is that discourse processing (in this case indexing) is only as good as the use made of it, which is necessarily on individual occasions, so it is only possible to infer, over many such occasions, what average performance will or can be designed to be.",
        "The motivation for a better evaluation methodology is thus more reliable inference, implying both a diligent attempt to lay out the premises but also, given the many factors involved in NLP systems and their resistance to precise specification, that the inferences drawn may still not be very reliable.",
        "The essential problem of NLP evaluation is that the evaluator has to advance between Scylla and Charybdis.",
        "Evaluation may be end-to-end for systems devoted to NLP, end-to-end for hybrid ones with both NLP and non-NLP subsystems, or non end-to-end, focused on some component of an NL processor; and there is a tradeoff, from the NLP evaluation point of view, between least problematic and also least analytic, and most analytic but also most problematic.",
        "End-to-end NLP system evaluation clearly demonstrates NLP function.",
        "Hybrid system evaluation is ambiguous in this respect.",
        "NL component evaluation is just this, at best within an artificial boundary but at worst imposing inappropriate standards.",
        "However with end-to-end NLP systems the situation of use becomes important, showing that in fact in all cases the context surrounding the NLP subject being evaluated matters.",
        "In the rest of this paper I shall consider the four clusters of concepts that need to be recognised and applied in evaluation, namely evaluation subjects and performance factors, kinds and levels of definition for performance assessment, sorts of test and evaluation data, and strategies for evaluation design and conduct.",
        "It is clear that there is no single correct way to evaluate an NLP system, and that very different evaluations are required in different circumstances, as I show in the subsequent illustration for two different cases involving the same NLP system.",
        "The important point is that evaluation has to be approached comprehensively and sys",
        "tematically, so the presumptions on which is based are laid bare.",
        "The methodology I outline, summarising Gal-hers and Sparck Jones (1993), is aimed at achieving this, leading to soundly-based tests that take account of the properties of both evaluation subjects and their contexts within a regular comparative framework.",
        "The principles involved in this are not novel; but they are not sufficiently applied in NLP evaluation, as noted in my concluding comments on the ARPA evaluations, and deserve reiteration."

        "In NLP the subject of assessment may be a language processing component, e.g. a syntax analyser; a language subsystem of a larger computational system, e.g. an interface to a fault diagnosis package; a complete computational system which may be wholly devoted to NLP, as in translation, or only partially an NLP system, as in the previous case; or a 'setup', i.e. a computational entity plus some body of people involved with it in some way.",
        "As this suggests, the onion metaphor applies, with the subject of the evaluation complemented by its envi-rpnment.",
        "It is convenient to refer to any of the kinds of evaluation subject mentioned in the abstract as a system: I shall therefore use computational system, or (c-system', specifically for the third case.",
        "In evaluation it is essential to take both system and environment into account as supplying the factors affecting performance.",
        "Thus attributing meaning to, or explaining, system performance depends on determining both system parameters and their potential settings, e.g. grammar or lexicon used, and environment variables and their values, e.g. text type or post-editor level of skill, in as thorough a way as possible.",
        "It is easy to pay too much attention to the system and not enough to its environment as influencing evaluation, so relevant environment variables are not taken into account.",
        "Characterisation of both variables and parameters is needed even when an evaluation is an investigation of some given system to establish its performance level, but even more so when experiments are conducted to compare system performance when parameter settings and/or environment variables are changed.",
        "Thus with an automatic summarising system as subject, for instance, different sets of semantic categories, or discourse relations, might be considered as parameter settings, and different document types, or lengths, as variable values.",
        "There can be very many performance factors that are hard to capture so alternatives can be compared and assessment of their influence made.",
        "Environment variables include both input and output ones, referring to the data for processing and the requirements on outputs imposed by their uses, e.g. for summaries that their intended users are able to read them quickly.",
        "With environment variables, it may be hard to determine the appropriate level of granularity, e.g. of length differences for input or output texts in summarising, or input genres or reader classes; and it may be hard to keep system parameters separate.",
        "The relation between a system and its environment thus has many implications for assessment practice, notably with respect to the view taken of system ends in evaluation, and in relation to the assessment of generic NLP systems.",
        "It is necessary to establish whether assessment of a system's functional performance refers to its ability to meet its internal design objectives or its external function requirements, e.g. for a translation c-system, either providing complete parses or delivering texts that don't confuse their readers.",
        "While the contrast between glass box and black box evaluation is commonplace, it is useful to interpret this in relation to the system-environment distinction and to a specific view of system function.",
        "With generic systems (such as SRI Cambridge's Core Language Engine), the issue is that establishing their merits by intrinsic evaluations is of limited value, so extensive extrinsic evaluation in a variety of environments is required.",
        "This also applies where a generic process, without any explicit generic data resources, is used, as in statistically-based text passage extraction."

        "Apart from the distinctions between kinds of evaluation just mentioned, it is helpful to categorise performance evaluation according to whether it is concerned with effectiveness, efficiency, or acceptability (to humans).",
        "Such distinctions help to guide an appropriate choice of performance criteria.",
        "For instance a text categorisation system might be evaluated for effectiveness by its accuracy in classing (say intrinsically against independently assigned categories for test material, or extrinsically with reference to output dumping by its recipients), or for acceptability in ordering and grouping presented material.",
        "It is clearly necessary both to contextualise a notion like effectiveness for a given evaluation, and to motivate performance criteria via their evaluative role.",
        "This implies further refinement, for instance of the human class for acceptability.",
        "However it is also essential, for sound evaluation, to recognise that as performance criteria are general, e.g. quality for translation output, a criterion requires further definition first by a particular performance measure, e.g. proportion of sentences edited, and second, for any measure, by a specific application method, e.g. for choosing actual texts.",
        "All three levels of characterisation are required for assessment, even for non-numerical approaches to evaluation.",
        "A given criterion can typically be given a range of specific interpretations, quantitative or qualitative, as individual performance measures: for instance translation quality by the proportion of sentences requiring post editing.",
        "Any measure in turn has to be operationalised, say for the precise way in which a random data sample is gathered, or how a measure is normalised.",
        "Individual choices of significance test would ordinarily be made at this level.",
        "Significance testing is required but is hard in NLP because normally only weak, non-parametric tests are applicable.",
        "They also only show the least required real difference: this has to be interpreted in practical terms in relation to operational system behaviour, and also needs to be supplemented by some view of what larger differences may actually be attainable.",
        "Again, IR experience has emphasised the relevance of all these layers, for example in their application to recall/precision figures.",
        "Thus while recall and precision may be used as criteria, thay can be more specifically defined in various ways, and also computed differently in averaging, with non-trivial consequences for what performance 'looks' like.",
        "Equally, statistical performance differences may difficult to translate into statements about getting noticeably more good documents in initial search output, while what level of performance is attainable in a given environment is usually unclear.",
        "In many cases there are either existing or natural comparative reference points for evaluation, which may be taken as defining baseline or benchmark performance.",
        "The former provides a rockbottom view of performance, e.g. as in word-for-word translation or simple word indexing, the latter the current best state of the art, e.g. sentence-by-sentence literal translation.",

        "1 The particular character of the evaluation data naturally follows from the goal and manner of the evaluation, as well as from the nature of the system and its environment.",
        "Thus while in some cases concrete answers may be available e.g. replies to database queries, in others this is not feasible: there are no correct outputs for a summarising system, only utility judgements.",
        "But it is useful to recognise, for NLP evaluation, some important properties of 'Training vs test data is a different contrast.",
        "test and evaluation data and major sorts of such data: it is all too easy to assume that any sufficiently large and miscellanous assemblage of material can be used simply because it is large and miscellanous.",
        "Thus it is necessary to consider requirements for data as realistic, representative, and legitimate.",
        "For an evaluation of a system for dealing with newspaper material, for instance, a set of newspaper stories is realistic, but it should also be a representative sample of the larger universe of stories with which the system may deal.",
        "Representative data should, further, be so in distribution, e.g. reflecting the relative frequency of newspaper topic domains in the larger universe.",
        "The need for legitimacy, even where data is already realistic and representative, seems superfluous but matters because evaluation data may be so expensive to acquire it is natural to seek to exploit it for other tests than those for which it was originally acquired, for example test paragraphs retrieved for specific queries regardless of other user constraints.",
        "The foregoing defines the most strongly constrained evaluation data.",
        "Other forms are proper and useful, but their limitations need to be accepted.",
        "Thus natural corpus test data may be selected for coverage of linguistic phenomena rather than to reflect statistical frequency; and artificially constructed bodies of test data or test suites, for example read speech material, may be provided without explicit accompanying answers (though these may be assumed as 'obvious', as in the speech case).",
        "However the most important distinction is between natural and artificial evaluation data, i.e. between test collections and checking collections.",
        "For example, in the IR case a test collection is properly only constituted from the relevance assessments made by the user submitting the query, while the agreed assessments of a set of librarians constitutes a checking collection.",
        "There are clear problems on the one hand where the same user cannot be `reused', for instance offered alternative explanations by different systems for the same original, uninformed question, and on the other where surrogate users offer their answers, especially normative ones.",
        "Different test and evaluation data sorts serve quite distinct functions and need to be correctly related to an evaluation's goal to avoid illegitimate inferences from the assessment results.",
        "Further, the task and situation complexity characterisic of many NLP applications, for instance translating repair instructions or summarising reports for 'non-reusable' users, implies large data sets."

        "The outcome of this combination of interdependent choices will be an individual evaluation which may differ substantially, for the same system, from others with different motivations.",
        "There is no one way to evaluate NLP c-systems, primarily because these are not autonomous entities: assuming that there is is a version of the naturalistic fallacy which supposes that NLP aspires towards human LP capabilities without allowing for the fact that humans have different capabilities that are differently deployed in different circumstances.",
        "The decompositional approach is naturally followed by answering a series of questions, gradually working into the fine detail of the evaluation in one or more cycles of specification, to emerge with the scenario for the whole evaluation.",

      "text": [
        "As noted, while there have been individual evaluations of interest, and attacks on methodology (cf Thompson, 1992), the (D)ARPA/NIST evaluation initiatives are major efforts in terms of their goals, scale, and hard labour.",
        "Relating these to my analysis and methodology their major feature is that they are laboratory experiments, and as such are naturally distanced from detailed operational influences, Moreover the desire for control, to be achieved not only by blind testing but more materially via highly elaborated and polished answer data, further emphasises their detachment.",
        "This is particularly noticeable in the MUC and SLS (ATIS) cases, where the assessment data is not realistic or representative in any strong, or at any rate demonstrated, sense.",
        "There is an assumption that the nature of the evaluation data reflects real needs, and that the relative scores obtained correctly predict relative operational utility.",
        "While SLS assessment via logfiles refers more to systems in use, current MUC evaluation concerns with 'internal' NLP products e.g. predicate-argument structures, reflect researchers' interests in fine-grained explanatory evaluation concentrating on system parameters, properly viewed heuristically, not absolutely.",
        "These are legitimate interests, but there is not enough of the necessary complementary concern, even for the laboratory approach, with environment variables and their interaction with parameters and impact on performance.",
        "TREC has the advantage of more realistic (and also more simply specified) evaluation, but there are still concerns here about legitimacy and generalisation; these instructively include what operationally relevant inferences can be drawn from test results even when these use such intuitively plausible and universal measures as recall and precision.",
        "One of the main requirements for future NLP evaluations is thus to approach these in a comprehensive as well as systematic way, so that the specific tests done are properly situated, especially in relation to the ends the evaluation subject is intended to serve, and the properties of the context in which it does this."
