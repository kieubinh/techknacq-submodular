        "The TextEval project aims to explore and develop a new approach to the automatic evaluation of computer-generated texts, based on the use of standard sets.We believe that fast, accurate and automatic evaluation methods are vital to the development of any large piece of natural language software, and note that current methods, which involve extensive intervention by human experts, are too costly to be a routine part of the development cycle.",
        "For pragmatic reasons we are working on translations, but in principle the techniques would apply to any body of suitably comparable texts, such as alternative versions of an instruction sheet.",
        "Our purpose in this presentation is to describe a framework for the automatic evaluation of translation quality.",
        "We will start by presenting the results of an evaluation experiment, then use the results of this to assess the usefulness of several alternative automatic metrics."

        "Although it is not clear precisely what translators' subjective judgements are based on when they report on the quality of translations, it is worthy of comment that such judgements can be elicited at all, since attempts to prescribe detailed guidelines for the scientific evaluation of translation quality have been problematic since the ALPAC report [1].",
        "It is arguable that any particular set of guidelines will inappropriately constrain the evaluator by imposing the theoretical preconceptions of the author of the guidelines.",
        "In the current project we are exploring the possibility of producing automatic evaluations without any prior commitment to a theory of translation.Our method of evaluation depends only on the essentially statistical hypothesis that good translations will tend to be more similar to each other than will bad ones.",
        "Prerequisites of this approach are the availability of a suitable corpus of translations and the choice of a similarity metric.",
        "In this paper the metrics which we describe will be (negative log) probabilities Strictly this makes them dissimilarity metrics.",
        "Once we have established a metric, we may apply two approaches to the generation of a rank ordering.",
        "In the first approach we find an appropriate method of combining the elements of a set of translations, then measure the distance of each individual translation from the composites formed by the respective remainders of the standard set.",
        "Under our hypothesis the better the translation is the lower will be its distance from the composite formed by the remaining data.In the second approach we start by generating a pairwise distance matrix, then use multidimensional scaling [3,4(p 498)] to reduce the data to one dimension.",
        "This produces not only a linear ordering over the items tested but also a measure of the extent to which this linear ordering captuures the relationships described by the distance matrix.",
        "We will introduce our framework by describing an experiment on the extraction of",
        "translation quality judgements from human beings, along with the analysis which demonstrates that these judgements do indeed reflect some objective reality about the translations.",
        "We will then carry out a very similar analysis of results obtained from automatic metrics."

        "The first experiment made use of translations which had previously been elicited by electronic mail for use in a pilot study [8].",

        "The original corpus consisted of 44 translations of the same piece (a report on the opportunities and dangers provided by Europe's peculiar position as a multilingual community).. For the experiment reported here we selected 10 translations spanning the quality range of the corpus as a whole.",

        "Our basic hypothesis allows, and indeed encourages this, because all that the scaling process knows is that this translation is very different from the others.",
        "In supplying only inter-translation distances we have effectively suppressed the information that this translation is better rather than worse than the generality of translations.",
