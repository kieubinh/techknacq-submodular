      "text": [
        "Since the summer of 1993, there has been considerable discussion in the ARPA HLT community of moving the evaluation of understanding systems for both spoken and written language away from application-based metrics (such as correct database response in ATIS, or template fills in MUC) toward technology-based metrics.",
        "The benefits hoped to be derived from such a shift include greater focus on underlying technology issues, rather than application issues, and lowering the overhead required to participate in evaluations in terms of developing application systems.",
        "The discussions have focused on the concept of a semantic evaluation, or \"SemEval\" consisting of three components: word-sense identification, predicate-argument structure determination, and coreference determination.",
        "This paper reports on how these ideas are being developed within the ARPA spoken-language community, in preparation for an initial spoken-language SemEval on ATIS data concurrent with the ATIS CAS (database answer) evaluation planned for November/December 1994.",
        "A meeting was held at SRI, 21-23 October 1993, to begin fleshing out these ideas for the evaluation of spoken-language understanding systems.",
        "The meeting was attended by researchers, annotators, and evaluators involved in both the ARPA Spoken Language Program and the ARPA Written Language Program: Fernando Pereira from AT&T Bell Laboratories; Rusty Bobrow and Dave Stallard from BBN; Wayne Ward and Sergei Nirenburg from CMU; Stephanie Seneff and Eric Brill from MIT; Robert Moore, Kate Hunicke-Smith, Jerry Hobbs, Harry Bratt, and Mark Gawron from SRI; Debbie Dahl and Lew Norton from Unisys; Mitch Marcus and Grace Kim from the University of Pennsylvania; Nancy Chin-chor from SAIC; George Doddington from ARPA; George Miller from Princeton University; Dave Pallett and Bruce Lund from NIST; and Ralph Grishman from NYU.",

      "heading": "2. WHY DO SEMEVAL?",
      "text": [
        "A question that has received, and continues to receive, extensive discussion is \"Why do we want to do SemEval at all?\"",
        "George Doddington [1] has addressed this from ARPA's perspective as follows: Why is SemEval a good idea?",
        "Well, first, ARPA's goal in the HLT Program is to make strategic advances in core human language technology.",
        "This goal is a technology goal (to produce useful functionality).",
        "It is not a science goal (to produce scientific understanding), nor is it an application goal (to produce useful applications embodying human language technology).",
        "So, why do SemEval instead of only doing task-level evaluations (such as ATIS CAS)?",
        "There are three reasons: 1.",
        "SemEval offers the possibility of providing a much more direct and objective evaluation of underlying technical issues.",
        "It thus promises greater diagnostic leverage which would yield more rapid and efficient development of core technology.",
        "2.",
        "SemEval, by measuring performance at a technical level rather than an application level, eliminates much overhead and research inefficiency by obviating the need to support application effort and other back-end issues.",
        "This makes research much more efficient by focusing a greater fraction of effort on research and technical issues of direct interest.",
        "It also makes it more attractive and much easier for a new player to enter the game.",
        "3.",
        "SemEval, by virtue of measuring performance below the application level, offers the opportunity to compare performance across different applications and to support formal evaluation among a much larger research community.",
        "Thus the potential benefit and evaluation support goes far beyond the relatively few ARPA HLT sites.",
        "The risk is that SemEval may end up measuring technical aspects of systems that are not directly relevant or do not represent the important issues in HLT.",
        "We need to try hard to avoid this.",
        "And we",
        "won't immediately abandon other task-level evaluations such as the ATIS CAS.",
        "But a successful SemEval has the potential to create a larger research challenge and to accelerate HLT progress very significantly.",
        "The potential payoff is high and we need to give SemEval the best shot we can."

      "heading": "3. METHODOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES",
      "text": [
        "Perhaps the main difficulty in defining SemEval is that there is no single generally accepted notation for representing the meaning of natural-language utterances.",
        "Instead, there are numerous notations and theories, from which we have to synthesize a notation that is compatible with as wide a variety of points of view as possible.",
        "Two methodological principles have been proposed to guide us in this task.",
        "The first is proposed as a strategy for helping us define annotations without bogging down in theoretical disputes: Take as our mantra \"It's just a notation, not a theory.\"",
        "That is, the overriding consideration should be whether a proposed notation is a convenient way of marking a distinction that we agree we should mark, and that whether it meets other, theory-driven conditions (e.g., supporting a truth-conditional semantics, assigning a type-theoretic interpretation to every subexpression, being compositional, assigning one predicate per morpheme) is beside the point.",
        "The second methodological principle is a default rule for deciding when to make distinctions.",
        "There are many cases where it is not immediately clear whether to mark a distinction or not.",
        "The proposed default is not to mark distinctions.",
        "That is, it should take some positive argument that if the distinction is not marked, two utterances that we agree should be assigned different structures will be assigned the same structure.",
        "(Often, the most compelling such arguments are truth-conditional.",
        "That is, we can describe a situation where one utterance is clearly true and the other is clearly false.)",
        "The reason for defaulting to not making distinctions is that systems that make more distinctions than necessary should be able to collapse them for purposes of translation to the canonical representation fairly easily, but a system that doesn't make a distinction at all will be severely penalized if it is scored incorrect for not making it.",
        "Hence, we need evidence that the system is wrong not to make the distinction.",
        "Note that marking distinctions does not mean that the notation will represent a superficial analysis of the utterance.",
        "Quite the contrary, it will often require giving a common representation to many expressions that are quite different syntactically and, hence, push toward deeper representations."

      "heading": "4.1. Syntax for Predicate-Argument",
      "text": [
        "Structure In discussions of a possible syntax for predicate-argument structure, it has been evident that there are considerable variations in preferences for the amount of syntactic sugar to be used.",
        "To accommodate these differences in preferences, three intertranslatable levels of notation have been proposed.",
        "The first is simply LISP-style nested functor-argument notation, with two notational additions.",
        "First, we use angle brackets <...> to indicate implicit conjunction, arising, for example, from iterated modifiers in the utterance.",
        "Second, we use numerical indices followed by a colon to label expressions that may fill more than one argument position in the predicate-argument structure.",
        "For example, if we make the assumption that tall, block, and blue, are one-place predicates and we ignore tense, Every blue block is tall might be represented: (decl (tall 1:(every <(block 1)(blue 1)>))) (The recursion implicit in the use of the index 1 will be explained in the discussion of quantification below.)",
        "A second level of representation is obtained by assigning every expression an index, and breaking the structure down into a list of atomic predications, interrelated by the indices:",
        "Finally, we may wish to break this notation down to an even more atomic level for the purpose of counting errors for scoring:"
      ]
    },
    {
      "heading": "4.2. Scope of Quantified Noun Phrases",
      "text": [
        "There has been general agreement that quantified noun phrases should be represented \"in place,\" without their exact scope being represented.",
        "To be more precise, for a generalized quantifier Q(X, Y) corresponding to a noun phrase determiner like some or every, since the restriction X is essentially the content of the noun phrase, that would be indicated in the notation, but the body Y, not being structurally determined by the syntax, would be left vague.",
        "This means we will give different representations to",
        "Every tall block is blue.",
        "and the complements are distinguished by the position they Every blue block is tall.",
        "fill in the argument list: since t he difference between these is structurally determined and unambiguous, but we will not give different representations to the two scopings of Some girl likes every boy.",
        "that is, There is some girl such that she likes every boy.",
        "- For every boy, there is some girl who likes him.",
        "since that distinction is not structurally determined (although structure has some influence), and it is often difficult to judge.",
        "An additional constraint that has been agreed on is that the notation should not have what has come to be called the \"linchpin problem\"; that is, the notation should not be such that, if one key piece is missed, the whole thing falls apart and credit is given for virtually nothing.",
        "In particular, it should be possible to miss which pieces belong inside or outside the restriction of the quantifier, and still get credit for recognizing all the predications of the \"quantified variable.\"",
        "The solution that has been developed is illustrated by the predicate-argument structure given above for the phrase every blue block: 1:(every <(block 1)(blue 1)>) The expression as a whole is given an index that is also used• in the argument positions inside the restriction of the quantifier that correspond to \"quantified variable\" positions.",
        "That way, the notation can clearly indicate which predications are part of the quantifier restriction, but every argument position that would be filled by the quantified variable in a standard logical representation is filled with the same index, whether the predication is inside or outside of the quantifier restriction.",
        "Quantified noun phrases are not the only constructs where the issue of scope arises.",
        "Others include modal verbs, negation, and propositional attitude verbs (e.g., want, know).",
        "It has generally been agreed that items whose scope is largely determined by linguistic structure would have their scope indicated in predicate-argument structure (usually by treating them as having propositions as arguments), and that items whose scope is not determined by linguistic structure (such as only), would have their structure left underspecified in predicate-argument structure.",
        "4.3.",
        "What are the Predicates and Arguments?",
        "There are two widely used schemes for mapping linguistic heads (e.g., main verbs) and complements (e.g., subjects and objects) into predicate-argument structures.",
        "In one approach, the head is treated as a multi-argument predicate",
        "In the other approach, a \"Davidsonian\" [2] notation is used, in which an \"event\" described by the head is introduced, and the complements are treated as fillers of role relations for the event.",
        "In the notation we have adopted, this comes out looking something like <(ev-type 1 P) (R1 1 X) (R2 1 Y) (113 1 Z)> We have chosen the Davidsonian-style notation, because of its flexibility in leaving open exactly what complements (and adjuncts) a head has.",
        "After the decision to use a Davidsonian representation, the question came up of how widely to apply it.",
        "Davidson's original proposal was intended to apply only to verbs (in particular, only to action verbs), but examples arise with adjectives, adverbs, nouns, and even prepositions that seem to require a similar treatment.",
        "We have tentatively decided, therefore, to apply it to all of these types of expressions, but to provide syntactic sugar to hide some of the complexity in simple cases."

        "It has also been agreed that verbs and their event nominal-izations should be given the same underlying predicates, for example, arrive and arrival.",

        "The choice of the Davidsonian representation for head-complement relations raises an important issue closely related to that of word-sense identification – namely, identification of the role-relations that hold between the events and the complements (R1, R2, and so forth in the discussion above).",
        "One possibility is to use fairly superficial identifiers (such as abbreviations for \"logical subject\" and \"logical object\") or surface prepositions for role names, to keep the annotations domain-independent.",
        "An objection to this is that it is too syntactically oriented and does not represent a deep enough level of understanding.",
        "The approach currently being explored is to attempt to define a set of semantic classes relevant to the domain and construct role names from those classes.",
        "If there is only one relation between a pair of classes salient enough to be expressed by a grammatical role or preposition, then a simple concatenation of the class names would be used.",

        "Since theory-laden terms are not used to name the roles, this approach should avoid arguments such as whether a particular role is really an agent or is merely an experiencer.",
