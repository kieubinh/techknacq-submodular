        "In the second year of evaluations of the ARPA HLT Machine Translation (MT) Initiative, methodologies developed and tested in 1992 were applied to the 1993 MT test runs.",
        "The current methodology optimizes the inherently subjective judgments on translation accuracy and quality by channeling the judgments of non-translators into many data points which reflect both the comparison of the performance of the research MT systems with production MT systems and against the performance of novice translators.",

        "Evaluation of Machine Translation (MT) has proven to be a particularly difficult challenge over the course of its history.",
        "As has been noted elsewhere (White et al., 1993), assessment of how well an expression in one language is conveyed in another is loaded with subjective judgments, even when the expressions are translated by professional translators.",
        "Among these judgments are the extent to which the information was conveyed accurately, and the extent to which the information conveyed was fluently expressed in the target language.",
        "The inherent subjectivity has been noted, and attempts have been made in MT evaluation to use such judgments to best qualitative advantage (e.g., van Slype 1979).",
        "The means of capturing judgments into quantifiably useful comparisons among systems have led to legitimate constraints on the range of the evaluation, such as to the scope of the intended end-use (Church and Hovy 1991), or to the effectiveness of the linguistic model (Jordan et al.",
        "1992, Nomura 1992, Gamback et al.",
        "1991).",
        "The ARPA MT Initiative encompasses radically different approaches, potential end-uses, and languages.",
        "Consequently, the evaluation methodologies developed for it must capture quantifiable judgments from subjectivity, while being relatively unconstrained otherwise.",
        "This paper presents the 1993 methodologies, and the results of the 1993 MT evaluation.",
        "We further discuss the preliminary status of an evaluation now underway that greatly increases the participation of the entire MT community, while refining the sensitivity and portability of the evaluation techniques."

        "The mission of the ARPA MT initiative is \"to make revolutionary advances in machine translation technology\" (Doddington, personal communication).",
        "The focus of the investigation is the \"core MT technology.\" This focus tends, ultimately, away from the tools of MT and toward the (fully automatic) central engines.",
        "It is well understood that practical MT will always use tools by which humans interact with the algorithms in the translation process.",
        "However, the ARPA aim is to concentrate on fully-automatic (FA) output in order to assess the viability of radical new approaches.",
        "The May-August 1993 evaluation was the second in the continuing series, along with dry runs and pretests of particular evaluation methods.",
        "In 1992, evaluation methods were built on human testing models.",
        "One method employed the same criteria used in the U.S. government to determine the competence of human translators.",

        "The methods have been replaced by methods which maintain familiarity in terms of human testing, but which are both more sensitive and more portable to other settings and systems.",
        "The Fluency, Adequacy, and Comprehension evaluations developed for the 1993 evaluation are described below; system outputs from 1992 were subjected to 1993 methods, which determined their enhanced sensitivity (White et al., op.",

        "The 1993 evaluation included output from the three research systems, five production systems, and translations from novice translators.",

        "The Pangloss system uses both knowledge-based and linguistic techniques.",
