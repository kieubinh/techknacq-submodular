        "This paper describes a semi-automatic method for associating a Japanese lexicon with a semantic concept taxonomy using a Japanese-English bilingual dictionary as a \"bridge\", in order to support semantic processing in a knowledge-based machine translation (MT) system.",
        "To enhance the semantic processing in MT systems, many system include conceptual networks called ontologies or semantic taxonomies [Bateman, 1990; Carlson and Nirenburg, 1990; Hovy and Knight, 1993; Klavans et al., 1990; Klavans et al., 1991; Knight, 1993].",
        "These ontologies house the representation symbols used by the analyzer and generator.",
        "To put the ontologies to practical use, lexical items of each language of interest should be linked to appropriate ontology items.",
        "To support extensibility to new languages, the MT ontology should be language-neutral, if not language-independent[Hovy and Nirenburg, 1992].",
        "However, the construction of language-neutral ontologies, and the association of ontology items with lexical items of various languages, are processes fraught with difficulty.",
        "Much of this work depends on the subjective decisions of more than one human workers.",
        "Therefore, large MT dictionaries tend to be subject to some dispersion and inconsistency.",
        "Many translation errors are due to these dictionary problems, because the quality of the MT dictionaries are essential for the translation process.",
        "If possible, the dictionary quality should be controlled by automatic algorithms during the process of development to suppress dispersions and inconsistencies, even if the final check should be entrusted to the human workers.",
        "Another motivation for the development of automated dictionary/ontology alignment algorithms is the increased availability of online lexical and semantic resources, such as lexicons, taxonomies, dictionaries and thesajuri[Matsumoto et al., 1993b; Miller, 1990; Lenat and Guha, 1990; Carlson and Nirenburg, 1990; Collins, 1971; IPAL, 1987].",
        "Making the best use of such resources leads to higher quality translation with lower development cost[Hovy and Knight, 1993; Knight, 1994; Hovy and Nirenburg, 1992].",
        "For example, the JUMAN system provides a Japanese unilingual lexicon for analyzing Japanese texts[Matsumoto et al., 1993b].",
        "The linkage of the unilingual lexicon to the ontology directly enables Japanese-English translation with lower development cost.",
        "From this viewpoint, automatic alignment algorithms represent a new paradigm for MT system building.",
        "The problem we focus on here is how to associate concepts in the ontology with Japanese lexical entities by automatic methods, since it is too difficult to define adequately many concepts manually.",
        "We have designed three algorithms to associate a Japanese lexicon with the concepts of the ontology automatically: the equivalent-word match, the argument match, and the example match, by employing a Japanese-English bilingual dictionary as a \"bridge\".",
        "The algorithms make it possible to link the unilingual lexicons such as JUMAN with the ontology for the development of a Japanese-English MT system.",
        "First, we describe three linguistic resources for developing the Japanese-English MT system: the ontology, the Japanese lexicon, and the bilingual dictionary.",
        "Next, we describe the automatic concept association algorithms for creating the MT dictionary.",
        "Finally, we report the results of the algorithms as well as future work."
