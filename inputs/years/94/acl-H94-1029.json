        "LINGSTAT is an interactive machine-aided translation system designed to increase the productivity of a translator.",
        "It is aimed both at experienced users whose goal is high quality translation, and inexperienced users with little knowledge of the source whose goal is simply to extract information from foreign language text.",
        "(For an introduction to the basic structure of LINGSTAT, see [1].)",
        "The first problem to be studied is Japanese to English translation with an emphasis on text from the domain of mergers and acquisitions, although recent evaluations have included general newspaper text as well.",
        "Work is also progressing on a Spanish to English system.",
        "The approach described below represents the current state of the Japanese system, and will be applied with minimal changes to Spanish.",
        "Due to the special difficulties presented by the Japanese writing system, previous versions of LINGSTAT have focused on developing tools for the lexical analysis of Japanese (such as tokenization of the Japanese character stream, morphological analysis, and katakana transliteration), and on providing the user access to lexical information (such as pronunciations, glosses, and definitions) via online lookup tools.",
        "In addition, a simple parser was incorporated to identify modifying phrases.",
        "No translation of the document was provided.",
        "Instead, the user used the results of the above analyses and the online tools to construct a translation.",
        "In the newest version of LINGSTAT, the user is pro-\"This work was sponsored by the Advanced Research Projects Agency under contract number J-FBI-91-239.",
        "vided with a draft translation of the source document.",
        "For a source language similar to English, a starting point for such a draft might be a word-for-word translation, but because Japanese word order and sentence structure are so different from English, a more general framework has been constructed.",
        "The translation process in LINGSTAT consists of the following steps:",
        "• Tokenization and morphological analysis • Parsing • Rearrangement of the source into English order • Annotation and selection of glosses via an English language model",
        "These modules are described in Section 2 below.",
        "Section 3 gives some preliminary results from the January 1994 evaluation, and Section 4 discusses some plans for future improvements."

      "heading": "2. IMPLEMENTATION Tokenization/de-inflection",
      "text": [
        "In LINGSTAT, \"tokenization\" refers to the process of breaking a source document into a sequence of root words tagged, if necessary, with inflection information.",
        "For most languages, the tokenizer is basically an engine that oversees the de-inflection of source words into root forms.",
        "For languages like Japanese, written without spaces, the tokenizer also has the job of segmenting the source.",
        "To segment Japanese, the LINGSTAT tokenizer uses a probabilistic dynamic programming algorithm to break up the character stream into the sequence of words that maximizes the product of word unigram probabilities, as supplied from a list of 300,000 words.",
        "Inflected forms are recognized during tokenization by a de-inflector module.",
        "This module has a language-independent engine driven by a language-specific de-inflection table.",
        "(More details on the function of these components can be found in [1].)",
        "There have been two improvements in the tokenizer/de",
        "inflector module in the newer versions of the system, made possible by the introduction of part of speech information into the word list.",
        "The first is an extra check on the validity of suggested de-inflections by demanding consistency between the inflection and the part of speech of the proposed root.",
        "This has cleanly eliminated a number of spurious de-inflections that were previously handled in a more ad-hoc fashion.",
        "The second improvement, motivated more by plans to move on to Spanish, is to stop the tokenizer from attempting to uniquely specify the de-inflection path (and now, part of speech) for each token it finds.",
        "As an example of the problem this addresses, consider the two de-inflections of the Spanish word ayudas: ayudas ayuda (help, aid) ayudas --• ayudar (to help, to aid) The original tokenizes made a choice between the noun and verb de-inflection based on the unigram frequency of the root.",
        "The new tokenizer still finds all allowed possibilities, but now simply passes them to the parser, which is better equipped to resolve the ambiguity."

      "heading": "Parsing",
      "text": [
        "The parser in LINGSTAT has two roles.",
        "In the interactive component, information about modifying phrases is extracted from the parse and presented to the user as an aid to understanding the structure of each Japanese sentence.",
        "In the automatic component, the parse is the basis for the rearrangement of the Japanese sentence into English.",
        "Because it is a long-term goal to have a system that can be quickly adapted to new domains and languages, a high priority is placed on developing parsing techniques that are capable of extracting some information automatically through training on new sources of text, thus minimizing the amount of human effort.",
        "In the current system, this has led to a two-stage parsing process.",
        "The first stage implements a coarse probabilistic context-free grammar of a few hundred human-supplied rules acting on parts of speech.",
        "Because of this coarseness, some parsing ambiguities remain to be resolved by the second-stage parser, which implements a simple, lexical-ized, probabilistic context-free grammar trained on word co-occurrences in unlabeled Japanese sentences without human input.",
        "Context-free parser.",
        "The first-stage parse is done using a standard probabilistic context-free grammar acting on about 50 parts of speech.",
        "Any ambiguities in part of speech assignments or de-inflection paths passed by the tokenizer/de-inflector are resolved based on the probability of possible parses.",
        "The grammar is allowed to contain unitary and null productions, which impose an ordering on the summation over rules that takes place during training; because there are currently only a few hundred rules, this ordering is checked by hand.",
        "The grammar can be trained with either the Inside-Outside [2] or Viterbi [3] algorithm.",
        "It is essential that the parser return a parse, even a bad one, for subsequent processing.",
        "Therefore special, low-probability \"junk\" rules have been introduced to handle unanticipated constructions.",
        "These junk rules affect the generation of terminal symbols and take the following form: for each rule in which a non-terminal generates a particular terminal, a rule is added permitting the same non-terminal to generate any other terminal with a small probability.",
        "This allows the grammar to force the terminal string into a sequence that has a recognizable parse, but at a high enough cost such that any parse without such coersion will be favored.",
        "One advantage of this approach is that the grammar can compensate for missing or mislabeled data.",
        "Consider the fragment thedet largeado dognoun in which the adjective large has been mislabeled as an adverb.",
        "The junk rule permits the grammar to change its part of speech to something more appropriate provided no other sensible parse can be found.",
        "In principle, the probability of invoking the junk rule could be trained with the other rules in the grammar (the example above suggests that it might be advantageous to do so).",
        "Currently this is not being done, based on the observation that an invocation of the junk rule is more likely an indication of a deficiency in the grammar than a useful correction to the data.",
        "Lexicalized parser.",
        "The grammar implemented by the context-free parser is not fine enough to properly resolve certain kinds of ambiguity, such as the correct attachment of prepositional phrases or noun modifiers.",
        "These attachment problems are handled by a second parser, which does a top-down rescoring of certain probabilities computed in the first stage.",
        "Currently this rescoring is used to fine-tune attachments of particle phrases in Japanese sentences.",
        "The second parser makes use of a second probabilistic grammar, one whose basic elements are the words themselves, and whose data consist of the probabilities of each word in the vocabulary to be generated in the context of any other word.",
        "Like a bigram language model, these probabilities can be trained on word co-occurrences in unlabeled sentences, but unlike bigrams, the grammar can learn about associations between words in a sentence regardless of their separation.",
        "This very simple context-free grammar can be described as follows.",
        "To each word in the vocabulary we associate a terminal symbol w (the word itself) and a non-terminal symbol A.",
        "The grammar consists of the following two kinds of rules:",
        "where 4, represents the null production.",
        "In addition, we introduce a sentence start symbol Ao with the production Ao .",
        "(2) The probability of invoking a particular rule depends only on the word associated with the generating non-terminal and the terminal word in the production.",
        "The probabilities for (la) and (lb) can therefore be written p(wi w2) and p(wi --+ (A), respectively, and these satisfy",
        "feature is that words with the most predictive power in a sentence tend to generate words with less predictive power, which has the consequence that words like the tend to generate no words at all.",
        "This is an improvement over a bigram model in which the is required to select a succeeding word from a distribution that is essentially flat across a large portion of the vocabulary.",
        "This grammar shares the appealing feature of n-gram models that its parameters can be trained on unlabeled text (consisting of whole sentences).",
        "In this case, however, the training procedure is iterative – a modification of the Inside-Outside algorithm that is of order N4 in the sentence length.",
        "The iteration starts from a flat distribution, with co-occurrences of words within sentences leading to enhanced probabilities for some words to generate others.",
        "The N4 algorithm actually applies to a slightly different (but generatively equivalent) grammar than the one defined by rules (1) and (2).",
        "To implement this algorithm, we first replace rule (la) by For the start symbol, the probabilities are p(0--• w) and satisfy",
        "(w2 to the left of wi) (w2 to the right of w1) There is no null production for the start symbol.",
        "Roughly speaking, this grammar generates a sentence in the following manner.",
        "The start symbol first generates some word in the sentence.",
        "This word then generates some number of words to its left and right, which in turn generate other words to their left and right.",
        "From the form of the grammar it can be deduced that these generations are \"local,\" in the sense that if w1 generates w2 on its right, w2 is not allowed to generate any word to the left of wi (and similarly for w1 generating w2 on its left).",
        "The process continues in a cascading fashion until the whole sentence has been generated.",
        "The fertility of a particular word w (i.e., the number of words it will typically generate) is determined by the probability p(w 0), as can be seen from examining the productions (1): a non-terminal Au, will continue to produce words through rule (la) via tail recursion until rule (lb) is invoked.",
        "Although this grammar has the same type and number of parameters as a bigram model, here they have a very different interpretation: they measure the probability of one word to generate another anywhere in the sentence, subject only to the constraints imposed by the generation process described above.",
        "Thus an association between two words that might typically appear together, such as fast and car, will be recognized even if another word might occasionally intervene, such as red.",
        "Another where the probability of both rules is the same and given by p(wi w2).",
        "The only difference between this and rule (la) is that when Aw generates multiple words to the right of w, they are generated right to left instead of left to right.",
        "As an example of how the N4 dependence arises, consider the inside calculation for this model.",
        "For a sentence w1... wN, the quantities of interest for the inside pass are the probabilities I(Aug-, wi .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "wi_1) for j < i and I(Awi wi) for j > i.",
        "These may be calculated recursively by the following formulae:",
        "where the \"negative length\" string wi wi_i is understood to represent the null production 0.",
        "The recursion 1 The authors would like to thank Joshua Goodman for developing the N4 procedure, a notable improvement over previous implementations.",
        "is initialized by = p(wi 0) The above computations involve a double sum and are therefore of order N2, and there are order N2 probabilities l(wi wi_1) and 1(A., wi+1 w,), for a total of N4.",
        "(For the Viterbi calculation, one simply selects the largest contribution from the right hand side of equations (3a) and (3b) instead of doing the double sum.)",
        "It is important to note that despite the N4 behavior, this grammar is in general faster than context-free parsing, which is computationally of order N3.",
        "This is because the compute time for context-free parsing also includes a factor proportional to the number of rules in the grammar, which even in simple cases can be in the hundreds.",
        "There is no such factor in the computation for this lex-icalized grammar – it is effectively replaced by another power of N, which is much smaller.",
        "To see how the probabilities p(w1 w2) converge, this model was run through ten iterations of training on approximately 100,000 sentences of ten words or less from the English half of the Canadian Hansard corpus.",
