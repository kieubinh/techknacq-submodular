        "In the message understanding research promoted by ARPA through its Human Language Technology initiative, the form of this output has been templates (feature-structures), with complex pathnames (slots) and various constraints on fillers.",
        "The design of these templates, especially considered as concrete data structures, has been determined to some degree at least by considerations having to do with automatic scoring.",
        "Beyond that, it has not been made clear what principles have driven or should drive the design of these output forms; but it has become clear that serious defects in the form of the output can undermine the utility of an information extraction system.",
        "If the output is unusable, or not easily usable, the breadth and reliability of coverage of the natural language analysis component will be of little value.",
        "As part of the DASH research project on Data Access for Situation Handling, we are attempting to elucidate principles of template design and at compiling these, with examples, in a manual for template designers.",
        "Our methodology has included detailed critical analysis of the templates from a variety of information extraction tasks (MUC-4, MUC-5, Tipster1, the Warbreaker Message Handling [WBMH] tasks), together with the creation of templates for the TREC topic descriptions and narratives.",
        "The design of templates, or more generally, abstract data structures, as output forms for automatic information extraction systems must be sensitive to three different but interacting considerations:",
        "1. the template as representational device 2. the template as generated from input 3. the template as input to further processing, by humans or programs or both.",
        "The central consideration in our research is that of the template as a representational device.",
        "The problem of template design is a special case of the general problem of knowledge representation.",
        "In particular, it is the problem of representing, within a constrained formalism, essential facts about situations in a way that can mediate between texts that describe those situations and a variety of applications that involve reasoning about them.",
        "What facts about a situation are essential is determined by a semantic model of the domain, which is in turn motivated by the particular information requirements of the analytical purposes which the extracted information is to serve.",
        "This specification could, in principle, be done without any detailed thought given to the nature of the texts from which information is to be extracted; thus it could include information requirements that simply could not be met by the input stream.",
        "It might also abstract from information readily transduced from the input stream.",
        "Conversely, the domain specification may reveal cases where one must extract information that is not important to the end user in order to disambiguate or otherwise explicate important informational content.",
        "Again, the domain model could be specified without any detailed thought given to the design of the concrete syntax of the template.",
        "In this latter regard, crucial considerations include intelligibility and 'browsability', together with the utility of the template fills as input to further processing.",
        "We here report some results of a program of research aimed at uncovering the underlying principles of template design."

        "In constructing a representation for a domain or task, the first questions to ask are:",
        "1.",
        "What are the basic entities?",
        "What properties of these objects and what relations among them are we interested in?",
        "2.",
        "What kinds of changes in such properties and relations are we interested in?",
        "Answers to any one of these questions depend on answers to the others.",
        "Answers to the first provide the basic ontology of",
        "the representation.",
        "Basic Entities The basic entities should be things that endure throughout the temporal focus of the task.'",
        "They enter into the relations and are characterized by the properties of primary interest and are the participants in events that may change those properties and relations.",
        "In the joint ventures domain, companies are the primary candidates for basic entities.",
        "In the long run, they get formed, split, merge, and go out of business, but for many analytical purposes, and in particular for the purposes implicit in the MUC-5 task, we can think of them as permanent.",
        "It is companies that enter into joint venture relationships and through such relationships bring about the one crucial exception to the rough-and-ready rule just mentioned: the creation of new, joint venture companies.",
        "In the same domain, facilities and people are also good candidates for basic entities.",
        "The basic entities may be represented by structured objects with a number of slots, as follows:",
        "The difference in outcome between these two cases is that in the former you have to look elsewhere for the information about the entity, whereas in the latter you don't.",
        "In general, it's better not to have to, so unless there is a good deal of information that needs to be recorded about the type of entity in question, it is better to use an atomic element to represent such entities.",
        "Again, within the joint venture domain, companies are good candidates for representation as structured objects, since we need to know their aliases, location, nationality, officers, etc.",
        "On the other hand, within that same domain, it may be that the only information we need to record about a person, aside from his relation to a company, is his name, so in that case it is better to represent the person (atomically) by his name.",
        "'For more on this, see next section.",
        "Natural Kinds It is better if the types of basic entities, especially those represented by structured objects, are 'natural kinds', that is, if they correspond to fairly natural, intuitive ways of classifying and characterizing the domain of interest.",
        "For example, companies, people, facilities are natural kinds in this sense.",
        "Ordered pairs of Industry Types and Product/Services are not.",
        "Rather than have basic entities of unnatural kinds, one may opt for more, or more complex, slot fills in objects of more natural varieties.",
        "Still, it should be remarked that one's commonsense demarcation of a domain into basic entities is always subject to revision by the particular analytical demands of the task at hand.",
        "Thus, in the case of WBMH, while units (e.g., divisions, battalions, etc.)",
        "are a perfectly natural kind of entity, deployments, that is relatively short-lived activities involving elements from units, may be less natural but they are at least equally central.",
        "Associating Properties with the Right Objects It is important to determine whether the property encoded in the slot of an object is really a property of that object, rather than of some other related object.",
        "For example, in the Tipster templates, Total Capitalization was viewed as a property of the Contribution object, whereas it is really a property of the Tie-Up Relationship, and thus should be associated with that object.",
        "This misplacement of properties seems especially likely when the entities in question are types of relationships or activities, as they are in this case.",

        "We have noted that the issue of what kinds of changes are of interest relative to a given task is centrally important to the design of templates for the task.",
        "The resolution of this issue is a crucial determinant, in particular, of what we call the temporal granularity of the representation.",
        "Certain properties of and relations among entities are relatively permanent; others are relatively short-lived.",
        "But what counts as permanent and what as short-lived is itself dependent on our interests and purposes, both theoretical and practical.",
        "An analysis of the kinds of changes that are of interest should determine, even if only roughly, a temporal interval or length of time as its focus or window.",
        "See Fig. 1.",
        "Note that there is a mutual dependence here: Properties and relations that are apt to change within that time interval are temporary; those that are likely to hold throughout the designated interval are, with respect to this task, permanent.",
        "Thus, the fixing of a temporal granularity allows the resolution of many problems in template design by defining limits on what we have to specify.",
        "For example, in the joint ventures domain, we are interested in the formation (or dissolution) of tie-up relations among companies.",
        "Thus such relations are temporary, whereas subsidiary relations are permanent.",
        "If we were interested in buy-outs, subsidiary relations would be viewed as temporary, changes in such relationships being an important focus for the task.",
        "In the domain of troop movements or deployments, locations and associated equipment are temporary, whereas a unit's place in the command hierarchy is permanent, even though on the scale of decades (or even much less), that might change.",
        "Note that temporal granularity is task-relative rather than message-relative.",
        "The messages may have been written from very different temporal perspectives, with very different interests and purposes.",

        "The following criteria seem useful in deciding which of these options to adopt:",
        "1.",
        "If the relation is of primary interest in the task, option (a) may be the best choice.",
        "2.",

        "and various other aspects of the relation, then option (a) is indicated.",
        "With respect to the third criterion, if the relation is at least as permanent as the entities, then option (b) is a good choice.",
        "These two criteria overlap to some extent.",
        "If the relation is permanent, there is likely no need to record its time.",
        "In the specific case of the Subsidiary relation in Tipster, it is not the relation of primary interest (Tie-Ups are), there are no other properties that need to be specified for the relation other than the parent and child companies, and the relation is permanent with respect to the temporal focus of the task.",
        "Therefore, option (b) seems appropriate.",
        "The Tipster template presents an apposite example of criterion 4 as well.",
        "A Contribution, as conceptualized in the template, is a relationship, just as a Tie-Up-Relationship is, so it certainly could qualify for object status.",
        "However, it is dependent on a Tie-Up-Relationship; a Contribution relationship among companies can't exist without a Tie-Up-Relationship among them.",

        "First, there are those that directly relate two or more basic entities, such as a company manufacturing a product or a terrorist organization attacking a target or a vendor supplying a buyer with a part.",
        "These very same events, however – especially if, as in the examples just mentioned, they involve purposive agents – can also be classified in terms of their purpose or aim.",
        "This type of classification typically involves further reference to an activity or condition, as when a company manufactures a product in order to enter a new market or when two companies form a joint venture for the purpose of carrying out some activity.",
        "Third, there is the specially important type of event involving communicative relations among basic entities, together with a content communicated, itself comprising some further activity or event of any of the three types.",
        "Thus, a typical event structure might be represented as in Fig. 3.",
        "Of course, in many cases there would be equations identifying the various entities involved.",
        "Thus, GM might announce it is forming a joint venture with Toyota for the manufacture of cars by GM in Japan, where Source-Ent = Entl Ent3 = GM.",
        "We also note that a Communication-Event can have a Basic-Event for its third argument.",
        "In addition to these three event types, there are relations between events that we may need to represent, such as causality or the subevent (part-whole) relation, as in Fig. 4.",

        "These slots, on the other hand, would also have to allow multiple entries and each entry would have to have time stamps.",
