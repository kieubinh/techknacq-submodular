        "Interactive spoken dialog provides many new challenges for spoken language systems.",
        "One of the most critical is the prevalence of speech repairs.",
        "Speech repairs are dysfluencies where some of the words that the speaker utters need to be removed in order to correctly understand the speaker's meaning.",
        "These repairs can be divided into three types: fresh starts, modifications, and abridged.",
        "A fresh start is where the speaker abandons what she was saying and starts again.",
        "the current plan is we take – okay let's say we start with the bananas (d91-2.2 utt105) A modification repair is where the speech repair modifies what was said before.",
        "after the orange juice is at – the oranges are at the 01 factory (d93-193 utt59) An abridged repair is where the repair consists solely of a fragment and/or editing terms.",
        "we need to – urn manage to get the bananas to Danville more quickly (d93-143 utt50) In these examples, the \"–\" marks the interruption point, the point that marks the end of the removed text (including word fragments), and precedes the editing terms, if present.",
        "In our corpus of problem solving dialogs, 25% of turns contain at least one repair, 67% of repairs occur with at least one other repair in the turn, and repairs in the same turn occur on average within 6 words of each other.",
        "As a result, no spoken language system will perform well without an effective way to detect and correct speech repairs.",
        "We propose that speech repairs can be detected and corrected within the local context of the repair.",
        "So, clues are needed for detecting repairs that do not depend on such global properties as the syntactic or semantic well-formedness of the entire utterance.",
        "But this does not mean that syntactic clues cannot be used.",
        "One powerful predictor of modification repairs is the presence of a syntactic anomaly (c.f.",
        "Bear, Dowding and Shriberg, 1992) at the interruption point.",
        "The anomaly occurs because the text after the interruption point is not intended to follow the text before the interruption, but to replace it, so there is no reason why the text before and the text after need to be syntactically well-formed.",
        "In this paper, we describe how the syntactic anomalies of modification repairs can be detected by a part-of-speech tagger, augmented with category transition probabilities for modification repairs.",
        "Because we use a statistical model, other clues, such as the presence of editing terms, word fragments, and word correspondence can be factored in by appropriately modifying the transition probabilities.",
        "Focusing on the detection of modification repairs does not mean we are ignoring abridged repairs.",
        "Assuming that word fragments and editing terms can be detected, abridged repairs are easy to detect and correct.",
        "What is not trivial about these repairs is differentiating them from modification repairs, especially where there are incidental word correspondences.",
        "It is this distinction that makes such repairs easy to detect, but potentially difficult to correct.",
        "Since our approach looks for syntactic anomalies, other than those caused by word fragments and editing terms, it can distinguish abridged repairs from modification repairs, which should make both types of repairs easier to correct.",
        "An ulterior motive for not using higher level syntactic or semantic knowledge is that the coverage of parsers and semantic interpreters is not sufficient for unrestricted dialogs.",
        "Recently, Dowding et al.",
        "(1993) reported syntactic and semantic coverage of 86% for the Darpa Airline reservation corpus.",
        "Unrestricted dialogs will present even more difficulties; not only will the speech be more ungrammatical, but there is also the problem of segmenting the dialog into utterance units (c.f.",
        "Wang and Hirschberg, 1992).",
        "If speech repairs can be detected and corrected before parsing and semantic interpretation, this should simplify those modules as well as make them more robust."

        "Several different strategies have been discussed in the literature for detecting and correcting speech repairs.",
        "One way to compare the effectiveness of these approaches is to look at their recall and precision rates.",
        "For detecting repairs, the recall rate is the number of correctly detected repairs compared to the number of repairs, and the precision rate is the number of detected repairs compared to the number of detections (including false positives).",
        "But the true measures of success are the correction rates.",
        "Correction recall is the number of repairs that were properly corrected compared to the number of repairs.",
        "Correction precision is the number of repairs that were properly corrected compared to the total number of corrections.",
        "One of the first computational approaches was that taken by",
        "Hindle (1983), who used a deterministic parser augmented with rules to look for matching categories and matching strings of words.",
        "Hindle achieved a correction recall rate of 97% on his corpus; however, this was olbtained by assuming that speech repairs were marked by an explicit \"edit signal\" and with part-of-speech tags externally supplied.",
        "The SRI group (Bear, Dowding and Shriberg, 1992) removed the assumption of an explicit edit signal, and employed simple pattern matching techniques for detecting and correcting modification repairs (they removed all utterances with abridged repairs from their corpus).",
        "For detection, they were able to achieve a recall rate of 76%, and a precision of 62%, and they were able to find the correct repair 57% of the time, leading to an overall correction recall of 43% and correction precision of 50%.",
        "They also tried combining syntactic and semantic knowledge in a \"parser-first\" approach – first try to parse the input and if that fails, invoke repair strategies based on their pattern matching technique.",
        "In a test set of 756 utterances containing 26 repairs (Dowding et al., 1993), they obtained a detection recall rate of 42% and a precision of 84.6%; for correction, they obtained a recall rate of 30% and a precision rate of 62%.",
        "Nakatani and Hirschberg (1993) investigated using acoustic information to detect the interruption point of speech repairs.",
        "In their corpus, 74% of all repairs are marked by a word fragment Using hand-transcribed prosodic annotations, they trained a classifier on a 172 utterance training set to identify the interruption point (each utterance contained at least one repair).",
        "On a test set of 186 utterances containing 223 repairs, they obtained a recall rate of 83.4% and a precision of 93.9% in detecting speech repairs.",
        "The clues that they found relevant were duration of pause between words, presence of fragments, and lexical matching within a window of three words.",
        "However, they do not address the problem of determining the correction or distinguishing modification repairs from abridged repairs."

        "On the test corpus consisting of 142 repairs, it made the right correction for 114 of them, it incorrectly corrected 4 more, and it falsely detected 14 more, for a correction recall rate of 803% and a precision of 86.4%.",
        "Table 4 summarizes the overall results for both the pattern builder and statistical model on the training corpus and on the test set.",
        "The results that we obtained are better than others reported in the literature.",
        "However, such comparisons are limited due to differences in both the type of repairs that are being studied and in the datasets used for drawing results.",
        "Bear, Dowding, and Shriberg (1992) use the ATIS corpus, which is a collection of queries made to an automated airline reservation system.",
        "As stated earlier, they removed all utterances that contained abridged repairs.",
        "For detection they obtained a recall rate of 76% and a precision of 62%, and for correction, a recall rate of 43% and a precision of 50%.",
        "It is not clear whether their results would be better or worse if abridged repairs were included.",
        "Dowding et al.",
        "(1993) used a similar setup for their data.",
        "As part of a complete system, they obtained a detection recall rate of 42% and a precision of 85%; and for correction, a recall rate of 30% and a precision of 62%.",
        "Lastly, Nakatani and Hirschberg (1993) also used the ATIS corpus, but in this case, focused only on detection, but detection of all three types of repairs.",
        "However, their test corpus consisted entirely of utterances that contained at least one repair.",
        "This makes it hard to evaluate their results, reporting a detection recall rate of 83% and precision of 94%.",
        "Testing on an entire corpus would clearly decrease their precision.",
        "As for our own data, we used a corpus of natural dialogues that were segmented only by speaker turns, not by individual utterances, and we focused on modification repairs and abridged repairs, with fresh starts being marked in the input so as not to cause interference in detecting the other two types."

        "We have described a statistical model for detecting speech repairs.",
        "The model detects repairs by using category transition probabilities around repair intervals and for fluent speech.",
        "By training on actual examples of repairs, we can detect them without having to set arbitrary cutoffs for category transitions that might be insensitive to rarely used constructs.",
        "If people actually use syntactic anomalies as a clue in detecting speech repairs, then training on examples of them",
        "makes sense.",
        "In doing this work, we were faced with a lack of training data.",
        "The eventual answer is to have a large corpus of tagged dialogs with the speech repairs annotated.",
        "Since this was not available, we used the Brown corpus for the fluent category-transition probabilities.",
        "As well, these transition probabilities were used to 'bootstrap' our tagger in determining the part-of-speech tags for our training corpus.",
        "The tags of the 450 or so hand-annotated modification repairs were then used for setting the transition probabilities around modification repairs.",
        "Another problem that we encountered was interference between adjacent utterances in the same turn.",
        "Subsequent utterances often build on, or even repeat what was previously said (Walker, 1993).",
        "Consider the following utterance.",
        "that's all you need you only need one tanker (d93-8.3 utt79) The tagger incorrectly hypothesized that this was a modification repair with an interruption point after the first occurrence of the word \"need\".",
        "Even a relatively simple segmentation of the dialogs into utterances would remove some of the false positives and improve performance.",
        "Speech repairs do interact negatively with part-of-speech tagging, and even with statistical modeling of repairs, inappropriate tags are still sometimes assigned.",
        "In the following example, the second occurrence of the word \"load\" was categorized as a noun, and the speech repair went undetected.",
        "it'll be seven a.m. by the time we load in - load the bananas (d93-12.4 utt53)"

        "This paper described a method of detecting repairs that uses a part-of-speech tagger.",
        "Our work shows that a large percentage of speech repairs can be detected and corrected prior to parsing.",
        "Prosodic clues can be easily incorporated into our statistical model, and we are currently investigating methods of automatically extracting simple prosodic features in order to further improve the performance of the algorithm.",
        "Our algorithm assumes that the speech recognizer produces a sequence of words and identifies the presence of word fragments.",
        "With the exception of identifying fresh starts, all other processing is automatic and does not require additional hand-tailored transcription.",
        "We will be incorporating this method of detecting and correcting speech repairs into the next version of the TRAINS system, which will use spoken input."
