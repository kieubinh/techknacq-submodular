        "When no information about sense-frequencies was available, the guessing heuristic using the numbers of alternative senses in WordNet was correct 45% of the time.",
        "When statistics for sense-frequencies were derived from a semantic concordance, the assumption that each word is used in its most frequently occurring sense was correct 69% of the time; when that figure was calculated for polysemous words alone, it dropped to 58%.",
        "And when a co-occurrence heuristic took advantage of prior occurrences of words together in the same sentences, little improvement was observed.",

        "It is generally recognized that systems for automatic sense identification should be evaluated against a null hypothesis.",
        "Gale, Church, and Yarowsky [1] suggest that the appropriate basis for comparison would be a system that assumes that each word is being used in its most frequently occurring sense.",
        "They review the literature on how well word-disambiguation programs perform; as a lower bound, they estimate that the most frequent sense of polysemous words would be correct 75% of the time, and they propose that any sense-identification system that does not give the correct sense of polysemous words more than 75% of the time would not be worth serious consideration.",
        "The value of setting such a lower bound is obvious.",
        "However, Gale, Church, and Yarowsky [1] do not make clear how they determined what the most frequently occurring senses are.",
        "In the absence of such information, a case can be made that the lower bound should be given by the proportion of monosemous words in the textual corpus.",
        "Although most words in a dictionary have only a single sense, it is the polysemous words that occur most frequently in speech and writing.",
        "This is true even when we ignore the small set of highly polysemous closed-class words (pronouns, prepositions, auxiliary verbs, etc.)",
        "that play such an important structural role.",
        "For example, 82.3% of the open-class words in WordNet [2] are monosemous, but only 27.2% of the open-class words in a sample of 103 passages from the Brown Corpus [3] were monosemous.",
        "â€¢ Hunter College and Graduate School of the City University of New York",
        "That is to say, 27% of the time no decision would be needed, but for the remaining 73% of the open-class words, the response would have to be \"don't know.\" This is probably the lowest lower bound anyone would propose, although if the highly polysemous, very frequently used closed-class words were included, it would be even lower.",
        "A better performance figure would result, of course, if, instead of responding \"don't know,\" the system were to guess.",
        "What is the percentage correct that you could expect to obtain by guessing?"

        "A guessing strategy presumes the existence of a standard list of words and their senses, but it does not assume any knowledge of the relative, frequencies of different senses of polysemous words.",
        "We adopted the lexical database WordNet [2] as a convenient on-line list of open-class words and their senses.",
        "Whenever a word is encountered that has more than one sense in WordNet, a system with no other information could do no better than to select a sense at random.",
        "The guessing heuristic that we evaluated was defined as follows: on encountering a noun (other than a proper noun), verb, adjective, or adverb in the test material, look it up in WordNet.",
        "If the word is monosemous (has a single sense in WordNet), assign that sense to it.",
        "If the word is polysemous (has more than one sense in WordNet), choose a sense at random with a probability of 1/n, where n is the number of different senses of that word.",
        "This guessing heuristic was then used with the sample of 103 passages from the Brown Corpus.",
        "Given the distribution of open-class words in those passages and the number of senses of each word in WordNet, estimating the probability of a correct sense identification is a straightforward calculation.",
        "The result was that 45.0% of the 101,284 guesses would be correct.",
        "When the percent correct was calculated for just the 76,067 polysemous word tokens, it was 26.8%."

        "Entries in this dictionary are organized in such a way that, whenever possible, the first sense of a polysemous word is both common and central to the meaning of the word.",

        "At the ARPA Human Language Technology Workshop in March 1993, Miller, Leacock, Tengi, and Bunker [7] described a semantic concordance that combines passages from the Brown Corpus [3] with the WordNet lexical database [2] in such a way that every open-class word in the text (every noun, verb, adjective, or adverb) carries both a syntactic tag and a semantic tag pointing to the appropriate sense of that word in WordNet.",
        "The version of this semantic concordance that existed in August 1993, incorporating 103 of the 500 passages in the Brown Corpus, was made publicly available, along with version 1.4 of WordNet to which the passages were tagged.' Passages in the Brown Corpus are approximately 2,000 words long, and average approximately 1,000 open-class words each.",
        "Although this sample is much smaller than one would like, this semantic concordance does provide a basis for estimating sense frequencies for open-class words broken down by part of speech (word/pos).",
        "For example, there are seven senses of the word \"board\" as a noun (board/nl, board/n2, , board/n7), and four senses as a verb (board/vl, board/v2, ... , board/v4); the frequencies of all eleven senses in the semantic concordance can be tabulated separately to determine the most frequent board/n and the most frequent board/v.",
        "The fact that the words that occur most frequently in standard English tend to be the words that are most polysemous creates a bad news, good news situation.",
        "The bad news is that most of the content words in textual corpora require disambiguation.",
        "The good news is that polysemous words occur frequently enough that statistical estimates are possible on the basis of relatively small samples.",
        "It is possible, therefore, to pose the question: on the basis of the available sample, how often would the most frequent sense be correct?",
        "A larger semantic concordance would undoubtedly yield a more precise lower bound, but at least an approximate estimate can be obtained.",
        "The most-frequent heuristic was defined as follows: on encountering a noun, verb, adjective, or adverb in the test material, look it up in WordNet.",
        "If the word is monosemous, assign that sense to it.",
        "If the syntactically tagged word (word/pos) has more than one sense in WordNet, consult the semantic concordance to determine which sense occurred most often in that corpus and assign that sense to it; if there is a tie, select one of the equally frequent senses at random.",
        "If the word is polysemous but does not occur in the semantic concordance, choose a sense at random with a probability of 1/n, where n is the number of different senses of that word in WordNet.",

        "The general rule is that only senses that suit all of the words in a sentence can co-occur; not only does word W1 constrain the sense of another word W in the same sentence, but W2 also constrains the sense of W That is what is meant when we say that context 1\" guides a reader in determining the senses of individual words.",
        "Given the importance of co-occurring senses, therefore, we undertook to determine whether, on the basis of the available data, co-occurrences could be exploited for sense identification.",
        "In addition to information about the most frequent senses, a semantic concordance also contains information about senses that tend to occur together in the same sentences.",

        "Means using the co-occurrence heuristic were perhaps a half percent lower than those obtained with the most-frequent heuristic.",
        "And when the effects of guessing were removed, an improvement of approximately 2% was obtained, as before.",
        "This similarity can be attributed to the limited size of the semantic concordance: no co-occurrence data were available for 28% of the polysemous words, so the most-frequent heuristic had to be used; moreover, those words for which co-occurrence data were available tended to occur in their most frequent senses.",
        "On the basis of results obtained with the available sample of semantically tagged text, therefore, there is nothing to be gained by using the more complex co-occurrence heuristic.",

        "The considerable improvement that results from having knowledge of sense frequencies is apparent from the results summarized in Table 2, where the guessing heuristic is contrasted with the most-frequent and co-occurrence heuristics (with guessing removed).",
        "Table 2 Percent correct sense identifications for open-class words without and with information on sense frequencies.",
        "Monosemous Polysemous and Polysemous only Guessing 45.0 26.8 Most frequent 69.0 58.2 Co-occurrence 68.6 57.7 The similarity of the results obtained with the most-frequent and the co-occurrence heuristics is attributable to the fact that when co-occurrence data were indeterminate or lacking, the most-frequent heuristic was the default.",
        "With a large semantic concordance, we would expect the co-occurrence heuristic to do better â€“ it should be able to capture the topical context which, in other work [8], we have found to give scores as high as 70-75% for polysemous words.",
        "How representative are the percentages in Table 2?",
        "Obviously, they are specific to the Brown Corpus; in a restricted domain of discourse, polysemous words would not be used in such a wide variety of ways and a most-frequent heuristic would be correct far more frequently.",
        "The percentages in Table 2 are \"broadly representative of current edited American English\" [3].",
        "They are also, of course, specific to WordNet.",
        "If WordNet did not draw so many sense distinctions, all of these statistical heuristics would be correct more often.",
        "But WordNet does not draw impossibly fine sense distinctions.",
        "Dictionaries differ widely in the number of sense distinctions they draw; pocket dictionaries offer few and unabridged dictionaries offer many alternative senses.",
        "WordNet is somewhere in the middle; it provides about the same semantic granularity as a good desk dictionary.",
        "Anything coarser could not have been used to tag passages from the Brown Corpus.",
        "Finally, can these heuristics provide anything more than benchmarks?",
        "Can they play a role in a system that does an acceptable job of sense identification?",
        "It should be noted that none of these heuristics takes into account the local context.",
        "Even the co-occurrence heuristic is indifferent to word order; imposing word-order constraints would have made sparse data sparser still.",
        "Local context â€“ say, Â± 2 or 3 words â€“ should contain sufficient information to identify the intended sense of most polysemous words.",
        "Given a system capable of exploiting local context, statistical heuristics might still provide a default, as Yarowsky [9] suggests; something to fall back on when local identification fails.",
        "Under those conditions, these statistical heuristics could indeed provide a floor on which more intelligent systems could build."
