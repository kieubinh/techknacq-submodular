        "When automated part of speech tagging was initially explored [Klein and Simmons 63, Harris 62], people manually engineered rules for tagging, sometimes with the aid of a corpus.",
        "As large corpora became available, it became clear that simple Markov-model based stochastic taggers that were automatically trained could achieve high rates of tagging accuracy [Jelinek 85].",
        "These stochastic taggers have a number of advantages over the manually built taggers, including obviating the need for laborious manual rule construction, and possibly capturing useful information that may not have been noticed by the human engineer.",
        "However, stochastic taggers have the disadvantage that linguistic information is only captured indirectly, in large tables of statistics.",
        "Almost all recent work in developing automatically trained part of speech taggers has been on further exploring Markov-model based tagging [Jelinek 85, Church 88, DeRose 88, DeMarcken 90, Merialdo 91, Cutting et al.",

        "that achieves performance comparable to that of stochastic taggers.",
        "Training this tagger is fully automated, but unlike trainable stochastic taggers, linguistic information is encoded directly in a set of simple non-stochastic rules.",
        "In this paper, we describe some extensions to this rule-based tagger.",
        "These include a rule-based approach to: lexicalizing the tagger, tagging unknown words, and assigning the k-best tags to a word.",
        "All of these extensions, as well as the original tagger, are based upon a learning paradigm called transformation-based error-driven learning.",
        "This learning paradigm has shown promise in a number of other areas of natural language processing, and we hope that the extensions to transformation-based learning described in this paper can carry over to other domains of application as wel1.2"
