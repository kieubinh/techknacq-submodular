        "The Laboratory began in 1923 based on a vision of Thomas Edison.",
        "It presently has both a military and civilian director.",
        "There are 4 Laboratories and 17 Divisions and 14 research sites outside the Washington D.C. area.",
        "The staff is comprised of approximately 900 Ph.D.s, 500 Master's degree holders and 700 bachelor's degree holders.",
        "Each year the Lab produces a significant number of refereed journal conference publications.",
        "The Information Technology Division houses the two laboratories whose work will be reported in the remainder of this paper, the HCI Laboratory and the NCARAI Laboratory.",
        "The work in the HCI Lab includes: speech processing within narrowband capabilities and evaluation methods for speech and other interactive systems.",
        "The effort at NCARAI in human language technology focuses on integrating speech with graphical or other modality interfaces.",

        "The speech technology group in the HCI Lab focuses on algorithmic development which is reaching toward communication of humanly intelligible speech at 600 bps .",
        "Current algorithms at 1200 bps are quite successful.",
        "The method relies on linear predictive coding (LPC) of the speech signal to LPC coefficients which can be independently manipulated to enhance aspects of the' signal under differing conditions.",
        "Changes in pitch with all else constant and in rate of speech by slowing or speeding the presentation of the entire set of coefficients are found to be equally intelligible and without distortions that interfere with intelligibility.",
        "A sample of a conversation at different communication bandwidths further demonstrates the role of the technology.",
        "This group has recently developed, using an off-the-shelf Macintosh, a non-real-time terminal which can transmit both speech and images (including annotation) within 2400 bps.",
        "A second terminal is being developed to transmit voice and still images simultaneously but real-time."
