        "The first is whether or not the dynamic programming procedure used in the first pass, which guarantees the optimality of the search for the bigram, generates an \"optimal\" lattice to be used with a trigram LM.",
        "For example, any given word in the lattice will have many possible ending points, but only a few starting points.",
        "This problem was in fact less severe than expected since the time information is not critical to generate an \"optimal\" word graph from the lattice, i.e. the multiple word endings provide enough flexibility to compensate for single word beginnings.",
        "The second consideration is that the lattice generated in this way cannot be too large or there is no interest in a two pass approach.",
        "To solve this second problem, two pruning thresholds are used during the first pass, a beam search pruning threshold which is kept to a level insuring almost no search errors (from the bigram point of view) and a word lattice pruning threshold used to control the lattice size.",
        "A description of the exact procedure used to generate the word graph from the word lattice is beyond the scope of this paper.",
        "The following steps give the key elements behind the procedure.4 First, a word graph is generated from the lattice by merging three consecutive frames (i.e. the minimum duration for a word in our system).",
        "Then, \"similar\" graph nodes are merged with the goal of reducing the overall graph size and generalizing the word lattice.",
        "This step is reiterated until no further reductions are possible.",
        "Finally, based on the trigram backoff language model a trigram word graph is then generated by duplicating the nodes having multiple language model contexts.",
        "Bigram backoff nodes are created when possible to limit the graph expansion.",
        "To fix these ideas, let us consider some numbers for the WSJ 5k-closed vocabulary.",

        "After expansion with the trigram backoff LM, there are on average 3900 word instanciations including silences which are treated the same way as words.",

        "For WSJ, paragraphs were selected ensuring not more than one word was out of the 5.6k most frequent words [ 19], and these additional words were then included as part of the vocabulary.",
        "For BREF, a lexicon was first constructed containing the 5k/20k most frequent words, and sentences covered by this vocabulary were selected from the development test material.",
        "The situation was slightly different for the Nov93 5k test in that the prompt texts were not normalized, and therefore several OOV words (0.3%) occurred in the test data despite it being a closed-vocabulary test.",
        "However, looking at the recognition results for individual speakers, it appears that interspeaker differences are much more important than differences in perplexity, and perhaps more than language differences.",
        "Just considering the relationship between speaking rate and word accurracy, in general, speakers that are faster or slower than the average have a higher word error.",
        "It has been observed that the better/worse speakers are the same on both the 5k and 20k tests.",
        "We have observed some language dependencies, such as the higher number of homophones in BREF, which has the effect of reducing the efficiency of the search and the large number of frequent monophone words which results in larger networks.",
        "At the same time, the phone accuracy for BREF is better than that for WSJ, which speeds up the search.",
        "Improving the model accuracy, at the acoustic level and at the language model level, by taking advantage of the available training data, has led to better system performance.",
        "For both WSJ and BREF increasing the amount of training utterances by an order of magnitude reduces the word error by about 30%.",
        "By using larger training text materials it is possible to train a trigram LM which was incorporated in a second acoustic pass.",
        "The trigram pass gives an error rate reduction of 20% to 30%.",
        "The combined error reduction is on the order of 50%.",
        "It remains a general problem of how to define comparable test conditions for different languages.",
        "This may even depend on the definition of a word in a given language, which is linked to the lexical coverage.",
        "A primary aim of the aforementioned LRE Sqale project is to address this issue."
