        "Interactive speech recognition systems are usually trained on substantial amounts of speech data collected with a high quality close-talking microphone.",
        "During recognition, these systems require the same type of microphone to be used in order to achieve their standard accuracy.",
        "This is a highly restricting condition for practical applications of speech recognition systems.",
        "One can imagine a situation, where it would be desirable to use a different microphone for recognition than the one with which the training speech was collected.",
        "For example, some users may not want to wear a head-motinted microphone.",
        "Others may not want to pay for a high quality microphone.",
        "Additionally, many applications involve recognition of speech over telephone lines and telephone sets with high variability in quality and characteristics.",
        "However, we know that even highly accurate speech recognition systems perform very poorly when they are tested with microphones with different characteristics than the ones that they were trained on [1].",
        "• Retrain the HMMs with data collected with the new microphone encountered during the recognition stage, a rather expensive approach for real applications, or by training on a large number of microphones in the hope that the system will obtain the necessary robustness.",
        "• Use robust signal processing algorithms.",
        "• Develop a feature transformation that maps the alternate microphone data to training microphone data.",
        "• Use statistical methods in order to adapt the parameters of the acoustic models.",
        "In previous work we had discussed the use of Cepstnim Mean Subtraction and the RASTA algorithm as two simple signal processing algorithms to compensate the degradation caused by an alternate channel [7].",
        "In this paper, we present an approach towards feature mapping by modeling the difference between the test and the training microphone, prior to recognition.",
        "We have developed the Tied-Mixture Normalization Algorithm, a technique for adaptation to a new microphone based on modifying the continuous densities in a tied-mixture HMM system, using a relatively small amount of stereo training speech.",
        "This method is presented in detail in Section 2.",
        "In Section 3 we describe several experiments on a known microphone task and the effect of the adaptation method in the performance of the recognition system."

      "text": [
        "In a Tied-Mixture Hidden Markov Model (TM-HMM) system [2, 6], speech is represented using an ensemble of Gaussian mixture densities.",
        "Every frame of speech is represented as a Gaussian mixture model.",
        "Specifically the probability density function for an observation conditioned on the HMEM state is expressed as:",
        "where zt, St, C, ck, Ek are the observed speech frame at time t, the HMM state at time t, the number of clusters of the codebook, and for k-th mixture density, the mixture weight, the mean and the covariance matrix respectively.",
        "The vector quantization (VQ) codebook which consists of these mean vectors and covariance matrices, has been derived from a subset of the training data, therefore it is mostly characteristic of the location and distribution of the training data and the training microphone in the acoustic space.",
        "However if the codebook was created with data collected with some other microphone, due to the additive and convo-lutional effect on speech specific to this new microphone, the data would be distributed differently in the acoustic space and the ensemble of means and covariances of the codebook would reflect the characteristics of the new microphone.",
        "This is the case of the mismatch in training and testing microphone.",
        "Without any compensation, we quantize the test data, recorded with the new microphone, using the mixture codebook generated from recordings with the training microphone.",
        "This inevitably results in a degradation in performance, since the codebook does not model the test data.",
        "We introduce a new algorithm, called Tied Mixture Normalization (TMN) to compute the codebook transformation from the training microphone to the new test microphone.",
        "The TMN algorithm requires a relatively small amount of stereo speech adaptation data, recorded with the microphone used for training (primary microphone) and the new microphone (alternate microphone).",
        "Then using the stereo data, we can adapt the existing IIMM model to work well on the new test condition despite the mismatch with the training.",
        "Figure 1 provides a schematic description of the TMN algorithm.",
        "We assume that we have a tied-mixture densities codebook (set of Gaussians distributions), derived from a subset of the training data that was recorded with the primary microphone.",
        "We quantize the adaptation data from the primary channel and label each frame of speech with the index of the most likely Gaussian distribution in the tied-mixture codebook.",
        "Since there is an one-to-one correspondence between data of the primary and alternate channel we use the VQ indices of the frames of the data of the primary channel to label the corresponding frames of the data of the alternate channel.",
        "Then for each of the VQ clusters, from all the frames of the alternate microphone data with the same VQ label, we compute the sample mean and the sample covariance of the cepstrum vectors that represent a possible shift and scaling of this cluster in the acoustic",
        "The new Gaussian densities are used in conjunction with the mixture weights ck (sometimes called the discrete probabilities) of the original model to compute the observation probability density function as expressed previously.",
        "One of the possible weaknesses of the TMN algorithm is that each cluster of the original codebook is transformed independently of all the others.",
        "This assumption goes against our intuition that a codebook transformation, due to different microphone characteristics, should maintain continuity between adjacent codebook clusters and shift all the clusters in the same general direction.",
        "Additionally, a potential problem may arise when a particular cluster does not have enough samples to compute its statistics.",
        "Hence, we may not estimate the correct transformation due to insufficient or distorted data by modeling each codebook cluster independently.",
        "To alleviate this problem we use the following approach, originally suggested for speaker adaptation [4]: when the centroid of the ith codebook cluster is denoted by mi and that of the transformed alternate microphone by pi,",
        "the deviation vector between these two centroids is",
        "where C is the size of the codebook.",
        "For each cluster centroid c%, the deviation vectors of all clusters {di} are summed with weighting factors {wik } to produce the shift vector LXi:",
        "The weighting factor wik is the probability {P(mdmi )}a of centroid Mk of the original codebook to belong to the ith cluster raised to the a power.",
        "This weight is a measure of vicinity among clusters and the exponentiation controls the amount of smoothing between the clusters.",
        "Finally, the centroid Cfs of the ith cluster of the transformed codebook is:",
        "Similarly the covariances of the clusters of the new codebook are computed as the averaged summations over all sample covariances computed in the first implementation of TMN."

        "It addresses two different alternate microphones, the Audio-Technica 853a, a high quality directional, stand-mount microphone, and a standard telephone handset ( the AT&T 720 speaker phone).",
        "The adaptation and test database includes simultaneous recordings of high quality speech using the primary microphone (Sennheiser HMD-414 head-mounted microphone with noise canceling element) and speech recorded with each of the two alternate microphones.",
        "All of the experiments that will be described were performed using the BBN BYBLOS speech recognition system [3].",
        "The front end of the system computes steady-state, first and second-order derivative Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and energy features over an analysis range of 80 to 6000 Hz.",
        "Cepstrum mean subtraction is a standard feature of the system used to compensate for the unknown channel transfer function.",
        "In cepstrum mean subtraction we compute the sample mean of the cepstrum vector over the utterance, and then subtract this mean from the cepstrum vector at each frame.",
        "No distinction is made between speech and non-speech frames.",
        "The acoustic models are trained on 62 hours of speech (37000 sentences) from the WSJO and WSJ1 corpora, collected from 37 speakers, with the Sennheiser high quality close-talking microphone.",
        "The recognition is done using trigram language models.",
        "The test data comes from the development and evaluation sets of Spoke 6 of the WSJ1 corpus and consists of stereo recordings with the Sennheiser microphone and the Audio-Technica microphone or a telephone handset over external telephone lines.",
        "Adaptation data was supplied separately consisting of a total of 800 stereo recorded utterances from 10 speakers; 400 sentences recorded simultaneously with the Sennheiser and the Audio-Technica and 400 sentences recorded with the Sennheiser and the telephone handset.",

        "The telephone handset (TH) differs radically from the other two microphones, having the main characteristic of allowing a much narrower band of frequencies than the others.",

        "Furthermore bandlimiting is essential for the good performance of the system for telephone speech, as in all conditions reduces the error rate by a factor of 2.",

        "The results on the telephone handset were more dramatic as the error rate reduced from 29.3% to 12.5% using bandlimited phonetic models and TMN adaptation.",
        "We showed that bandlimited phonetic models are essential, as most of the degradation is due to the loss of information outside the narrow bandwidth of the telephone.",
        "The 12.5% word error rate is close to the error rate achieved using the primary microphone, which is considered the best performance the system can achieve for a microphone.",
        "However the overall good performance of the system of telephone speech may also be an artifact of the data collection procedure, as the speech was only sent over a local loop, there was no long distance calling for example, and the telephone handset did not vary, as the case would be in a conventional application."
