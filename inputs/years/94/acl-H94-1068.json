        "Hidden Markov Models (HMM's) have to date been accepted as an effective classification method for large vocabulary continuous speech recognition.",
        "Existing HMM-based recognition systems, e.g., SPHINX and DECIPHER, work best for \"highquality close-talking speech.\"",
        "They require consistency in sound capturing equipment and in acoustic environments between training and testing sessions.",
        "When testing conditions differ from training conditions, performance of these recognizers is typically degraded if they are not retrained to cope with new environmental effects.",
        "Retraining of HMM-based recognizers is complex and time-consuming.",
        "It requires recollection of a large amount of speech data under corresponding conditions and reestimation of HMM's parameters.",
        "Particularly great time and effort are needed to retrain a recognizer which operates in a speaker-independent mode, which is the mode of greatest general interest.",
        "Room reverberation and ambient noise also degrade performance of speech recognizers.",
        "The degradation becomes more prominent as the microphone is positioned more distant from the speaker, for instance, in a teleconferencing application.",
        "Previous work has demonstrated that beamforming/matched-filter microphone arrays can provide higher signal-to-noise ratios than can conventional microphones used at distances (see, e.g., [1, 2]).",
        "Consequently, there is increasing interest in microphone arrays for hands-free operation of speech processing systems [3]-[7].",
        "In this report, a system of microphone arrays and neural networks is described which expands the power and advantages of existing ARPA speech recognizers to practical acoustic environments where users need not be encumbered by hand-held or body-worn microphone systems.",
        "(Examples include Combat Information Centers, large group conferences, and mobile hands-busy eyes-busy maintenance tasks.)",
        "Another advantage of the system is that the speech recognizer need not be retrained for each particular application environment.",
        "Through neural network computing, the system learns and compensates for environmental interference.",
        "The neural network transforms speech-feature data (such as cepstrum coefficients) obtained from a distant-talking microphone array to those corresponding to a high-quality, close-talking microphone.",
        "The performance of the speech recognizer can thereby be elevated in the hostile acoustic environment without retraining of the recognizer.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "First, a new speech corpus with simultaneous recording from different microphones is described in Section 2.",
        "Next, the system of microphone arrays and neural networks is discussed in Section 3.",
        "The system is evaluated using both the SPHINX speech recognizer and a Dynamic-Time-Warping (DTW) based recognizer.",
        "The results are presented in Sections 4 and 5, respectively.",
        "In Section 6, performance comparisons are made of different network architectures to identify an optimal design for room-acoustic equalization.",
        "Finally, we summarize the study and discuss our future work in Section 7."
