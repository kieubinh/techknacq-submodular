        "In ad hoc Information Retrieval (IR) one employs a user-supplied free-text query as a clue to match against a textbase and rank documents for retrieval.",
        "In a routing environment, one has the additional option to consult a user need's history to obtain a set of previously judged documents.",
        "This set may be used with an automatic learning algorithm to help refine or augment the user-supplied free-text query, or even to define the query without the user description.",
        "We focus on employing the judged relevant set in this paper.",
        "(Judged nonrelevant documents have not been found to be useful in our model.)",
        "For this option, one needs to consider two separate processes:",
        "(1) selecting the appropriate relevant documents or portions of them for training; and (2) selecting the appropriate terms from these documents, expand the query and then effectively weighting these terms for the query.",
        "It is well-known from TREC and other experiments [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] that process (2) can improve routing results substantially.",
        "However, process (1) is normally not given much consideration.",
        "One either uses all the relevant documents, or employs the best n of them after ranking with respect to the query under consideration.",
        "However, over time in a large scale environment, hundreds and thousands of such relevant documents may accumulate for each user need.",
        "A strategy of which and what parts of the relevant documents are to be employed for training needs to be considered.",
        "Would portions of relevant documents be sufficient?",
        "One reason for using a portion is that many documents can be long and may contain extraneous paragraphs and sections that are irrelevant.",
        "Using them for learning may contribute ambiguities during the term selection, query expansion and weighting processes.",
        "The problem is that current relevance information gathering is for whole documents only, and not at a more specific level such as which sentence or paragraph that is relevant.",
        "This problem would be alleviated if users are diligent and indicate the relevant components of a document that are actually relevant.",
        "However, this could be a burden that some users may want to avoid.",
        "It is therefore useful to have an algorithm to locate the most useful relevant components for training purposes.",
        "Another reason to use only portions of the relevants is consideration of efficiency: one would like to avoid processing long documents when most of it is irrelevant, or decrease the number of documents to be processed.",
        "This investigation concerns exploring ways to effectively choose a subset of documents for training a given set of routing queries."

        "This approach may impact favorably on: 1) precision because shorter, more local units may diminish chance occurrence of terms used in senses different from what is intended; 2) term weighting because unrealistic probability estimates of term weights may be avoided; 3) query training and expansion because long documents may have unrelated and irrelevant topics and concepts that can add noise to these operations; 4) retrieval output display because one can narrow down to the relevant portion of a long document for the user; and 5) general efficiency because of handling multiple, more uniform subdocuments instead of one long document.",

        "For testing our various strategies of subdocument selection for training, we performed experiments exactly as those of TREC2 routing: Topics 51-100 retrieving on the 1 GB of documents on Disk3 of the TREC collection.",
        "Topics 51-100 have relevant document information from Disk 1&2 totaling 2 GB.",
        "There are altogether 16400 relevant documents averaging out to 328 per query.",
        "During our processing however, a small percentage of the relevants are lost, so that we in effect use only 16114 relevants that get segmented into 57751 subdocuments.",
        "This averages to about 1155 units per query.",
        "For the ranking strategies of Section 3.2, we have created a separate subcollection consisting only of the 57751 training relevants but using Disk 1&2 term statistics, and ranking for the first 2000 of each query is done.",
        "Various subsets of these ranked training documents are then used for weight learning for the query-term side of the network, with term expansion level K=40 terms as the standard.",
        "For some cases we also did term expansion of K=80.",
        "After freezing these trained edge weights, Disk3 subdocuments are linked in and routing retrievals are done.",
        "Results using the 'total number of relevants retrieved' (at 1000 retrieved cutoff) and 'average precision over all recall points' as measures of effectiveness, as well as the number of training units used, are summarized in Table 1.",
        "Some of the detailed precision-recall values are given in Table 2.",
        "The overall conclusion from these results is that for this TREC-2 routing experiment, where a large number of relevant documents of different sizes and quality is available, it is possible to define good subsets of the documents or portions of them for training.",
        "From Table 1 and using the average precision (av-p) measure for comparison, it appears that the simple strategy (b) of just using short, 'nonbreak' max=1 relevant documents gives one of the best results, achieving av-p at K=40 expansion level of 0.4050, about 6.7% better than the 0.3795 of our baseline strategy (a) which uses all the relevant units.",
        "Moreover it is very efficient, requiring only 5235 units which is less than 10% of the total 57751 relevant subdocuments available and about 1/3 of the 16114 documents.",
        "Using longer documents that break into two and six units (max=2 and 6) successively leads to slightly worse results as well as more work (15103 and 32312 subdocuments).",
        "Thus, it appears that longer documents carry with it more noise as discussed in the Introduction.",
        "Just using the first subdocument of every relevant (c) performs quite well, with av-p of 0.4001.",
        "Since the FR collection has many documents of thousands of words long, it is difficult to imagine that signal parts are all in the first subdocuments.",
        "A casual scan however shows that some FR documents, such as FR88107-0009 and FR88119-0018, carry a summary at the beginning.",
        "Moreover, FR documents constitute only a minority of the training relevants.",
        "Thus the first subdocuments apparently carry sufficient signals of documents for training in this experiment.",
        "Last subdocuments (results not shown) do not perform as well as first.",

        "For bestnx=30, employing only 1500 subdocuments apparently is not sufficient, and training may be limited to subdocuments resembling the original query.",
        "bestnx=100 uses 4945 units similar to max=1 but with av-p about 1.5% worse, while bestnx=300 uses 13712 which is slightly less than first and performs about the same.",
        "In general, bestn results (not shown) are slightly less than those of bestnx as expected.",
        "Using the topnx=1 subdocument of every relevant (t) achieves 0.4082, the best numerically.",
        "In (f) we have less than 16114 units for training because we only rank the top 2000 for each query, and so some subdocuments ranking below 2000 are not accounted for.",
        "It appears that including other overall relevants can help improve performance.",
        "Strategies (g,h) of combining sets of subdocuments do not seem to lead to more improved results.",
        "Using the relevants retrieved (r-r) as a measure, it appears that larger training set sizes between 10000 to 16000 are needed to achieve good recall.",
        "For example, max=1 and bestnx=100 employs about 5000 units for training and have r-r of 7646 and 7605. bestnx=300, max=2, first and topnx=1 have r-r values of 7703, 7783, 7805 and 7833, and training set sizes of: 13712, 15103, 16114 and 15702. fmax=2 achieves good r-r of 7827 with a training size of 10169. fmax=3 (results not shown) is inferior.",
        "For this collection, the best strategies of selecting subdocuments for training appears to be either fmax=2 with av-p/r-r values of 0.4047/7827 or topnx=1 with 0.4082/7833.",
        "fmax=2 has the advantage that a ranking is not done and the training set is smaller.",
        "The detailed recall-precision values in Table 3 also shows that finax=2 gives better precision at the low recall region.",
        "It appears that using document properties to select training documents in this routing experiment is both effective and efficient."
