        "The research described in this paper is part of a larger ongoing project called the KUDZU (Knowledge Under Development from Zero Understanding) project.",
        "This project is",
        "aimed at exploring the automation of extraction of information from technical texts.",
        "The KUDZU system has two primary components – an NLP component, and a Knowledge Analysis (KA) component.",
        "This section describes this system in order to facilitate understanding of the approach described in this paper.",
        "The NLP component consists of a tagger, a semi-parser, a prepositional phrase attachment specialist, a conjunct identifier for coordinate conjunctions, and a restructures.",
        "The tagger is an n-gram based program that currently generates syntactic/semantic tags for the words in the corpus.",
        "The syntactic portion of the tag is mandatory and the semantic portion depends upon whether the word has any special domain-specific classification or not.",
        "Currently only nouns, gerunds, and adjectives are assigned semantic tags.",
        "For example, in the domain of veterinary medicine, \"dog\" would be assigned the tag \"noun – patient,\" \"nasal\" would be \"adj – body-part,\" etc.",
        "The parsing strategy is based on the initial identification of simple phrases, which are later converted to deeper structures with the help of separate specialist programs for coordinate conjunct identification and prepositional phrase attachment.",
        "The result for a given sentence is a single parse, many of whose dements are comparatively underspecified.",
        "For example, the parses generated lack clause boundaries.",
        "Nevertheless, the results axe surprisingly useful in the extraction of relationships from the corpus.",
        "The semi-parser recognizes noun-, verb-, prepositional-, gerund-, infinitive-, and adjectival-phrases.",
        "The prepositional phrase attachment specialist [2] uses case grammar analysis to disambiguate the attachments of prepositional phrases and is highly domain-dependent.",
        "The current implementation of this subcomponent is highly specific to the domain of veterinary medicine, the initial testbed for the KUDZU system.",
        "Note that all the examples presented in this paper will be taken from this domain.",
        "The coordinate conjunction specialist identifies pairs of appropriate conjuncts for the coordinate conjunctions in the text and is domain-independent in nature [1].",
        "The restructurer puts together the information acquired by the specialist programs in order to provide a better (and deeper) structure to the parse.",
        "Before being passed to the knowledge analysis portion of the system, some parses undergo manual modification, which is",
        "facilitated by the help of an editing tool especially written for this purpose.",
        "A large percentage of the modifications can be attributed to the limitation of the conjunct identifier in recognizing only pairs of conjuncts, as opposed to all conjuncts of coordinate conjunctions.",
        "The KA component receives appropriate parses from the NLP component and uses them to populate an object-oriented knowledge base [4].",
        "The nature of the knowledge base created is dependent on a domain schema which specifies the concept hierarchy and the relationships of interest in the domain.",
        "Examples of the concept hierarchy specifications and relationships present in the domain schema are given in Figure 1.",
        "Many such relationships may be defined in the domain schema.",
        "While processing a sentence, the KA component hypothesizes the types of relationships that may be present in it.",
        "However, before the actual relationship is instantiated, objects corresponding to the mandatory slots must be found, either directly or by the help of an algorithm that resolves indirect and implied references.",
        "If objects corresponding to the optional slots are found, then they are also filled in.",
        "Currently, the domain schema has to be generated manually after a careful evaluation of the domain.",
        "This is a time-consuming process that often requires the help of a domain expert.",
        "Once the schema has been specified, the rest of the KA component is domain independent [4], with the exception of a domain-specific synonym table.",
        "For each sentence that is processed by the KA component, a set of semantic relationships that were found in the sentence is produced.",
        "An interface to the KA component allows users to navigate through all instances of the different relationships that have been acquired from the corpus.",
        "Two sample sentences from the veterinary medicine domain, their parsed output and the relations extracted from them are shown in Figure 2."

        "The automatic acquisition of semantic features of a domain is an important issue, since it assists portability by reducing the amount of human intervention.",
        "In the context of the KUDZU system in particular, it is desired that the system be moved from the domain of veterinary medicine to that of physical chemistry.",
        "As explained above, certain components of the system are domain-dependent and have to be significantly modified before the system can be used for a new domain.",
        "The current research aims to use the acquired semantic features in order to improve the portability of the KUDZU system.",
        "It is important to note that although the initial motivation for this research came from the need to move the KUDZU system to a new domain, the underlying techniques are generic and can be used in a variety of applications.",
        "The primary goal is to acquire the semantic features of the domain with minimal human intervention, and ensure that these features can be applied to different systems rather easily.",
        "In this research, two main types of semantic features are of interest – a concept hierarchy for the domain, and lexico-semantic patterns present in the domain.",
        "These patterns are similar to what are also known as \"selectional constraints\" or \"selectional patterns\" [6, 5] in systems which use them primarily to determine the correct parse from a large number of parses generated by a broad coverage grammar.",
        "They are basically co-occurrence patterns between meaningful' nouns, gerunds, adjectives, and verbs.",
        "For example, \"DISORDER of BODY-PART\", \"MEDICATION can be used to TREAT-VERB PA-TIENT\", etc.",
        "are legitimate lexico-semantic patterns from the veterinary medicine domain.",

        "Algorithmically identify the explicit semantic clusters that may exist in the current domain.",
        "Apply the clustering algorithm separately to nouns, gerunds, adjectives, and verbs.",
        "3.",
        "Use the syntactic tags and semantic classes to automate the identification of lexico-semantic patterns that exist in the given domain.",
        "This basic methodology is similar to some other approaches adopted in the past [8, 6].",
        "However, some important differences exist which will be discussed later.",
        "Once the semantic features have been obtained, they can be used in a variety of ways depending upon the needs of the NLP system.",
        "They can be helpful in improving the portability of an NLP system by providing useful semantic information that may be needed by different components of the system.",
        "In the KUDZU system, these features will be used to improve the success rate of a domain-independent syntactically based prepositional phrase attachment specialist, and for automatic acquisition of the domain schema.",

        "ful in the attachment of prepositional phrases.",
        "All patterns that have some preposition embedded within them will essentially provide selections' constraints for the classes of words that may appear in the object and host slots.",
        "These patterns will be used to improve the success rate of a domain-independent syntactically based prepositional phrase attachment specialist.",
        "There is ample evidence [10, 15] that semantic categories and collocational patterns can be used effectively to assist in the process of prepositional phrase attachment.",
        "These semantic features will also be used to automatically generate the domain schema for any given domain.",
        "Figure 1 contains examples of the semantic class hierarchy and the relationships of interest, as defined in the domain schema.",
        "The former may be acquired from the semantic clustering process.",
        "The specification of the relationships can be achieved with the help of the weighted lexico-semantic patterns.",
        "Some of the relationships can be acquired by an automated comparison of all patterns involving a given semantic verb class.",
        "Other relationships may be determined by comparing other patterns with common noun and gerund semantic classes.",

        "The only human intervention required at the present stage is for the assignment of class identifiers to the generated classes.",
        "In fact, a human is shown small sub-clusters (each with 8-10 objects) of the generated hierarchy, and is asked to label these sub-clusters with a semantic label, if possible.",
        "Note that not all such sub-clusters should have semantic labels – several nouns in the corpus are generic nouns that cannot be classified into any semantic class.",
        "However, a majority of the sub-clusters should represent the semantic classes that exist in the domain.",

        "The patterns are weighted on the basis of their frequency of occurrence, with the more frequent patterns getting higher weights.",
        "It seems reasonable to assume that if lexico-semantic patterns were already known to the system, the identification of semantic categories would become easier and vice-versa.",

        "As has been shown before [8, 6, 14], such patterns place constraints on the semantic classes of words appearing in particular contexts.",
        "The set of selected patterns can, therefore, be used to reanalyse the corpus in order to recognise the incorrectly clustered words in the previously generated class hierarchy and to suggest the correct class for these words.",
        "For example, if the word \"penicillin\" is incorrectly clustered as a DISORDER, an analysis of the corpus will show that it appears most frequently as a MEDICATION in patterns like \"TREAT-VERB DISORDER with MEDICATION\", \"MEDICATION can be used to TREAT-VERB PATIENT\", etc.",
        "and rarely as a DISORDER in the DISORDER patterns.",
        "Hence, its semantic category can be guessed to be MEDICATION.",
        "This guess is added to the list of attributes for the words, and semantic clustering is performed again.",
        "This iterative mechanism assists clustering in two ways – firstly, the additional attribute helps convergence towards better clusters and secondly, the tentative semantic classes from the ith iteration can be used to generate values for attributes for the (i 1)°' iterations, thus reducing the sparsity of data.",
