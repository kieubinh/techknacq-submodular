        "The N-Best Paradigm [1] was introduced originally as a means for integrating the speech recognition and language understanding components of a spoken language system.",
        "Since then, we have generalized its use for integrating into the recognition search other expensive knowledge sources (such as higher-order n-gram language models, between-word co-articulation models, and segmental models) without increasing the search space [2].",
        "The basic idea is that we use inexpensive knowledge sources to find N alternative sentence hypotheses.",
        "Then we rescore each of these hypotheses with the more expensive and more accurate knowledge sources in order to determine the most likely utterance.",
        "The N-Best Paradigm specifically, and multi-pass search algorithms in general, are now used widely by the speech recognition research community.",
        "Besides its use as an efficient search strategy, the N-Best Paradigm has been used extensively in several other ways [2].",
        "Its simplicity has made it ideal as a means for cooperation between research sites.",
        "For example, we regularly send the N-Best lists of alternatives to research sites that do not have an advanced speech recognition capability (e.g., Paramax and NYU) in order that they can apply their own linguistic components for understanding or for research into alternative language modeling techniques.",
        "Another related use of the N-Best lists is for evaluation of alternative knowledge sources.",
        "New knowledge sources can be evaluated without having to integrate them into the search strategy.",
        "For example, we can determine whether a new prosodic module or linguistic knowledge source reduces the error rate when used to reorder the N-Best list.",
        "This is particularly important for knowledge sources that are not easily formulated in a left-to-right incremental manner.",
        "Finally, we have presented techniques for optimizing the weights for different knowledge sources, and for discriminative training [2].",
        "In this paper we attempt to determine whether the N-Best Paradigm results in substantial search errors.",
        "If it does, then its use for the other purposes mentioned above would also be questionable.",
        "First we describe briefly how we used the N-Best paradigm in previous versions of BYBLOS.",
        "Then, we describe our attempts to avoid the errors that might be a result of using the N-Best paradigm.",
        "Finally, we argue that there will always be cases where the N-Best paradigm will make it possible to use some knowledge sources that would likely never be used otherwise."

        "The BYBLOS system has been described previously (e.g., [3]).",
        "We reiterate here the use of the N-Best Paradigm in that system.",
        "The decoder used a 3-pass search strategy.",
        "The strategy used a forward pass followed by a backward Word-Dependent N-Best search algorithm [4] using a bigram language model, within-word triphone models, and top-1 (discrete VQ) densities.",
        "The N-Best hypotheses were then rescored using crossword triphone context models, top-5 mixture densities, and trigram language model.",
        "Typically, the backward Word-Dependent N-Best pass requires about half the time required by the forward pass.",
        "Rescoring each alternative sentence hypothesis individually with crossword triphone models only requires about 0.2 seconds per hypothesis.",
        "And rescoring the text of the hypotheses with a high-order n-gram language model [5] requires essentially no time."

      "text": [
        "It has often been asserted that the N-Best paradigm is inadmissible because when the initial N-Best list is created using weaker knowledge sources, then the answer that would have had the highest score using the stronger knowledge sources might not be within the list of alternatives, and therefore never have a chance to be rescored.",
        "This would be especially likely when the error rate is high and the utterances",
        "are long, since the number of alternative sentences needed to include the correct answer would grow exponentially with the length of the utterance.",
        "The knowledge sources (e.g., crossword triphones and trigram language models) used for rescoring in the 3-Pass N-Best strategy described above were much more powerful than the original knowledge sources (e.g, within-word triphones and bigram language models) in that they frequently reduced the error rate by half.",
        "However, we had assured ourselves that, at least for moderate-size problems (like ATIS with 2,000 words or WSJ with 5,000 words), there were few if any additional errors caused by the correct answer not being included in the N-Best list.",
        "However, after the November 1992 DARPA Continuous Speech Recognition (CSR) evaluations, we were concerned that we might be losing some performance as a result of our use of the 3-Pass N-Best strategy (rescoring with crossword triphones, top-5 mixture densities, and trigram language models) on the 20,000 words WSJ test.",
        "This was because there were many sentences for which the correct answer was not in the N-Best hypotheses although it had a higher total score (when including the trigram language model and crossword triphones) than any sentence hypothesis in the N-Best list.",
        "We felt that this was due to the higher word error rate that resulted from recognition with a large vocabulary of 20,000 words, and the long utterances found in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus.",
        "Therefore, this year we implemented a more complicated search strategy similar to the Progressive-Search strategy suggested by Murveit [6] in which we use the initial passes to create a lattice of alternative hypotheses, which can then be rescored.",
        "The advantage of this approach is that a lattice with a small number of alternatives at each point can represent a very large number of alternative sentence hypotheses.",
        "In addition, rescoring the lattice of alternatives is computationally less expensive than rescoring a large explicit list of sentence alternatives.",
        "This also avoids the rather large intermediate storage required to store the N-Best hypotheses."

        "That is if a 01 Pr(wilwi) 4, > A where Pr(wi lwa) is the probability of wi followed by and A is the threshold (which can be a function of either a or 13).",

        "Having found a word-pair, we look for the next word-juncture where this second word is the first word of the next pair.",

        "If the range of beginning and ending times for a single word overlap, then we create a loop for that word.",
        "The word lattice (which is really just a small finite-state language model) is then expanded to allow for maintaining separate scores for trigram language models and crossword triphones.",
        "This entails copying each word in the context of each preceding word, and replacing the triphones on either side of the word junctures with the appropriate crossword triphones.",
        "Thus, each word in the lattice represents a particular instance of that word in the context of some particular other word.",
        "The transition probabilities in the lattice are the probability of the next word given the previous two words – trigram probabilities.",

        "We performed an experiment in which we compared the recognition accuracy of this 4-Pass Lattice approach with the previous 3-Pass N-Best approach.",
        "In both cases, the initial search (in order to create the lattice or to find the N-Best sentence hypotheses) used only a bigram language model and within-word coarticulation models with topl-VQ discrete densities, while the final search (on the lattice) or rescoring (the N-Best) used a trigram language model and between-word coarticulation models with top-5 mixture densities.",
        "Initially, we were surprised to find that the accuracy using the lattice was actually slightly worse than that of the original N-Best method.",
        "Then, we realized that this was due to the larger number of alternatives.",
        "A lattice with an average depth (the average number of branches out of a word-end node) of 10 for a sentence of 20 words can be thought of as an N-Best list with 102° hypotheses.",
        "When we had previously found that, in the 3-Pass N-Best approach, the correct utterance might have a higher score than the answers in the top 100 best hypotheses, there were also countless other incorrect hypotheses, in the 4-Pass Lattice approach, that also had higher scores than the answers in the original N-Best.",
        "The search on the lattice often found one of these other incorrect answers.",
        "We alleviated this problem by optimizing (automatically) the weights (for trigram language model, word insertion penalty and phone insertion penalty) using the N-Best alternative hypotheses found after the lattice search.",
        "These new weights were then used to search the lattice again.",
        "Finally, we were able to obtain 5% fewer word errors using the 4-Pass Lattice strategy than when using the 3-Pass N-Best approach.",
        "This was a much smaller reduction in error than we had hoped for.",
        "Apparently the reduced search errors were largely offset by the larger search space on the lattice.",
        "It would appear, therefore, that the doom and gloom predictions for N-Best are unfounded so far, at least for the 20,000 WSJ task.",

        "While this model could have been integrated directly, it was much easier and faster to simply rescore the N-Best hypotheses with this larger model.",
