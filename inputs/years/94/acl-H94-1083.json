        "Mission complexity has increased tremendously as instrumentation and scientific objectives have become more sophisticated.",
        "Recent developments in robotics and machine intelligence have led to striking changes in the way systems are monitored, controlled, and operated[1].",
        "In the past, individual subsystems were managed by operators in complete supervisory and directing mode.",
        "Now the decision speed and complexity of many aerospace systems call for a new approach based on advanced computer and software technology.",
        "In this context, the importance of the human computer interface cannot be underestimated.",
        "Astronauts will come to depend on the system interface for all aspects of space life including the control of the onboard environment and life support system, the conduct of experiments, the communication among the crew and with the ground, and the execution of emergency procedures.",
        "One of the technology sought to help solve the human interface challenge in space is voice processing.",
        "Though Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and other forms of advanced voice I/O techniques have only recently been experimented with simple avionic systems, much remains to be done to meet the ergonomic characteristics of the unique operational environment found in space.",
        "This paper presents the particularities of operator-computer interaction in space.",
        "As examples, the current environment of the Space Shuttle System is described and projected requirements for the international Space Station are examined.",
        "The paper also outlines the potential for voice control applications inside spacecraft and suggest methods of integrating spoken-language interfaces onto operational space systems."

        "Space travel not only generates significant levels of stress in the human organism, but transforms the entire operational conditions.",

        "• Reliability/Accuracy/Redundancy: high tolerance to failure is a condition to safety.",
        "Operative systems in space must be at least two fault-tolerant, if not more in the case of critical systems such as flight controls or environmental control and life support systems (ECLSS).",
        "Where applicable, error correction mechanisms must be implemented.",
        "• Accessibility: the crew's ability to execute tasks safely and efficiently is notably improved if controls are ergonomically placed, clearly marked, and readily available[3].",
        "Indirect accessibility is also crucial, particularly where overriding of automated functions is required.",
        "• Feedback: in difficult operational environments such as micro-gravity, precise system feedback becomes essential.",
        "Through visual, auditive and tactile means, feedback reinforces security procedures and lessen the monitoring workload, particularly for telerobotic tasks which must be performed with extreme caution.",
        "On the shuttle, for example, robot arm operations are executed by two astronauts, one manipulating the robot and the other assisting with secondary functions, camera controls and status displays.",
        "Visual feedback, if not precisely obtained from camera views, is directly available from the four windows of the Shuttle's flight deck.",
        "On Space Station, direct visual feedback will only be available on rare occasions and thus other means of feedback will have to be developed and integrated with the HCI of the robotics control workstation to provide camera redundancy.",
        "• Commonality: system configuration consistent in type and quality for crew operations enhance efficacy and lowers training demands.",
        "Operating Space Station with an international crew, in particular, will necessitate very high commonality of functions to ensure safety."
