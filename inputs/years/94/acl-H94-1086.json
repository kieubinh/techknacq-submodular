        "The segmentation of written words into component characters is often the first step of handwriting recognition systems [1].",
        "In some cases, segmentation is forced on the user by providing boxes for the writing of discrete letters.",
        "However, in modern continuous speech recognition efforts, segmentation of phonemes is not performed before either of the training or the recognition steps.",
        "Instead, segmentation occurs simultaneously with recognition.",
        "If such a system could be adapted for handwriting, the very difficult and time consuming issue of segmentation could be avoided.",
        "This paper addresses such a system, where automatic recognition of on-line cursive handwriting is achieved by the use of continuous speech recognition methods.",
        "In this context, on-line refers to the situation where the time sequence of samples comprising the script is known (as with pen computers).",
        "The recognition of the on-line handwriting is performed through the use of hidden Markov models and statistical grammars in a manner very similar to several modern speech recognizers.",
        "In fact, we show that, with essentially no modification, a speech recognition system can perform accurate on-line handwriting recognition with the input features being those of writing instead of speech.",
        "Hidden Markov models have intrinsic properties which make them very attractive for handwriting recognition.",
        "For training, all that is necessary is a data stream and its transcription (the text matching the handwriting).",
        "The training process automatically aligns the components of the transcription to the data.",
        "Thus, no special effort is needed to label training data.",
        "Segmentation, in the traditional sense, is avoided altogether.",
        "Recognition is performed on another data stream.",
        "Again, no explicit segmentation is necessary.",
        "The segmen-tcultently with the MIT Media Lab.",
        "tation of words into characters or even sentences into words occurs naturally by incorporating the use of a lexicon and a language model into the recognition process.",
        "The result is a text stream that can be compared to a reference text for error calculation.",
        "Section 2 discusses the similarities of speech and handwriting recognition tasks and provides some background on technique.",
        "Section 3 describes an initial 3050 word, 52 symbol, writer dependent experiment.",
        "Section 4 discusses a more ambitious 25,595 word, 86 symbol, writer dependent system involving multiple writers.",
        "Section 5 examines experimental results and discusses future work."

      "text": [
        "On-line handwriting and continuous speech share many common characteristics.",
        "On-line handwriting can be viewed as a signal (x,y coordinates) over time, just like in speech.",
        "The items to be recognized are well-defined (usually the alphanumeric characters) and finite in number, as are the phonemes in speech.",
        "The shape of a handwritten character depends on its neighbors.",
        "Correspondingly, spoken phonemes change due to coarticulation in speech.",
        "In both cases, these basic units form words and the words form phrases.",
        "Thus, language modeling can be applied to improve recognition performance for both problems.",
        "In spite of the above similarities, handwriting recognition has some basic differences to speech recognition.",
        "Unlike continuous speech, word boundaries are usually distinct in handwriting.",
        "Thus, words should be easier to distinguish.",
        "However, in cursive writing the dots and crosses involved in the characters \"i\", \"j\", \"x\", and \"t\" are not added until after the whole word is written.",
        "Thus, all the evidence for a character may not be contiguous.",
        "Additionally, in words with multiple crossings (\"t\" and \"x\") and/or dottings (\"i\" and \"j\") the order of pen strokes is ambiguous.",
        "Even so, with the many parallels between on-line writing and speech, speech recognition methods should be applicable to on-line handwriting recognition.",
        "Since hidden Markov models currently constitute the state of the art in speech recognition, this method also seems a likely candidate for handwriting recognition.",
        "There has been some interest in the use of HMMs for on-line handwriting recognition (see, for example, [2, 3]).",
        "However, the few studies that have used HMMs have dealt with small vocabularies, isolated characters, or isolated words.",
        "In this study, our objective is to deal with continuous cursive handwriting and large vocabularies (thousands of words) using a speech recognition system and language models."

      "text": [
        "In the initial system, the BBN BYBLOS Continuous Speech Recognition system [4, 5, 6] (see Figure 1) was used without modification on an on-line cursive handwriting corpus created from prompts from the ARPA Airline Travel Information Service (ATIS) corpus [7].",
        "These full sentence prompts (approximately 10 words per sentence) were written by a single subject.",
        "These sentences were then reviewed (verified) to make sure that the prompts were transcribed correctly.",
        "After verification, these sentences were separated into a set of 381 training sentences and a mutually exclusive set of 94 test sentences.",
        "The lexicon for this task consisted of 3050 words, where lowercase and capitalized versions of a word are considered distinct.",
        "For this initial system there were 54 characters: 52 lower and upper case alphabetic, a space character, and a \"backspace\" character.",
        "The backspace character is appended onto words that contain \"i\", \"j\", \"x\", or \"t\".",
        "This character models the space the pen moves after finishing the body of the word to add the dot or the cross when drawing one of these characters.",
        "The data was acquired using a Momenta pentop which stored the script in a simple time series of x and y coordinates at a sampling rate of 66 Hz.",
        "The handwriting data is sampled continuously in time, except when the pen is lifted (Momenta pentops provide no information about pen movement between strokes).",
        "Because we wanted to use our speech recognition system with no modification, we decided to simulate a continuous-time feature vector by arbitrarily connecting the samples from pen-up to pen-down with a straight line and then sampling that line ten times.",
        "Thus, the data effectively became one long criss-crossing stroke for the entire sentence, where words run together and \"i\" and \"j\" dots and \"t\" and \"x\" crosses cause backtracing over previously drawn script (see Figure 2).",
        "an= en-0 a-1",
        "For each sample point, an analysis program computed a two-element feature vector: the writing angle at that sample and the change in the writing angle [2] (see Figure 3).",
        "These time series of feature vectors were then fed into the BYBLOS system.",
        "For this task, BYBLOS quantizes the feature vectors for a sentence into 64 different clusters.",
        "These new time series are then used with their respective sentence transcriptions to train HMMs representing the script characters (note that the alignment of the clusters with the sentence transcriptions occurs automatically in this process).",
        "A 7-state HMM model was chosen to represent each symbol (see Figure 4).",
        "Since the penning of a script letter often differs depending on the letters written before and after it, additional HMMs are used to model these contextual effects [8].",
        "Adjacent effects between two letters (bilets) are modeled as well as three letter (trilet) contexts.",
        "In a given set of sentences there may be many trilets, up to the number of symbols cubed.",
        "However, in English only a subset of these are allowed.",
        "In the ATIS task there are 3639 different trilets in the training sentences.",
        "A statistical grammar can also be used to improve recognition performance.",
        "For this experiment, a bigram grammar (to relate pairs of words) was created using a larger set of 17209 sentences from the ATIS corpus (the 94 test sentences were not included).",
        "The resultant grammar has a perplexity of 20.",
        "Table 1 shows the word error rates for this task when doing recognition using context without the grammar (perplexity = 3050), using the grammar without context, and using both context and the grammar.",

        "When the grammar was added and context not used, the error rate dropped to 2.2%.",

        "The prompts from the Wall Street Journal consist mainly of full sentences with scattered article headings and stock listings (all are referred to as sentences for convenience).",
        "We have thus far collected over 7000 sentences (175,000 words total or about 25 words/sentence) from 21 writers on two GRiD Convertible pentops.",

        "Several non-native writers were included (writers whose first working language was not English).",
        "While the handwriting input was constrained, the rules given the subjects were simple: write the given sentence in cursive; keep the body of a word connected (do not lift the pen in the middle of a word); and do crossings and dottings after completing the body of a word.",
        "However, since many writers could not remember how to write capital letters in cursive, great leniency was allowed.",

        "Even with all insertion errors added to the estimate of the alphabetic error, the error rates for numerals and symbols are still significantly higher.",

        "be to specifically train on common digit strings such as \"1989\", \"80286\", and \"747\" (presently, \"1989\" is recognized as four separate words instead of the more salient whole).",
        "Symbol recognition may be further improved by tuning the minimum stroke length in preprocessing.",
        "If the minimum stroke length is too small, a period or comma may be completely ignored due to too few samples comprising the symbol.",
        "However, if the minimum stroke length is too large, insertion errors may occur.",
        "A better solution would allow a varying number of states for different letter models.",
        "Thus, complicated letters like \"G\" would be given 7 to 11 states while a period (or letter dotting) would be given 3.",
        "This method may improve all classes of recognition.",
        "Another known improvement deals with apostrophes.",
        "Presently, apostrophes are handled incorrectly by expecting only the intra-word stroke version.",
        "By expecting both standard stroke orders in words with apostrophes, the system can increase the recognition accuracy of these words significantly.",
        "By fixing these problems and using BYBLOS's optimizing features, a 10-50% reduction in word error rate may occur.",
        "In this experiment we used a large number of training sentences per writer.",
        "Supplying such a large amount of training text may be tiring for just one writer.",
        "However, there is some evidence that not as many training sentences per writer are needed for good performance.",
        "Furthermore, if good word error rates for the cursive dictation task can be assured, a writer may be willing to spend some time writing sample sentences.",
        "A possible compromise is to create a writer independent sytem which can then be adapted to a particular writer with a few sample sentences.",
        "With this level of training it may be possible to relax the few restrictions made on the writers in this experiment.",
        "However, a more robust feature set may be necessary for creating the writer independent system.",
        "A practical issue in handwriting recognition is the speed of the recognizer.",
        "Approximately 20 seconds per word are required for recognition in the present experimental system.",
        "However, we suspect that real-time performance is attainable by increasing the efficiency of the code and porting the decoder to a more powerful hardware platform.",
        "Future experiments will be directed at further reduction of the error rates for the writer dependent task.",
        "More writers may also be incorporated into the test.",
        "In addition, writer independent and writer adaptive systems may be attempted.",
        "Scalability of the number of training sentences will be addressed along with possible changes to the BYBLOS system to better accomodate handwriting.",
