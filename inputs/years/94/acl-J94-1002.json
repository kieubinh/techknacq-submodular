        "Prosodic phrase structure plays a role in both naturalness and intelligibility of speech.",
        "For example, prosodic phrase boundaries break the flow of a sentence, dividing it into smaller units for easier processing.",
        "In addition, researchers have shown that prosodic phrase break placement is important in syntactic disambiguation (Lehiste 1973; Price, Ostendorf, Shattuck-Hufnagel, and Fong 1991).",
        "For these reasons, computational modeling of prosodic phrases is important both for text-to-speech synthesis and speech understanding applications.",
        "In this work, we present a computational model that represents a hierarchy of prosodic constituents using a stochastic formalism to capture the natural variability allowable in prosodic phrasing.",
        "The model is useful for both analysis and synthesis applications; we focus on synthesis here, and present experimental results for predicting prosodic phrase structure from text.",
        "Prosodic phrase structure, or groupings of words in a sentence, can be equivalently represented by different phrase break markers.",
        "The location and relative size of these breaks define the prosodic phrase structure, which we will refer to here as a prosodic parse.",
        "Prosodic phrase breaks are discrete events that are associated with acoustic cues such as duration lengthening, pause insertion, and intonation markers.",
        "In this work, we are concerned only with the relationship between the abstract events (different levels of phrase breaks) and text.",
        "To be useful in synthesis or understanding applications, the results presented here need to be integrated with a component that models the acoustics associated with these abstract events (see, for example, Hirose and Fujisaki 1982).",
        "Several observations about prosodic phrase breaks raise issues to be considered in designing an algorithm to predict such breaks from text.",
        "First, there is a significant body of literature in linguistics concerning various hierarchies that specify the relationship among prosodic constituents, and the model should reflect this structure.",
        "Second, several different prosodic parses may all be acceptable for one sentence.",
        "This variability is particularly important to represent if the model is to be useful for analysis as well as synthesis.",
        "Third, prosodic phrase breaks do not always coincide with syntactic phrase boundaries, and the relationship between prosody and syntax is not well understood.",
        "This means that prosodic phrases cannot simply be predicted from syntactic structure.",
        "Finally, since most text-to-speech synthesis applications require a low cost implementation, there is the concern of computational complexity.",
        "We shall expand on these points separately below, to motivate the work described here.",
        "The various linguistic theories of prosodic phrase structure (e.g., Liberman and Prince 1977; Selkirk 1980, 1984; Beckman and Pierrehumbert 1986; Nespor and Vogel 1983; Ladd 1986) differ in the specific levels that they represent, but all have a similar hierarchical structure.",
        "Two levels of prosodic phrases are common to most proposals: the intonational phrase and the intermediate phrase, using the terminology of Beckman and Pierrehumbert.",
        "A sentence is composed of a sequence of intonational phrases, which in turn are composed of sequences of intermediate phrases.",
        "An intonational phrase break is therefore perceived as stronger or more salient than an intermediate phrase break.",
        "Intonational phrases are delimited by boundary tones, and intermediate phrases are theoretically marked with a phrase accent, where the pitch markers can be either high or low (Beckman and Pierrehumbert 1986).",
        "(In other theories of intonation, for example, t'Hart, Collier, and Cohen [1990], pitch markers also occur at phrase boundaries, but are identified with movement and referred to as either rising or falling.)",
        "Both types of constituents are also cued by segmental lengthening in the phrase final syllable (Wightman, Shattuck-Hufnagel, Ostendorf, and Price 1992).",
        "Since intonational and intermediate phrases are generally accepted, the experiments here will only address these two levels, referring to them as major and minor phrases, respectively.",
        "However, other types of prosodic constituents may be useful and, in fact, there is durational evidence for at least four levels (Wightman, Shattuck-Hufnagel, Ostendorf, and Price 1991; Ladd and Campbell 1991).",
        "We therefore propose a more general hierarchical model that can be extended to an arbitrary, but fixed, number of levels.",
        "In the examples given here, we will represent intonational phrases (I) using \"II\" to mark a major break and intermediate phrases (i) using \"I\" to mark a minor break.",
        "The example below illustrates how phrase breaks are used to represent prosodic phrase structure: Those on early release I must check in with correction officials I fifty times a week 11 according to Ash, who says about half I the contacts for a select group will now be made I by the computerized phone calls.",
        "I ((Those on early release); (must check in with correction officials);), ((fifty times a week),), ((according to Ash,),), ((who says about half), (the contacts for a select group),), ((will now be made); (by the computerized phone calls.",
        ");),",
        "Another important consideration in modeling prosody (and evaluating the model) is that prosodic phrase structure is not deterministic.",
        "Speakers can produce a sentence in several ways without altering the naturalness or the meaning.",
        "Prosodic breaks can differ in size and/or placement because of differences in style, competence, or simply natural speaking variations.",
        "For example, the following sentence was said three ways by five speakers: They're in jail for such things II as bad checks or stealing.",
        "They're in jail for such things as bad checks or stealing.",
        "They're in jail I for such things as bad checks or stealing.",
        "Although deterministic rules can be used to predict phrase breaks for speech synthesis applications, such a model will be limited in its usefulness in speech analysis.",
        "In addition, speech synthesis might be more natural if variability is included in the model.",
        "Here, a stochastic model is used to represent the natural variability in prosodic structure by deriving probabilities of phrase breaks, rather than predicting locations of phrase breaks by rule.",
        "The relationship between prosody and syntax is not fully understood, though it is generally accepted that there is such a relationship.",
        "For example, relatively higher syntactic attachment usually corresponds to relatively larger prosodic breaks, but there are many exceptions, as in: (iMaryinp [was amazed [Ann Dewey was angryls'lvpls which was produced by four speakers as Mary was amazed H Ann Dewey was angry.",
        "In an analysis of the Londonâ€“Lund corpus, Altenberg (1987) finds relative frequencies that describe the correspondence between prosodic constituents (tone units) and different syntactic units.",
        "This data supports the use of a probabilistic model, which also has an advantage in that it can be trained automatically, facilitating representation of a wide variety of speaking styles and allowing a means of discovering syntax-prosody relationships from a large corpus.",
        "One reason that the mapping between syntax and prosody is not simple is because, in speech, the constraints of syntactic structure and phrase length are balanced to produce a regular, roughly equal, sequence of prosodic phrases (Gee and Grosjean 1983).",
        "Consequently, we include constituent length as a factor in the model.",
        "The cost of obtaining a full and accurate syntactic parse can be high, which presents difficulties for text-to-speech synthesis systems.",
        "In addition, a full syntactic parse may not be necessary for predicting prosodic phrases, since prosody is not directly related to syntax.",
        "Consequently, we investigate computation/performance trade-offs associated with using a skeletal syntactic parse vs. simple part-of-speech (POS) assignments.",
        "To summarize, the model proposed here addresses several issues in modeling prosodic phrase structure.",
        "The model is a general formalism for an embedded hierarchy, which we specifically apply to represent sentences, major phrases, and minor phrases.",
        "In order to account for the allowable variability in prosodic parsing, the model is probabilistic.",
        "The structure of the model allows use of grammatical information such as part-of-speech labels, syntactic structure and constituent length, but the specific parameters are trained automatically.",
        "Finally, computational complexity trade-offs are investigated by evaluating the algorithm with and without syntactic cues.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "We begin, in Section 2, by discussing past work in predicting prosodic phrase breaks from text for speech synthesis.",
        "In Section 3, we introduce the probabilistic formalism of the hierarchical model and outline the implementation: text pre-processing, parameter estimation, and phrase break prediction using a dynamic programming algorithm to obtain the most likely prosodic parse.",
        "In Section 4, we present experimental results for prediction of major and minor prosodic phrase breaks based on a corpus of FM radio news stories.",
        "Finally, we conclude in Section 5 by discussing possible implications and extensions of these results."

        "Initial attempts to incorporate prosody in speech synthesis involved determining intonation and duration patterns as a function of syntactic phrase structure (Allen, Hunnicutt, Carlson, and Granstrom 1979; Allen, Hunnicutt, and Klatt 1987), which requires syntactic parsing.",
        "More recently, researchers have attempted to address the fact that prosody and syntax are not directly related by explicitly predicting prosodic phrase boundaries rather than using syntactic clause boundaries.",
        "An important difference between these subsequent approaches is in the amount of syntactic information used to predict prosodic boundaries.",
        "The algorithms reflect different assumptions about the relationship between prosody and syntax, as well as different levels of computational complexity.",
        "Clearly, a greater use of syntactic information will require more computation for finding a more detailed syntactic parse.",
        "One approach is based on the idea that a prosodic parse may not require a full syntactic parse and that detailed part-of-speech information (e.g., noun, verb, determiner) may not be necessary for generating a prosodic parse.",
        "Sorin, Larreur, and Llorca (1987) proposed a simple prosodic parser for French based on content/function word classification to determine prosodic constituents referred to as prosodic groups.",
        "The length and relative location of these prosodic groups is then used to determine phrase break locations that are marked with a pause.",
        "Our earlier work drew on this scheme for predicting phrase boundaries in English: a Markov model was developed to predict phrase breaks by representing the sequence of prosodic groups and breaks as a Markov chain (Veilleux, Ostendorf, Price, and Shattuck-Hufnagel 1990).",
        "An advantage of these approaches is that they only require a small dictionary of function words to assign part-of-speech labels.",
        "Motivated by similar principles and using only a 300-word dictionary, O'Shaughnessy (1989) proposes a somewhat more sophisticated parser for English based on function word identification, number agreement, and suffix identification.",
        "O'Shaughnessy's work differs from the other approaches in that his goal is a syntactic parse, though not complete, and he does not address the issue of differences between prosody and syntax.",
        "At the other end of the spectrum are approaches based on the hypothesis that prosodic phrase boundaries can be predicted by rule from a full syntactic parse.",
        "Gee and Grosjean (1983) developed a rule-based system, called the Phi.",
        "Algorithm, to predict psycholinguistic \"performance structures\" that are represented by assigning an integer number corresponding to boundary salience between each pair of words.",
        "Constituent length information is incorporated primarily through the application of their verb balancing rule, which splits the verb phrase and groups the verb with either the previous or subsequent material, subject to syntactic constraints.",
        "Gee and Grosjean developed their Phi Algorithm only to predict performance structures.",
        "However, their work has been extended to prosodic phrase prediction for speech synthesis applications by Bachenko and Fitzpatrick (1990), who explicitly find prosodic phrase breaks",
        "M. Ostendorf and N. Veilleux Hierarchical Stochastic Model for Automatic Prediction from derived boundary salience indices.",
        "They relax many of the constraints on the use of the verb rule and propose a Verb Adjacency Rule, so their algorithm requires a fairly detailed parse, although not a complete one.",
        "One of the relaxed constraints obviates the need for clause information.",
        "Altenberg (1987) has also proposed an algorithm for prediction of phrase boundary locations (specifically, tone unit boundaries for British English) by rule from syntactic structure and semantic information.",
        "However, the detailed information required for the algorithm cannot currently be acquired automatically from text.",
        "Departing from these approaches, Wang and Hirschberg (1992) have recently used binary decision trees to predict the presence or absence of a prosodic break at each word boundary in a sentence.",
        "They consider a range of input variables, including text-derived information such as detailed POS labels and syntactic constituent structure, and in some experiments, acoustic information.",
        "P05 labels were given by Church's tagger (Church 1988) and syntactic constituents by Hindle's parser (Hindle 1987).",
        "The acoustic information (previous boundary location, pitch accent location, and phrase duration), which was based on hand-labeled prosodic markers, did not improve performance but resulted in a much smaller tree for prediction.",
        "All of these approaches have influenced the model proposed here.",
        "For example, we investigate simple content/function word POS assignment, as in Sorin, Larreur, and Llorca (1987).",
        "Like Wang and Hirschberg (1992), we use decision trees to automatically determine the important factors influencing phrase break location.",
        "In addition, all of the above works have influenced the choice of factors and questions incorporated in the decision tree.",
        "Two important differences in our approach include a stochastic model to capture variability and an explicit representation of a linguistically motivated hierarchy.",
        "Of course, whether it is effective and/or efficient for a computational model to reflect a linguistic hierarchy is an empirical question."

        "Another consequence of using only minor breaks to train the tree is that features that are associated with major breaks are not represented in the model, which may explain the poor performance of the model with syntax.",
        "However, this problem could be addressed with an extension of the current model.",
        "In order to see if explicit modeling of a prosodic hierarchy was a useful aspect of the model, we conducted similar experiments using trees designed specifically for classification.",
        "A binary decision tree was trained using the baseline questions (1-8), and another tree was trained using syntax as well (1-13).",
        "In both cases, the trees were trained to predict three classes: major break, minor break, and no break.",
        "Including the minor phrase length ratio test using known break locations (from hand labels) did not improve prediction performance, so we did not implement a dynamic version based on hypothesized minor breaks.",
        "Results for these two trees are included in Table 2, with confusion matrices given in Table 5.",
        "The costs of different errors were chosen to obtain a false detection rate similar to that for the hierarchical model.",
        "Choosing good costs proved difficult, so the correct detection rate is lower than that for the other models primarily because the false detection rate was so low.",
        "The difference in false detection rates makes comparison to the hierarchical model difficult.",
        "However, experience with performance of the models at different false detection rates suggests that the baseline hierarchical model outperforms the classification tree that does not use syntax, but that the classification tree that uses syntax is at least as good as the hierarchical model.",
        "Since the complexity associated with obtaining a syntactic parse is significantly greater than that associated with the simple three-level hierarchy that we have proposed, we conclude that explicit modeling of a hierarchy is a useful feature of the model.",
        "In addition, the fact that syntactic information was useful for the classification tree but not for the hierarchical model suggests that syntactic features are more important for predicting major breaks than minor breaks, since major breaks are not represented as a class in tree design for the hierarchical model.",
        "For both the hierarchical model and the simple classification trees, we also investigated the use of more detailed part-of-speech information both with and without",
        "the syntactic features.",
        "The more detailed part-of-speech did not improve performance under any of these conditions.",
        "For the classification trees, correct detection improved slightly, but there was a corresponding increase in false detection.",
        "For the hierarchical model, performance actually degraded.",
        "These results suggest that the complexity associated with more detailed part-of-speech tagging may not be necessary; however, further research is needed to answer this question.",
        "It may be that other POS questions, such as testing a larger window of words around the break as in Wang and Hirschberg (1992), would yield better results.",
        "Finally, we thought it would be interesting to compare the results of our prediction algorithm to that of Bachenko and Fitzpatrick's algorithm on our corpus.",
        "Since the test set was relatively small, we were able to implement the algorithm by predicting the phrase boundaries from the rules by hand.",
        "To assign node indices to prosodic breaks (Bachenko and Fitzpatrick 1990), a critical value for separating major and minor phrase breaks is calculated based on an average of the indices associated with the prosodic phrase nodes, where the prosodic phrase nodes are all those created by the Bachenko â€“ Fitzpatrick primary salience rules.",
        "Boundaries with an index greater than the critical value are assigned a major break, indices below 5 have no prosodic break, and intermediate indices map to a minor prosodic break.",
        "(Bachenko and Fitzpatrick include index 4 in the minor break category, but 5 was used here to obtain a lower insertion rate.)",
        "For multiple verb phrases in sequence, the verb balancing rule is applied left-to-right until all verb phrases are grouped before applying the verb adjacency rule or other processing.",
        "The confusion matrix for these results is shown in Table 6, and the performance summary is also included in Table 2.",
        "Although the correct break detection rate is significantly higher than that for the other algorithms, the false detection rate is also higher, and so the sentence accuracy is similar to that for the baseline hierarchical model.",
        "Unlike the other algorithms, the Bachenko â€“ Fitzpatrick algorithm did not make the mistake of assigning a minor phrase break before a particle, but this relies on having a parser that can make that distinction.",
        "An advantage of both the classification tree and the hierarchical model over the Bachenko â€“ Fitzpatrick model is that they can be automatically trained, and thus can be tuned to handle particular tasks.",
        "Table 7 gives the correct detection and false detection rates calculated by comparing the predicted prosodic parses to each of the different spoken versions.",
        "The performance of speaker f2b, whose speech made up roughly three-quarters of the training data, had performance similar to the average for the five versions with slightly lower correct detection rates but also slightly lower false detection rates.",
        "These results suggest that the automatic algorithms are not particularly speaker-dependent, though we expect that it is important to have similar styles for both training and test data.",
        "There was no consistent difference in performance between male and female speakers, and the difference in error rates for different speakers was relatively small.",
        "Correct detection/false detection rates for predicted phrase breaks to each of the five different test versions.",
        "With the exception of the Bachenko â€“ Fitzpatrick algorithm, the systems included here did not use the minor ratio question.",
        "Speaker codes begin with \"f\" or \"m\" for female and male speakers, respectively.",
        "Speaker code f2b is annotated with \"r\" for the original radio recording and \"1\" for the subsequent lab recording.",
        "In all of the previous experiments, the presence of a comma was an important feature for predicting phrase boundaries for all algorithms implemented.",
        "While this is a valid feature in text-to-speech synthesis applications, it is not available in applications involving spoken speech.",
        "(Although presence of a pause might be a useful alternative feature.)",
        "In addition, as we have mentioned earlier, commas are not reliably used even in written text.",
        "Therefore, it is interesting to determine the performance of the algorithm without the comma feature.",
        "As expected, performance degrades significantly, both for the hierarchical model and for the classification trees.",
        "In addition, foy the hierarchical model, syntactic information and the minor phrase length ratio test now provide information that improves performance over the baseline system.",
        "To illustrate performance differences, some correct prediction/false prediction rates are given in Table 8.",
        "It is difficult to compare our performance figures with other reported results because of differences in corpora and speaking styles.",
        "However, the average single speaker correct detection and false detection rates reported here for our implementations of the Bachenko-Fitzpatrick and Wang-Hirschberg algorithms indicate the robustness of these algorithms to different types of data.",
        "Our results for the Bachenko-Fitzpatrick algorithm are somewhat higher than those that they report, .84/.09 vs. .78/.08.2 Using only the features inferable from text, Wang and Hirschberg use classification trees to predict prosodic boundaries in spontaneous speech, achieving phrase break prediction results of .66/.02.3 (Again, note that these results are not directly comparable because of the differences in false detection rates, and results for other trees in Wang and Hirschberg [1992] suggest that these two algorithms have similar",
        "performance.)",
        "Our classification trees used somewhat different features, though also based on POS and syntactic information, and achieved results on radio news speech that are surprisingly lower, i.e., .59/.02 for the tree that used syntax but did not use commas.",
        "Of course, the POS and syntactic information used here may not have been as detailed and/or reliable as that used by Wang and Hirschberg.",
        "(The comparisons here are based on the average error rates for single version comparisons.)"

        "In summary, the model proposed here addresses several issues in modeling prosodic phrase structure.",
        "The model is a general formalism for an embedded hierarchy, which represents a unit in terms of the probability of the sequence of subunits comprising it.",
        "The model is specifically applied to represent a hierarchy containing sentences, major phrases, and minor phrases.",
        "The model captures grammatical and constituent length factors through the use of a decision tree, as in Wang and Hirschberg (1992), but embedding the tree within a hierarchical structure yields better performance than that achieved by a decision tree alone.",
        "The model is stochastic, which accounts for the natural variability in prosodic parsing, and can be automatically trained to reflect different speaking styles.",
        "The automatic training algorithm described here, based on maximum likelihood estimation, involves simple relative frequency estimates and decision tree design.",
        "Automatic training on a large corpus to design the best predictors of phrase breaks can also provide new insight into the relationship between prosody and syntax.",
        "Using the stochastic model, prosodic phrase break prediction involves choosing the most likely prosodic parse, which can be achieved using a recursive dynamic programming algorithm.",
        "We have found that good phrase break prediction results can be achieved without the use of syntactic information or detailed part-of-speech labels, resulting in a very low complexity prediction algorithm.",
        "Without syntax, our algorithm predicted a good prosodic parse for 18 out of 23 sentences, which corresponds to a correct break prediction of 81% and a false prediction rate of 4%.",
        "There are many ways in which this work could be extended.",
        "As we have pointed out, it would be useful to use features directly in determining the probability of a unit, rather than simply representing a unit in terms of the probabilities of the subunits.",
        "For example, we conjecture that commas and certain syntactic structures might be good predictors of major phrase breaks, but not minor phrase breaks.",
        "In addition, other features could be used in the model, including different syntactic features and different questions about the more detailed part-of-speech labels.",
        "Automatically predicted prominence (or pitch accent) locations might also be useful in phrase boundary prediction, although it is arguable whether prominence prediction should come before or after boundary placement.",
        "Of course, it would also be interesting to consider a higher order hierarchy, though we anticipate that a successful implementation would require representation of features at the different levels.",
        "The results reported here were limited to some extent by the amount of available data.",
        "A larger training set would enable the study of more factors, including possibly paragraph-level phenomena.",
        "A larger test set would better establish the significance of the results.",
        "Finally, the best test of a phrase break prediction algorithm is in perceptual judgments of synthesized speech, and we would like to evaluate our algorithm in this context.",
        "In this work we have focused on the synthesis application of prosodic phrase break prediction.",
        "However, one of the advantages of a stochastic model is that it may be useful for analysis of spoken speech.",
        "Because there is some relationship between prosody and syntax, prosodic phrase structure can be used to improve the performance and/or speed of speech understanding systems.",
        "For example, a score of the consistency be",
        "tween a syntactic parse and a prosodic parse has been used to resolve ambiguities in sentence interpretation, where the score is computed by comparing automatically detected prosodic phrase breaks to phrase breaks predicted from the text of the different interpretations (Ostendorf, Wightman, and Veilleux 1993).",
        "Another approach to syntactic disambiguation using prosodic information is described in Bear and Price (1990) and Ostendorf, Price, Bear, and Wightman (1990), where prosodic breaks are used to constrain grammar rules in a parser.",
        "A stochastic phrase model could also be used to improve performance of this system simply by serving as a \"language model\" (as in speech recognition) to improve the performance of a detection algorithm using acoustic information."
