        "Recently there has been an increasing amount of work in computational linguistics involving the interpretation of anaphoric elements in Japanese (Yoshimoto 1988; Kuno 1989; Walker, lida, and Cote 1990; Nakagawa 1992).",
        "These accounts are intended as components of computational systems for machine translation between Japanese and English or for natural language processing in Japanese alone.",

        "in Japanese so that it can be used in computational systems, and (3) to provide some insights on the effect of syntactic factors in Japanese on discourse interpretation.",
        "In the computational literature, there are two foci for research on the interpretation of anaphoric elements such as pronouns.",
        "The first viewpoint focuses on an inferential process driven by the underlying semantics and relations in the domain (Hobbs 1985a; Hobbs et al.",
        "1987; Hobbs and Martin 1987).",
        "A polar focus is to concentrate on the role of syntactic information such as what was previously the topic or subject (Hobbs 1976b; Kameyama 1985; Yoshimoto 1988).",
        "We will argue for an intermediate position with respect to the interpretation of ZEROS, unexpressed arguments of the verb, in Japanese.",
        "Our position is that the interpretation of zeros is an inferential process, but that syntactic information provides constraints on this inferential process (Joshi and Kuhn 1979; Joshi and Weinstein 1981).",
        "We will argue that syntactic cues and semantic interpretation are mutually constraining (Prince 1981b, 1985; Hudson-D'Zmura 1988).",
        "The syntactic cues in Japanese discourse that we investigate are the morphological markers for grammatical TOPIC, the postposition wa, as well as those for grammatical functions such as SUBJECT, ga, OBJECT, a, and OBJECT2, ni.",
        "In addition, we investigate the role of speaker's EMPATI-IY, which is the viewpoint from which an event is described.",
        "This can be syntactically indicated through the use of verbal compounding, i.e. the auxiliary use of verbs such as kureta, kilo.",
        "In addition to the argument that a purely inference-based account does not consider limits on processing time, another argument against a purely inference-based account is provided by the minimal pair below.",
        "Here, the only difference is whether Ziroo is the subject or the object in the second utterance.",
        "Note that the interpretation of zeros is indicated in parentheses: Example 1 a. Taroo ga kooen o sanpositeimasita.",

        "In lb and 2b, the syntactic position in which Ziroo is realized has the effect that lc",
        "means Moo asked Taroo the score of yesterday's game, while 2c means Taroo asked Ziroo the score of yesterday's game.",
        "On the other hand, some purely syntactic accounts require that antecedents for zeros be realized as the grammatical TOPIC, and thus cannot explain the above example because Taroo is never explicitly marked as the topic (Yoshimoto 1988).",
        "In the literature, ZEROS are known as zero pronouns.",
        "We adopt the assumption of earlier work that the interpretation of zeros in Japanese is analogous to the interpretation of overt pronouns in other languages (Kuroda 1965; Martin 1976; Kameyama 1985).",
        "Japanese also has ()Vert pronouns, but the use of the overt pronoun is rare in normal speech, and is limited even in written text.",
        "This is mainly because overt pronouns like kare ('he') and kanozyo ('she') were introduced into Japanese in order to translate gender-insistent pronouns in foreign languages (Martin 1976).",
        "In this paper, we only consider zeros in subcategorized-for argument positions.",
        "Since Japanese doesn't have subject or object verb agreement, there is no syntactic indication that a zero is present in an utterance other than information from subcategorization.1 First, in Section 1.2 we describe the methodology that we applied in this investigation.",
        "In Section 2, we present the theory of centering and some illustrative examples.",
        "Then, in Section 3, we discuss particular aspects of Japanese discourse context, namely grammatical TOPIC and speaker's EMPATHY.",
        "We will show how these can easily be incorporated into a centering account of Japanese discourse processing, and give a number of examples to illustrate the predictions of the theory.",
        "We also discuss the way in which a discourse center is instantiated in Section 4.",
        "In Section 5 we propose a discourse rule of ZERO TOPIC ASSIGNMENT, and use the centering model to formalize constraints on when a zero may be interpreted as a ZERO TOPIC.",
        "Our account makes a distinction between two notions of TOPIC – grammatical topic and zero topic.",
        "The grammatical topic is the wa-marked entity, which is by default predicted to be the most salient discourse entity in the following discourse.",
        "However, there are cases in which it may not be, depending on whether ZERO TOPIC ASSIGNMENT applies.",
        "This analysis provides support for Shibatani's claim that the interpretation of the topic marker, wa, depends on the discourse context (Shibatani 1990).",
        "ZERO TOPIC ASSIGNMENT actually predicts ambiguities in Japanese discourse interpretation and provides a mechanism for deriving interpretations that previous accounts claim would be unavailable.",
        "We delay the review of related research to Section 6 when we can contrast it with our account.",
        "The two major previous accounts are those of Kuno (Kuno 1972, 1976b, 1987, 1989) and Kameyama (Kameyama 1985, 1986, 1988).",

        "For example, Hasegawa (1984) described a zero pronoun as a phonetically null element in an argument position.",
        "However, as shown in the following example, Terazu, Yamanasi, and lnada (1980) assumed that zero pronouns are not limited in their distribution and stipulated them in adjunct positions as well (Ma 1993).",

        "Thus we are manipulating factors such as whether a discourse entity is realized in subject or object position in the third utterance, whether a discourse entity realized in subject position is ga-marked or wa-marked in the third utterance, and whether a discourse entity realized in the fourth utterance in object position is marked as the locus of speaker's EMPATHY.",
        "We collected a group of about 35 native speakers by solicitation on the InterNet to provide judgments for most of the examples given in this paper.",
        "These native speakers were readers of the newsgroups sci.lang.japanese and comp.research.japan.",
        "They were thus typically well-educated, bilingual engineers.",
        "Whenever an example was tested in this way, we provide the number of informants who chose each possible interpretation to the right of the example.",
        "Some examples that are included for expository reasons were not tested.",
        "Participation in our survey was completely voluntary, and the data were collected over three surveys.",
        "Thus the numbers of subjects varied from one survey to another, and this is reflected in the numbers accompanying our examples.",
        "This data collection was carried out on written examples using electronic mail in a situation in which the informants could take as long as they wanted to decide which interpretation they preferred.",
        "The instructions sent with the surveys are given in Appendix A.",
        "This paradigm clearly cannot provide information on which interpretation a subject might arrive at first and then perhaps change based on other pragmatic factors, and thus it contrasts with reaction time studies.",
        "However, the judgments given should be stable and should reflect the fact that our informants were able to use all the information in the discourse.",
        "It is a useful paradigm given that we are exploring the correlation of syntactic cues and discourse interpretation.",
        "It has been claimed that syntactic cues are only used in automatic processing and can be overridden by deeper processing.",
        "However, Hudson's results suggest that subjects may judge a discourse sequence to be nonsensical when it is incoherent according to centering (Hudson-D'Zmura 1988).",
        "Di Eugenio claims that discourse sequences in Italian that are not discourse-coherent according to centering theory produce a garden-path effect (Di Eugenio 1990).",
        "The methods we used allow us to explore the results of these interactions, and yet it",
        "would be beneficial for these results to be expanded upon by careful psychological experimentation.",
        "For most of the examples reported here, we asked subjects to choose one preferred interpretation instead of allowing them to rank interpretations.",
        "The motivation for doing this was to force differences to come out for slight preferences, with the theory being that other variations would come out across subjects.",
        "In a few cases we allowed subjects to indicate no preference; these examples will be clearly indicated.",
        "In addition, we used the same gender for multiple discourse entities to prevent any tendency for judgments to be influenced by gender stereotypes.",
        "We also avoided using verbs with causal biases toward one of their arguments, and we used few cue words such as but, because, and then, which could result in a bias toward, say, a cause-effect or temporal sequence of events interpretation.",
        "We also omitted honorific markers, which are normally a part of Japanese ambiguity resolution.'",
        "This was done to isolate the effects of the variables that we were exploring in this study, namely topic marking, grammatical function, empathy, and realization with a zero or with a full noun phrase."

        "Centering is intended to reflect aspects of ATTENTIONAL STATE in a tripartite view of discourse structure that also includes INTENTIONAL STRUCTURE and LINGUISTIC STRUCTURE (Grosz and Sidner 1986).",
        "In Grosz and Sidner's theory of discourse structure, discourses can be segmented based on intentional structure, and a discourse segment exhibits both local and global coherence.",

        "Each utterance in a discourse segment has two structures associated with it.",
        "First, each utterance in a discourse has associated with it a set of discourse entities called FORWARD-LOOKING CENTERS, Cf. Centers are semantic entities that are part of the discourse model.",
        "Second, there is a special member of this set called the BACKWARD-LOOKING CENTER, Cb.",
        "The Cb is the discourse entity that the utterance most centrally concerns, what has been elsewhere called the 'theme' (Reinhart 1981; Horn 1986).",

        "This distinction between looking back to the previous discourse with the Cb and projecting preferences for interpretation in subsequent discourse with the Cp is a key aspect of centering theory.",
        "In addition to the structures for centers, Cb and Cf, the theory of centering specifies a set of rules and constraints.",

        "The second constraint depends on the definition of realizes.",
        "An utterance U realizes a center c if c is an element of the situation described by U, or c is the semantic interpretation of some subpart of U (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein unpublished).",
        "Thus the relation REALIZE describes zeros, explicitly realized discourse entities, and those implicitly realized centers that are entities inferable from the discourse situation (Prince 1978a, 1981b).",
        "A specialization of the relation REALIZE is the relation DIRECTLY REALIZE.",
        "A center is directly realized if it corresponds to a phrase in an utterance.",

        "As we discuss further in Section 3, zeros refer to entities that are already in the discourse context.",

        "In addition, if there is only one pronoun, then that pronoun must be the Cb.",
        "For Japanese, we extend this rule directly to zeros, assuming that zeros in Japanese correspond to destressed pronouns in English.",
        "Rule (2) states that modeling attentional state depends on analyzing adjacent utterances according to a set of transitions that measure the coherence of the discourse segment in which the utterance occurs.",
        "Measuring coherence is based on an estimate of the hearer's inference load, but this measure must always be relative since there is no grammar of discourse.",

        "Centering theory models this by stipulating that some transitions are preferred over others.",
        "The typology of transitions from one utterance, U1, to the next is based on two factors: whether the backward-looking center, Cb, is the same from U1_1 to 1LI,, and whether this discourse entity is the same as the preferred center, Cp, of U1.8",

        "Kameyama's account of zero interpretation consists roughly of a PROPERTY-SHARING CONSTRAINT, henceforth PS, and an EXPECTED CENTER ORDER, henceforth ECO, which may be paraphrased as follows: PROPERTY-SHARING CONSTRAINT: Two zero-pronouns in adjacent utterances, which co-specify the same Cb-encoding discourse entity, should share one of the following properties (in descending order of preference): 1) both IDENT and SUBJECT, 2) IDENT alone, 3) SUBJECT-alone, 4) both NONIDENT and NONSUBJECT, 5) NONSUBJECT alone, or 6) NONIDENT al one.",
        "EXPECTED CENTER ORDER RULE: In a sentence that contains a center-establishing zero, if it is to have a full NP as its antecedent, the default preference order among its potential antecedent NPs is: Topic > Ident > Subject > Object(2) > Others.",
        "As noted earlier, we use a modified version of Kameyama's EXPECTED CENTER ORDER as the ordering of the Cf, but Kameyama's treatment differs from ours in a number of respects.",
        "First, Kameyama used the property IDENT to describe something similar to Kuno's notion of EMPATHY, and has an added assumption of a SUBJECT IDENT default, i.e. subjects are considered to be EMPATHY loci by default.",
        "This means that her theory also includes a neutralization device for cases where this default is not in effect (Kameyama 1988).",
        "In contrast, our theory explains examples covered by the SUBJECT IDENT default by including EMPATHY in the ranking of the Cf list and by the distinction between CONTINUE and RETAIN, as illustrated in example 24.",
        "We have also expanded Kameyama's treatment of TOPIC.",
        "We have elucidated the interaction of topic with subject and empathy markers and supported our claim that the topic marker wa functions similarly to pronominalization in instantiating the Cb.",
        "In addition, ZTA and the distinction that we make between grammatical and zero topic is new to our account.",
        "Furthermore, since Center Instantiation is a side effect of the application of the centering algorithm, we treat 40c and 41c with the same mechanism.",
        "In Kameyama's analysis, the PS constraint applies to example 40, while the ECO applies in example 41."

        "In this paper, we have attempted to elucidate the interaction of syntactic realization and discourse salience in Japanese using the discourse-processing framework of CENTERING.",
        "In our theory discourse salience is operationalized by the ranking of the forward centers for an utterance.",
        "We explored speakers' options for indicating salience in Japanese discourse, especially the interaction of discourse markers for TOPIC and EMPATHY.",
        "We then posited a ranking and used it to explain some facts about the interpretation of zeros in Japanese.",
        "While there is clearly a correlation between syntax and discourse function, we show that discourse context plays an important role.",
        "We proposed a discourse rule of ZERO TOPIC ASSIGNMENT (ZTA), which distinguishes grammatical and zero topic.",
        "We showed that centering allows us to formalize constraints on when ZTA can apply.",
        "However, future work must determine additional constraints on when ZTA applies, and which language families support ZTA.",
        "The preferred interpretation of zeros and the discourse factors that are responsible for each interpretation are summarized below.",
        "Remember that in each case the zero in the third utterance was established as the Cb by the previous two utterances:",
        "This analysis suggests that centering may be a universal of context-dependent processing of language, although so far this theory has only been applied to English, German, Turkish, Japanese, and Italian (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987; Walker 1989; Walker, Iida, and Cote 1990; Di Eugenio 1990; Cote 1992; Rambow 1993; Nakatani 1993; Hoffman 1995; Turan 1995).",
        "We proposed that the centering component of a theory of discourse interpretation can be constructed in a language-independent fashion, up to the declaration of a language-specific value for one parameter of the theory, i.e., Cf ranking (as in Section 2).",
        "This parameter is language-dependent because different languages offer different means of expressing discourse function.",
        "We conjecture that ZTA may apply in any free-word order language with zeros.",
        "Future work must examine the interaction between centering and discourse segmentation in both monologue and dialogue (Whittaker and Stenton 1988; Walker and Whittaker 1990; Walker 1993b), and the role of deictics, lexical semantics, one anaphora, and propositional discourse entities in centering (Webber 1978; Sidner 1979; Walker 1992, 1993a; Cote 1995).",
        "It is also important to examine the interaction of zeros with overt pronouns and with deictics and the interaction of pronominalization with accenting (Terken 1995).",
        "In addition, the semantic theory underlying centering must be further developed (Roberts 1995).",
        "Finally, centering transitions are currently defined by an equality relation between discourse entities, but POSET relations and functional dependencies often link entities in discourse (Prince 1978b, 1981a; Ward 1985; Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein unpublished).",
        "The predictions made here should also be tested on a large corpus of naturally occurring Japanese discourse (Hurewitz and Linson 1995)."
