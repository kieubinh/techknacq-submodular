      "text": [
        "Following Ann Banfield (1982), a literary theorist who analyzes point of view linguistically, we shall call sentences that take a character's psychological point of view (hereafter, simply point of view or POV) subjective, in contrast to sentences that objectively narrate events or describe the fictional world.",
        "Subjective sentences present private states of charactersstates of an experiencer holding an attitude, optionally toward an object.",
        "Varieties of private states include intellectual ones, such as someone believing, wondering, or knowing something; emotive ones, such as someone hating something or being afraid; and perceptual ones, such as someone seeing or hearing something.",
        "Thus, private states are states that are not open to objective observation or verification (Quirk et al.",
        "1985).",
        "To refer to a private state p and its components, we shall write: Ps (p,experiencer,attitude,object) where experiencer is the person in state p, and attitude is know, believe, see, or whatever sort of private state p is.",
        "Notice that \"attitude\" is being used as a general covering term, referring to a class of which the propositional attitudes are only a subclass.",
        "We shall limit our scope in this paper mainly to two classes of subjective sentences, one containing those Banfield calls \"represented thoughts\" and \"represented perceptions,\" and the other containing those I call \"private-state reports.\" We will not consider represented speech at all (Jespersen 1924; Banfield 1982), because of its complexity, and only toward the end of the paper (Section 11) will we consider a variant of private-state reports: subjective sentences about private-state actions.",
        "Even restricting one's attention to the two classes mentioned above, there are many syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic features according to which one could characterize subjective sentences.",
        "Below I propose a view of subjective sentences that is useful for the specific purpose of tracking FOV.",
        "For characterizations that include further and alternative distinctions, see, for example, the following works in literary theory and linguistics: Dole2e1 1973; Uspensky 1973; Fillmore 1974; Cohn 1978; Banfield 1982; Caenepeel 1989; Galbraith 1990; Li 1991.",
        "A private state is part of the meaning of any kind of subjective sentence.",
        "However, a represented thought or represented perception without a narrative parenthetical explicitly mentions only the object of the private state; the attitude and experiencer are implicit.",
        "On the other hand, a private-state report explicitly mentions the experiencer, the attitude, and, optionally, the object of a private state p; in addition, with the private state report, p is not the object of some other private state with an implicit experiencer and attitude.",
        "Consider the following sentences: 31 Zoe was angry at Joe.",
        "3.2 Where was he?",
        "Sentence (3.2) is a represented thought.",
        "It mentions the object of a private state p whose experiencer, Zoe, and attitude, wonder or a similar attitude, are implicit: \"Where was he?\" Ps(p, experiencer, attitude, object)",
        "Sentence (3.1) mentions the experiencer, attitude, and object of a private state /71: \" Zoewas angry at Joe.\" PS (pi, experienceryattitudei,objecti) Under a private-state report interpretation of (3.1), p1 is not itself the object of some other private state.",
        "We shall call the character whose psychological point of view is taken by a subjective sentence the subjective character (SC) of that sentence.",
        "The SC is the subject of a narrative parenthetical, when one is present; the implicit experiencer, when the sentence is a represented thought or represented perception without a narrative parenthetical; and the explicit experiencer, when the sentence is a private-state report.",
        "In addition to private-state terms such as 'know' and 'see,' subjective sentences can contain subjective elements, linguistic elements that express attitudes of the SC (this aspect of subjective sentences is noted in many studies of POV; the term \"subjective element\" is attributable to Banfield 1982).",
        "An example appears in the following passage (throughout this paper, sentences in cited passages are indented to reflect paragraphing in the original texts).",
        "The adjective \"awful\" in (4.6) is a subjective element, expressing Zoe's evaluation of Joe (that he is awful).",
        "Notice that (4.6) is a represented thoughtZoe thought is implicit and (4.2) is a private-state report, reporting Zoe's private state of being furious with Joe.",
        "As will be specified shortly in Section 6, the output of the algorithm is the POV of a sentence, not a representation of its meaning.",
        "One interesting issue not addressed in this paper is how one might represent the difference between, for example, \"John wondered where he was\" and\" 'Where was he?'",
        "John wondered.\" But one distinction that is crucial for tracking POV is the distinction between the interpretation of a sentence as either objective or subjective, and the kinds of states of affairs that the sentence is about.",
        "The former is a pragmatic issue, concerning the use of a sentence to present objective or subjective information about the fictional world (Kuroda 1976).",
        "The latter is a semantic issue, concerning the word senses of lexical items in the sentence.",
        "For instance, (5) below can be used to objectively narrate a past action or to portray a character's thought of one.",
        "Tn either case, the sentence is about an action.",
        "(5) Gus had taken them back to town.",
        "Now consider (6): (6) Gus had a cornish hen.",
        "Whether the word sense of 'had' in (6) is a state or an action (eating) is a separate question from whether the sentence is objective or subjective (similarly, Hirst [1987]",
        "suggests that lexical ambiguity is orthogonal to speech act ambiguity in conversation).",
        "As specified in Section 6.1, the type of state of affairs that each clause is about is part of the input to the algorithm.",
        "In addition to being objective or a character's subjective sentence, a sentence may express the attitudes of an overt narrator (Chatman 1978).",
        "But this paper will focus only on texts without overt narrators.",
        "In addition, we will not consider passages with irony and humor that do not originate with a character, or passages that are written in the style of an epic, parable, or folktale.",
        "As well, we will not try to account for fiction that is experimental in its manipulation of POV.",
        "Finally, we will only consider narrative sentences in which the tenses are \"shifted\" (Jespersen 1924); that is, in which the simple past is used for the narrative present, and the past perfective is used for the narrative past.",
        "Note that it is not difficult to find published third-person texts that satisfy these criteria.",
        "the meaning of the text is beyond the scope of this work.",
        "But to accomplish such tasks, the system must recognize when attitudes are being presented in the first place and identify the character whose attitudes they are; these are the tasks involved in tracking the psychological POV.",
        "POV also has important implications for discourse processing.",
        "Discussion of this topic is deferred until Section 14.",
        "Sentences that present' the attitudes of someone who is not the writer appear in genres other than third-person fictional narrative text, such as newspaper articles and textbooks (Banfield 1982), even if we might prefer another term than \"represented thought\" for such sentences.",
        "Thus, the problem of tracking POV arises for these other genres as well.",
        "Following is a passage from The New York Times (1990) that contains a \"represented thought\": Looking at the more severely affected countries, experts are wondering where the saturation point will be.",
        "Where will the infection rate level off as most of those engaging in riskier behavior fall prey: 30 percent?",
        "40 percent?",
        "The second sentence presents something that the experts are wondering; 30 and 40 percent are the experts' guesses, not those of the writer.",
        "Third-person fictional narrative text is the focus of this work primarily because it contains so many prototypical instances of sentences that present attitudes of someone who is not the writer.",
        "Further, by restricting the types of texts considered (see Section 2.2 above), it is possible to constrain the problem to choosing among an objective POV and the points of view of the characters.",
        "In genres such as soft news and editorials, for example, the writer may present his or her own attitudes; when attitudes of the writer, the speaker, or a narrator may be presented, the problem is less constrained.",
        "Hamburger (1973), Kuroda (1973), Banfield (1982), Galbraith (1990), and Wiebe (1991) address this issue more fully.",

        "Reasoning about whether a sentence is objective or the subjective sentence of this or that character is certainly part of tracking POV (Fillmore 1974).",

        "(Similar suggestions have been made by Carberry [19891 with respect to resolving intersentential ellipsis and by Sidner [1983] with respect to pronoun resolution.)",
        "We can view the text as composed of maximal blocks of objective sentences (objective contexts) and maximal blocks of subjective sentences that have the same subjective character (subjective contexts).",

        "2.Sentence s resumes y's POV: s is a subjective sentence of y and is preceded by an objective context, which is in turn preceded by a subjective context of the same character y.",
        "3.Sentence s initiates y's POV: s is a subjective sentence of y and either s is the first subjective sentence of a scene, or the SC of the previous subjective sentence is a different character z.",
        "The approach taken in this work is to seek, by extensive examination of naturally occurring narratives, regularities in the ways that authors initiate, resume, and continue a character's point of view, and to develop an algorithm that tracks point of view on the basis of the regularities found.",
        "Given certain combinations of sentence features (e.g., tense, aspect, lexical items that potentially express subjectivity, the types of states of affairs that the sentence is about, and the identities of the actors or experiencers of those states of affairs), and of the current context (e.g., whether the previous sentence was subjective or objective, whether a paragraph break separates the current and previous sentences, and the identity of the SC of the previous subjective sentence, if there was one), particular point-of-view operations can be expected.",
        "A simple example: a sentence that (1) is about an action, (2) is in the past progressive, and (3) follows, without a paragraph break, the subjective sentence of a character c, usually continues c's POV.",
        "The examination of texts mentioned above was not a formal empirical investigation, so the algorithm should be viewed as a hypothesis that can be subjected to such tests.",
        "However, I examined passages from over forty novels and short stories to identify the regularities upon which the algorithm is based, and strictly adhered to the practice of considering only naturally occurring examples in developing the algorithm.",

        "Quoted speech is a major way of communicating the beliefs, intentions, etc., of characters who are not to become the SC; merely the fact that what a character says expresses her point of view should not lead the reader to anticipate later subjective sentences of that character, as the reader does after a subjective sentence.",

        "Thus, the actor of a private-state-action sentence that is the actor's subjective sentence has usually been the SC before.",
        "While consistency in the interpretation of a passage with this sort of sentence must be supported by other factors, this regularity is a strong one in the texts examined.",
        "Thus, if the actor has been a SC, then the algorithm treats a private-state-action sentence s as it would have treated a private-state sentence in the same context; otherwise, it treats s as it would have treated an action sentence in the same context (see Wiebe [19901 for illustrations of the various consequences of treating s one way or the other).",

        "The results are positive, and are given in Appendix C. Fully testing the algorithm would require a much larger corpus, in which a significant number of each of the possibilities arises.",
        "Such testing would be a major endeavor in itself.",
        "Finally, as mentioned in Section 8.3.1, we have performed psychological experiments that showed that readers' interpretations of private-state sentences are affected by paragraph breaks as we predicted on the basis of the algorithm (Bruder and Wiebe 1990 and in press).",

        "One direction for future research is investigating the interactions of different points of view.",
        "A large class of exceptions to the algorithm can be attributed to interactions between the spatial and temporal points of view and the psychological one.",
        "For example, there are spatial and temporal discontinuities other than scene breaks after which a character should no longer be expected: the current \"here\" and \"now\" in the story may shift away from the character, or the character may leave the scene while the \"here\" and \"now\" remain unchanged.",
        "These situations must be distinguished from the situation, occurring with represented thoughts, in which there is a \"projected here\" and a \"projected now\" of events that are being thought about, and from the situation in represented perception in which there is a \"projected here\" of events being perceived (Bruder et al.",
        "1986; Rapaport et al.",
        "1989a, 1989b).",
        "An important area of future research is investigating interactions among tracking POV, recognizing discourse structure, and anaphora resolution.",
        "I am currently focusing on discourse structure within subjective contexts.",
        "We can view a subjective context as presenting a sequence of private states, where the experiencers and attitudes of some are only implicit (in the case of represented thoughts).",
        "In addition to discourse relations among sentences as wholes, there can be discourse relations among objects of",
        "private states, even a hierarchical structure involving several such objects.",
        "As a concrete example, the contrast signaled by the cue-phrase 'but' appearing in a represented thought may be between a represented thought and the object of a previous private state report.",
        "One example of a potential effect on pronoun resolution: if a sentence s is to be interpreted as a represented thought, and is to be incorporated into a discourse segment structure among previous private-state objects, then pronouns in s can be resolved against the focus space(s) corresponding to the private-state-object segments (as in Grosz and Sidner's [1986] theory).",
        "Of course, determining whether or not s is to be so interpreted is a difficult problem.",
        "But such interactions among POV, discourse structure, and anaphora resolution might be usefully cast as constraints, with evidence regarding interpretation with respect to one limiting the options to be pursued for the others.",
        "The psychological POV is related to other pragmatic and discourse phenomena.",
        "Subjective contexts are paragraph-level analogs of opaque contexts in belief reports (Wiebe [1991] specifically addresses this issue).",
        "In addition, the discourse phenomena identified by Fauconnier (1985) are similar to the psychological point of view.",
        "Just as a private-state report can begin a discourse segment in which subsequent sentences are understood to continue a character's point of view, an adverbial such as \"in 1969\" can begin a discourse segment in which subsequent sentences are understood to refer to events that occurred in 1969, even though the date is not subsequently mentioned.",
        "Or, consider discussing someone else's work, say Smith's, in a research paper or textbook.",
        "After an initial reference to Smith's work, you may go on to describe his or her theory without explicitly saying in each sentence that you are doing so (with a locution such as \"Smith shows that,\" \"In Smith's theory,\" \"In Smith's algorithm,\" or \"According to Smith\") (William J. Rapaport, personal communication).",
        "Along with subjective contexts, an NLU system must be able to recognize such discourse phenomena in order to recover information implicitly communicated in the discourse.",
        "A detailed investigation of one of them suggests directions for investigating the others.",
        "The one investigated here, subjective contexts in particular kinds of texts, is a good one to investigate because it is possible to constrain the problem, because there are so many prototypical instances in those kinds of texts, and because there is a great deal of previous work in linguistics and literary theory to build upon.",
        "In conclusion, this paper presented an algorithm for tracking the psychological point of view in third-person fictional narrative text.",
        "The algorithm is based on regularities, found by extensive examination of naturally occurring narratives, in the ways that authors manipulate point of view.",
        "The algorithm has been implemented, preliminary empirical studies have been performed, which support the algorithm, and psychological experimentation is continuing.",
        "This is the first detailed computational approach to the problem of tracking the psychological point of view."

        "In the entire novel (not only in the passages tested), there are a total of 10 subjective sentences attributed to Lynette.",
        "All are private-state reports, none has a subjective element, and no two of them appear together.",
        "In addition, 5 of them include some description of Lynette's behavior, and, of the remaining 5, 4 are the subjective sentence of Jeremy and Lynette together, not of Lynette alone.",
        "If one of the above heuristics were employed, then there would be 12 fewer primary errors and 14 fewer secondary errors.",
        "Whether or not one of these heuristics is employed does not affect the results given above for Lonesome Dove.",
        "Assuming one of the above heuristics, the results for The Magic of the Gilts would be as follows.",
        "Out of the 450 input items, the algorithm would commit 22 primary errors (5%) and 7 secondary errors (2%).",
        "Table 8 shows the primary errors broken down according to point-of-view operation, assuming that one of the heuristics discussed above is employed.",
        "Notice that the differences between Tables 7 and 8 appear in the last two rows."
