        "Classical generative phonology is couched within the same set of assumptions that dominated standard transformational grammar.",
        "Despite some claims that \"derivations based on ordered rules (that is, external ordering) and incorporating intermediate structures are essential to phonology\" (Bromberger and Halle 1989:52), much recent work has tended toward a new model, frequently described in terms of constraints on well-formedness (Paradis 1988; Goldsmith 1993; McCarthy and Prince 1993; Prince and Smolensky 1993).",
        "While this work has an increasingly declarative flavor, most versions retain procedural devices for repairing representations that fail to meet certain constraints, or for constraints to override each other.",
        "This view is in marked contrast to the interpretation of constraints in grammar frameworks like LFG, GPSG, and HPSG1 and in constraint programming systems more generally (Jaffar and Lassez 1987; Smolka 1992).",
        "In such approaches, constraints cannot be circumvented, there are no 'intermediate structures,' and the well-formedness constraint (Partee 1979) is observed (i.e. ill-formed representations can never be created).",
        "The advantage of these frameworks is that they allow interesting linguistic analyses to be encoded while remaining computationally tractable.",
        "Here, we are interested in the question of what a theory of phonology ought to look like if it is to be compatible with a constraint-based grammar framework.",
        "This issue has already received attention,' although a thoroughgoing integration of phonology into constraint-based grammars has yet to be attempted.",
        "To ease exposition, we shall take HPSG as a suitably representative candidate of such approaches.",
        "Although we are broadly committed to a sign-oriented approach to grammar, none of our proposals depends crucially on specific tenets of HPSG.",
        "Rather than attempting to theorize at an abstract level about constraint-based phonology, we shall engage in two case studies intended to give a concrete illustration of important issues: these involve templatic morphology in Sierra Miwok and schwa alternation in French.",
        "Before launching into these studies, however, we present an overview of some aspects of phonology that present a challenge to standard assumptions taken in sign-oriented constraint-based grammars.",
        "Then we describe a (simplified) version of HPSG that will make it possible to illustrate the approach without irrelevant technical machinery."

      "heading": "1.1 The Challenge of Phonology",
      "text": [
        "Given that the dominant focus of most research in constraint-based grammar has been syntax and semantics, it is not surprising that the phonological content of words and phrases has been largely limited to orthographic strings, supplemented with a concatenation operation.",
        "How far would such representations have to be enriched if we wanted to accommodate a more thoroughgoing treatment of phonology?",
        "As remarked earlier, recent work in theoretical phonology has apparently moved closer to a constraint-based perspective, and is thus a promising starting point for our investigation.",
        "Yet there are at least three challenges that confront anyone looking into theoretical phonology from the viewpoint of computational linguistics.",
        "Most striking perhaps is the relative informality of the language in which theoretical statements are couched.",
        "Bird and Ladd (1991) have catalogued several examples of this: notational ambiguity (incoherence), definition by example (informality), variable interpretation of notation depending on subjective criteria (inconsistency), and uncertainty about empirical content (indeterminacy).",
        "When a clear theoretical statement can be found, it is usually expressed in procedural terms, which clouds the empirical ramifications making a theory difficult to falsify.",
        "Finally, even when explicit and nonprocedural generalizations are found, they are commonly stated in a nonlinear model, which clearly goes beyond the assumptions about phonology made in HPSG as it currently stands.",
        "We approach these challenges by adopting a formal, nonprocedural, nonlinear model of phonology and showing how it can be integrated into HPSG, following on the heels of recent work by the authors (Bird and Klein 1990; Bird 1992; Klein 1992).",
        "One of the starting assumptions of this work is that phonological representations are intensional, i.e. each representation is actually a description of a class of utterances.",
        "Derivations progress by refining descriptions, further constraining the class of denoted objects.",
        "Lexical representations are likewise partial, and phonological constraints are cast as generalizations in a lexical inheritance hierarchy or in a prosodic inheritance hierarchy.",
        "When set against the background of constraint-based grammar, this intensional approach is quite natural (cf. Johnson [1988]).",
        "Moreover, some recent thinking on the phonology – phonetics interface supports this view (Pierrehumbert 1990; Coleman",
        "1992).",
        "However, it represents a fundamental split with the generative tradition, where rules do not so much refine descriptions as alter the objects themselves (Keating 1984).",
        "While it is clearly possible to integrate an essentially generative model into the mold of constraint-based grammar (Krieger, Pirker, and Nerbonne 1993), it is less clear that this is the approach most phonologists would wish to take nowadays.",
        "It is becoming increasingly apparent that rule-based relationships between surface forms and hypothetical lexical forms are unable to capture important generalizations about surface forms.",
        "This concern was voiced early in the history of generative phonology, when Kisseberth (1970) complained that such rules regularly conspire to achieve particular surface configurations, but are unable to express the most elementary observations about what those surface configurations are.",
        "As a criticism of rule-based systems, Kisseberth's complaint remains valid and has been echoed several times since then (Shibatani 1973; Hooper 1976; Hudson 1980; Manaster Ramer 1981).",
        "However, recent work in phonology has moved away from models involving rules that relate lexical and surface forms toward models involving general systems of interacting constraints, where this problem has been sidestepped.",
        "Accordingly, we avoid the theoretical framework of early generative phonology, focusing instead on encoding phonological constraints in a constraint-based grammar framework.",

      "heading": "1.2 Motivation",
      "text": [
        "At this point, we should briefly address the question: What is gained by integrating phonology into a constraint-based grammar?",
        "One pragmatic answer is that approaches like HPSG have already taken this step, by introducing a PHONOLOGY attribute that parallels attributes for SYNTAX and SEMANTICS.",
        "Since, as we have already pointed out, the value of PHONOLOGY needs to be enriched somehow if it is to be linguistically adequate, it is reasonable to ask whether the formalism allows insightful statements of phonological generalizations.",
        "An objection might take the following form: phonology is formally less complex than syntax, as shown by the body of work on finite state analyses of phonology (cf.",
        "Section 1.4).",
        "Hence, it is inappropriate to encode phonology in a general purpose formalism that has been designed to accommodate more complex phenomena.",
        "As a first response, we would maintain that formalisms should not be confused with theories.",
        "Certainly, we want to have a restrictive theory of phonology and its interactions with other levels of grammar.",
        "But we view constraint-based formalisms as languages for expressing such theories, not as theories themselves.",
        "Moreover, the fact that we use a uniform constraint formalism does not force us to use homogeneous inferential mechanisms for that formalism; this issue is discussed further in Section 1.4 and Section 6.",
        "A further question might be: do natural language grammars require the kind of interaction between phonology and other levels of grammar made possible by constraint-based formalisms?",
        "This is not the place to explore this issue in the detail it deserves.",
        "However, even if we accept the contention of Pullum and Zwicky (1984) that the interactions between phonology and syntax (narrowly construed) are highly restricted, there are still good reasons for wanting to accommodate phonological representations as one of the constraints in a sign-based grammar framework.",
        "To begin with, it is relatively uncontroversial that morphology needs to be interfaced with both syntax and phonology.",
        "Approaches like that of Krieger and Nerbonne (in press) have shown that both derivational and inflectional morphology can be usefully expressed within the constraint-based paradigm.",
        "Taking the further step of adding phonology seems equally desirable.",
        "Second, the use of typed feature structures within the lexicon has been strongly",
        "argued for by Briscoe (1991) and Copestake et al.",
        "(in press).",
        "That is, even when we ignore syntactic combination, constraint-based grammar frameworks turn out to be well suited to expressing the category and semantic information fields of lexical entries.",
        "But the interaction of phonology with categorial information inside the lexicon is well documented.",
        "Lexical phonology (Kiparsky 1982) has shown in detail how phonological phenomena are conditioned by morphologically specified domains.",
        "If direct interaction between phonology and morpho-syntax is prohibited, one can only resort to ad hoc and poorly motivated diacritic features.",
        "Turning to a different empirical domain, it can be argued that focus constructions exhibit an interaction between information structure (at the semantic–pragmatic level) with prosodic structure (at the phonological level).",
        "This interaction can be directly expressed in a sign-oriented approach.",
        "In other frameworks it is common practice to avoid direct reference to phonology by invoking a morpho-syntactic FOCUS feature (e.g. Selkirk 1984; Rooth 1985); the mediation of syntax in this way appears to be more an artifact of the grammar architecture than an independently motivated requirement.",
        "Equally, it has been argued that the phenomenon of heavy NP shift is a kind of syntax-phonology interaction that is simply stated in a constraint-based approach, where the linear precedence constraints of syntax are sensitive to the phonological category of weight (Bird 1992)."

        "In this section, we present a brief overview of HPSG (Pollard and Sag 1987), a constraint-based grammar formalism built around a type system that suits our purposes in phonology.",
        "In order to formulate the type system of our grammar, we need to make two kinds of TYPE DECLARATION.",
        "The first kind contains information about the subsumption ordering over types.",

        "That is, for each type, we declare (all and only) the attributes for which it is specified, and additionally the types of values which those attributes can take.' For example, objects of type sign 3 The constraints proposed here deviate in various respects from the standard version of HPSG.",
        "We follow Carpenter (1992) in using the notation o ck to specify that type cr satisfies constraint 0.",

        "Steven Bird and Ewan Klein Phonological Analysis in Typed Feature Systems could be constrained to have the following features defined:",
        "That is, feature structures of type sign must contain the attributes PHON (i.e. phonology), SYNSEM (i.e. syntax/semantics),5 and DTRS (i.e. daughters) and these attributes must take values of a specific type (i.e., phon, synsem, and list, respectively).",
        "A further crucial point is that appropriateness conditions are inherited by subtypes.",
        "For example, since morph is a subtype of sign, it inherits all the constraints obeyed by sign.",
        "Moreover, as we shall see in Section 3.2, it is subject to some further appropriateness conditions that are not imposed on any of its supertypes.",
        "Continuing in the same vein, we can assign appropriateness conditions to the types synsem and phon that occurred as values in (2), (simplifying substantially from standard HPSG).",
        "Here we give the constraints for synsem.",

        "To conclude this section, we shall look very briefly at matters of interpretation and inference.",

        "Following Zajac, let us say that a GROUND feature term is a term all of whose type symbols are minimal (i.e., the most specific types in the hierarchy immediately above 1).",
        "A WELL-TYPED feature term is one that obeys all the type definitions.",
        "Then the meaning of a feature term F is given by the set of all well-typed ground feature terms that are subsumed by F. Evaluating F, construed as a query, involves describing F's denotation; for example, enumerating all the well-typed ground feature terms it subsumes.",
        "Since the type definitions obeyed by F might be recursive, its denotation is potentially infinite.",
        "Consider for example the following definitions (where 'nelist' and 'elist' stand for nonempty list and empty list respectively, and T subsumes every type):",
        "5 Earlier versions of HPSG kept syntax and semantics as separate attributes, and we shall sometimes revert to the latter when borrowing examples from other people's presentations.",
        "Here, the denotation of the type symbol list is the set of all possible ground lists.",

        "However, as it happens, there is no need for us to adopt the rich representation Tranel employs.",
        "We can simulate his analysis using a single tier (rather than two) while retaining a representation of syllable structure.",
        "Observe that the use of the CV tier and the melody tier was motivated solely by the need to have a floating autosegment, the ce.",
        "It is equivalent to collapse these two tiers, using the alternation ce-0 in place of the floating ce.",
        "This style of approach to zero alternations, which dates back to Bloomfield (1926), will employ the parenthesis notation for optional items that was defined in Section 2.1.",
        "We follow Tranel in representing syllable structure and we shall do this using the notation shown in (52).16",
        "An independent tier that represents syllable structure will be encoded as a sequence of such syllables, where the segmental constituents of the syllable structure are coindexed with a separate segmental tier, as defined in (53).",
        "Note that the indices in (53) range over lists that may be empty in the case of onsets and codas, and that the type phrase denotes phonological phrases.",
        "The notation of (53) states that in order for something to be a well-formed phrase, its sequence of segments must be parsed into a sequence of well-formed syllables.",
        "In more familiar terms, one could paraphrase (53) as stating that the domain of syllabification in French is the phrase.",
        "As a simple illustration of the approach, consider again the word melons.",
        "The proposed lexical representation for the phonology attribute of this word is [SEGS : (m (ce) 1 5)].",
        "When we insist that any phrase containing this word must consist of a sequence of well-formed syllables, we can observe the following pattern of behavior for six melons.",
        "Observe in the above example that the syllabic position of m is variable.",

        "Now consider the case of the phrase sept melons.",
        "This is similar to the situation in (54), except that we must find a way of ruling out the tml cluster as a valid coda-onset sequence.",
        "We are not aware of any exhaustive study of possible French consonant clusters, although one can find discussions of particular clusters (e.g., Tranel [1987b:95ff] shows that CLj onset clusters are not tolerated).",

        "the classification of syllables and imposing suitable constraints on syllable sequences.",
        "Here is one way of doing this, following the same pattern that we saw in (55).",
        "This constraint states that it is not permissible to have an obstruent in a syllable coda if the following onset lacks an obstruent.",
        "Equivalently, we could say that if a syllable coda contains an obstruent then the following onset must also contain an obstruent.",
        "To see why these constraints are relevant to schwa, consider the case of demanderions, (also discussed by Tranel [198713]).",
        "The constraints in Figure 3 rule out *[dce.mitdrji5], since the underlined onset cluster is too complex.",
