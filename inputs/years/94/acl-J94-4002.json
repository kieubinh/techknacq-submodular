        "Sidner (1981, 1983), Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1983, 1986), Grosz and Sidner (1986), 21 The difficulty that RAP encounters with such cases was discussed in Section 4.1.",
        "We are experimenting with refinements in RAP's scoring mechanism to improve its performance in these and other cases.",
        "Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987), and Webber (1988) present different versions of this approach.",
        "Dynamic properties of discourse, especially coherence and focusing, are invoked as the primary basis for identifying antecedence candidates; selecting a candidate as the antecedent of a pronoun in discourse involves additional constraints of a syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic nature.",
        "In developing our algorithm, we have not attempted to consider elements of discourse structure beyond the simple model of attentional state realized by equivalence classes of discourse referents, salience degradation, and the sentence recency salience factor.",
        "The results of our experiments with computer manual texts (see Section 4.2) indicate that, at least for certain text domains, relatively simple models of discourse structure can be quite useful in pronominal anaphora resolution.",
        "We suspect that many aspects of discourse models discussed in the literature will remain computationally intractable for quite some time, at least for broad-coverage systems.",
        "A more extensive treatment of discourse structure would no doubt improve the performance of a structurally based algorithm such as RAP.",
        "At the very least, formatting information concerning paragraph and section boundaries, list elements, etc., should be taken into account.",
        "A treatment of definite NP resolution would also presumably lead to more accurate resolution of pronominal anaphora, since it would improve the reliability of the salience weighting mechanism.",
        "However, some current discourse-based approaches to anaphora resolution assign too dominant a role to coherence and focus in antecedent selection.",
        "As a result, they establish a strong preference for intersentential over intrasentential anaphora resolution.",
        "This is the case with the anaphora resolution algorithm described by Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987).",
        "This algorithm is based on the centering approach to modeling attentional structure in discourse (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983, 1986).22 Constraints and rules for centering are applied by the algorithm as part of the selection procedure for identifying the antecedents of pronouns in a discourse.",
        "The algorithm strongly prefers intersentential antecedents that preserve the center or maximize continuity in center change, to intrasentential antecedents that cause radical center shifts.",
        "This strong preference for intersentential antecedents is inappropriate for at least some text domains – in our corpus of computer manual texts, for example, we estimate that less than 20% of referentially used third person pronouns have intersentential antecedents.'",
        "There is a second difficulty with the Brennan et al.",
        "centering algorithm.",
        "It uses a hierarchy of grammatical roles quite similar to that of RAP, but this role hierarchy does not directly influence antecedent selection.",
        "Whereas the hierarchy in RAP contributes to a multidimensional measure of the relative salience of all antecedent candidates, in Brennan et al.",
        "1987, it is used only to constrain the choice of the backward-looking center, Cb, of an utterance.",
        "It does not serve as a general preference measure for antecedence.",
        "The items in the forward center list, Cf, are ranked according to the hierarchy of grammatical roles.",
        "For an utterance Un, Cb(Un) is required to be the highest ranked element of Cf (U„_1) that is realized in U.",
        "If an element E in the list of possible",
        "forward centers, Cf (Un_1), is identified as the antecedent of a pronoun in LIE, then E is realized in Un.",
        "The Brennan et al.",
        "centering algorithm does not require that the highest ranked element of Cf (Un_1) actually be realized in Un, but only that Cb(Un) be the highest ranked element of Cf (Un_1) which is, in fact, realized in Un.",
        "Antecedent selection is constrained by rules that sustain cohesion in the relations between the backward centers of successive utterances in a discourse, but it is not determined directly by the role hierarchy used to rank the forward centers of a previous utterance.",
        "Therefore, an NP in Un_1 that is relatively low in the hierarchy of grammatical roles can serve as an antecedent of a pronoun in Lin, provided that no higher ranked NP in U„_1 is taken as the antecedent of some other pronoun or definite NP in Lin.",
        "24 An example will serve to illustrate the problem with this approach.",
        "The display shows you the status of all the printers.",
        "It also provides options that control printers.",
        "The (ranked) forward center list for the first sentence is as follows: ( [DISPLAY] [STATUS] [YOU] [PRINTERS] ) .",
        "Applying the filters and ranking mechanism of Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (1987) yields two possible anchors.25 Each anchor determines a choice of Cb(Un) and the antecedent of it.",
        "One anchor identifies both with display, whereas the second takes both to be status.",
        "The hierarchy of grammatical roles is not used to select display over status.",
        "Nothing in the algorithm rules out the choice of status as the backward center for the second sentence and as the antecedent of it.",
        "If this selection is made, display is not realized in the second sentence, and so Cb(Un) is status, which is then the highest ranked element of Cf (Un_1) that is realized in Un, as required by constraint 3 of the Brennan et al.",
        "centering algorithm.",
        "In general, we agree with Alshawi (1987, p. 62) that an algorithm/model relying on the relative salience of all entities evoked by a text, with a mechanism for removing or filtering entities whose salience falls below a threshold, is preferable to models that \"make assumptions about a single (if shifting) focus of attention.\"'"

        "The systems described by Asher and Wada (1988), Carbonell and Brown (1988), and Rich and LuperFoy (1988) are examples of this mixed evaluation strategy.",

        "Thus, for example, Rich and LuperFoy (1988) propose a system that computes the global preference value of a candidate from the scores provided by a set of constraint source modules, in which each module invokes different sorts of conditions for ranking the antecedent candidate.",
        "The set of modules includes (among others) syntactic and morphological filters for checking agreement and syntactic conditions on disjoint reference, a procedure for applying semantic selection restrictions to a verb and its arguments, a component that uses contextual and real-world knowledge, and modules that represent both the local and global focus of discourse.",
        "The global ranking of an antecedent candidate is a function of the scores that it receives from each of the constraint source modules.",
        "Our algorithm also uses a mixed evaluation strategy.",
        "We have taken inspiration from the discussions of scoring procedures in the works cited above, but we have avoided constraint sources involving complex inferencing mechanisms and real-world knowledge, typically required for evaluating the semantic/pragmatic suitability of antecedent candidates or for determining details of discourse structure.",
        "In general, it seems to us that reliable large scale modelling of real-world and contextual factors is beyond the capabilities of current computational systems.",
        "Even constructing a comprehensive, computationally viable system of semantic selection restrictions and an associated type hierarchy for a natural language is an exceedingly difficult problem, which, to our knowledge, has yet to be solved.",
        "Moreover, our experiments with statistically based lexical preference information casts doubt on the efficacy of relatively inexpensive (and superficial) methods for capturing semantic and pragmatic factors for purposes of anaphora resolution.",
        "Our results suggest that scoring procedures which rely primarily on tractable syntactic and attentional (recency) properties can yield a broad coverage anaphora resolution system that achieves a good level of performance."

        "It scored higher than a version of Hobbs' algorithm that we implemented for Slot Grammar.",
        "Results of experiments with the test corpus show that the syntax-based elements of our salience weighting mechanism contribute in a complexly interdependent way to the overall effectiveness of the algorithm.",
        "The results also support the view that attentional state plays a significant role in pronominal anaphora resolution and demonstrate that even a simple model of attentional state can be quite effective.",
        "The addition of statistically measured lexical preferences to the range of factors that the algorithm considers only marginally improved its performance on the blind test set.",
        "Analysis of the results indicates that lexical preference information can be useful in cases in which the syntactic salience ranking does not provide a clear decision among the top candidates, and there is a strong lexical preference for one of the less salient candidates.",
        "The relatively high success rate of the algorithm suggests the viability of a computational model of anaphora resolution in which the relative salience of an NP in discourse is determined, in large part, by structural factors.",
        "In this model, semantic and real-world knowledge conditions apply to the output of an algorithm that resolves pronominal anaphora on the basis of syntactic measures of salience, recency,",
        "and frequency of mention.",
        "These conditions are invoked only in cases in which salience does not provide a clear-cut decision and/or there is substantial semantic–pragmatic support for one of the less salient candidates.'"
