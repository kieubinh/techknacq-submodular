        "This definition implies that a divergence may arise between two languages L1 and L2, independent of the way the translation is done (i.e., direct, transfer, or interlingual).",
        "However, it is also possible to define a divergence from an interlingual point of view, i.e., with respect to an underlying representation (lexical conceptual structure) that has been chosen to describe the source and target language sentences.",

        "Marantz takes issue with the characterization of such cases as an idiosyncratic relation between syntax and semantics and proposes, instead, that the conceptual structure looks different from what Jackendoff envisions.",
        "Whichever of these proposals is correct, neither Jackendoff nor Marantz considers their proposals in the context of interlingual machine translation.",
        "If the exceptional mappings are indeed arbitrary, then one needs to explain how this affects the handling of different languages.",
        "Moreover, neither Jackendoff nor Marantz mentions the possibility that the number of exceptional mappings might not be arbitrarily large, but that there might be a fixed number of exceptions, delineated in such a way that only a handful need to be considered at any time for any given language.",
        "This is why the formalization described in this paper is a valuable resource: it provides a means for proving that only certain types of exceptions are allowed and that the number of such exceptions is actually quite small.",

        "In terms of the mapping from the CLCS to the target-language sentence, this implies that the CLCS must be decomposed into (potentially overlapping) RLCSs whose \"union\" covers the entire CLCS.",

        "Once these positions are filled, the combination of the RLCSs for yo, dar, punaladas, a, and Juan covers the entire concept.",
        "Thus, the full coverage requirement is satisfied.",
        "It should be noted that a number of other systems have attempted to tackle divergences similar to those discussed in this paper without appealing to the notion of full coverage.",
        "Three examples of such systems are (1) GETA/ARIANE (Vauquois and Boitet 1985; Boitet 1987); (2) LMT (McCord 1989); and (3) METAL (Alonso 1990; Thurmair 1990).",

        "In particular, if the English sentence in (42) were realized as an embedded complement such as I think that the baby just fell, it would not be possible to generate the French output.",

        "This sentence is broken down into predicate–argument relations that conform (roughly) to the following logical specification: (45) think(I,fall(baby)) just(fall(baby)) Because the logical constituent fall(baby) is viewed as an argument of two logical heads, \"think\" and \"just,\" the LFG-MT generator cannot determine how to compose these concepts and produce an output string.",

        "That is, the \"just\" component of meaning is a modifier of the \"falling\" action, regardless of how this constituent is realized on the surface.",

      "heading": "6. Limitations and Conclusions",
      "text": [
        "The current approach has been implemented in a system called UNITRAN (Dorr 1990a, 1990b, 1993b).3° Many of the problems associated with the direct replacement and transfer approaches of previous systems have been eliminated in this new design.",
        "In particular, UNITRAN does not make use of analysis/synthesis rules that are meticulously tailored to each of the source and target languages, nor does it require detailed source-to-target transfer rules.",
        "On the other hand, because the system is designed (deliberately) to operate on one sentence at a time, it has a number of inherent limitations.",
        "In particular, the lack of a theory of multisententiality makes high quality translation difficult, since it is often the case that a single sentence in one language should be translated as two or more sentences in the other language; currently, UNITRAN does not allow for a mismatch between the number of source and target-language sentences.'",
        "Since generation has not been the primary focus of the current research, this and other generation problems have not yet been addressed in this framework.",
        "Such problems include cohesion (Granville 1983), selecting propositional and rhetorical goals (McKeown 1985), selecting open-class items from \"deep knowledge\" (Goldman",
        "1975; Jacobs 1985; Kittredge, Iordanskaja, and Polguere 1988; Nirenburg and Nirenburg 1988; Nirenburg et al.",
        "1992; among others), ordering propositions for producing coherent text (Hovy 1988), resolving anaphora (Derr and McKeown 1984; Sondheimer, Cumming, and Albano 1990; Werner and Nirenburg 1988), and many others.",
        "In fact, not all of these issues (e.g., selecting propositional and rhetorical goals) are directly relevant to the task of machine translation, which already has the advantage (at least from the generation point of view) that the source-language sentence and, in the current model, the conceptual analysis underlying this sentence are available at the onset of the generation process.",
        "Instead, the current research focuses on demonstrating the utility of the LCS-based interlingua and the associated parameters for resolving translation divergences while maintaining the systematic relation between the interlingua and the syntax.",
        "The tasks involved in achieving this objective have been reduced to what might be considered the standard \"what\" and \"how\" questions of generation: (1) lexical selection, i.e., the task of deciding what target-language words accurately reflect the meaning of the corresponding source-language words; and (2) syntactic realization, i.e., the task of determining how target-language words are mapped to their appropriate syntactic structures.",
        "In the context of the current model, the first task consists of matching the LCS-based interlingua (the CLCS) against the LCS-based entries (the RLCS) in the dictionary in order to select the appropriate word, and the second task consists of realizing the positions marked by * (and other parametric markers) into the appropriate syntactic structure.",
        "The question of lexical choice is one that deserves further discussion.",
        "The details of the matching process that achieves lexical selection of the target-language RLCSs (e.g., the selection of the RLCSs for like [or gustar] from the underlying CLCS shown in Definition 1) have not been presented here, but see Dorr (1993a) for a discussion with examples.",
        "Roughly, lexical selection in UNITRAN is a \"reverse\" unification-like process that matches the CLCS to the RLCS templates in the lexicon and chooses the associated lexical words accordingly.",
        "One of the important problems that must be considered with respect to lexical selection is that of overgeneration.'",
        "In particular, one might ask how the matcher knows whether it should try to choose phrases that restate the source language more succinctly in the target language, or whether it should be allowed to restate the source-language phrases more verbosely in the target language.",
        "This comes up in cases such as the stab example given earlier.",
        "It turns out that the word stab can be translated into Spanish as the succinct form apunalar, or as the more verbose form dar punaladas.",
        "Similarly, in the reverse direction, the translation of dar punaladas is the more succinct form stab; however, one could conceive of a more verbose translation (e.g., inflict knife wounds or even give knife wounds).",
        "Currently, there is no preference assignment during lexical selection (as in Nirenburg and Nirenburg 1988; Wilks 1973); instead, the system requires an exact match of the CLCS to the target-language RLCS (or some combination of RLCSs).",
        "If there is more than one way of matching the CLCS, multiple forms will be generated (although we have discussed only one target-language form, dar punaladas, for the stab example).",
        "A first-pass approach to resolving such cases of overgeneration (based on aspectual features) is discussed in Dorr (1992a) and in more detail in Dorr (1993b).",
        "In addition, a model",
        "of generation based on theories of tense by Allen (1983, 1984), Hornstein (1990), and Reichenbach (1947) is discussed in Dorr and Gaasterland (1992) and Dorr (1993b).",
        "The difficulty of the lexical choice problem will become more important as the system grows beyond its current prototypical state.",
        "Research is currently underway to extend the system by developing automatic lexical acquisition procedures that make use of a small set of conceptual structures, as a starting point, and then acquire syntactic and semantic information on the basis of these initial representations plus machine-readable definitions from the Longman's Dictionary of Contemporary English (Proctor 1978).",
        "(LDOCE is useful because it includes collocations and sense frequency, thus making it possible to determine the argument structures for different words.)",
        "This investigation will benefit from the work of several researchers in the field of automatic lexicon construction, most notably, Brent (1993), Boguraev and Briscoe (1989), Boguraev and Pustejovsky (1990), Briscoe and Copestake (1990), Byrd et al.",
        "(1987), Far-well, Guthrie, and Wilks (1992), Montemagni and Vanderwende (1992), Pustejovsky (1987), Pustejovsky and Bergler (1987), and Pustejovsky, Bergier, and Anick (1993), among others.",
        "In particular, it has been argued convincingly by Farwell, Guthrie, and Wilks (1992) that resources such as the LDOCE are useful for constructing dictionary representations for languages other than English, thus paving the way for scaling up interlingual machine translations so that they have broader coverage.",
        "Once this extension is complete, we intend to scale up the UNITRAN system and test the LCS approach to lexical choice on a broader set of phenomena using a larger lexicon.",
        "The current framework provides a systematic classification of machine translation divergences.",
        "We have shown how this classification can be formally defined and systematically resolved through the use of general mapping relations and a small set of cross-linguistic parameters.",
        "Because the parameters are used to factor out \"transfer\" information, the current approach obviates the need for transfer rules.",
        "We have provided evidence that supports the view that the lexical–semantic divergence classification proposed in the current framework covers all lexical–semantic divergences that arise during translation (i.e., divergences based on properties associated with lexical entries that are not based on purely syntactic information, idiomatic usage, aspectual knowledge, discourse knowledge, domain knowledge, or world knowledge).",
        "Since the characterization of the range of potential divergences is manageably small, the task of accommodating divergences is immensely simplified.",
        "We have also demonstrated the usefulness of a full coverage requirement as a tool that allows one to judge whether a particular target-language sentence fully covers the concept that underlies the corresponding source-language sentence.",
        "Finally, we have shown, formally, that the current model accommodates interacting divergence types."
