        "The first problem we address is that of combining different functions, each of which is supposed to offer some contribution to selecting the best among a set of analyses of a sentence.",
        "Although multiple functions have been used in other systems (for example, McCord 1990; Hobbs and Bear 1990), little is typically said about how the functions are combined to produce the overall score for an analysis, the weights presumably being determined by intuition or trial and error.",
        "McCord (1993) gives very specific information about the weights he uses to combine preference functions, though these weights are chosen by hand.",
        "Selecting weights by hand, however, is a task for experts, which needs to be redone every time the system is applied to a new domain or corpus.",
        "Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the selected weights will achieve optimal or even near-optimal performance.",
        "The speech-processing community, on the other hand, has a longer history of using numerical evaluation functions, and speech researchers have used schemes for scoring recognition hypotheses that are similar to the one proposed here for disambiguation.",
        "For example, Ostendorf et al.",
        "(1991) improve recognition performance by using a linear combination of several scoring functions.",
        "In their work the weights for the linear combination are chosen to optimize a generalized mean of the rank of the correct word sequence.",
        "In our case, the problem is formulated as follows.",
        "Each preference function is defined as a numerical (possibly real-valued) function on representations corresponding to the sentence analyses.",
        "A weighted sum of these functions is then used as the overall measure to rank the possible analyses of a particular sentence.",
        "We refer to the coefficients, or weights, used in this linear combination as the \"scaling factors\" for the functions.",

        "The results we present show that these functions vary considerably in disambiguation accuracy, but that the best collocation functions are more effective than a function based on simple estimates of syntactic rule probabilities.",
        "In particular, the best collocation function performs significantly better than a related function that defines collocation strength in terms of mutual information, reducing the error rate in a disambiguation task from approximately 30% to approximately 10%.",

        "1993).",
        "The work presented here is all concerned with the English analysis side, though we see no reason why its conclusions should not be applicable to Swedish or other natural languages.",
        "In our experiments we made use of the Air T.c.vel Information System (ATIS) corpus of transcribed speech sentences.",
        "This application was chosen because the proposed method for automatic derivation of scaling factors requires a corpus of sentences that are representative of the sublanguage, together with some independent measure of the correctness or plausibility of analyses of these sentences.",
        "In addition, we had access to a hand-parsed subcollection of the ATIS corpus built as part of the Penn Treebank project (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993).",
        "Another reason for choosing ATIS was that it consists of several thousand sentences in a constrained discourse domain, which helped avoid sparseness problems in training collocation functions.' In the various experiments, the alternatives we are choosing between are analyses expressed in the version of quasi logical form (QLF) described by Alshawi and Crouch (1992).",
        "QLFs express semantic content, but are derived compositionally from complete syntactic analyses of a sentence and therefore mirror much syntactic structure as well.",
        "However, the use of QLF analyses is not central to our method: the important thing is that the representation used is rich enough to support a variety of preference functions.",
        "We have experimented with combinations of around 30 different functions and use 20 of them in our spoken language translation system; the others contribute so little to overall performance that their computational cost cannot be justified.",
        "This default set of 20 was used throughout the scaling factor work described in Sections 3 and 4.",
        "It consists of 1 collocation-based function and 19 non-collocation-based ones.",
        "The work described in Section 6 involved substituting single alternative collocation-based functions for the single one in the set of 20.",
        "Many (unscaled) preference functions simply return integers corresponding to counts of particular constructs in the representation, such as the number of expressions corresponding to adjuncts, unresolved ellipses, particular attachment configurations, or balanced conjunctions.",
        "There are also some real-valued functions, including the semantic collocation functions discussed in Section 5.",
        "To illustrate how the system works, consider the ATIS sentence \"Do I get dinner on this flight?\" The CLE assigns two analyses to this sentence; in one of them, QH, \"on this flight\" attaches high to \"get,\" and in the other, QL, it attaches low to \"dinner.\" Four functions return non-zero scores on these analyses.",
        "Two of them, Low 1 and Low2, prefer low attachment; the difference between them is an implementation detail that can be ignored here.",
        "A third, SynRules, returns an estimate of the log probability of the syntactic rules used to construct the analysis.",
        "A fourth, SemColl, is a semantic collocation function.",
        "The scores, after multiplying by scaling factors, are as shown in Table 1.",
        "The SemColl function is the only one that prefers QH to QL.",

        "This is followed by statistical analysis to produce the following functions of each triple in the observed triple population.",
        "The first two functions have been used in other work on collocation; some authors use simple pairs rather than triples (i.e., no relation, just two words) when computing collocation strengths, so direct comparisons are a little difficult.",
        "The third function is an original variant of the second; the fourth is original; and the fifth is prompted by the arguments of Dunning (1993).",
        "• Mutual information: this relates the probability Pi(a)P2(b)P3(c) of the triple (a, b, c) assuming independence between its three fields, where",
        "Pp(x) is the probability of observing x in position p, with the probability A estimated from actual observations of triples derived from analyses ranked highest (or joint highest) in training score.",
        "More specifically, we use ln{A/ [Pi (a)P2(b)P3(C)1}*",
        "• x2: compares the expected frequency E of a triple with the square of the difference between E and the observed frequency F of the triple.",
        "Here the observed frequency is in analyses ranked highest (or joint highest) in training score, and the \"expected\" frequency assumes independence between triple fields.",
        "More specifically we use IF – El * (F – E)/E.",
        "This variant of x2, in which the numerator is signed, is used so that the function is monotonic, making it more suitable in preference functions.",
        "• x: as x2, but the quantity used is (F –E)/A, as large values of F –E have a tendency to swamp the x2 function.",
        "• Mean distance: the average of the relativized training score for all QLF analyses (not necessarily the highest ranked ones) that include the semantic collocation corresponding to the triple.",
        "In other words, the mean distance value for a triple is the mean amount by which a QLF giving rise to that triple falls short of a perfect score.",
        "• Likelihood ratio: for each triple (H1, R, H2), the ratio of the maximum likelihood of the triple, given the distribution of triples in correct",
        "analyses of the training data, on the assumption that H1 and H2 are independent given R, to the maximum likelihood without that assumption.",
        "(See Dunning 1993, for a fuller explanation of the use of likelihood ratios.)",
        "Computation of the mutual information and x2 functions for triples involves the simple smoothing technique, suggested by Ken Church, of adding 0.5 to actual counts.",
        "From these five functions on triples, we define five semantic collocation preference functions applied to QLFs, in each case by averaging over the result of applying the function to each triple derived from a QLF.",
        "We refer to these functions by the same names as their underlying functions on triples.",
        "The collocation functions are normalized by multiplying up by the number of words in the sentence to which the function is being applied.",
        "This normalization keeps scores for QLFs in the same sentence comparable, while at the same time ensuring that the triple function scores tend to grow with sentence length in the same way that the non-collocation functions tend to do.",
        "Thus the optimality of a set of scaling factors is relatively insensitive to sentence length.",
        "Our use of the mean distance function was motivated by the desire to take into account additional information from the training material that is not exploited by the other collocation functions.",
        "Specifically, it takes into account all analyses proposed by the system, as well as the magnitude of the training score.",
        "In contrast, the other collocation functions make use only of the training score to select the best analysis of a sentence, discarding the rest.",
        "Another way of putting this is that the mean distance function is making use of negative examples and a measure of the degree of unacceptability of an analysis."

        "An evaluation of each function acting alone on the five held-out sets of test data yielded the numbers of correctly processed sentences shown in Table 4.",
        "The figures for the random baseline are repeated from Table 2.",
        "We also show, for comparison, the results for a function that scores a QLF according to the sum of the logs of the estimated probabilities of the syntactic rules used in its construction.'",
        "In cases where a function judged N QLFs equally plausible, of which 0 < G < N were correct, we assigned a fractional count G/N to that sentence; a random choice among the N QLFs would pick a correct one with probability G/N.",
        "For significance tests, which require binary data, we took a function as performing correctly only if all the QLFs it selected were correct.",
        "Such ties did not occur at all for the other experiments reported in this paper.",
        "A pairwise comparison of the results shows that all the differences between collocational functions are statistically highly significant.",
        "The syntactic rule cost function is significantly worse than all the collocational functions except the mutual information one, for which the difference is not significant either way.",
        "(There may, of course, exist better syntactic functions than the one we have tried.)",
        "The mean distance function is much superior to all the others when acting alone.",
        "Presumably, this function has an edge over the other functions because it exploits the additional information from negative examples and degree of correctness.",
        "The difference in performance between our syntactic and semantic preference functions is broadly in line with the results presented by Chang, Luo, and Su (1992), who use probabilities of semantic category tuples.",
        "However, this similarity in the results should be taken with some caution, because our syntactic preference function is rather crude, and because our best semantic function (mean distance) uses the additional information mentioned above.",
        "This information is not normally taken into account by direct estimates of tuple probabilities.",
        "When 1 collocation function is selected to act together with the 19 non-collocation-based functions from the default set (the set defined in Section 2 and used in the experiments on scaling factor calculation), the picture changes slightly.",
        "In this context, when scaling factors are calculated in the usual way, by least squares followed by hill climbing, the results for the best 3 of the above functions are as shown in Table 5.",
        "The difference between the mean distance function and the other 2 functions is still highly significant; therefore this function is chosen to be the only collocational one to be included in the default set of 20 (hence the \"mean distance\" condition here is the same as the \"hill-climbing\" condition in Section 4).",
        "However, the difference between the x and x2 functions is no longer quite so clear cut, and the relative advantage of the mean distance function compared with the x function is less.",
        "It may be that other preference functions make up for some shortfall of the x function that is, at least in part, taken into account by the mean distance function.",
        "7.",
        "Conclusion We have presented a relatively simple analytic technique for automatically determining a set of scaling factors for preference functions used in semantic disambiguation.",

        "Hiyan Alshawi and David Carter Training and Scaling Preference Functions training procedure and are further improved by comparison with instances of the task they are intended to perform.",
        "The experimental results presented indicate that, by using a fairly crude training score measure (comparing only phrase structure trees) with a few thousand training sentences, the method can yield a set of scaling factors that are significantly better than those derived by a labor-intensive hand-tuning effort.",
        "We have also confirmed empirically that considerable differences exist between the effectiveness of differently formulated collocation functions for disambiguation.",
        "The experiments provide a basis for selecting among different collocational functions and suggest that a collocation function must be evaluated in the context of other functions, rather than on its own, if the correct selection is to be made.",
        "It should be possible to extend this work fruitfully in several directions, including the following.",
        "Training with a measure defined directly on semantic representations is likely to lead to a further reduction in the disambiguation error rate.",
        "The method for computing scaling factors described here has more recently been applied to optimizing preference selection for the task of choosing between analyses arising from different word hypotheses in a speech recognition system (Rayner et al.",
        "1994) and is applicable to other problems, such as choosing between possible target representations in a machine translation system.",
        "Finally, it would be interesting to combine the work on semantic collocation functions with that on similarity-based clustering (Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993; Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1993), with the aim of overcoming the problem of sparse training data.",
        "If this is successful, it might make these functions suitable for disambiguation in domains with larger vocabularies than ATIS."
