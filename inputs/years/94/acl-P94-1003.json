        "Our central model of a discourse grammar is the Linguistic Discourse Model (LDA4) most often associated with Scha, Polanyi, and their co-workers (Polanyi and Scha 1984, Scha and Polanyi 1988, Priist 1992, and most recently in Priist, Scha and van den Berg 1994).",

        "These are simple clauses whose syntax and underresolved semantics have been determined by a sentence grammar but whose fully resolved final form can only be calculated by their integration into the current discourse and its context.",
        "The rules of the discourse grammar act to establish the rhetorical relations between constituents and to perform resolution of those anaphors whose interpretation can be seen as a function of discourse coherence (as opposed to those whose interpretation relies on general knowledge).",
        "For illustrative purposes, we focus here on Priist's rules for building one particular type of rhetorical relation, labelled \"list\" (Priist 1992).",
        "His central thesis is that for Dcus to be combined into a list they must exhibit a degree of syntactic-semantic parallelism and that this parallelism will strongly determine the way in which some kinds of anaphor are resolved.",
        "The clearest example of this is VP-ellipsis as in (la) but Priist also claims that the subject and object pronouns in (lb) and (lc) are parallelism-dependent anaphors when they occur in list structures and must therefore be resolved to the corresponding fully referential subject/object in the first member of the list.",

        "In (2) these features are sem (the unresolved semantic interpretation of the category), consem (the contextually resolved semantic interpretation), and schema (the semantic information that is common between the daughter categories).",
        "Priist calls the operation used to calculate the value for schema the most specific common denominator (mscD, indicated by the symbol q).",
        "The MSCD of C1 and S2 is defined as the most specific generalization of C1 that can unify with S2.",
        "It is essential that the result should be contentful to a degree that confirms that the list structure is an appropriate analysis, and to this end Priist imposes the condition that the value of schema should",
        "be a characteristic generalization of the information contributed by the two daughters.",
        "There is no formal definition of this notion; it would require knowledge from many sources to determine whether sufficient informativeness had been achieved.",

        "So in PrUst's rule the MSCD operation plays two distinct roles, first as a test for parallelism (as the value of the mother's schema) and second as a basis for resolution (in the composite operation which is the value of the second daughter's consem).",
