        "In this paper, we claim that a variety of facts concerning ellipsis resolution, event reference, and interclausal coherence can be explained by the interaction between the syntactic and semantic properties of the form in question and the type of discourse inference operative in establishing the coherence of the antecedent and elided clauses.",

        "In Kehler (1993b), we presented an analysis of VP-ellipsis that distinguished between two types of relationship between clauses, parallel and non-parallel.",
        "An architecture was presented whereby utterances were parsed into propositional representations which were subsequently integrated into a discourse model.",
        "It was posited that VP-ellipsis could access either propositional or discourse model representations: in the case of parallel constructions, the source resided in the propositional representation; in the case of non-parallel constructions, the source had been integrated into the discourse model.",
        "In Kehler (1994), we showed how this architecture also accounted for the facts that Levin and Prince noted about gapping.",
        "The current work improves upon that analysis in several respects.",
        "First, it no longer needs to be posited that syntactic representations disappear when integrated into the discourse mode1;15 instead, syntactic and semantic representations coexist.",
        "Second, various issues with regard to the interpretation of propositional representations are now rendered moot.",
        "Third, there is no longer a dichotomy with respect to the level of representation from which VP-ellipsis locates and copies antecedents.",
        "Instead, two distinct factors have been separated out: the resolution of missing constituents under Common Topic inference is purely syntactic whereas the resolution of anaphoric expressions in all cases is purely semantic; the apparent dichotomy in VP-ellipsis data arises out of the interaction between these different phenomena.",
        "Finally, the current approach more readily scales up to more complex cases.",
        "For instance, it was not clear in the previous account how non-parallel constructions embedded within parallel constructions would be handled, as in sentences (27a-b): Clinton was introduced by John because Mary had refused to, and Gore was too.",

        "However, this aspect was crucial for handling the gapping data, since the infelicity of gapping in non-parallel constructions hinged on there no longer being a propositional representation available as a source.",
        "Priist utilizing a mixed representation (called syntactic/semantic structures) and Asher utilizing Discourse Representation Theory constructs, each defines mechanisms for determining relations such as parallelism and contrast, and gives constraints on resolving VP-ellipsis and related forms within their more general frameworks.",
        "However, each essentially follows Sag in requiring that elided VP representations be alphabetic variants of their referents.",
        "This constraint rules out cases where VP-ellipsis obtains syntactically mismatched antecedents, such as example (19) and other non-parallel cases given in Kehler (1993b).",
        "It also appears that neither approach can account for the infelicity of mixed gapping/VP-ellipsis cases such as sentence (25)."
