        "Furthermore, there are good reasons for generating indirect answers instead of just yes, no, or I don't know.",

        "Second, they contribute to an efficient dialogue by anticipating follow-up questions.",

        "This paper provides a computational model for the interpretation and generation of indirect answers to Yes-No questions in English.",
        "More precisely, by a Yes-No question we mean one or more utterances used as a request by Q (the questioner) that R (the responder) convey R's evaluation of the truth of a proposition p. An indirect answer implicitly conveys via one or more utterances R's evaluation of the truth of the questioned proposition p, i.e. that p is true, that p is false, that there is some truth to p, that p may be true, or that p may be false.",
        "Our model presupposes that Q's question has been understood by R as intended by Q, that Q's request was appropriate, and that Q and It are engaged in a cooperative goal-directed dialogue.",
        "The interpretation and generation components of the model have been implemented in Common Lisp on a Sun SPARCstation.",
        "The model employs an agent's pragmatic knowledge of how language typically is used to answer Yes-No questions in English to constrain the process of generating and interpreting indirect answers.",
        "This knowledge is encoded as a set of domain-independent discourse plan operators and a set of coherence rules, described in section 2.1 Figure 1 shows the architecture of our system.",
        "It is reversible in that the same pragmatic knowledge is used by the interpretation and generation modules.",
        "The interpretation algorithm, described in section 3, is a hybrid approach employing both plan inference and logical inference to infer It's discourse plan.",

        "Linguists (e.g. see discussion in [Levinson, 1983]) have claimed that use of an utterance in a dialogue may create shared expectations about subsequent utterances.",
        "In particular, a Yes-No question creates the discourse expectation that R will provide R's evaluation of the truth of the questioned proposition p. Furthermore, Q's assumption that R's response is relevant triggers Q's attempt to interpret R's response as providing the requested information.",
        "We have observed that coherence relations similar to the subject-matter relations of Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) [Mann and Thompson, 1987] can be used in defining constraints on the relevance of.an indirect answer.",
        "For example, the relation between the (implicit) direct answer in (2b) and each of the indirect answers in (2c) - (2e) is similar to RST's relations of Condition, Elaboration, and (Volitional) Cause, respectively.",
        "2.a.",
        "Q: Are you going shopping tonight?",
        "b. R: [yes] c. if I finish my homework d. I'm going to Macy's e. Winter clothes are on sale",
        "Furthermore, for Q to interpret any of (2c) - (2e) as conveying an affirmative answer, Q must believe that R intended Q to recognize the relational proposition holding between the indirect answer and (2b), e.g. that (2d) is an elaboration of (2b).",
        "Also, coherence relations hold between parts of an indirect answer consisting of multiple utterances.",
        "For example, (le) describes the cause of the failure reported in (1d).",
        "Finally, we have observed that different relations are usually associated with different types of answers.",
        "Thus, a speaker who has inferred a plausible coherence relation holding between an indirect answer and a possible (implicit) direct answer may be able to infer the direct answer.",
        "(If more than one coherence relation",
        "is plausible, or if the same coherence relation is used with more than one type of answer, then the indirect answer may be ambiguous.)",
        "In our model we formally represent the coherence relations which constrain indirect answers by means of coherence rules.",
        "Each rule consists of a consequent of the form (Plausible (CR q p)) and an antecedent which is a conjunction of conditions, where CR is the name of a coherence relation and q and p are formulae, symbols prefixed with \"?\"",
        "are variables, and all variables are implicitly universally quantified.",
        "Each antecedent condition represents a condition which is true if it is believed by R to be mutually believed with Q.2 Each rule represents sufficient conditions for the plausibility of (CR q p) for some CR, q, p. An example of one of the rules describing the Obsta-'Our model of R's beliefs (and similarly for Q's), represented as a set of Horn clauses, includes 1) general world knowledge presumably shared with Q, 2) knowledge about the preceding discourse, and 3) R's beliefs (including \"weak beliefs\") about Q's beliefs.",
        "Much of the shared world knowledge needed to evaluate the coherence rules consists of knowledge from domain plan operators.",
        "cle relation' is shown in Figure 2.",
        "The predicates used in the rule are defined as follows: (in-state p t) denotes that p holds during t, (occur p t) denotes that p happens during t, (state x) denotes that the type of x is state, (event x) denotes that the type of x is event, (timeperiod t) denotes that t is a time interval, (before tl t2) denotes that ti begins before or at the same time as t2, (app-cond q p) denotes that q is a plausible enabling condition for doing p, and (unless p) denotes that p is not provable from the beliefs of the reasoner.",
        "For example, this rule describes the relation between (1d) and (1c), where (1d) is interpreted as (not (in-state (running R-car) Present)) and (1c) as (not (occur (go-shopping R) Future)).",
        "That is, this relation would be plausible if Q and R share the belief that a plausible enabling condition of a subaction of a plan for R to go shopping at the mall is that R's car be in running condition.",
        "In her study of responses to questions, StenstrOm [StenstrOrn, 1984] found that direct answers are often accompanied by extra, relevant information,' and noted that often this extra information is similar in content to an indirect answer.",
        "Thus, the above constraints on the relevance of an indirect answer can serve also as constraints on information accompanying a direct answer.",
        "For maximum generality, therefore, we went beyond our original goal of handling indirect answers to the goal of handling what we call full answers.",
        "A full answer consists of an implicit or explicit direct answer (which we call the nucleus) and, possibly, extra, relevant information (satelliies).5 In our",

        "By representing answer types as plan operators, generation can be modeled as plan construction, and interpretation as plan recognition.",

        "Applicability conditions are necessary conditions for appropriate use of a plan operator.",
        "For example, it is inappropriate for R to give an affirmative answer that p if R believes p is false.",

The recognition process for non-primitive actions differs in that these operators contain existential variables which must be instantiated.",

        "We have described our implemented computational model for interpreting and generating indirect answers to Yes-No questions.",
        "Its main features are 1) a discourse-plan-based approach to implicature, 2) a reversible architecture, 3) a hybrid reasoning model, and 4) use of stimulus conditions for modeling a speaker's motivation for providing appropriate extra information.",
        "The model handles a wider range of types of indirect answers than previous computational models.",
        "Furthermore, since Yes-No questions and their answers have features in common with other types of adjacency pairs [Levinson, 1983], we expect that this approach can be extended to them as well.",
        "Finally, a discourse-plan-based approach to implicature has significant advantages over a licensing-rule-based approach.",
        "In the future, we would like to integrate our interpretation and generation components with a dialogue system and investigate other factors in generating indirect answers (e.g. multiple goals, stylistic concerns)."
