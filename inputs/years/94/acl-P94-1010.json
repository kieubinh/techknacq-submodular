        "The initial step of any text analysis task is the tok-enization of the input into words.",
        "For many writing systems, using whitespace as a delimiter for words yields reasonable results.",
        "However, for Chinese and other systems where whitespace is not used to delimit words, such trivial schemes will not work.",
        "Chinese writing is moiphosyllabic (DeFrancis, 1984), meaning that each hanzi– 'Chinese character' – (nearly always) represents a single syllable that is (usually) also a single morpheme.",
        "Since in Chinese, as in English, words may be polysyllabic, and since hanzi are written with no intervening spaces, it is not trivial to reconstruct which hanzi to group into words.",
        "While for some applications it may be possible to bypass the word-segmentation problem and work straight from hanzi, there are several reasons why this approach will not work in a text-to-speech (TI'S) system for Mandarin Chinese – the primary intended application of our segmenter.",
        "These reasons include:",
        "1.",
        "Many hanzi are homographs whose pronunciation depends upon word affiliation.",
        "So, (1/9 is pronounced de01 when it is a prenominal modification marker, but di4 in the word El Efl mu4di4 'goal': tt is normally ganl 'dry', but qian2 in a person's given name.",

        "tle rat', becomes xiao3 I lao2-shu3 1, rather than xiao2 I lao2-shu3 J, because the rule first applies within the word lao3-shu3, blocking its phrasal application.",

        "Chen and Liu's (1992) algorithm matches words of an input sentence against a dictionary; in cases where various parses are possible, a set of heuristics is applied to disambiguate the analyses.",
        "Various morphological rules are then applied to allow for morphologically complex words that are not in the dictionary.",

        "For an application like TI'S, however, it is necessary to know that a particular sequence of hanzi is of a particular category because, for example, that knowledge could affect the pronunciation.",

        "However, for our purposes it is not sufficient to represent the morphological decomposition of, say, plural nouns: we also need an estimate of the cost of the resulting word.",

        "Given names are most commonly two hanzi long, occasionally one-hanzi long: there are thus four possible name types.",

        "First, the model assumes independence between the first and second hanzi of a double GIVEN name.",
        "Yet, some hanzi are far more probable in women's names than they are in men's names, and there is a similar list of male-oriented hanzi: mixing hanzi from these two lists is generally less likely than would be predicted by the independence model.",
        "As a partial solution, for pairs of hanzi that cooccur sufficiently often in our namelists, we use the estimated bigram cost, rather than the independence-based cost.",
        "The second weakness is that Chang et al.",
        "(1992) assign a uniform small cost to unseen hanzi in GIVEN names; but we know that some unseen hanzi are merely accidentally missing, whereas others are missing for a reason – e.g., because they have a bad connotation.",
        "We can address this problem by first observing that for many hanzi, the general 'meaning' is indicated by its so-called 'semantic radical'.",
        "Hanzi that share the same 'radical', share an easily identifiable structural component: the plant names NI, M and M share the GRASS radical; malady names 6, , and M share the SICKNESS radical; and ratlike animal names 21, M, and a share the RAT radical.",
        "Some classes are better for names than others: in our corpora, many names are picked from the GRASS class, very few from the SICKNESS class, and none from the RAT class.",

        "Assuming unseen objects within each class are equiprobable, their probabilities are given by the Good-Turing theorem as:",

        "The use of the Good-Turing equation presumes suitable estimates of the unknown expectations it requires.",
        "In the denominator, the Nis are well measured by counting, and we replace the expectation by the observation.",
        "In the numerator, however, the counts of NI are quite irregular, including several zeros (e.g. RAT, none of whose members were seen).",
        "However, there is a strong relationship between Nis and the number of hanzi in the class.",
        "For E(.113), then, we substitute a smooth against the number of class elements.",

        "The final estimating equation is then:",
        "The total of all these class estimates was about 10% off from the Turing estimate NUN for the probability of all unseen hanzi, and we renormalized the estimates so that they would sum to MIN.",
        "This class-based model gives reasonable results: for six radical classes, Table 1 gives the estimated cost for an unseen hanzi in the class occurring as the second hanzi in a double GIVEN name.",
