        "Clark and Schaefer (1989) suggested that acknowledgments are an important component of a larger framework through which communicating parties provide evidence of understanding.",
        "Conversants have a range of means, which vary with respect to strength, for indicating acceptance of a presentation.",
        "These include continued attention, initiation of the next relevant contribution, acknowledgment, demonstration.",
        "and display.",
        "Thus acknowledgments are common linguistic devices used to provide feedback.",
        "Broadly speaking, acknowledgments are responsive acts.1 That is, they are usually uttered in (possibly partial) response to a production by another speaker; acknowledgment acts express beliefs and intentions of one conversant with respect to the mutuality of prior exchanges involving some other conversant.",
        "The intended perlocutionary effect of an acknowledgment act is generally the perception of mutuality of some belief.",
        "In previous research, the function of acknowledgments has been most readily characterized in terms of attention, understanding and acceptance on the recipient's behalf (Kendon, 1967; Schegloff, 1982).",
        "In addition, it has been suggested that they serve to facilitate active participation in dialogues and promote \"smooth\" conversations (Duncan and Fiske, 1987).",
        "Schegloff (1982) described two main types of acknowledgment: continuers and assessments.",
        "Continuers, such as \"uh huh,\" \"quite,\" and \"I see,\" act as bridges between units.",
        "Conversants use acknowledgments as continuers to signal continued attention and to display the recipient's understanding that the speaker is in an extended turn that is not yet complete.",
        "Moreover, continuers indicate the turning down of an opportunity to undertake a repair subdialogue regarding the previous utterance or to initiate a new turn.",
        "Assessments – such as \"oh wow\" and \"gosh, really?\" – are essentially an elaboration on continuers.",
        "That is, they occur in much the same environment and have similar properties to continuers, but in addition express a brief assessment of the previous utterance.",
        "Empirical analysis of conversations has indicated that the occurrence of acknowledgments is not arbitrary.",
        "Acknowledgments mostly occur at or near major grammatical boundaries, which serve as transition-relevance places for turn-taking (Sacks et al., 1974; Hopper, 1992).",
        "In particular, work by Orestrom (1983) and Goodwin (1986) suggested a tendency for continuers to overlap with the primary speaker's contribution, in such a way that they serve as bridges between two turn-constructional units.",
        "Assessments, on the other hand, are generally engineered without overlap.",
        "Goodwin suggested that conversants make special efforts to prevent assessments from intruding into subsequent units.",
        "That is, the speaker typically delays production of the subsequent unit until the recipient's assessment has been brought to completion.",
        "Clearly, acknowledgments are an important device for providing evidence of understanding and for avoiding miscommunication between parties.",
        "Just as next-relevant-contributions include the entire range of potential task or domain actions, the task-based role of acknowledgments can be differentiated within their class as acceptances.",
        "Beyond continuers and assessments, we will demonstrate that acknowledgments incorporate a larger set of conversational actions, many of which relate to coherence of multi-utterance contributions."

        "The generally accepted view of acknowledgments, as noted earlier, distinguishes between two classes – namely continuers and assessments (Schegloff, 1982).",
        "Indeed, there were many occurrences of continuers (and a few assessments) in the VNS corpus.",
        "However, our analysis suggests that acknowledgments perform functions beyond these two classes.",
        "For instance, we observed several instances of acknowledgment being used at the beginning of a turn by the same speaker.",
        "This contrasts with the notions of continuers and assessments which, by definition, occur as unitary productions in the context of extended turns by another speaker.",
        "Clearly, an acknowledgment occurring at the beginning of a turn is not serving as a prompt for the other speaker to continue.",
        "To account for the evidence provided by the VNS corpus, we propose to extend Schegloff's classification scheme into a task-based model of acknowledgment acts.",
        "This model formalizes the meaning and usage characteristics of acknowledgments, based on an analysis of what acknowledgments mean and when acknowledgments are used in the VNS dialogues.",
        "A useful way of looking at the role of acknowledgments in the context of turns is to consider the basic structural context of exchanges.",
        "We begin by reviewing the concept of an adjacency pair (Schegloff and Sacks, 1973; Clark and Schae",
        "fer, 1989).",
        "An adjacency pair is formed by two consecutive utterances that have a canonical relationship, such as question-answer and greeting-greeting.",
        "An acknowledgment can be produced as the second phase of an adjacency pair or following a complete adjacency pair; in each case, the utterance may contain multiple acceptances.",
        "Of course, an acknowledgment can be produced also as a single turn that does not relate to an adjacency pair.",
        "Thus, based on exchange structure one can distinguish three broad structural classes of acknowledgments:2",
        "• Other-+ ackn, where the acknowledgment forms the second phase of an adjacency pair; • Self-+ other-4 ackn, where Self initiates an exchange, Other (eventually) completes the exchange, and Self then utters an acknowledgment; and • S elf+ ackn, where Self includes an acknowledgment in an utterance outside of an adjacency pair.",
        "In the other--■ ackn class, the exchange is a basic adjacency pair; Other's act will be composed of a single turn.",
        "In the self other-4 ackn class, the exchange initiated and eventually acknowledged by Self may be composed of multiple turns, with multiple utterances by both Self and Other.",
        "In the self+ ackn class, the acknowledgment occurs in a single, extended turn by Self that may contain multiple utterances."

        "Why is a conversation-analytic study of acknowledgment useful in the development of spoken language systems?",
        "SLSs developers face the dual challenges of creating both domain-based dialogues and repair-oriented dialogues.",
        "Lacking systematic mechanisms for natural maintenance of mutuality, SLSs tend to rely on domain structures – producing rather stolid interaction.",
        "The most advanced systems incorporate repair acts, but are unable to relate the repairs to the main dialogue structures in a natural way.",
        "The acknowledgment model described in this paper provides a systematic method of maintaining mutuality of knowledge for both domain and control information.",
        "More concretely, using this model SLSs can account for acknowledgments by both user and system.",
        "The corpus evidence suggests that users' utterances in unconstrained dialogues contain many instances of acknowledgment.",
        "In interpreting these utterances, identification of the appropriate acknowledgment function affects the state of the dialogue model and thus plays an important role in determining an appropriate response by the system.",
        "In producing such responses, the acknowledgment model can provide structurally appropriate utterances.",
        "The fundamental idea is to produce contextually appropriate acknowledgments that advances the dialogue seamlessly with respect to both domain and control functions.",
        "That is, the system needs to give the right signals at the right time.",
        "The evidence of the U S WEST VNS corpus suggests that understanding and production of domain and control utterances are closely linked; they thus cannot be implemented as independent mechanisms in an SLS.",
        "For example, giving directions involves presenting large amounts of information for which an installment approach often proved effective.",
        "Typically the user was given the opportunity to choose the style of presentation of",
        "directions, either step-by-step or all at once.",
        "The choice of presentation method by the conversants was a dynamic one: in cases where it became apparent that the user was experiencing difficulties with either hearing or understanding directions, the wizard often resorted to the step-by-step approach.",
        "This form of repair changed the process of interaction so that the comprehension of each installment was verified before proceeding with the next.",
        "The conversants in the VNS corpus displayed relatively higher rates of use of acknowledgment in repair situations or when unplanned events arose (e.g., the user had gotten lost).",
        "Intuitively, people make more effort to establish mutual knowledge when it is apparent that miscommunication has occurred than at other times; their certainty criterion for mutuality (Clark and Marshall, 1981) is raised as a result of the need for repair.",
        "This suggests that a facility for acknowledgment is an important element in the development of robust SLSs because use of acknowledgment is most critical precisely when the conversation has gone awry.",
        "We are currently developing a computational model of acknowledgment based on the empirical work presented in this paper.",
        "This model is intended for integration into a SLS where it will serve both to predict when acknowledgments are appropriate from the system and when to expect acknowledgments from the user.",
        "Briefly, determining the applicability of an acknowledgment involves interpreting exchanges in terms of speech acts and then mapping these speech-act patterns onto the acknowledgment classes described.",
        "This, we believe, will facilitate improved SLS robustness through achievement of a greater degree of mutual understanding and provide a more natural and intuitive interaction.",
        "The utility and implementation of the empirical model will be the focus of a later paper."
