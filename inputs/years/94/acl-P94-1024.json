        "Recently, several researchers, including Gibson and Wexler (1994), henceforth GW, Dresher and Kaye (1990); and Clark and Roberts (1993) have modeled language learning in a (finite) space whose grammars are characterized by a finite number of parameters or n-length Boolean-valued vectors.",
        "Many current linguistic theories now employ such parametric models explicitly or in spirit, including Lexical-Functional Grammar and versions of HPSG, besides GB variants.",
        "With all such models, key questions about sample complexity, convergence time, and alternative modeling assumptions are difficult to assess without a precise mathematical formalization.",
        "Previous research has usually addressed only the question of convergence in the limit without probing the equally important question of sample complexity: it is of not much use that a learner can acquire a language if sample complexity is extraordinarily high, hence psychologically implausible.",
        "This remains a relatively undeveloped area of language learning theory.",
        "The current paper aims to fill that gap.",
        "We choose as a starting point the GW Triggering Learning Algorithm (TLA).",
        "Our central result is that the performance of this algorithm and others like it is completely modeled by a Markov chain.",
        "We explore the basic computational consequences of this, including some surprising results about sample complexity and convergence time, the dominance of random walk over gradient ascent, and the applicability of these results to actual child language acquisition and possibly language change.",
        "Background.",
        "Following Gold (1967) the basic framework is that of identification in the limit.",
        "We assume some familiarity with Gold's assumptions.",
        "The learner receives an (infinite) sequence of (positive) example sentences from some target language.",
        "After each, the learner either (i) stays in the same state; or (ii) moves to a new state (change its parameter settings).",
        "If after some finite number of examples the learner converges to the correct target language and never changes its guess, then it has correctly identified the target language in the limit; otherwise, it fails.",
        "In the GW model (and others) the learner obeys two additional fundamental constraints: (1) the single-value constraint – the learner can change only 1 parameter value each step; and (2) the greediness constraint – if the learner is given a positive example it cannot recognize and changes one parameter value, finding that it can accept the example, then the learner retains that new value.",
