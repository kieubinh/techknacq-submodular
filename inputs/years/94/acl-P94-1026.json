        "Previous work by Manny Rayner and the author, see [Samuelsson & Rayner 1991] attempts to tailor an existing natural-language system to a specific application domain by extracting a specialized grammar from the original one using a large set of training examples.",
        "The training set is a treebank consisting of implicit parse trees that each specify a verified analysis of an input sentence.",
        "The parse trees are implicit in the sense that each node in the tree is the (mnemonic) name of the grammar rule resolved on at that point, rather than the syntactic category of the LHS of the grammar rule as is the case in an ordinary parse tree.",
        "Figure 1 shows five examples of implicit parse trees.",
        "The analyses are verified in the sense that each analysis has been judged to be the preferred one for that input sentence by a human evaluator using a semi-automatic evaluation method.",
        "A new grammar is created by cutting up each implicit parse tree in the treebank at appropriate points, creating a set of new rules that consist of chunks of original grammar rules.",
        "The LHS of each new rule will be the LHS phrase of the original grammar rule at the root of the tree chunk and the RHS will be the RHS phrases of the rules in the leaves of the tree chunk.",
        "For example, cutting up the first parse tree of Figure 1 at the NP of the rule vp_v_np yields rules 2 and 3 of Figure 3.",
        "The idea behind this is to create a specialized grammar that retains a high coverage but allows very much faster parsing.",
        "This has turned out to be possible – speedups compared to using the original grammar of in median 60 times were achieved at a cost in coverage of about ten percent, see [Samuelsson 1994a].1 Another benefit from the method is a decreased error rate when the system is required to select a preferred analysis.",
        "In these experiments the scheme was applied to the grammar of a version of the SRI Core Language Engine [Alshawi ed.",
        "1992] adapted to the Atis domain for a speech-translation task [Rayner et al. 1993] and large corpora of real user data collected using Wizard-of-Oz simulation.",
        "The resulting specialized grammar was compiled into LR parsing tables, and a special LR parser exploited their special properties, see [Samuelsson 1994b].",
        "The technical vehicle previously used to extract the specialized grammar is explanation-based generalization (EBG), see e.g. [Mitchell et al. 1986].",
        "Very briefly, this consists of redoing the derivation of each training example top-down by letting the implicit parse tree drive a rule expansion process, and aborting the expansion of the specialized rule currently being extracted if the current node of the implicit parse tree meets a set of tree-cutting criteria2.",
        "In this case the extraction process is invoked recursively to extract subrules rooted in the current node.",
        "The tree-cutting criteria can be local (\"The LHS of the original grammar rule is an NP,\") or dependent on the rest of the parse tree (\"that doesn't dominate the empty string only,\") and previous choices of nodes to cut at (\"and there is no cut above the current node that is also labelled NP.\").",
        "A problem not fully explored yet is how to arrive at an optimal choice of tree-cutting criteria.",
        "In the previous scheme, these must be specified manually, and the choice is left to the designer's intuitions.",
        "This article addresses the problem of automating this process and presents a method where the nodes to cut at are selected automatically using the information-theoretical concept of entropy.",
        "Entropy is well-known from physics, but the concept of perplexity is perhaps better known in the speech-recognition and natural-language communities.",

        "This means that if we cut at a node corresponding to e.g. an NP, i.e. where the arcs incident from it are labelled with grammar rules whose left-hand-sides are NPs, we must allow all specialized NP rules to be potentially applicable at this point, not just the ones that are rooted in this node.",

        "In the simplest scheme for calculating the entropy of an or-node, only the RHS phrase of the parent rule, i.e. the dominating and-node, contributes to the entropy, and there is in fact no need to employ an and-or tree at all, since the tree-cutting criterion becomes local to the parse tree being cut up.",

        "Instruments have been developed and tested for controlling the coverage and for avoiding a large number of short reductions, which is argued to be the main source to poor parser performance.",
        "Although these instruments are currently slightly too blunt to enable producing grammars with the same high performance as the hand-coded tree-cutting criteria, they can most probably be sharpened by future research, and in particular refined to achieve the delicate balance between high coverage and a distribution of reduction lengths that is sufficiently biased towards long reductions.",
        "Also, banning recursion by category specialization, i.e. by for example distinguishing NPs that dominate other NPs from those that do not, will be investigated, since this is believed to be an important ingredient in the version of the scheme employing hand-coded tree-cutting criteria."
