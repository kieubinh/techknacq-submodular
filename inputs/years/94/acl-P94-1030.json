        "Spoken language understanding is one of the most challenging research areas in natural language processing.",
        "Since spoken language is incomplete in various ways, i.e., containing speech errors, ellipsis, metonymy, etc., spoken language understanding systems should have the ability to process incomplete inputs by hypothesizing the underlying information.",
        "The abduction-based approach (Hobbs et al., 1988) has provided a simple and elegant way to realize such a task.",
        "Consider the following Japanese sentence:",
        "(a famous writer) buy PAST This sentence contains two typical phenomena arising in spoken language, i.e., metonymy and the ellipsis of a particle.",
        "When this sentence is uttered under the situation where the speaker reports his experience, its natural interpretation is the speaker bought a SOseki novel.",
        "To derive this interpretation, we need to resolve the following problems:",
        "• The metonymy implied by the noun phrase SOseki is expanded to a SOseki novel, based on the pragmatic knowledge that the name of a writer is sometimes used to refer to his novel.",
        "• The particle-less thematic relation between the verb katta and the noun phrase SOseki is determined to be the object case relation, based on the semantic knowledge that the object case relation between a trading action and a commodity can be linguistically expressed as a thematic relation.",
        "This interpretation is made by abduction.",
        "For instance, the above semantic knowledge is stated, in terms of the predicate logic, as follows:",
        "(2) sem(e,x) C trade(e) A commodity(x) A obj(e,x)",
        "Then, the inference process derives the consequent sem(e,x) by hypothesizing an antecedent obj(e,x), which is never proved from the observed facts.",
        "This process is called abduction.",
        "Of course, there may be several other possibilities that support the thematic relation sem(e,x).",
        "For instance, the thematic relation being determined to be the agent case relation, sentence (1) can have another interpretation, i.e., Sliseki bought something, which, under some other situations, might be more feasible than the first interpretation.",
        "To cope with feasibility, the abduction-based model usually manages the mechanism for evaluating the goodness of the interpretation.",
        "This is known as cost-based abduction (Hobbs et al., 1988).",
        "In cost-based abduction, each assumption bears a certain cost.",
        "For instance, the assumption obj(e,x), introduced by applying rule (2), is specified to have a cost of, say, $2.",
        "The goodness of the interpretation is evaluated by accumulating the costs of all the assumptions involved.",
        "The whole process of interpreting an utterance is depicted in the following schema:",
        "1.",
        "Find all possible interpretations, and 2.",
        "Select the one that has the lowest cost.",
        "In our example, the interpretation that assumes the thematic relation to be the object case relation, with the metonymy being expanded to a SOseki novel, is cheaper than the interpretation that assumes the thematic relation to be the agent case relation; hence, the former is selected.",
        "An apparent problem here is the high computational cost; because abduction allows many possibilities, the schema involves very heavy computation.",
        "Particularly in the spoken language understanding task, we need to consider a great number of possibilities when hypothesizing various underlying information.",
        "This makes the abduction process",
        "computationally demanding, and reduces the practicality of abduction-based systems.",
        "The existing models do not provide any basic solution to this problem.",
        "Charniak (Charniak and Husain, 1991; Charniak and Santos Jr., 1992) dealt with the problem, but those solutions are applicable only to the propositional case, where the search space is represented as a directed graph over ground formulas.",
        "In other words, they did not provide a way to build such graphs from rules, which, in general, contain variables and can be recursive.",
        "This paper provides a basic and practical solution to the computation problem of cost-based abduction.",
        "The basic idea comes from the natural language parsing literature.",
        "As Pereira and Warren (1983) pointed out, there is a strong connection between parsing and deduction.",
        "They showed that parsing of DCG can be seen as a special case of deduction of Horn clauses; conversely, deduction can be seen as a generalization of parsing.",
        "Their idea of using chart parsers as deductive-proof procedures can easily be extended to the idea of using chart parsers as abductive-proof procedures.",
        "Because chart parsers have many advantages from the viewpoint of computational efficiency, chart-based abductive-proof procedures are expected to nicely solve the computation problem.",
        "Our algorithm, proposed in this paper, has the following features, which considerably enhance the computational efficiency of cost-based abduction:",

        "In this paper, we provided a basic and practical solution to the computation problem of cost-based abduction.",
        "We explained the basic concept of our algorithm and presented the details of the algorithm along with simple examples.",
        "We also showed how our algorithm improves computational efficiency on the basis of the results of the preliminary experiments.",
        "We are now developing an abduction-based spoken language understanding system using our algorithm.",
        "The main problem is how to find a good search strategy that can be implemented with the agenda control mechanism.",
        "We are investigating this issue using both theoretical and empirical approaches.",
        "We hope to report good results along these lines in the future."
