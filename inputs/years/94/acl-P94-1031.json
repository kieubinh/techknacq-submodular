        "With the intensive exploration of contemporary theories on unification grammars[6, 15, 13] and feature structures[7, 19] in the last decade, the old image of machine translation (MT) as a brutal form of natural language processing has given way to that of a process based on a uniform and reversible architecture[16, 1, 27].",
        "The developers of MT systems based on the constraint-based formalism found a serious problem in \"language mismatching,\" namely, the difference between semantic representations in the source and target languages.'",
        "Attempts to design a pure interlingual MT system were therefore abandoned,2 and the notion of \"semantic trans-fer\"[24, 22] came into focus as a practical solution to the problem of handling the language mismatching.",
        "The constraint-based formalism[2] seemed promising as a formal definition of transfer, but pure constraints are too rigid to be precisely imposed on target-language sentences.",
        "the concept of defeasible reasoning in order to formalize what is missing from a pure constraint-based approach, and control mechanisms for such reasoning have also been proposed[5, 3].",
        "With this additional mechanism, we can formulate the \"transfer\" process as a mapping from a set of constraints into another set of mandatory and defeasible constraints.",
        "This idea leads us further to the concept of \"information-based\" MT, which means that, with an appropriate representation scheme, a source sentence can be represented by a set of constraints that it implies and that, given a target sentence, the set C, of constraints can be divided into three disjoint subsets:",
        "• The subset Co of constraints that is also implied by the target sentence • The subset af.",
        "of constraints that is not implied by, but is consistent with, the translated sentence • The subset C_ of constraints that is violated by the target sentence",
        "The target sentence may also imply another set",
        "• of constraints, none of which is in C,.",
        "That",
        "is, the set Ct of constraints implied by the target sentences is a union of Co and Cnew, while C, = Co UC+ UC_.",
        "When C, = Co = Ct, we have a fully inter/ingua/ translation of the source sentence.",
        "If C+ C_ 41, and Cnew = 4), the target sentence is said to be under-generated, while it is said to be over-generated when C+ = = and Cn„,, 0.3 In either case, C_ must be empty if a consistent translation is required.",
        "Thus, the goal of machine translation is to find an optimal pair of source and target sentences that minimizes C+, C – , and Cnew.",
        "Intuitively, Co corresponds to essential information, and C+ and Ca,,,, can be viewed as language-dependent supportive information.",
        "C_ might be the inconsistency be",
        "tween the assumptions of the source and target-language speakers.",
        "In this paper, we introduce tricolor DAGs to represent the above constraints, and discuss how tricolor DAGs are used for practical MT systems.",
        "In particular, we give a generation algorithm that incorporates the notion of semantic transfer by gradually approaching the optimal target sentence through the use of tricolor DAGs, when a fully interlingual translation fails.",
        "Tricolor DAGs give a graph-algorithmic interpretation of the constraints, and the distinctions between the types of constraint mentioned above allow us to adjust the margin between the current and optimal solution effectively.",

        "Each node represents either an atomic value or a root of a DAG, and each arc is labeled with a feature name.",

        "In the rest of this paper, we will consider only well-formed TDAGs.",
        "Furthermore, since only the semantic portions of TDAGs are used for machine translation, we will not discuss syntactic features.",

        "Pronoun resolution can be similarly represented by using green nodes and arcs.",
        "It is worth looking at the source and target TDAGs in the opposite direction.",

        "For example, the functional control of the verb \"wish\" in the English sentence John wished to walk may produce the TDAG1 in Figure 1, but the red arc corresponding to the agent of the *WALK predicate may not be preserved in a target TDAG2.7 This means that the target sentence alone cannot convey the information that it is John who wished to walk, even if this information can be understood from the context.",
