        "Early attempts to use context-free grammars (CFGs) as a mathematical model for natural language syntax have largely been abandoned; it has been shown that (under standard assumptions concerning the recursive nature of clausal embedding) the cross-serial dependencies found in Swiss German cannot be generated by a CFG (Shieber, 1985).",
        "Several mathematical models have been proposed which extend the formal power of CFGs, while still maintaining the formal properties that make CFGs attractive formalisms for formal and computational linguists, in particular, polynomial parsability and restricted weak generative capacity.",
        "These mathematical models include tree adjoining grammar (TAG) (Joshi et al., 1975; Joshi, 1985), head grammar (Pollard, 1984), combinatory categorial grammar (CCG) (Steed-man, 1985), and linear index grammar (LIG) (Gazdar, 1988).",
        "These formalisms have been shown to be weakly equivalent to each other (Vijay-Shanker et al., 1987; Vijay-Shanker and Weir, 1994); we will refer to them as \"LIG-equivalent formalisms\".",
        "LIG is a variant of index grammar (IG) (Aho, 1968).",
        "Like CFG, IG is a context-free string rewriting system, except that the nonterminal symbols in a CFG are augmented with stacks of index symbols.",
        "The rewrite rules push or pop indices from the index stack.",
        "In an IG, the index stack is copied to all nonterminal symbols on the right-hand side of a rule.",
        "In a LIG, the stack is copied to exactly one right-hand side nonterminal.1 'Note that a LIG is not an IG that is linear (i.e., whose productions have at most one nonterminal on the right-hand side), but rather, it is a context-free grammar with linear indices (i.e., the indices are never copied).",
        "the case that the full power of the system is used in the linguistic analyses that are expressed in it.",
        "HPSG analyses include information about constituent structure which can be represented as a context-free phrase-structure tree.",
        "In addition, various mechanisms have been proposed to handle certain linguistic phenomena that relate two nodes within this tree.",
        "One of these is a multiset-valued feature that is passed along the phrase-structure tree from daughter node to mother node.",
        "Multiset-valued features have been proposed for the SLASH feature which handles tvh-dependencies (Pollard and Sag, 1994, Chapter 4), and for certain semantic purposes, including the representation of stored quantifiers in a mechanism similar to Cooper-storage.",
        "Another use may be the representation of anti-coreference constraints arising from Principle C of Binding Theory (be it that of (Chomsky, 1981) or of Pollard and Sag (1992)).",
        "It is desirable to be able to assess the formal power of such a system, for both theoretical and practical reasons.",
        "Theoretically, it would be interesting if it turned out that the linguistic principles formulated in HPSG naturally lead to certain restricted uses of the unification-based formalism.",
        "Clearly this would represent an important insight into the nature of grammatical competence.",
        "On the practical side, formal equivalences can guide the building of applications such as parsers for existing HPSG grammars.",
        "For example, it has been proposed that HPSG grammars can be \"compiled\" into TAGs in order to obtain a computationally more tractable system (Kasper, 1992), thus sidestepping the issue of building parsers for HPSG directly.",
        "However, LIG-equivalent formalisms cannot serve as targets for compilations in cases in which HPSG uses multiset-valued feature structures."
