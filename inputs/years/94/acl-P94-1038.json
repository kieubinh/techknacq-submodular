        "Data sparseness is an inherent problem in statistical methods for natural language processing.",
        "Such methods use statistics on the relative frequencies of configurations of elements in a training corpus to evaluate alternative analyses or interpretations of new samples of text or speech.",
        "The most likely analysis will be taken to be the one that contains the most frequent configurations.",
        "The problem of data sparseness arises when analyses contain configurations that never occurred in the training corpus.",
        "Then it is not possible to estimate probabilities from observed frequencies, and some other estimation scheme has to be used.",
        "We focus here on a particular kind of configuration, word cooccurrence.",
        "Examples of such cooccurrences include relationships between head words in syntactic constructions (verb-object or adjective-noun, for example) and word sequences (n-grams).",
        "In commonly used models, the probability estimate for a previously unseen cooccurrence is a function of the probability esti",
        "mates for the words in the cooccurrence.",
        "For example, in the bigram models that we study here, the probability P(w2lwi) of a conditioned word w2 that has never occurred in training following the conditioning word w1 is calculated from the probability of w2, as estimated by w2's frequency in the corpus (Jelinek, Mercer, and Roukos, 1992; Katz, 1987).",
        "This method depends on an independence assumption on the cooccurrence of w1 and w2: the more frequent w2 is, the higher will be the estimate of P(w2lwi), regardless of Class-based and similarity-based models provide an alternative to the independence assumption.",
        "In those models, the relationship between given words is mod-ele.d by analogy with other words that are in some sense similar to the given ones.",
        "Brown et al.",
        "(1992) suggest a class-based n-gram model in which words with similar cooccurrence distributions are clustered in word classes.",
        "The cooccurrence probability of a given pair of words then is estimated according to an averaged cooccurrence probability of the two corresponding classes.",
        "Pereira, Tishby, and Lee (1993) propose a \"soft\" clustering scheme for certain grammatical cooccurrences in which membership of a word in a class is probabilistic.",
        "Cooccurrence probabilities of words are then modeled by averaged cooccurrence probabilities of word clusters.",
        "Dagan, Markus, and Markovitch (1993) argue that reduction to a relatively small number of predetermined word classes or clusters may cause a substantial loss of information.",
        "Their similarity-based model avoids clustering altogether.",
        "Instead, each word is modeled by its own specific class, a set of words which are most similar to it (as in k-nearest neighbor approaches in pattern recognition).",
        "Using this scheme, they predict which unobserved cooccurrences are more likely than others.",
        "Their model, however, is not probabilistic, that is, it does not provide a probability estimate for unobserved cooccurrences.",
        "It cannot therefore be used in a complete probabilistic framework, such as n-gram language models or probabilistic lexicalized grammars (Schabes, 1992; Lafferty, Sleator, and Temperley, 1992).",
        "We now give a similarity-based method for estimating the probabilities of cooccurrences unseen in training.",

        "(1985).",
        "We present a different method that takes as starting point the back-off scheme of Katz (1987).",
        "We first allocate an appropriate probability mass for unseen cooccurrences following the back-off method.",
        "Then we redistribute that mass to unseen cooccurrences according to an averaged cooccurrence distribution of a set of most similar conditioning words, using relative entropy as our similarity measure.",
        "This second step replaces the use of the independence assumption in the original back-off model.",
        "We applied our method to estimate unseen bigram probabilities for Wall Street Journal text and compared it to the standard back-off model.",
        "Testing on a held-out sample, the similarity model achieved a 20% reduction in perplexity for unseen bigrams.",
        "These constituted just 10.6% of the test sample, leading to an overall reduction in test-set perplexity of 2.4%.",
        "We also experimented with an application to language modeling for speech recognition, which yielded a statistically significant reduction in recognition error.",

        "Typically, the adjustment involves either interpolation, in which the new estimator is a weighted combination of the MLE and an estimator that is guaranteed to be nonzero for unseen bigrams, or discounting, in which the MLE is decreased according to a model of the unreliability of small frequency counts, leaving some probability mass for unseen bigrams.",
        "The back-off model of Katz (1987) provides a clear separation between frequent events, for which observed frequencies are reliable probability estimators, and low-frequency events, whose prediction must involve additional information sources.",
        "In addition, the back-off model does not require complex estimations for interpolation parameters.",
        "A back-off model requires methods for (a) discounting the estimates of previously observed events to leave out some positive probability mass for unseen events, and (b) redistributing among the unseen events the probability mass freed by discounting.",

        "Instead, Katz's back-off scheme redistributes the free probability mass non-uniformly in proportion to the frequency of w2, by setting",
        "Katz thus assumes that for a given conditioning word w1 the probability of an unseen following word w2 is proportional to its unconditional probability.",
        "However, the overall form of the model (2) does not depend on this assumption, and we will next investigate an estimate for Pr (W2 I WI) derived by averaging estimates for the conditional probabilities that w2 follows words that are distributionally similar to wi."

Intuitively, the lower the perplexity of a model the more likely the model is to assign high probability to bigrams that actually occur.",

        "We will outline here the main parallels and differences between our method and cooccurrence smoothing.",
        "A more detailed analysis would require an empirical comparison of the two methods on the same corpus and task.",
        "In cooccurrence smoothing, as in our method, a baseline model is combined with a similarity-based model that refines some of its probability estimates.",
        "The similarity model in cooccurrence smoothing is based on the intuition that the similarity between two words w and w' can be measured by the confusion probability Pc(w'lw) that w' can be substituted for w in an arbitrary context in the training corpus.",
        "Given a baseline probability model P, which is taken to be the MLE, the confusion probability Pc (w wi) between conditioning words w and w1 is defined as",

        "Notice that this formula has the same form as our similarity model (6), except that it uses confusion probabilities where we use normalized weights.4 In addition, we restrict the summation to sufficiently similar words, whereas the cooccurrence smoothing method sums over all words in the lexicon.",
        "The similarity measure (9) is symmetric in the sense that Pc(wilw) and Pc (w 10) are identical up to frequency normalization, that is pPccZtvlw,)) = pP(V).",
        "In contrast, D(w II w') (7) is asymmetric in that it weighs each context in proportion to its probability of occurrence with w, but not with w'.",
        "In this way, if w and w' have comparable frequencies but w' has a sharper context distribution than w, then D(w' II w) is greater than D(w w').",
        "Therefore, in our similarity model w' will play a stronger role in estimating w than vice versa.",
        "These properties motivated our choice of relative entropy for similarity measure, because of the intuition that words with sharper distributions are more informative about other words than words with flat distributions.",
        "4 This presentation corresponds to model 2-8 in Essen and Steinbiss (1992).",
        "Their presentation follows the equivalent model 1-A, which averages over similar conditioned words, with the similarity defined with the preceding word as context.",
        "In fact, these equivalent models are symmetric in their treatment of conditioning and conditioned word, as they can both be rewritten as",
        "They also consider other definitions of confusion probability and smoothed probability estimate, but the one above yielded the best experimental results.",
        "Finally, while we have used our similarity model only for missing bigrams in a back-off scheme, Essén and Steinbiss (1992) used linear interpolation for all bigrams to combine the cooccurrence smoothing model with MLE models of bigrams and unigrams.",
