        "Several Corpus Linguistics research groups have gone beyond collation of 'raw' text, to syntactic annotation of the text.",
        "However, linguists developing these linguistic resources have used quite different wordtagging and parse-tree labelling schemes in each of these annotated corpora.",
        "This restricts the accessibility of each corpus, making it impossible for speech and handwriting researchers to collate them into a single very large training set.",
        "This is particularly problematic as there is evidence that one of these parsed corpora on its own is too small for a general statistical model of grammatical structure, but the combined size of all the above annotated corpora should deliver a much more reliable model.",
        "We are developing a set of mapping algorithms to map between the main tagsets and phrase structure grammar schemes used in the above corpora.",
        "We plan to develop a Multi-tagged Corpus and a MultiTreebank, a single text-set annotated with all the above tagging and parsing schemes.",
        "The text-set is the Spoken English Corpus: this is a halfway house between formal written text and colloquial conversational speech.",
        "However, the main deliverable to the computational linguistics research community is not the SEC-based MultiTreebank, but the mapping suite used to produce it - this can be used to combine currently-incompatible syntactic training sets into a large unified multicorpus.",
        "Our architecture combines standard statistical language modelling and a rule-base derived from linguists' analyses of tagset-mappings, in a novel yet intuitive way.",
        "Our development of the mapping algorithms aims to distinguish notational from substantive differences in the annotation schemes, and we will be able to evaluate tagging schemes in terms of how well they fit standard statistical language models such as n-pos (Markov) models.",
        "1 'This research began with grants from the UK Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC) and the Universities Funding Council's Knowledge Based Systems Initiative (UFC KBSI), and is now funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and Several research projects around the world are building grammatically analysed corpora; that is, collections of text annotated with part-of-speech wordtags and syntax trees.",
        "Tagged and parsed English corpora (Bank of English [54]; BNC [44], [22]; Brown [24]; ICE [12], [28], [64]; Lancaster-IBM [26], [22]; LOB [1], [3], [38], [42]; London-Lund [62]; Nijmegen [12]; PoW [23], [55], [57]; SEC [63]; TOSCA [46], [31], [12]; UPenn [53], [45]; etc) are used, among other things, as authoritative exail !pies by researchers in English Language Teaching and 'Lexicography (e.g. [44]), and as training data for statistical syntactic constraint models to improve recognition accuracy in speech and handwriting recognisers (e.g. [37], [10]).",
        "However, projects have used quite different wordtag-ging and parsing schemes.",
        "In contrast to the Speech research community, which has reached broad agreement on an uncontentious set of labelling conventions for phonetic/phonemic analysis, there is no general consensus in the international Natural Language research community on analogous conventions for grammatical analysis.",
        "Developers of corpora adhere to a variety of competing models or theories of grammar and parsing, with the effect of restricting the accessibility of their respective corpora, and the potential for collation into a single fully parsed corpus.",
        "In view of this heterogeneity, we have begun to investigate and develop methods of automatically mapping between the annotation schemes of the most widely known corpora, thus assessing their differences and improving the reusability of the corpora.",
        "Annotating a single corpus with the different schemes allows for Coln-parisons, and will provide a rich test-bed for automatic parsers.",

        "Initially, we considered adopting the Interlingua ap-proach' to mapping, as used in Machine Translation projects such as EUROTRA.",
        "This would require us to develop tagset mappings between the LOB Corpus (our primary tagset Interlingua) and each of the 'major' tagged corpora: BROWN, ICE, Lancaster-IBM, and UPenn.",
        "Next full grammar mappings would be developed between the Lancaster-IBM Treebank (our primary parsing scheme Interlingua) and each of: the UPenn Treebank and the Lancaster-Leeds Treebank.",
        "The ICE and BNC tagsets and parsing schemes could be included when they become available.",
        "Mapping between tagsets will involve relabelling of words, whereas mapping between grammar schemes also involves structural manipulation.",
        "These treebanks have been chosen for their skeletal parsing schemes, which are of relatively similar structure apart from a small number of systematic differences.",
        "We have chosen the SEC as a 'core' text for this project, because",
        "1. the tagged SEC uses the same tagset as the LOB Corpus (widely considered to be the UK standard and our proposed primary tagset); 2. the parsed SEC uses the same grammatical scheme as the Lancaster-IBM Treebank (our proposed primary parsing scheme); 3. these are the annotation schemes which we have most prior experience of; 4. the text material, BBC radio broadcasts, are a neutral compromise between written and conversational spoken English genres.",
        "Our aim is to develop bidirectional mappings for the above tagsets and grammar schemes, although we appreciate that for mapping from simple to delicate schemes this will not be possible, and that mappings will be imperfect.",
        "As mapping algorithms are developed and tested, and whilst building the Multi-Tagged Corpus and Multi-Treebank, we will compile \"handbooks\" of common errors (i.e. mismatches) and their corrections.",
        "These will help future users of the developed mapping algorithms to straightforwardly post-edit their mapped corpora and treebanks, thus maximising resource reusability.",
        "To map between two tagsets other than LOB, two mappings will be necessary (via the primary tagset, our \"interlingua\" representation); similarly for non-terminal grammar schemes.",
        "We appreciate the danger of propogating incorrect mappings.",

        "They will allow research groups who are using corpus-based training data to make use of other corpora straightforwardly, without substantial modifications.",
        "Any current and future users of corpora will have a much expanded resource.",
        "The Multi-Tagged Corpus and the Multi-Treebank will be distributed, along with the main Spoken English Corpus, through ICAME.",
        "They will also be available for incorporation into the SEC Speech Database currently being created by Gerry Knowles and Peter Roach, further enhancing the SEC as a general research resource.",
        "Both the Multi-Treebank and the Multi-Tagged corpus will potentially be used by speech and language technology groups for many research and teaching purposes, including: training data for speech-recognisers, optical text recognisers, word processor text-critiquing systems, machine translation systems, natural language interfaces, and NLP applications generally; and for providing examples for English Language Teaching (ELT) grammar textbooks and training material.",
        "In addition, the Multi-Treebank may be used as a testbed and benchmark for parsers (explored in the workplaii).",
        "It would also be a rich resource for grammar-learning experiments - a research topic of growing interest (see e.g. [8], [11], [16], [33]).",
        "We envisage supplying the computational linguistics research community with a valuable research resource, and the ACL Workshop will be an invaluable opportunity for us to survey potential customer requirements and preferences!"
