        "The idea of integrating statistical and knowledge-based approaches for natural language problems has been recently gaining ground in the computational linguistics community, as it is expected that a combined approach will offer significantly better performance over either methodology alone.",
        "This paper supplements this intuitive belief with actual evaluation data, obtained when several linguistics-based modules were integrated in a statistical system.",
        "We used a system we previously developed for the separation of adjectives into semantic groups [Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993] as the basis for our comparative analysis.",
        "We identified several different types of shallow linguistic knowledge that can be efficiently introduced into our system.",
        "We evaluated the system with and without each such feature, obtaining an estimate of each feature's positive or negative contribution to the overall performance.",
        "By matching cases where all system parameters are the same except for one feature, we assess the statistical significance of the differences found.",
        "Also, a statistical model of the system's performance in terms of the active features for each run offers a view of the contributions of features from a different angle, contrasting the significance of linguistic features (or other modeled system parameters) against each other.",
        "Our analysis of the experimental results showed that many forms of linguistic knowledge have a significant positive contribution to the performance of the system.",
        "We attribute to the combined effect of the linguistic knowledge modules the ability of our system to perform fine-tuned classification of adjectives into semantic classes.",
        "Other statistical systems that address word classification problems do not emphasize the use of linguistic knowledge and do not deal with a specific word class [Brown et al., 1992], or do not exploit as much linguistic knowledge as we do [Pereira et al., 1993].",
        "As a result, a coarser classification is usually produced.",
        "In contrast, by limiting the system's input to adjectives, we can take advantage of specific syntactic relationships and additional filtering procedures that apply only to particular word classes.",
        "These sources of linguistic knowledge provide in turn the extra edge for discriminating among the adjectives at the semantic level.",
        "Our adjective grouping system can be used for applications such as natural language generation (where knowledge of the semantic groups and of the ordering of the elements within them allows the precise lexicalization of semantic concepts [Elhadarl, 1991]) and computational lexicography (by automatically compiling domain-dependent lists of synonyms and antonyms).",
        "The produced groups can also help correct erroneous usage of",
        "multiple qualifiers that are superfluous or contradict each other, a phenomenon that has been observed in medical reports'.",
        "But in addition to the immediate applications of word classification, many other statistical NLP applications can be cast in a similar framework.",
        "Therefore, the positive effects of linguistic knowledge on our system indicate that the incorporation of linguistic knowledge will probably result in similar benefits for other applications as well.",
        "In what follows, we briefly review our adjective grouping system, and then present the linguistic features we explored and the alternatives for each of them.",
        "In Section 5 we give the results of our evaluation on different combinations of features and we analyze their significance.",
        "We also present these results in a predictor-response framework, and we conclude by discussing the applicability of our results to other NLP problems."

      "text": [
        "Our adjective grouping system [Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993] starts with a set of adjectives to be clustered into semantically related groups.",
        "Ideally, we want highly related words such as synonyms, antonyms, and hyponyms to be the only ones placed in the same group.",
        "The system is given the number of groups to form as an input parameta2, and has access to a text corpus.",
        "No semantic information about the adjectives is available to the system.",
        "The system operates by extracting pairs of modified nouns for each adjective, and, optionally, pairs of adjectives that we can expect to be semantically unrelated on linguistic grounds3.",
        "From the estimated distribution of modified nouns for each adjective, a similarity score is assigned to each possible pair of adjectives.",
        "This is based on Kendall's t, a non-parametric, robust estimator of correlation [Kendall, 1938].",
        "Using the similarity scores and, optionally, the established relationships of non-relatedness, a non-hierarchical clustering method [SpAth, 1985] assigns the adjectives to groups in a way that maximizes the within-group similarity (and therefore also maximizes the between-group dissimilarity).",
        "IWe thank Johanna Moore for pointing out this application to us.",
        "2Determining this number from the data is probably the hardest problem in cluster analysis in general; see (Kaufman and Rousseeuw.",
        "1990).",
        "3 These are adjectives that either modify the same noun in the same NP (e.g. big white house) or one of them modifies the other (e.g. light blue coat); see [Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993] for a detailed analysis.",
        "To evaluate our system, we have developed extended versions of the standard information retrieval measures precision, recall, and fallout.",
        "These extended versions score the grouping produced by the system against a set of model groupings (instead of just one) for the same adjec",
        "fives, supplied by humans.",
        "In the experiments reported in this paper, we employ 8 or 9 human-constructed models for each adjective set.",
        "We base our comparisons on and report the F-measure scores (Van Rijsbergen, 1979] which combine precision and recall in a single number.",
        "In addition, since the correct number of groupings is something that the system cannot yet determine (and, incidentally, something that human evaluators disagree about), we run the system for the five cases in the range 2 to +2 around the average number of clusters employed by the humans and average the results.",
        "This smoothing operation prevents an accidental high or low score being reported when a small variation in the number of clusters produces very different scores.",
        "It should be noted here that the scores reported should not be interpreted as linear percentages.",
        "In other words, a score of 40 is not just twice as good as a score of 20, and going from 30 to 40 is much harder than going from 20 to 30.",
        "The latter is true for most applications, but the problem of interpreting the scores is exacerbated in our context because of the structural constraints imposed by the clustering and the presence of multiple models.",
        "Furthermore, even the best clustering that could be produced would not receive a score of 100, because of disagreement among humans on what is the correct answer.",
        "To clarify the meaning of the scores, we accompany them with lower and upper bounds for each adjective set we examine.",
        "'These bounds are obtained by the performance of a system that creates random groupings (averaged over many runs) and by the average score of the human-produced partitions when evaluated against the other human models respectively.",

        "Our adjective clustering system determines the distribution of related (modified) nouns for each adjective and eventually the similarity between adjectives from pairs of the form (adjective, modified noun) observed in the corpus.",
        "Direct information about incompatible adjectives (in the form of appropriate adjective-adjective pairs) can also be collected from the corpus.",
        "Therefore, a first parameter of the system and a possible dimension for comparisons is the method employed to identify such pairs in free text.",
        "This is hardly a unique feature of our system: all word-based statistical systems must first collect data from the corpus about the words of interest, on which the subsequent statistics operate.",
        "There are several alternate models for this task of data collection, with different degrees of linguistic sophistication.",
        "A first model is to use no linguistic knowledge at all: we collect for each adjective of interest all words that fall within a window of some predetermined size.",
        "Naturally, no negative data (adjective-adjective pairs) can be collected with this method.",
        "However, the method can be implemented easily and does not require the identification of any linguistic constraints so it is completely general.",
        "It has been used for diverse problems such as machine translation and sense disambiguation [Gale et al., 1992, Schiltze, 1992].",
        "A second model is to restrict the words collected to the same sentence as the adjective of interest and to word class(es) that we expect on linguistic grounds to be relevant to adjectives.",
        "For our application, we collect all nouns in the vicinity of an adjective without leaving the current sentence.",
        "We assume that these nouns have some relationship with the adjective and that semantically different adjectives will exhibit different collections of such nouns.",
        "This model requires only part-of-speech information (to identify nouns) and a method of detecting sentence boundaries.",
        "It uses a window of fixed length to define the neighborhood of each adjective.",
        "Such a model incorporates minimal linguistic knowledge, namely in determining what constitutes the informative class(es) of words collected (nouns in our problem).",
        "Again, negative knowledge such as incompatible adjective pairs cannot be collected with this model.",
        "Nevertheless, it has also been widely used, e.g. for collocation extraction [Smadia, 1993] and sense disambiguation [Liddy and Palk, 1992].",
        "A third model uses a simple linguistic rule to identify pairs of interest that is even more restrictive and informative than the \"nouns in vicinity\"",
        "approach.",
        "Since we are interested in nouns modified by adjectives, such a rule is to collect a noun immediately following an adjective, assuming that this implies a modification relationship.",
        "Pairs of consecutive adjectives can also be collected.",
        "Up to this point we have successively restricted the collected pairs on linguistic grounds, so that less but cleaner data is collected.",
        "For the fourth model, we extend the simple rule given above, using linguistic information to catch more valid pairs without sacrificing accuracy.",
        "We employ a pattern matcher that retrieves any sequence of one or more adjectives followed by any sequence of zero or more nouns.",
        "These sequences are then analyzed with heuristics based on linguistics to obtain pairs.",
        "For example, it can be shown that all adjectives in such a sequence must be semantically unrelated, and that it is best to attach all the adjectives to the final noun.",
        "The regular expression and pattern matching rules of the previous model can be extended further, forming a grammar for the constructs of interest.",
        "This approach can detect more pairs, and at the same time address known problematic cases not detected by the previous models.",
        "We implemented the above five data extraction models, using typical window sizes for the first two methods (50 and 5 on each side of the window respectively) which have been found useful in other problems before.",
        "For the fifth model, we developed a finite-state gyammar for NPs which is able to handle both predicative and attributive modification of nouns, conjunctions of adjectives, adverbial modification of adjectives, quantifiers, and apposition of adjectives to nouns or other adjectives5.",
        "Unfortunately, the resources required to perform our tests for the first model were too great (e.g. 12,287,320 pairs in a 151 MB file were extracted for the 21 adjectives in our smallest test set) so we dropped that model from further consideration and we use the second model as the baseline of minimal linguistic knowledge.",

        "We solve this problem by counting the occurrences of each candidate form in our corpus and selecting the one with non-zero frequency.",
        "Another potential application of linguistic knowledge is the use of a spell-checking procedure, combined with a word list, to eliminate typographical errors from the corpus.",
        "Such errors can produce wrong estimates for the frequencies of modified nouns for an adjective, but most importantly introduce \"unique\" nouns appearing only with one adjective, skewing the comparison of noun distributions.",

        "First, the performance of the system depends naturally on the adjective set that is to be clustered.",
        "Presumably variations in the adjective set can be modeled by several parameters, such as size of the set, number of semantic groups in it, and strength of semantic relatedness among its members, plus several parameters describing the properties of the adjectives in the set in isolation, such as frequency, specificity, etc.",

        "Nevertheless, the basic components stay the same.",
        "For example, in our application the original words are",
        "the adjectives and the predictions are their groups; in machine translation, the predictions are the translations of the words in the source language text; in sense disambiguation, the predictions are the senses assigned to the words of interest; in part-of-speech tagging or in classification the predictions are the tags or classes assigned to each word.",
        "Because of this underlying similarity, the comparative analysis presented in the paper is relevant to all these problems.",
        "For a concrete example, we examine the case of collocation extraction that has been addressed with statistical methods in the past.",
        "Smadja [1993] describes a system that initially uses the \"nouns in vicinity\" extraction model to collect cooccurrence information about words, and then identifies collocations on the basis of distributional criteria.",
        "A later component filters the retrieved collocations, removing the ones where the participating words are not used consistently in the same syntactic relationship.",
        "This post-processing stage doubles the precision of the system.",
        "We believe that using from the start a more sophisticated extraction model to collect these pairs of related words will have similar positive effects.",
        "Other linguistic components, such as a morphology module that combines frequency counts, should also improve the performance of the system.",
        "In this way, we can benefit from linguistic knowledge without having to use a separate filtering process after expending the effort to collect the collocations.",
        "Similarly, the sense disambiguation problem is typically attacked by comparing the distribution of the neighbors of a word's occurrence to prototypical distributions associated with each of the word's senses [Gale et al., 1992, Schtitze, 1992].",
        "Usually, no explicit linguistic knowledge is used in defining these neighbors, which are taken as all words appearing within a window of fixed width centered at the word being disambiguated.",
        "Many words unrelated to the word of interest are collected in this way.",
        "In contrast, identifying appropriate word classes that can be expected on linguistic grounds to convey significant information about the original word should increase the performance of the disambiguation system.",
        "Such classes might be modified nouns for adjectives, nouns in a subject or object position for verbs, etc.",
        "As we have showed in Section 5, less but cleaner information increases the quality of the results.",
        "An interesting topic is the identification of parallels of our linguistic modules for these applications, at least for those modules which, unlike morphology, are not ubiquitous.",
        "Negative knowledge for example improves the performance of our system, supplementing the positive information provided by adjective-noun pairs.",
        "It could be useful for other systems as well if an appropriate application-dependent method of extracting such information is identified."

        "We have showed that all linguistic features considered in this study had a positive contribution to the performance of the system.",
        "Except for spell-checking, all these contributions were bah statistically significant and large enough to make a difference in practical situations.",
        "Furthermore, the results can be expected to generalize to a wide variety of corpus-based systems for different applications.",
        "The cost of incorporating the linguistics-based modules in the system is not prohibitive.",
        "The effort needed to implement all the linguistic modules was about 5 person-months, in contrast with 7 person-months needed to develop the basic statistical system.",
        "Furthermore, the runtime overhead caused by the linguistic modules is not significant.",
        "Each takes from 1 to 7 minutes on a Sun SparcStation 10 to process a tnillion entries (words or pairs) and all except the negative knowledge module need process a corpus only once, reusing the same information for different adjective sets.",
        "This should be compared to the approximately 15 minutes needed by the statistical component for grouping about 40 adjectives.",
        "In the future, we plan to extend the results discussed in this paper by an analysis of the dependence of the effects of each parameter on the values of the other parameters.",
        "We are currently stratifying the experimental data obtained to study trends in the magnitude of parameter effects as other parameters vary in a controlled manner, and we will examine the interactions with corpus size and specificity of clustered adjectives.",
        "We are also interested in providing similar quantitative results for other applications, to corroborate our belief in the generality of the importance of easily obtainable linguistic knowledge for statistical systems."
