        "We report on the progress we have made towards developing a robust 'self-constructing' parsing device that uses indirect negative evidence (Kapur, 1992) to set its parameters.",
        "Generally, by parameter, we mean any point of variation at which two languages may differ.",
        "Thus, the relative placement of an object with respect to the verb, a determiner with respect to a noun, the difference between prepositional and postpositional languages, and the presence of long distance anaphors like Japanese \"zibun\" and Icelandic \"sig\" are all parameters.",
        "The device would be exposed to an input text consisting of simple unpreprocessed sentences.",
        "On the basis of this text, the device would induce indirect negative evidence in support of some one parsing device located in the parameter space.",
        "The development of a self-constructing parsing system would have a number of practical and theoretical benefits.",
        "First, such a parsing device would reduce the development costs of new parsers.",
        "At the moment, grammars must be developed by hand, a technique which requires a significant investment in money and man-hours.",
        "If a basic parser could be developed automatically, costs would be reduced significantly, even if the parser requires some fine-tuning after the initial automatic learning procedure.",
        "Second, a parser capable of self-modification is potentially more robust when confronted with novel or semi-grammatical input.",
        "This type of parser would have applications in information retrieval as well as language instruction and grammar correction.",
        "Finally, the development of a parser capable of self-modification would give us considerable insight into the formal properties of complex systems as well as the twin problems of language learnability and language acquisition.",
        "Given a linguistic parameter space, the problem of locating a target language somewhere in the space on the basis of a text consisting of only grammatical sentences is far from trivial.",
        "Clark (1990, 1992) has shown that the complexity of the problem is potentially exponential because the relationship between the points of variation and the actual data can be quite indirect and tangled.",
        "Since, given n parameters, there are r possible parsing devices, enumerative search through the space is clearly impossible.",
        "Because each datum may be successfully parsed by a number of different parsing devices within the space and because the surface properties of grammatical strings underdetermine the properties of the parsing device which must be fixed by the learning algorithm, standard deductive machine learning techniques are as complex as a brute enumerative search (Clark, 1992, 1994).",
        "In order to solve this problem, robust techniques which can rapidly eliminate inferior hypotheses must be developed.",
        "We propose a learning procedure which unites symbolic computation with statistical tools.",
        "Historically, symbolic techniques have proven to be a versatile tool in natural language processing.",
        "These techniques have the disadvantage of being both brittle (easily broken by new input or by user error) and costly (as grammars are extended to handle new constructions, development becomes more difficult due to the complexity of rule interactions within the grammar).",
        "Statistical techniques have the advantage of robustness, although the resulting grammars may lack the intuitive clarity found in symbolic systems.",
        "We propose to fuse the symbolic and the statistical techniques, a development which we view as inevitable; the resulting system will use statistical",
        "learning techniques to output a symbolic parsing device.",
        "We view this development to provide a nice middle ground between the problems of over-training versus undertraining.",
        "That is, statistical approaches to learning often tend to overfit the training set of data.",
        "Symbolic approaches, on the other hand, tend to behave 813 though they were undertrained (breaking down on novel input) since the grammar tends to be compact.",
        "Combining statistical techniques with symbolic parsing would give the advantage of obtaining relatively compact descriptions (symbolic processing) with robustness (statistical learning) that is not over-tuned to the training set."

        "Naturally, a necessary preliminary for our work is to specify a set of parameters which will serve as a testing ground for the learning algorithm.",

        "Both parameters involve the semantic relations between the NP and the infinitival VP as well as the treatment of case marking.",

        "Syntactic clitics have a number of syntactic consequences including special word order properties and an inability to participate in conjunctions and disjunctions.",
        "For example, in French,, fldl direct objects occur after the lexical verb but accusative clitics appear before the verb: Restricting our attention, for the moment to French, we should note that clitic pronouns may occur in sequences, in which case there are a number of restrictions on their relative order.",
        "Thus, nominative clitics (eg., \"je\", \"tu\", \"il\", etc.)",
        "occur first, followed by the negative element \"ne\", fi)llowed by accusative clitics (eg., \"la\", \"me\", \"re\") and dative clitics (\"lui\"), followed, at last, I)y the first element of the verbal sequence (an auxiliary or the main verb).",
        "There are further ordering constraints within the accusative and dative elites based on the person of the clitic; see Perlmutter (1971) for an exhaustive description of clitic pronouns in French.",
        "In order to correctly set the parameters governing the syntax of pronominals, the learner must distinguish clitic pronouns from free and weak pronouns as well as sort all pronoun systems according to their proper case system (e.g., nominative pronouns, accusative pronouns).",
        "Further",
        "more, the learner must have some reliable method for identifying the presence of clitic pronouns in the input stream.",
        "The above considerations suggest that free pronouns occur in a wider range of syntactic environments than clitic pronouns and, so, should carry less information about the syntactic nature of the positions that surround them.",
        "Clitic pronouns, on the other hand, occur in a limited number of environments and, hence, carry more information about the surrounding positions.",
        "Furthermore, since there are systematic constraints on the relative ordering of clitics, we would expect them to fall into distribution classes depending on the information they carry about the positions that surround them.",
        "The algorithm we report, which is also based on the observation of entropies of positions in the neighborhood of pronouns, not only distinguishes accurately between clitic and free-standing pronouns, but also successfully sorts clitic pronouns into linguistically natural classes.",
        "It is assumed that the learner knows a set of first and second person pronouns.",
        "The learning algorithm computes the entropy profile for three positions to the left and right of the pronouns (H(WIP = p) for the six different positions), where ps are the individual pronouns.",
        "These profiles are then compared and those pronouns which have similar profiles are clustered together.",
        "Interestingly, it turns out that the clusters are syntactically appropriate categories.",
        "In French, for example, based on the Pearson correlation coefficients we could deduce that the object clitics \"me\" and \"te\", the subject clitics \"je\" and \"tu\", the non-clitics \"moi\" and \"toi\" , and the ambiguous pronouns \"nous\" and \"vous\" are most closely related only to the other element in their own class.",
        "In fact, the entropy signature for the ambiguous pronouns can be analyzed as a mathematical combination of the signatures for the conflated forms.",
        "To distinguish clitics from non-clitics, we use the measure of stickiness (proportion of times they are sticking to the verbs compared to the times (8) a. Jean a vu les J. has seen the lilies.",
        "girls \"Jean saw the girls.\" b. Jean les a vues.",
        "J. clitic has seen \"Jean saw them.\" Restricting our attention, for the moment to French, we should note that clitic pronouns may occur in sequences, in which case there are a number of restrictions on their relative order.",
        "Thus, nominative clitics (eg., \"je\", \"tu\", \"it\", etc.)",
        "occur first, followed by the negative element \"ne\", followed by accusative clitics (eg., \"la\", \"me\", \"te\") and dative clitics (\"lui\"), followed, at last, by the first, element of the verbal sequence (an auxiliary or the main verb).",
        "There are further ordering constraints within the accusative and dative elites based on the person of the clitic; see Perlmutter (1971) for an exhaustive description of clitic pronouns in French.",
        "In order to correctly set the parameters governing the syntax of pronominals, the learner must distinguish clitic pronouns from free and weak pronouns as well as sort all pronoun systems according to their proper case system (e.g., nominative pronouns, accusati ye pronouns).",
        "Further-We also verified that the object clitics in French 66 were not primarily responsible for the correct result.",
        "' Preliminary results were presented at the Berne workshop on Li and 1,2-acquisition of clause-internal rules: scrambling and cliticizatiou in January, 1994. they are two or three positions away).",
        "These results are quite good.",
        "The stickiness is as high as 54-55% for the subject clitics; non-clitics have stickiness no more than 17%.",
        "The Dutch clitic system is far more complicated than the French pronoun system.",
        "(See for example, Zwart (1993).)",
        "Even so, our entropy calculations made some headway towards classifying the pronouns.",
        "We are able to distinguish the weak and strong subject pronouns.",
        "Since even the strong subject pronouns in Dutch tend to stick to their verbs very closely and two clitics can come next to each other, the raw stickiness measure seems to be inappropriate.",
        "Although the Dutch case is problematic due to the effects of V2 and scrambling, we are in the process of treating these phenomena and anticipate that the pronoun calculations in Dutch will sort out properly once the influence of these other word order processes are factored in appropriately."

        "It needs to be emphasized that in our statistical procedure there is a mechanism available to the learning mechanism by which it can determine when it has seen enough input to reliably determine the value of a certain parameter.",
        "(Such means are non-existent in any trigger-based error-driven learning theory.)",
        "In principle at least, the learning mechanism can determine the variance in the quantity of interest as a function of the text size and then know when enough text has been seen to be sure that a certain parameter has to be set in a particular way.",
        "We are currently extending the results we have obtained to other parameters and other languages.",
        "We are convinced that the word order parameters (for example, those in (1-2) in the section Preliminaries) should be fairly easy to set and amenable to an information-theoretic analysis along the lines sketched earlier.",
        "Scrambling also provides a case where calculations of entropy should provide an immediate solution to the parameter-setting problem.",
        "Notice however that both scrambling and V2 interact in an interesting way with the basic word order parameters; a learner may be potentially misled by both scrambling and V2 into mis-setting the basic word order parameters since both parameters can alter the relationship between heads, their complements and their specifiers.",
        "Parameters involving adverb placement, extra-position and wh-movement should be relatively more challenging to the learning algorithm given the relatively low frequency with which adverbs are found in adult speech to children.",
        "These cases provide good examples which motivate the use of multiple trials by the learner.",
        "The interaction between adverb placement and head movement, then, will pose an interesting problem for the learner since the two parameters are interdependent; what the learner assumes about adverb placement is contingent on what it assumes about head placement and vice versa."
