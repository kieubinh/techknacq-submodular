        "Natural language processing of spontaneous speech is particularly difficult because it contains false starts, out of vocabulary words, and ungrammatical constructions.",
        "Because of this, it is unreasonable to hope to be able to write a grammar which will cover all of the phenomena which a parser is likely to encounter in a practical speech translation system.",
        "In this paper we describe an implementation of a hybrid statistical/symbolic approach to recovering from parser failures in the context of a speech-to-speech translation system of significant scope (vocabulary size of 996, word recognition accuracy 60 %, grammar size on the order of 2000 rules).",
        "The domain which the current system focuses on is the scheduling domain where two speakers attempt to set uI a meeting over the phone.",
        "Because this is an interlingua.-based translation system, the goal of the analysis stage of the translation process is to map the utterance in the source language onto a feature-structure representation called an interlingua which represents meaning in a language-independent way.",
        "(This approach extends to other feature structure based meaning representations as well.)",

        "cannot derive a complete analysis for an utterance, it derives a partial parse by skipping over portions of the utterance in order to find a subset which can parse.",
        "It also returns an analysis for the skipped portions which can be used to rebuild the meaning of the input utterance.",
        "The goal of our repair module is to interactively reconstruct the meaning of the full utterance by generating predictions about the way the fragments can fit together and checking them with the user.",
        "In this way it negotiates with the user in order to recover the meaning of the user's utterance.",
        "The repair module described in this paper uses both symbolic and statistical information in order to reconstruct the speaker's meaning from the partial analysis which the parser produces.",
        "It generates predictions based on constraints from a specification of the interlingua representation and from mutual information statistics extracted from a corpus of naturally occurring scheduling dialogues.",
        "Mutual information is intuitively a measure of how strongly associated two concepts are.",
        "Although the syntactic structure of the input utterance certainly plays an important role in determining the meaning of an utterance, it is possible with the use of the interlingua specification to reason about the meaning of an utterance when only partial structural information is available.",
        "This can be accomplished by fitting the partial features structures together against the mold of the interlingua specification.",
        "During the parsing process, two structural representations are generated, one which is a treelike structure generated from the structure of the context-free portion of the parsing grammar rules, and one which is a feature-structure generated from the unification portion of the parsing grammar rules.",
        "There is a many-to-one mapping between tree-structures and feature-structures.",
        "Both of these structures are important in the repair process.",
        "The repair process is analogous in some ways to fitting pieces of a puzzle into a mold which contains receptacles for particular shapes.",
        "The interlingua specification is like the mold with receptacles of different shapes, making it possible to compute all of the ways partial analyses can fit together in order to create a structure which is valid for that interlingua.",
        "But the number of",
        "ways it is possible to do this are so numerous that the brute force method is computationally intractable.",
        "Mutual information statistics are used to guide the search.",
        "These mutual information statistics encode regularities in the types of fillers which tend to occur in particular slots and which feature structures associated with particular non-terminal symbols in the parsing grammar tend to be used in a particular way in the interlingua representation.",
        "By drawing upon both statistical and symbolic sources of information, the repair module can constrain its repair predictions to those which are both likely and meaningful.",
        "One advantage to the design of this module is that it draws upon information sources which were already part of the system before the introduction of the repair module.",
        "Most of the additional information which the module needs was trained automatically with statistical techniques.",
        "The advantage to such a design is that the module can be easily ported to different domains with minimal additional effort.",
        "Another strength is that the statistical model the repair module makes use of continually adapts during use.",
        "This is desirable in a statistical approach in order to overcome problems with unbalanced training sets or training sets which are too small leading to over-fitting."

        "The overwhelming majority of research in symbolic approaches to handling ill-formed input has focused on flexible parsing strategies.",
        "Jerry Hobbs [Hobbs et al.1991], David McDonald [McDonald1993], Jaime Carbonell [Carbonell et al.",
        "19841, Wayne Ward [Woszcyna et al.",
        "1993], Jill Lehman [Lehman1989], and Alon Lavie [Lavie and Tomita1993] have all developed types of flexible parsers.",
        "Hobbs and McDonald each employ grammar-specific heuristics which are suboptimal since they fall short of being completely general.",
        "Ward and Carbonell take a pattern matching approach which is not specific to any particular grammar but the structure of the output representation is not optimal for an application where the output representation is distinct from the structure of the parse, e. g. a feature structure, as in an interlingua-based machine translation system.",
        "Both Lehman and Lavie take an approach which is independent of any particular grammar and makes it possible to generate an output representation which is distinct from the structure of the parse.",
        "Lehman's least-deviant-first parser can accommodate a wide range of repairs of parser failures.",
        "But as it adds new rules to its grammar in order to accommodate idiosyncratic language patterns it quickly becomes intractable for multiple users.",
        "Also, because it does not make use of any statistical regularities, it has to rely on heuristics to determine which repair to try first.",
        "Lavie's approach is a variation on Tomita's Generalized LR parser which can identify and parse the maximal subset of the utterance which is grammatical according to its parsing grammar.",
        "He uses a statistical model to rank parses in order to deal with the extraordinary amount of ambiguity associated with flexible parsing algorithms.",
        "His solution is a general one.",
        "The weakness of this approach is that part of the original meaning of the utterance may be thrown away with the portions of the utterance which were skipped in order to find a subset which can parse.",
        "From a different angle, Gorin has demonstrated that it is possible to successfully build speech applications with a purely statistical approach.",
        "He makes use of statistical correlations between features in the input and the output which purely symbolic approaches do not in general make use of.",
        "The evidence provided by each feature combines in order to calculate the output which has the most cumulative evidence.",
        "In Gorin's approach, the goal is not to derive any sort of structural representation of the input utterance.",
        "It is merely to map the set of words in the input utterance onto some system action.",
        "If the goal is to map the input onto a meaning representation, as is the case in an interlingua-based machine translation project, the task is more complex.",
        "The set of possible meaning representations even in a relatively small domain such a scheduling is so large that such an approach does not seem practical in its pure form.",
        "But if the input features encode structural and semantic information, the same idea can be used to generate repair hypotheses.",
        "The repair module described in this paper builds upon Lavie's and Gorin's approaches, reconstructing the meaning of the original utterance by combining the fragments returned from the parser, and making use of statistical regularities in order to naturally determine which combination to try first.",
        "In our approach we have attempted to abstract away from any particular grammar in order to develop a module which could be easily ported to other domains and other languages.",
        "Our approach allows the system to recover from parser failures and adapt without adding any extra rules to the grammar, allowing it to accommodate multiple users without becoming intractable.",
