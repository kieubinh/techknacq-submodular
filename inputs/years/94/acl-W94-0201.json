        "In its early stages when the temperature is high, annealing search resembles random search.",
        "There is so much free energy in the system that a transition to a higher energy state is highly probable.",
        "As the temperature decreases the search begins to resemble hill-climbing.",
        "Now there is much less free energy and so transitions to higher energy states are less and less likely.",

        "For the parameters we proceed as follows, here exemplified for h. First, set p = t(h.-hrnin).",
        "Now, add to h a random number in the range [-p, p] and check that the result is still in the range [hmin, hmad• equilibrium At each temperature, the system is required to reach 'thermal equilibrium' before the temperature is lowered.",
        "In the present context, equilibrium is reached if no more than one of the last eight perturbations yielded a new state that was accepted.",
        "free energy function This is the amount of available energy for transitions to higher energy states.",

        "Now the algorithm itself is presented:",
        "The program is made up of two loops.",
        "The outer loop simply iterates through the temperature range, beginning with a temperature of 1 and steadily decreasing it until it gets very close to zero.",
        "The nested loop performs the task of reaching thermal equilibrium at each temperature.",
        "The first step is to perturb the previous transcription to make a new one.",
        "Notice that the temperature t is a parameter of the perturb function.",
        "Next, the difference A between the old and new evaluations is calculated.",
        "If the new transcription has a better evaluation than the old one, then A is negative.",
        "Next, the program accepts the new transcription if (i) A is negative or (ii) A is positive and there is sufficient free energy in the system to allow the worse transcription to be accepted.",
        "Finally, we check if the new transcription is better than the best transcription found so far (BestTrans) and if so, we set BestTrans to be the new transcription.",

        "In the first trial, both programs generated random sequences of tones, then computed the corresponding Fo sequence using 7', then set about transcribing the Fo sequence.",
        "Since these sequences were ideal, the best possible evaluation for a transcription was zero.",
        "The performance of the programs could then be measured to see how close they came to finding the optimal solution.",
        "Each program was tested on Fo sequences of length 5, 10, 15 and 20.",

        "The left member of each pair is for the genetic search program, while the right member is for the annealing search program.",

        "These indicate the number of times out of 100 that the programs found a transcription with an evaluation less than 1.",
        "This evaluation means that the average of the squared difference between the predicted Fo values and the actual Fo values was less than 1Hz.",
        "Observe that the annealing search program performs significantly better in all cases.",
        "Note that the mutation operation in the genetic search program treats each bit in the parameter encodings equally, while the perturbation operation in the annealing search program is sensitive to the distinction between more significant vs. less significant bits.",
        "This may explain the better convergence behaviour of the annealing search.",
        "Notice also in Figure 6 that performance",
        "does not degrade with transcription length as the length doubles from 10 to 20.",
        "This is probably because a randomly generated sequence will contain downsteps on every second tone (on average) causing a general downtrend in the Fo values and severely limiting the combinatorial explosion of possible transcriptions.",

        "Consider again the bars corresponding to evaluations less than 1.",
        "For both programs, however, observe that the performance degrades more uniformly than in trial 1, probably because the inclusion of upstep greatly increases the number of possible transcriptions (and hence, the number of local optima).",

        "is different from that in previous figures.",
        "This is because evaluations near zero were less likely with real data.",
        "In fact, the annealing program never found an evaluation less than 3 while the genetic program never found an evaluation less than 4.",
        "Since the programs performed about equally on finding transcriptions with an evaluation less than 7, I shall display these transcriptions along with an indication of how many times each program found the transcription (G = genetic, A = annealing).",
        "I give transcriptions which occurred at least twice in one of the programs, during 100 executions of each.",
