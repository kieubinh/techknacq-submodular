        "The theory of lexical phonology (LP) seeks to explain the interrelationships between morphology and phonology by allocating some of the phonological processes to the dictionary or lexicon in which the morphemes reside.",
        "The functions of brackets and boundary symbols found in other phonological representations are subsumed into the framework of the system.",
        "The domains of both morphological and phonological rules within the lexicon are subdivided into strata which define both the type of morphological process applicable and the mode of operation (i.e. whether cyclic or non-cyclic) of the associated phonological rules.",
        "Processes applied on early strata are invisible to those of later strata through the application of the \"Bracket Erasure Convention\".",
        "A computational system, LexPhon, has been devised to demonstrate the principles of LP.",
        "LexPhon comprises a level-ordered phonological interpreter and a set of linguistic tools for reformulating the stratum control, developing phonological rule sets and for devising phoneme inventories, including natural class categorisation tools for making explicit the conjunctive relationships between the elements of the inventories derived.",
        "Aspects of LP incorporated into LexPhon are the Strict Cyclicity Condition, Bracket Erasure and both cyclic and noncyclic control mechanisms.",
        "Syllabification is based on the Maximal Onset Principle and fully-specified underlying representations are assumed.",
        "The number of strata and attribution of each stratum to either cyclic or noncyclic control is variable by the user.",
        "Ordered sets of phonological rules are allocated to strata.",
        "LexPhon is used for comparison of potential structures for the level-ordered frameworks within which the phonological rules operate and for alternative formulations and assignments of the rules themselves.",
        "Conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of each from the broad phonemic transcriptions resulting from applying any given setting of the system to large quantities of data and from the processing traces also provided.",
        "An example is given of the application of LexPhon to the study of speech style, using data from reported studies of English and Mexico City Spanish and its ability to model the alternative surface forms evidenced by the data, through the reallocation of the same set of phonological rules to different strata, is evaluated."

        "Lexical phonology (Kiparsky, 1982; 1982b; Halle and Mohanan, 1985, Booij and Rubach, 1987; and many others) is a recent approach to generative phonology (Chomsky and Halle, 1968) in which the application of the phonological rules, which map from the abstract, underlying form of a word to its surface, phonetic realisation, is tied to the morphological word formation processes taking place.",
        "Morphological and phonological rules are seen as part of the lexicon and are grouped into strata.",
        "The order of interaction between morphological and phonological components",
        "is stratum-depndant.",
        "Thus, LP ties the application of phonological rules to morphological structure in a particularly close way.",
        "It provides a highly structured framework in which to develop and evaluate the rules and representations for phonological transformations.",
        "However, while there is considerable support for the theory of stratification of morphological rules and the cyclic nature of the application of some phonological rules, opinion is divided as to the number of strata required and the level(s) to which each of the identified phonological rules is assigned in any given language and further, as to whether such higher level control structures are universal (Booij and Rubach, 1987) or language specific (Kiparsky, 1982, Halle and Mohanan, 1985).",
        "In addition to linear representations, LP accounts of linguistic phenomena are frequently formulated within the formats provided by autosegmental and metrical, or nonlinear phonology (for examples see Tranel, 1987; van der Hulst and Smith, 1982; Halle and Vernaud, 1982; Leben, 1982; etc.).",
        "LP descriptions usually adopt the two principle tiers from autosegmental phonology, the melody and the skeleton, to represent the data.",
        "Further layers and/or the hierarchical representations of metrical phonology may be introduced when required.",
        "The melody corresponds roughly to the linear representation of segments whereas the skeleton carries the positional or timing information in x-slots.",
        "The x-slots, sometimes further distinguished as C and V slots, generally correspond one-to-one with the segments and are anchored to elements of the melody tier.",
        "However, in the case of long vowels, for instance, two skeletal slots may be attached to the same vowel.",
        "Empty slots and floating segments are also permitted by this theory.",
        "Both morphological and phonological higher level structures may be attached to the skeleton tier allowing other levels of organisation, such as onset and rime within syllables, to be represented, if required.",
        "Nonlinearity of both morphology and phonology is incorporated into LP through the structuring of the lexicon and the independence of syllabification from the word-formation process.",
        "For LexPhon, the concept of timing slots has influenced the choice of multiple segment descriptions for long vowels and diphthongs.",
        "Syllabification, where needed, is derived from the current segmental representation which thus reflects both the melody and skeleton tiers.",
        "However, by permitting features and their domains to be independent of the segment, autosegmental phonology also allows for the description of feature and tonal units smaller than a single segment.",

        "The term \"speech style\" usually refers to intra-speaker variation although there is not as yet any consensus as to its scope (Llisterri, 1992).",

        "Stylistic variations may be restricted to prosodic, phonetic and phonemic contrasts or extend to syntax, choice of lexical items or even choice between different languages (Milroy, 1987).",
        "Thus, speech style may be seen as a single continuum along which each of the contributory factors may be ranged (Labov, 1981) or as a set of distinct categories within which there can be intra-style variation (Milroy, 1987).",
        "Further, different factors can result in the same phonemic or phonetic contrasts (Kreidler, 1989).",
        "Harris (1969) presented a study of Hispanic phonology in which he contrasted the regular variations in pronunciations which occurred, relative to the speed at which each utterance was produced.",
        "He identified four different speeds which could be characterised for the Mexico City dialect of Spanish under study.",
        "These comprised: Largo, slow and also described as overprecise; Andante, not quite so slow and considered typical of natural careful speech; Allegretto, somewhat faster and typical of natural casual speech; and Presto, extremely fast and unconstrained.",
        "The styles are distinguished b y differences in nasal and sibilant assimilations as well as by other variants.",
        "The assimilation phenomena seem to be at least partially dependent on differences in the level of boundaries which must be specified in the phonological rules.",
        "This suggests that the level ordering of LP might enable a simpler characterisation of speech style contrast be formulated.",

        "LexPhon, a computational framework for models of lexical phonology, has been described and an example application of one potential use of such a system has been presented.",
        "Using LexPhon, contrastive L P structures were applied to Spanish and English data in the context of language-dependant Phoneme Inventories and Phonological Rule sets.",
        "A hypothesis was tested that intra-speaker style variation might be the result of applying the same rules to the same underlying forms but at different stages of the utterance formation process.",
        "In the case of the Spanish data for the Mexico City dialect, allocation of rules to strata appears to account for a substantial proportion of the attested variation between the speech speed styles.",
        "For the contrastive study of English careful versus casual style data, reallocation of rules to strata appears to account for a smaller proportion of the variation attested, in spite of the use of a much more comprehensive rule set.",
        "Although the studies presented here are not conclusive, they provide evidence which gives support to the theory that aspects of style variation may be attributable to the level of word-formation at which phonological rules are applied, rather than necessarily to differences in the formulation of the rules themselves.",
        "This supports the LP hypothesis that complex surface phonology of languages may be the result of interactions between relatively simple morphological and phonological processes taking place within a simple framework.",
        "Further, the application of LexPhon to a problem requiring alternative phoneme inventory, phonological rulebase and LP control framework demonstrates the flexibility which the system can offer to comparative studies in lexical phonology."
