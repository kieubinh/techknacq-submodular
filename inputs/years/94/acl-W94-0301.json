        "We believe that \"discourse relations\" (essentially, semantic meta-relations) and \"rhetorical types\" (roughly, speech acts)1 are major elements of an appropriate input structure for tactical generation, and that both sorts of elements can be identified by analyzing their surface linguistic expressions.",
        "[Seligman 91] presented a discovery methodology based on synonymy judgments, one intended to refine and make more explicit an earlier proposal appearing in [Ivir et al. 1973].",
        "Recently, an independent but quite similar suggestion by [Knott and Dale 1992] has introduced some further worthwhile refinements.",
        "Let us put forth the view of tactical generation which motivates this opinion.",
        "We can then go on to compare the three procedures.",
        "We take it as fairly uncontroversial that the role of a tactical generation program is to express certain preselected semantic and pragmatic structures.",
        "The strategic component has decided that certain meanings and functions are to be expressed; and the tactical component's assignment is to select any combination of expressors which preserve that meaning and function.",
        "Strategy has decided what to say; tactics must choose a way of saying it.",
        "But certain implications of this tactical assignment -\"select expressors so as to preserve meaning and function\" need clarification.",
        "One implication, we think, is that a semantic or pragmatic symbol at the tactical level should be considered by its very definition a shorthand for a semantic or pragmatic equivalence relation: a way of capturing what semantic or pragmatic characteristics certain surface expressions have in common.",
        "And so a tactical generator's task with respect to such a symbol, stated a bit more carefully, is to choose among expressions which have been previously judged semantically or pragmatically equivalent in context and grouped under that symbol for just that reason.",
        "(And, since there will be many symbols, each with several possible structures, it must also make sure that the respective expressors are compatible.)",
        "From this reconceptualization or redefinition of the tactical role, it follows directly that a procedure for discovering semantic or pragmatic symbols at the tactical level should depend on speakers' semantic and pragmatic equivalence judgments.",
        "A commitment to restrict the tactical role to making expressive selections and checking expressor compatabilities has a second implication: while there is a great deal to be known about the connection between tactical input symbols and communicative goals or cognition, it is not the tactical generator's job to know it.",
        "Its input symbols should reflect utterance goals or the processes of deciding what to say only to the extent that these are slated for explicit expression -- for instance, as the explicit markings of this or that speech act.",
        "A strategic program, when delivering an input structure to the tactical generator, should supply in its symbols and their interrelationships all the information necessary to make meaning-or-function-preserving expressor choices, but it need not supply a full trace of the strategic reasoning, and we should not expect to"

        "When the fox tells the crow his voice is beautiful, we will see nothing of his ulterior motives in the tactical generation input, though presumably they lurk in prior structures leading to it.",
        "At that level, we see only an assertion, indicating some speech goals to be sure, but only such as the fox decided would be politic.",
        "We are not, of course, suggesting that strategic problems be ignored -- only that they can and should be cleanly separated from tactical ones.",
        "It is clear that true semantic and pragmatic studies -- studies showing how a given meaning or function (set of equivalent expressors) is selected in context -- must inform strategic programs.",
        "(Beyond this, they are desirable for tactical generation efforts as well, since semantic/pragmatic analysis can make more plausible a set of discourse relation symbols discovered via speakers' equivalence judgments.",
        "For this purpose, we semantically analyze several relations in [Seligman 19911 comparing our analysis with several competing ones.)",
        "But while semantic/pragmatic study is indispensable, it is methodologically valuable to separate it from synonym-based discovery of relations and to treat the discovery as primary, as a first step.",
        "One can first determine that native speakers judge several expressions to have the same meaning or function in certain contexts, and then use this information as a guide in investigating the nature of the equivalence -- the linkage to situations and goals.",
        "Assuming that the purpose of tactical semantic and pragmatic symbols is precisely to capture paraphrases -- to symbolize what is semantically and pragmatically invariant in a range of surface expressions -- it is natural that a symbol set is to be tested by generating purported paraphrases from it.",
        "Various versions of the output should indeed be judged to preserve meaning and pragmatic function.",
        "If not, another cycle of elicitation must tease apart distinctions or commonalities missed the last time round.",

        "The present modest proposal is to extend this sort of investigation to discourse relations and rhetorical types as well as to relations in general.",

        "We now examine and compare three specific paraphrase-based discovery procedures for discourse relations.",

        "Their catalog was compiled as part of a contrastive study of English and Serbo-Croatian, and thus strives for cross-linguistic universality.",
        "They began their study by compiling a list of surface clause relators from the Brown corpus and standard grammatical sources.",
        "Their method for discovering discourse relations by comparison of such surface expressions is described only as follows: ... we chose sets of two sentences [in each language] and applied the test of whether a particular item [surface structure] could link them without substantially altering the relationship indicated by other members of the same category.",
        "What exactly constituted a \"substantial\" alternation, of course, presented a complex problem, which we dealt with by appealing to the intuition of native speakers [Ivir et al. 1973:29].",
        "The resulting S-relators, some 62 of them, are listed with testing frames taken to be diagnostic and sample relating structures.",
        "Here are two, omitting the equivalent Serbo-Croatian:",
        "Other relators, intuitively grouped in the study according to semantic field, include NON-REAL.CAUSE (as if ), COMPARATIVE.DEGREE ( so ... that, to such a degree), and fifty-odd others.",
        "All these relations are listed along with a few typical expressors in an appendix to [Seligman 91].",

        "These symbols should represent pragmatic or semantic (\"rhetorical or non-rhetorical\") equivalence classes of expressions, and should thus be discovered by using as primary data speakers' equivalence judgments.",
        "We offered a discovery procedure based on paraphrase, intended to be more explicit and flexible than a procedure suggested by Ivir et al.",
