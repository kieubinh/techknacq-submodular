        "Second, discourse plans must represent the informational structure of utterances.",
        "Discourse interpretation requires that an agent be able to recognize the relationships between the information conveyed in consecutive elements of discourse (e.g., [7, 16]).",
        "Choosing syntactic structures and connective markers that convey these relationships requires that a discourse generator represent informational [19, 21, 22] as well as intentional [4] structure.",
        "Because there is not a fixed, one-to-one mapping between intentional and informational structures, discourse plans must include an explicit representation of both types of structure [15, 16].",
        "In addition to these representational requirements, we argue that discourse planners should meet certain computational requirements.",
        "Most current discourse planners are based on the original NOAH [20] model of hierarchical planning [1, 2, 9, 13, 15].",
        "These systems rely on customized planning algorithms with procedural semantics for the purposes of solving specific text-planning problems.",
        "The informal construction of these systems and their application to particular problems have resulted in successful text generation for specific domains and text types.",
        "However, careful analysis of these programs shows that there is nothing in their semantics to prevent them from generating incorrect plans, generating plans with redundant steps, or failing to find plans in situations where they exist.",
        "To the extent that these planners have been able to avoid these problems, they have done so by severely limiting the expressive power of action descriptions and/or requiring the designer to handcraft each action description to fit correctly into the ad hoc semantics of the specific plan for which the action is intended.",
        "As the number of operators for such systems increases it becomes impractical for their designers to maintain their consistency.",
        "To overcome these limitations, we argue that a discourse planning algorithm should be formally sound and complete (or at least be formally characterizable in terms of these properties).",
        "While these formal characteristics may need to be relaxed in order to construct a planner for any given application, it is important to determine exactly how a planning algorithm fails to meet these requirements.",
        "Without such a characterization one cannot specify what class of plans, and thus what class of discourses, are generated by a discourse planning system.",
        "In this paper we provide a general characterization of previous discourse planning systems in terms of these properties.",
        "We then describe a new discourse planning algorithm that extends recent work on partial-order, causal link (POCL) planning systems to represent hierarchical discourse plans.",

        "Although the plan shown in Figure 2 does not explicitly illustrate how our representation addresses cases where action descriptions have multiple effects and so distinguishes between intended and side-effects in the same action, our model handles these cases appropriately.",
        "Our solution rests on the fact that our model makes a clear distinction between effects of discourse actions that play a role in achieving the top-level goals of the discourse plan and effects that are not causally linked in a way that contributes to the agent's ultimate goals.",

        "For example, one way for a speaker to increase a hearer's belief in a proposition (i.e., to support a proposition) is to describe a plausible cause of that proposition.",
        "In DPOCL, we represent this \"rule of language\" using a decomposition operator as illustrated by the decomposition operator in Figure 3.",
        "This operator says that one way to support a proposition ?prop1 is to find another proposition, ?prop2, such that causes(?prop2, ?propl) is true in the domain.",
        "If such a ?prop2 can be found, then the speaker can support ?propl by making the hearer believe ?prop2 and the relation causes(?prop2, ?propl) In this way, information in the domain acts to constrain what language rules are appropriate and, given any particular rule, what objects can be referred to when it is used.",
        "The representation of the informational structure in a DPOCL plan is straightforward.",
        "Each decomposition operator in DPOCL lists the informational constraints that must hold in order for an abstract action to be achieved by the subplan defined in that operator.",
