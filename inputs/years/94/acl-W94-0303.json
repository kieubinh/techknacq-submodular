        "Our experience with MACH-111 [Kurland et al. 1992] showed us that there is more to multiparagraph text than stringing together isolated well-formed paragraphs, not surprising since the same is true of multisentential paragraphs and multiword sentences.",
        "The underlying structure of the entire text, depicting interparagraph relationships and emphases, must also be determined for successful generation.",
        "This of course implies that we need a formalism for representing interparagraph structure.",
        "Fortunately, RST [Mann & Thompson 1987] is capable of representing the needed interparagraph structure as well as intraparagraph structure, giving us the framework for exploring how paragraph structure and total text structure interact and how these structures affect the surface text.",
        "However, RST does not specify how to build large structures representing multiparagraph text, or even smaller structures representing sentences.",
        "This paper presents an algorithm to construct such multiparagraph structures in the context of a critique by the MACH-III system of a student's performance in troubleshooting the HAWK radar.",
        "This critique is based on the functional hierarchy tree (FH tree), which is the heart of the expert system component of MACH-III [Kurland et a/ 1989].",
        "First we describe functional hierarchy as a paradigm for organizing expert system knowledge.",
        "Then the algorithm for generating text structures based on this functional hierarchy organization is presented in two parts.",
        "The first describes how the higher level RST structure defining the overall organization of the paragraphs and their contents is built.",
        "This is an elaboration of the algorithm first presented in [Granville 1993].",
        "The second part describes how the individual paragraph RST structures are filled out, resulting in a complete representation of the desired text.",
        "This algorithm was developed as part of the George system, ongoing work extending MACH-III to improve explanation capabilities.",
        "The first part of the algorithm, that which builds the high-level RST structures, has been implemented.",
        "The second part is the current subject of the George effort.",
        "2.",
        "Functional Hierarchy and Explanations",
        "Since our algorithm relies heavily upon the functional hierarchy tree structured organization of the MACH-III expert system, we should begin with a brief description.",
        "Functional hierarchy (FH) is a new paradigm for organizing expert system knowledge bases, based on the procedural abstraction principles of Liskov and Guttag Pskov & Guttag 1986].",
        "Functional hierarchy differs greatly from production rules (the customary basis for an expert system) in that functional hierarchy rules define the actions a system can take, rather than the conditions under which actions may take place.",
        "The concept of \"action\" is expanded to include all actions the system takes, including control decisions, rather than just changes to the database, thereby eliminating the need for a separate control structure.",
        "These rules are arranged in a hierarchy, where the action of a rule is defined as a combination of other actions.",
        "A complete description of the FH paradigm can be found in [Kurland et a/ 19921.",
        "A student action is deemed either to be GOOD, when the action continues in the current branch of the FH tree, SKIPPING, when an action jumps to another branch of the tree before the current branch is completed, OUT OF TREE, when the action has nothing to do with the problem at hand, and therefore isn't represented in the tree, or REDUNDANT, when an action had already been taken by the student, since none of the various actions in this domain ought to be repeated in one session.",
        "There is also RETURN for when a student returns to a branch he skipped from, which is the equivalent of GOOD, and SKIPPING-RETURN, which is a return to a skipped branch at the price of leaving the current branch unfinished, equivalent to SKIPPING.",
        "MACH-III includes navigational milestones in its output.",
        "These milestones do not represent direct actions the student has taken, but mark the entering, returning to, and completion of branches in the FH tree by the actions the student does take.",
        "In writing any text, the intended audience must be identified and assumptions of background knowledge be made.",
        "The intended audience for the MACH-III critiques consists of students who have already had several weeks of training in troubleshooting HAWK radar systems.",
        "We can assume they are basically familiar with the troubleshooting task and the components that make up HAWK radars.",
        "The chief goal of the MACH-III system is to help the students organize their troubleshooting knowledge with simulated hands-on experience to make them more efficient at the required task."

        "A common component of generation systems is a database containing assumptions of the reader's knowledge known as the reader model (or listener model for systems that simulate participants in spoken dialogue).",
        "In our system, the required text is not a model of interactive dialogue, but rather a written monologue.",
        "This means that our reader model does not have to be subject to testing and correcting, since such testing and correcting are by nature interactive.",
        "Therefore, the system doesn't have to be careful about maintaining a history of how the RST was built, and which assumptions were brought into play when decisions in building the RST were made.",
        "This is in direct contrast with Moore's system [Moore 1989].",
        "In her work, Moore addressed the problem of a listener not understanding a computer generated response in an interactive dialogue, usually due to a mistaken assumption in the system's listener model.",
        "It was imperative for Moore's system to be able to identify where in its plan the system failed to make itself understood and the assumptions that caused it to make the erroneous decisions that resulted in the faulty plan.",
        "This way it could correct the assumptions and revise the plan, resulting in clearer text for the listener.",
        "In order to do this, Moore's system must build its plan to achieve identified goals, and keep careful records of how the plan was built, what decisions were made, and the factors that went into those decisions.",
        "The George system does not need an elaborate component to build a plan for two reasons.",
        "The first, as mentioned above, is that the desired output text of George is a non-interactive monologue of written text, rather than text that models interactive dialogue, and therefore doesn't need information for revising its text in reaction to a listener's misunderstanding.",
        "The second is that the database from which George has to generate text is the MACH-III functional hierarchy trees.",
        "These FH trees are structured purposely to explicitly reflect the very organization we want George to explain.",
        "Because of these FH trees, we don't have to build plans to determine text structure, and the job of organizing the text, that is, building RST structures, is greatly simplified.",
        "An observant reader will note that a great deal of structure is being imposed on the knowledge base, significantly more than is usual.",
        "This raises the question, can we reasonably expect expert systems to have such carefully structured knowledge bases?",
        "Clearly, there has to be an intrinsic organization to expert knowledge; there have to be basic relationships about how pieces of information combine to form larger pieces.",
        "Knowing you need to test the local oscillator subsystem of a radar unit, but not knowing the subcomponents that make up the local oscillator subsystem will not be sufficient to accomplish the task.",
        "Even if you know how to test each basic component in the radar, not knowing how they combine to form larger subsystems would preclude testing these larger subsystems.",
        "If there has to be an organization to knowledge, the next question is when should that organizing be done.",
        "Traditionally, no organizational structure for the facts has been required of the expert system.",
        "Responsibility for the structure is usually placed on the generation system.",
        "Either the generation system builds the structure to produce a coherent text (e.g. [Hovy 1988]), or plausible structures (such as McKeown's schemas [McKeown 1982]) are built ahead of time, and the system selects one that defines the desired structure.",
        "But we have agreed that to be useful, knowledge has to be organized.",
        "Obviously, the expert system is making use of that knowledge, so there has to be some organization to it.",
        "And, if the experts system desires to explain its knowledge, and the organization is an integral part of that knowledge, then the expert system must explain this organization, too.",
        "But a system cannot explain something it doesn't explicitly represent ([Swartout 19831 [Clancey 1983]), so we must somehow explicitly represent the organization of the system.",
        "The traditional expert system paradigm of a production rule knowledge base doesn't represent this organization well, as many researchers have pointed out over the years ([Clancey, Shortliffe, Buchanan 1979], [Swartout 1983], [Clancey 1983], [Kurland et al. 1992] to name a few.",
        "The chief problem is that the independent production rules are the result of a careful organization of the knowledge on the part of the human designers, but these rules don't explicitly represent that organization.",
        "All the organization is lost to the system.",
        "Functional hierarchy is a paradigm that explicitly organizes the knowledge to reflect the structure of the knowledge used by actual experts.",
        "Since this organization is explicitly represented, it is readily"

        "available for explanation purposes.",
        "This knowledge structure is itself something that differentiates experts from novices.",
        "Therefore, rather than being a nicety, such organization should be explicitly represented and available in any expert system as a fundamental part of the knowledge base.",
        "Finally, a few words should be said about our use of RST in George.",
        "As was discussed above, most generation systems impose little or no organizational requirements on the facts they take as input, and instead build the text structure or select the text structure from a pool of schemas.",
        "Those that build their structures, and use RST as the representation of that resulting structure, have extended RST from its original concept to include the mechanisms for the construction of text structure as well as the representation of text structure (see e.g. [Hovy 1988]).",
        "George uses only the representation originally introduced in [Mann & Thompson 1987], without any of the mechanisms used for building structure that are commonly thought of as part of RST.",

        "High-Level Text Organization",
        "An examination of the desired text may yield some hints about the underlying structure.",
        "As we stated above, the purpose of the this text is to describe student actions in the course of a troubleshooting session, and how these actions relate to the organization in the FH trees.",
        "The only relationships between these actions are how they combine in order to contribute to or detract from an orderly attempt to isolate a problem in the HAWK radar.",
        "In themselves, they are completely independent.",
        "Testing one component has nothing to do with testing another outside the context of troubleshooting the entire radar.",
        "The way RST organizes events, such as student actions, that have no relationship between them other than they occurred in a specific order is with the SEQUENCE relation.",
        "Because we're assuming our audience is conversant with troubleshooting HAWK radars, we don't have to explain the function of components or how the basic actions are performed.",
        "Instead, we must tell the student the system's judgment on each specific action, and how that judgment was made.",
        "When an action is deemed good, we must explain why it was good; when it is deemed a mistake, we must explain why it was a mistake.",
        "In MACH-III, an action is determined to be good or bad based on how it maneuvers the student through the FH tree.",
        "Therefore the navigational milestones generated by MACH-III can serve to help explain the critique of each action.",
        "Since the text isn't interactive and we don't have to verify and modify our reader model, we can assume that once we explain the validity of a branch in the FH tree or why a problem violates the tree organization, the student understands the concept, and it doesn't have to be explained again.",
        "This leaves the problem of the higher organization of the text, that is, where to break paragraphs in the RST structure.",
        "It was argued in [Granville 1990] that the structural organization of a text is as important to the message to be conveyed as is its factual content.",
        "Therefore any artificial metric for paragraphs, such as limiting them to a specific number of sentences, must be unsatisfactory.",
        "However, the problem is not so daunting when we consider the purpose of the paragraph, which is to describe one idea or topic.",
        "One obvious topic category for our text consists of problems and navigational milestones that must be explained because they are being encountered for the first time.",
        "The problem or milestone being explained is obviously the topic of the explanation, and therefore deserves its own paragraph.",
        "Since problems and milestones that have already been explained do not get full explanations with subsequent encounters, these further references don't merit paragraph treatment.",
        "This does not completely solve the problem, however.",
        "Depending on how the FH tree is set up and previous student actions, we may be presented with a set of actions without problems or milestones to explain, and therefore apparently no natural points to break paragraphs.",
        "Nevertheless, the set of actions may be too large to describe in a single paragraph.",
        "Once again, a natural solution appears when we consider the purpose of our text, which is to describe the student's actions and how they relate to properly navigating through FH trees, ultimately to help teach the student the organization of these trees.",
        "Since teaching this organization is a high-level goal, structuring the text to reflect this organization whenever possible would be beneficial.",
        "By placing actions that are directly related in the FH tree in the same paragraph and putting paragraph breaks between actions that aren't related because they're in different branches, our text will reflect the FH tree organization.",
        "However, this criterion may be overridden if the paragraph would consist of only",
        "one action item that doesn't require elaboration.",
        "Otherwise, we could generate a paragraph consisting of one simple sentence.",
        "Finally, there may be circumstances where we don't want a paragraph break, even though we have the conditions we've described.",
        "When an FM node has to be explained, we've observed that this requires a central topic and thus its own paragraph.",
        "However, we can have two consecutive actions, each requiring explanations on topics that are closely related.",
        "For instance, if a student skips to a new branch when neither the skipping problem nor the new branch has yet been explained, we'd have to explain both the milestone of entering the new branch and the skipping problem, and since they both relate to the same action, we want them in the same paragraph.",
        "Another example is an action requiring explanation because of a milestone followed immediately by a redundant occurrence of the same action.",
        "In both these cases, the central topic is the action, and the two explanations should be in the same paragraph.",
        "From these observations, building a multiparagraph RST structure is straightforward.",
        "Let's look at a concrete example.",
        "The following is a portion of the output of an actual MACH-III session (run by the author).",
        "The test indications (which are not part of the critique output) had indicated a fault with Receiver Noise.",
        "A possible text description of these actions is the following.",
        "(Phrases are numbered for discussion purposes to correspond with later diagrams.)",
        "(1) The next action you took was to check the W4, (2) one of the RF input cables.",
        "(3) If these cables are faulty, feedthrough nulling won't occur properly, (4) resulting in noise in the Receiver, so checking the W4 is certainly a valid step.",
        "(5) However, an organized approach to troubleshooting the Receiver is strongly recommended, and checking the W4 at this point left your investigation of whether noise is being introduced unfinished.",
        "(6) (You hadn't yet checked the Scan Driver Assembly, which can also introduce noise if not working properly.)",
        "(7) You followed the W4 check by replacing the Scan Driver, (8) further skipping around.",
        "(9) By executing a BITE Test, you demonstrated that the fault wasn't with the Scan Driver, (10) and the problem wasn't noise being introduced.",
