        "Non-determinism in these automata has been addressed using focus preferences for selecting from a content pool, these preferences being embodied in a selection mechanism.",
        "Other approaches exploited the structure of domain knowledge with mechanisms for traversing data structures representing this knowledge [Paris & McK-eown 1986, Sibun 1992].",
        "Planning approaches initially utilized more local yet still schematic specifications of ordering, expressed as preconditions or optional satellites for plan operators [Cawsey 1989, Hovy 1988, Moore 1989].",

        "However these processes underconstrain sequential structure.",
        "This is especially true below the granularity at which the operators interface with a domain knowledge source, because the latter is partially responsible for providing collections of related content that can't be specified by domain-independent operators.",
        "For example, a specification that some distinguish",
        "lug attributes of an entity should be expressed might bind to several nonexclusive alternatives, or a specification for a description of the constituents of an object or process might result in retrieval of a collection of propositions.",
        "Some sequencing decisions above the granularity of access to domain knowledge may be un-derconstrained as well, for example the order in which to express a list of multiple reasons for a conclusion.",
        "Further constraints are available, for example from reasoning about the integrative processes of the hearer or reader and the impact of working memory limits on these processes.",
        "Application of these constraints is a matter for discourse planning because the choices relate to one's communicative goals, as discussed below.",
        "Sequential structure is too important to treat arbitrarily and too context-sensitive to treat in a schematic manner.",
        "Overall, ordering heuristics have not typically been made explicit as causally efficacious plan operators.",
        "Explicit ordering operators facilitate the expression and study of alternate theories of sequential structure, and have benefits for planning as well.",
        "For example, they enable a planner to tell whether it can achieve a communicative goal by ordering its utterances in a certain way, and they provide a handle for changing strategies in different discourse situations.",
        "Suthers [1993a] treated sequencing as a distinct planning task and used sequencing operators that derived ordering constraints from relevant relationships between the elements being ordered.",
        "However, prior planning approaches (including that just cited) have not made the effects of ordering decisions explicit.",

        "For example, a common con-ffict is between a sequential structure that makes a single entity salient and a sequential structure that flows smoothly from one entity to another (\"dovetailing\").",

        "Presented after a generality, examples provide concrete instances under which the generality may be indexed.",

        "Achieving Communicative Goals by Sequential Structure.",
        "Some planners (e.g., POCL planners) can notice when a goal can be achieved by actions that have already been planned.",
        "However, these planners can only take advantage of existing actions when the explicit effects of a single action meets the goal in question.",
        "It should be possible to extend these planners to use ordering operators in an opportunistic manner to identify ways in which goals can be achieved by felicitous ordering of multiple actions, e.g., to achieve communicative goals by implicit relations [Lascarides & Oberlander 1992, Mann & Thompson 1983].",
        "If an operator's effect matches to an active unsatisfied goal and the operator's constraints match existing utterance components or planning can satisfy these constraints with new utterances, then mere installation of the ordering constraint can be used to achieve the communicative goal.",
        "For example, suppose a discourse planner has the goals of describing a number of events and the causal relations between them.",
        "Communication of the causal relations might be achieved implicitly by describing the events in their causal order.",

        "Approaches that treat sequencing as a selective task, for example by using predicates that select the most preferred element out of a set of remaining candidates, are forced to generate a full ordering (the sequence of selected items).",
        "The structural aspects of sequencing are not a natural consequence of the model.",
        "When sequencing is treated as the accumulation of explicit constraints between elements, partial orderings can be constructed.",

        "Juxtaposition is significant when the contents of both segments must be in focus of attention at the same time in order for the segments to fulfill their intended communicative function.",
        "For example, statements of similarity and difference are usually juxtaposed when making a comparison so that the relative significance of the similarities and differences can be weighed.",
        "Any constraint on Sequential structure must involve one of precedence or juxtaposition.",
        "Succession indicates the simultaneous presence of both constraints (i.e., that one segment should occur immediately before and neat to another segment).",

        "Once familiar-first has been applied, dovetailing can be used to introduce other unfamiliar concepts.",
        "The assumption behind familiar-first is that it is easier to retrieve a known concept and integrate a new concept in relation to it than it is to construct a new concept from scratch and subsequently retrieve a known concept to which it can be integrated.",
        "However, at and below the clause level the delay between the introduction of n and f may be so small that this strategy does not have a discernible effect.",
        "Also, if n is a topic, \"topic as subject\" may be more relevant to the speaker's goals.",
        "These are questions for empirical work."

        "The sequencing of expository texts and speech should be chosen to enhance the intended functionality of each textual unit and to facilitate the questioner's integration of the communicated information.",
        "This aspect of the planning task is usefully seen as one of translating functionally relevant relationships between textual units into ordering constraints.",
        "The strategies presented in this paper were derived from examination of example explanations and found to be necessary to enable an automated explanation generator to produce coherently sequenced explanations [Suthers 1993a].",
        "(Space constraints necessitate leaving a full example to the work just cited.)",
        "Many of the strategies were subsequently found to correspond to results in the psycholinguistic literature.",
        "As discussed previously, the strategies can conflict.",
        "Suthers [1993a] handled conflicts with a simple preference ordering.",
        "This approach is inadequate because conflict resolution is expected to depend on contextual factors such as the speaker or writer's goals and the relationships of the elements to be ordered with respect to discourse segment boundaries.",
        "The author is currently planning psycholinguistic experiments to test the impact of the strategies through reading time and recall studies, with particular concern for how the resolution of conflicts between topic salience and other heuristics should be sensitive to discourse context.",
        "Another question for future work is the extent to which the sequencing task fits top-down models of planning such as DPOCL [Young et al.",
        "1994] vs. requiring a distinct mechanism for the application of conflicting heuristics.",
        "The modeling of working memory limits and memory decay in DPOCL operators would require generalizing the POCL notion of a \"threat\" to be a matter of degree rather than absolute.",
        "The author suspects that important generalities will be easier to capture if factored out and expressed as explicit sequencing operators rather than manifested in variations of multiple decom-positional operators.",
        "The foregoing work is being extended to include the subordination structure of an utterance as well as its sequential structure.",
        "\"Focus trees\" [McCoy & Cheng 1991, Hovy & McCoy 1989] will be used to represent the combined sequential and subordination structure, with partial orderings placed between siblings at each level of the hierarchy.",
        "The nodes of a focus tree represent units of a text at various granularities ranging from intentionally defined segments of the sort discussed by Grosz & Sidner [1986] down through clausal propositions to predicates and entity references.",
        "\"Focusing operators,\" including versions of the sequencing heuristics of this paper rewritten in the focus tree notation, will manipulate the tree structure by subordinating one or more subtree to another or by installing cross-links between siblings to constrain possible traversals.",
        "This reformulation is expected to be an improvement for several reasons.",
        "It allows the expression of heuristics for the subordination aspects of focus structure, not just sequencing, and thematic development can take place at multiple granularities.",
        "Only one ordering relation, precedence, is required.",
        "Juxtaposition is handled by grouping within a subordinate structure rather than by a different ordering relation that requires special interpretation.",
        "An availability metric can be defined in terms of distance to search back through the tree.",
        "Finally, the notation can be used in the analysis of texts, and promises to support application of the sequencing heuristics to text revision as well as text generation."
