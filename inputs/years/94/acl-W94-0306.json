        "Instructional texts have been the object of many studies recently, with an emphasis on methods for integrating graphics and text, as in WIP (Wahlster et al., 1993) and COMET (Feiner and McKeown, 1990), for tailoring to the user (Peter and ROsner, 1994), for generating purpose expressions in English (Vander Linden, 1993), for producing multilingual instructions, (e.g., Rosner and Stede, 1991), and for planning the appropriate referring expressions, (e.g., Dale, 1992).",
        "Most of",
        "these systems produce only a sequence of steps necessary to accomplish a task (e.g., change the engine oil, replace a radio battery, cook butter bean soup).",
        "One of the motivations for generating instructions automatically is the increased need to produce manuals, especially multilingual manuals, coupled with the cost of translators and technical writers.",
        "This is important not only for European manufacturers, who are required to produce manuals in all the languages of the European Union, but also for multinational companies, whose international sales are reported to constitute over half of their total sales.",
        "Given this motivation, then, producing the sequence of steps required to achieve a task is only part of the job: most user guides and manuals contain more than a simple sequence of steps to achieve a task.",
        "In our work, we are attempting to generate a more complete user guide, in several languages.",
        "The emphasis of previous research on instructions has led to the almost exclusive use of one type of discourse structure (a sequence, reflecting the sequence of steps needed for a task), and one type of realisation (the imperative).",
        "We have found, however, that manuals can have different styles: not all instructions are stated in a sequence, using the imperative form.",
        "This would indeed lead to rather monotonous texts, texts with potentially the wrong interpersonal force (too many imperatives can be too forceful!",
        "), and instructions in which the relative importance of various steps might be lost.",
        "Furthermore, different parts of manuals often use different discourse structures and forms of realisation.",
        "In our work, we are investigating the range of \"styles\" in instructional manuals in different languages, and the relationship between stylistic variants and the global structure of the manual both within and between languages.",
        "The work reported here is part of the DRAFTER and the GIST projects at the University of Brighton (Scott, 1993), which aim to generate instructional manuals in several languages",
        "and in different domains.",
        "We have analysed user guides in various languages, attempting to avoid translated manuals.",
        "This paper presents our preliminary results concerning the different styles and global structures that frequently occur within English and French manuals for consumer appliances.",
        "Although our analysis so far does not provide conclusive results with respect to the relationships between stylistic variants, the global structures, and different languages, they suggest that it is important for a system to provide a range of styles of instructions.",
        "Our results also indicate directions for further analysis."

        "Instructions are aimed at conveying directions to perform a (set of) task(s).",
        "For example, we can have instructions for filling out a form, or for operating and repairing a device.",
        "We include in our definition of instructions activities related to the actions to be performed, such as installation (preparatory steps), maintenance and trouble-shooting, as well as warnings concerning the safe execution of the actions.",
        "Confining instructions solely to central actions to be performed is too restrictive as the above-mentioned aspects are also integral parts of carrying out a task safely and efficiently.",
        "The most straightforward way to get a reader to perform a task is, of course, through the use of a sequence of imperatives.",
        "However, our analysis of a corpus of over 30 user manuals for consumer appliances reveals a variety of realisations for such directions, from imperatives to simple statements.",
        "Statements may, by some, be considered to be outside the scope of instructions.",
        "We do not hold to this: we have found numerous examples to support the view that statements are often implicit instructions.",
        "Consider, for example, the following instructions from English and French for using a insulated flask, taken from EMSA Thermos.",
        "Filter coffee: Simply place the filter on your EMSA vacuum jug to prevent escape of aroma and temperature Filtrage du café: Le café peut-etre flint directement dans le pichet.",
        "Le porte-filtres s' adapte parfaitement sur l'ouverture du pichet, &lint ainsi la perte et la dispersion de l' al-tune du café.",
        "Loose English Translation: Filtering of Coffee: The coffee can be filtered directly into the jug.",
        "Filter holders .fit perfectly on the opening of the jug, thus preventing loosing the aroma of the coffee Here we see that the English instructions to filter coffee is given as an imperative, whereas, in the French version, the user is provided with a description of the utensil, from which the directions can be derived.",
        "The issue of style is of course not a new one: indeed, there are whole subfields of theoretical and computational linguistics devoted to it.",
        "Sometimes it is referred to as stylistics (e.g., Crystal and Davy, 1969; Ager, 1970; DiMarco, 1992), special languages (e.g., Sager et al., 1980), sublanguages (e.g., Kit-tredge and Lehrberger, 1982), conative function (e.g., Jakob-son, 1960), registers (e.g., Halliday, 1973; Ghadessy, 1988; Bateman and Paris, 1989; Martin, 1992), or pragmatic effects (e.g., Hovy, 1988).",
        "It is thus not surprising that this linguistic feature also applies to instructions, although it has not been explicitly addressed so far.",
        "The different styles in instructional manuals appear to be closely allied to the stance the writer takes towards the reader.",
        "For example, different stances are usually taken when providing a description and a warning.",
        "Although, in general, such stances can be a decision on the part of the writer (or speaker), in which case it can be referred to as a conative intention (Sager et al., 1980), in the case of instructional manuals, it is usually an institutional decision on the part of the product manufacturer or the technical writing company (this is often referred to as \"house style\").",
        "Stances can indeed be exploited in manuals to project a specific company image (for example, your friendly local nuclear power plant).",
        "These stances are factors that professional technical authors and translators are taught to pay particular attention to when writing or translating instructions, since failure to do so will lead to instructions which, although technically and grammatically correct, have an unintended pragmatic force.",
        "Following Systemic Linguistic Theory (Halliday, 1978), we will refer to these stances as semantic meanings to be expressed, at the interpersonal level.",
        "Semantic meanings lead to the inclusion of different types of information, different organisations of a text, and different expressions of the actions to be performed.",
        "For instance, with indirect commands \"the addressee is treated as if they have the right to demur\"; a choice of a direct command, on the other hand, \"grants the addressee little or no discretion\" (Hasan, 1988, p 24).",
        "They can even result in different typographical devices.",
        "This is why not all instructions are written as a sequence of steps in the imperative mode.",
        "Depending on the semantic meanings to be conveyed, the text can be quite different at both the discourse and realisation levels.",
        "From our text analysis, we have began to identify different meanings that can be conveyed in user manuals and their preferred realisations.",
        "We have noted that these meanings are not constant throughout an entire manual, but vary across sections.",
        "It is thus necessary to identify the different parts that make up manuals, the semantic meanings that can be expressed in the different sections, and the linguistic means available to express them.",
        "Furthermore, given our multilingual framework, we are also investigating whether the preferred linguistic means of realising these meanings differ across languages, and whether the preferred stance is likely to change across various languages, as suggested by Hervey and Higgins (1992), and for different target audiences.",
        "The work on DRAFTER and GIST is directly related to these issues."

        "Clearly, instructions generated with the wrong stance can lead readers to misinterpret the importance of the steps presented in various parts of the text.",
        "Consider for example the text shown in Figure 4, translated from Italian Because eulogies cannot be used for giving directives, on reading this, most readers (or at least ourselves!)",
        "are likely to understand that the pan does not need any cleaning, thanks to its properties.",
        "Lo and behold, in the text that follows – which is laid out in a way that suggests that its content is secondary to that which precedes it – we learn that cleaning the pan is critical for avoiding toxification, and steps to achieve this are given.",
        "Because of the eulogy stance taken here, we are not expecting to be told that the pan actually needs cleaning (even though the header provides a strong clue).",
        "As a result, the instructions for cleaning the pan may be overlooked.",
        "We will be investigating issues pertaining to usability in a separate phase of our projects, related to the development of evaluation criteria for instructions.",
        "Our data further suggest that the mappings from stance to realisation is not language independent.",
        "This observation reinforces our belief that multilingual generation will lead to better texts than machine translation will, because a straightforward translation from one language to another might result in text that is awkward or which has the wrong pragmatic force.",
        "In addition, the choice of stance itself could also be culturally motivated.",
        "If this is indeed the case, then only through multilingual generation can a text with the appropriate stance be produced automatically.",
        "In this paper, we raise the issue of the importance of stylistic variation in instructions, and pose a number of questions that must be addressed.",
        "Our analysis has provided guidelines for proceeding with a comprehensive study of this feature of naturally-occuring instructions.",
        "Our first step is to refine our analysis to provide further distinctions in the semantic meanings and to identify more clearly their associated realisation.",
        "This analysis will apply to instructions such as the ones discussed here as well as to those for other domains (e.g., software documentation, instructions for administrative procedures).",
