        "The reader is expected to pull down the white plastic tray, remove that tray, and then unpack the cable.",
        "Current studies of instructional text (e.g., Wisner and Stede, 1992; Vander Linden, 1993) typically represent the relationship found here in a simple multi-dependent structure such as that provided by the Sequence schema in Mann and Thompson's Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST') (1988) (see figure 1A).",
        "This rhetorical structure, which represents three sequential actidns, directly matches the grammatical forms used in the actual text.",
        "Indeed, this sequential execution is precisely what the instruction writer desires the reader to",
        "tAuthors are presented in alphabetical order.",

        "The complication comes when one finds, sometimes even in the same instruction manual, an alternate form of expression for the very same user action, such as the one shown in the following:",
        "(2) Pull down and remove to unpack the video cable.",
        "(Apple)",
        "RST analysts would most likely represent this with a purpose relation, as in figure 1B.",
        "Clearly, the representation formalism fails to capture the common semantics of these two examples.",
        "This problem may be only rarely encountered in a monolingual context, but is exceedingly common in a multilingual environment (Delia et al., 1993).",
        "Consider the following example, taken from a trilingual, translated instruction manual for a step-aerobics machine:",
        "(3) The stepping load can be altered by loosening the locking lever and changing the position of the cylinder foot.",

        "The English version is perhaps best characterised as a Means relation, whereas the French is a Purpose relation and the German a•Circumstance.",
        "The problem examples such as these raise for generation is twofold: (a) how do we endow our systems with the necessary flexibility to generate alternative expressions of the same basic information and (b) given this flexibility, how do we determine which of the available expressions are appropriate?",
        "The root of these problems is that, to date, research in the generation of instructions has failed to take account of the precise procedural relations that underlie the texts.",
        "In this paper, we make an excursion into the philosophical literature on Action Theory and the Al literature on plan recognition to find solidly defined procedural relations which can capture the underlying semantics of actions and their relationships in a way that will prove useful for our generation task: building multilingual instructional text generation systems.",

        "A simple test of Generation holding between action pairs is whether it can be said that by performing one of the actions (a), the other (0) will automatically occur (Pollack.",

        "According to Goldman.",

        "since we are dealing with actions that have not yet taken place; we are able to do this without distorting the general theory that Goldman presents (cf. Pollack, 1986).",

        "(3)",

        "Following Goldman, Generation holds in cases where: • the actions concerned are performed by the same agent (e.g., John).",
        "For reasons that will become clearer later on, we have found it necessary to qualify and extend this part of the definition to actions performed or perceived to be performed by the same human agent.",
        "• the relation is asymmetric: if the agent does a by doing a then he does not do a by doing 0 (e.g., the switch cannot be flipped by turning on the light).",
        "• neither action is subsequent to the other (e.g., the light does not come on after the switch is flipped, or vice versa)'.",
        "A useful linguistic test for this is the invalidity of the expression \"a and then 13\".",
        "• the actions are not co-temporal.",
        "Simply stated, if a and a are co-temporal, then one could validly say \"a while also 13\" and vice versa, for example, \"John strummed the guitar while also wriggling his toes\".",

        "One could not validly say that John flipped on the switch while also turning on the light, or moved his queen to king-knight-seven while also checkmating his opponent.",
        "• if the agent had not done a, then he would not have done 0; • there is a (set of) condition(s) y (say, George making sure that the light bulb was screwed in) such that",

        "(10) If you want to checkmate your opponent, move your queen to king-knight seven.",
        "Two points are worthy of note here.",
        "The first is that although causation plays a key role in Generation, 3 is not in a strict sense caused by a; rather, /3 is the action of (to use Goldman's term) 'bringing about' the state that is the direct result of performing a under specific conditions (7).",
        "Referring back to example 6, John's flipping of the switch causes the event of the light coming on; John's 'bringing about' of this event can be captured by the expression 'turning on the light'.",
        "The second point to be noted is that, in the domain of instructions for mechanical and electronic objects there is also a hidden agent the machine itself, as an agent acting on behalf of the user.",

        "Unlike the preconditions of plans, however, their effects must hold before the action can take place (i.e., the action cannot result if the precondition does not hold).3 Actions must minimally have an effect.",

        "These are phenomena which signify that the state holds.",

        "Having set out this scheme, we can now proceed to identify instances of Generation and Enablement within our representation for instructions: a generates 0 if a is the body of a plan E whose goal is a enables 3 if a is a precondition of a plan E and 3 is the goal of plan E, or if 13 is the body of E and a is a precondition of 13.",

        "As with our analysis of the French data, we set ourselves the task of examining the relationships between the Generation and Enablement relations and syntactic forms in approximately 30 examples of each relation.",
        "In what follows, we present the result of our analysis of the 33 Generation and 32 Enablement relations taken.",
        "A detailed accounting of the grammatical forms used to express Generation relations is shown in table 5.",
        "Similar statistics for Enablement relations are shown in table 6.",
        "The results of these mappings, displayed graphically in figure 6, show a pattern of almost exclusive use of grammatical realizations for the two underlying relations; we will argue that in fact there is no overlap in our data between expressions of the two relations.",
        "In general, the pattern of results for Portuguese is rather closer to our findings for French than for English.",
        "Expressing Generation in Portuguese In our Portuguese data, expressions of Generation most often involve the \"para\" connective, primarily followed by an infinitive (Para Infinitive) and on rarer occasions by a nominal phrase (Para Noun).",

        "The third connective \"e\" (\"and\") appears as a Sequence, but what is in fact happening here is that the author has elided the \"para\" from the expression \"e para\" (\"and to\").",
        "Sequence is in fact reserved for Enablement, but here the \"e\" (a typical example of a Sequence marker) is not misleading, since the reader has been primed by the 'rhythm' of the preceding sequence of \"para\"s to interpret it as yet another one.",
