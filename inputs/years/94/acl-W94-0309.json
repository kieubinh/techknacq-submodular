        "Abstract: This paper discusses the principles that should govern the construction of two components of a system for natural language generation (NLG): (1) the ontology - or, rather, as the paper argues, the 'ontological' aspects of a belief system - and (2) the semantic representation of noun senses.",
        "It is an interesting fact that many ontologies bear a striking resemblance to a system network, as used in systemic functional grammar (SFG).",
        "Furthermore, two major current research efforts in the field of ontology-building are designed to run with a SFG generator: Pangloss, where the generator is Penman, and COMMUNAL, where the generator is GENESYS.",
        "It is therefore important to establish a principled approach to the 'division of labour' between the ontology and the equivalent aspects of the model of language - here a system network for the 'meaning potential' of English nouns.",
        "(However, the general principles should be relevant to ANY model of language.)",
        "The paper summarises (a) the purposes and (b) the structure of (1) a system network for noun senses and (2) the equivalent ontology (based on what we in the COMMUNAL Project judge is required in the next generation of belief systems for NLG).",
        "Examples are given of current work on the relevant system network and, more briefly, of the equivalent ontological aspects of the belief system.",
        "In particular, reasons are given why it would be inappropriate to give a primary place to the 'mass' vs. 'count' distinction in an 'interlingua' ontology - and even, surprising though it may seem, in a language-specific semantics for English.",
        "Finally, it turns out that, in the new perspective presented here, there is no 'component' of the belief system that is 'the ontology', and the reasons for this apparently anomalous position are given."

        "One of the 'givens of Computational Linguistics (CL) - which is taken here in a sense that includes Machine Translation (MT) - is that any such system needs an ontology.' But what, precisely, is an ontology?",
        "It seems to be one of those concepts which everyone who works with it instinctively feels they understand, so that the basic assumptions are seldom made explicit.",
        "In practical terms, there is a fairly general assumption that an ontology is closely related to, and perhaps isomorphic with, the 'meanings' of the nouns of a language - or of a set of languages, the maximal set being all human languages.",
        "But in building a theoretically satisfactory overall model one discovers that there are senous problems with this position, as will be shown in this paper.",
        "There is a long history of work on ontologies for CL, including the important work at Carnegie-Mellon University over many years, that of Dahlgren and her colleagues (e.g. Dahlgren 1988) and the current Pangloss Project, as described in Hovy and Nirenburg 1992, Hovy and Knight 1993 and Knight 1993.",
        "We in the COMMUNAL Project have been considering alternative approaches to this aspect of what we term the belief system, and I would like to present here, for discussion by the wider NLG community, the principles that we have established, often after years of experimentation, as they relate to these matters.",
        "We are currently implementing a system based on these principles.",
        "In many respects, of course, our assumptions are similar to those of others working in this area.",
        "But our view is that the next generation of systems in Artificial Intelligence (AI) - and possibly also in MT - will require, as central components, belief systems that represent 'knowledge' (or, more accurately, beliefs) of more types and in a more complex manner than in some current systems.",
        "As we shall see by the end of this paper, the phenomena that are often handled in terms of an ontology look somewhat different in this new perspective.",
        "In relation to some of the issues to be discussed here, then, we are constructing a different overall model from that which appears to underlie much other current work.",
        "The purpose of this paper is to set out these ideas, to compare them with those of other researchers on whose work we are seeking to build, and to give some explanation of why we are following the direction that we are.",
        "We hope that this will open up further discussion about the next generation of belief systems.",
        "The first step is to be clear about what the issues are.",
        "They are (1) issues of levels (which we shall here assume to mean levels of language), (2) issues of components of the overall system, and (3) issues of the structure and contents of part of the largest component of the overall system, namely the belief system.",
        "We shall focus panic-ularly on the types of relations that need to be recognised as holding between the 'concepts' in an ontology or rather, between the generic objects (in contrast with specific objects), such as 'dog', realized as dogs, as in I like dogs.2"

        "Hovy and Nirenburg (1992), in clearing the ground for their discussion of the principles that should guide the construction of an ontology, suggest that most ontologies and domain models to date have been assembled based primarily on introspection, and often reflect the idiosyncrasies of the builders more than the requirements of the application (such as MT).",
        "Lacking well-founded guided principles, the ontology builder is working in the dark.",
        "This judgement seems a little hyperbolic, in view of the fact that a number of recent ontology-builders have explained their principles as fully as Hovy and Nirenburg do.",
        "Thus, while there are aspects of Dahlgren's framework (1988:46f.)",
        "that are open to criticism, she in fact gives as detailed an account of her principles as do Hovy and Nirenburg.",
        "Bateman (1990, Bateman et al. 1990) similarly explains the ideas underlying the 'upper model' in Penman.",
        "In fact, as Hovy and Knight (1993) state, the 'ontology base' in Pangloss is in part based on Penman (being a merger of this, the semantic categories from the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE), which is intended as a taxonomy for the nouns of English), and ULTRA (Nirenburg and Defrise 1992) - which itself draws on the LDOCE categories).",
        "Nonetheless the main thrust of",
        "Hovy and Nirenberg's comment is surely right, in that the discussion of the principles governing the building ontologies is far from over.",
        "Indeed, it may be that the requirements of MT and AT (where NL is used to communicate with a problem solving system) are different (at least at this stage of the development of MT).",
        "Most - and perhaps all - ontology-builders accept that they are in fact working on the basis of natural language - and, typically, that the language is English.",
        "In Bateman's words (1990:56) 'the Upper Model represents the speaker's experience in terms of generalized linguistically-motivated \"ontological\" categories'.",
        "He states that 'it is essential that constraints should be found for what an upper model should contain and how it should be organised [his italics], and he then goes on to suggest that it is the aspects of meaning found in the experiential meta-function in a systemic functional grammar that should guide the construction of the ontology.",
        "This application of SFG concepts provides a helpful framework in which to approach the problem.",
        "(We might note that distinctions that depend on register, e.g. on tenor (formality), such as that between cigarette and fag are irrelevant to the ontology.)",
        "The reason for depending on NL, then, seems to be that, without it, we would have no guidelines as to how to structure the ontology.",
        "Let us assume for the moment that this position is justified (though I shall suggest some problems with it in sections 5 and 6).",
        "This brings us to an important question for those who use the Upper Model or any derived ontology such as Pangloss.",
        "This is: if there is to be this 'strong connection to the linguistic system' (Bateman 1990:57), what part of it should that connection be to?",
        "And here we come to an apparent problem for this line of argument.",
        "This is that the Nigel model of language around which Penman is constructed lacks a specific network for noun senses.",

      "text": [
        "First, however, let us be explicit about two of the factors that differentiate various research projects in this area, and so, perhaps, the assumptions underlying various conceptual frameworks that have been adopted.",
        "The first is the disciplinary coverage of researchers on a project - including the 'home discipline,' as it were, of the leading researcher.",
        "Those such as myself whose starting point was linguistics are sometimes shocked at the cavalier way (note the loaded language to express the viewpoint!)",
        "in which non-', b linguists simply adopt the 'senses of the nouns of English as the starting point for an ontology.",
        "AI-minded computer scientists may be equally shocked at the pussyfooting way in which many linguists refuse to recognise the need to move outside the semiotic system of language, even though this is patently necessary in order to build adequate models of how language is used.",
        "Often neither really addresses the issue of where the semiotic system of a natural language ends (i.e. the semantics of the language) and where the 'concepts' (or whatever is assumed as the category for 'thinking') begins.",
        "In this paper I shall set out a clear and, I believe, defensible position on these issues.",
        "A second factor which undoubtedly affects the conceptual framework used in any given research project is the time scale set by the sponsors of one's research.",
        "Practically all sponsors of CL research expect products that are at least potentially 'applicable' (though often in a sense that is not well defined).",
        "For some researchers the time scale may be such that they must work with existing data bases, such as the machine readable version of the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) (Longman Group 1978) or 'Wordnet' (Miller 1990).",
        "This seems to be the case with the Pangloss project (Hovy and Nirenburg 1992, Hovy and Knight 1993, Knight 1993), whose explicit goal is to combine the best features of these sources.",
        "This is an ambitious goal and I wish the researchers well.",
        "However the well-known fact must be pointed out that, in the last decade and a half, many other researchers have put in a lot of work in trying to make LDOCE usable in a number of ways - and yet so far as I am aware no one yet has found a way to use these data as part of a belief system without an enormous amount of hand-editing.",
        "There are important questions that need to be asked about the relationship of these data to ontology building.",
        "The answers should relate to an integrated framework that provides appropriately for at least the two linguistic levels of meaning and form, and, outside language, the categories of a belief system (concepts').",
        "Researchers who are working to a less constrained timetable are perhaps more able to ask such questions.",
        "There are arguments for and against each approach, and it is not the purpose of this paper to criticize the work of those who seek directly to exploit existing data bases.",
        "Indeed, it may be that such work will in time produce solutions to the problems to be discussed here, by developing EVOLUTIONARILY into more advanced models.",
        "Alternatively, it may be that a significantly different framework is required in order to achieve optimal representations of belief systems; both lines of inquiry should be pursued.",
        "In the COMMUNAL Project our task is to think speculatively about the next generation of belief systems, and about the components, relations and procedures that will be required in it.",
        "It is in the nature of research that we shall almost certainly have overlooked some aspects that will strike future researchers as important, but the enterprise is nonetheless worth attempting.",
        "Here, however, we shall not try to provide a complete overview, even very briefly, of all of the components that we believe to be necessary in a belief system (for which see Fawcett 1993), but just those aspects that pertain to the concept of the 'ontology'."

        "He envisaged a model of language in which the earlier i choices n a system network would be realised grammatically, i.e. in the structures of clause and group syntax and in grammatical items - and where these earlier choices would lead on to more 'delicate' choices that would be realised as lexical items.",

        "To the best of my belief, the first example of the intertwining of the two concepts of an ontology and a system network occurred in the mid 1960s.",
        "It was at about this time that the system networks of SFG were beginning to be semanticized as the meaning potential of a language.",
        "Linguists working in the Chomskyan tradition had recently introduced the concept of selectional restrictions - which effectively presuppose semantic features.",
        "At this juncture a British linguist, Geoffrey Leech, who was at University College London at the same time as Halliday was developing SFG there in the 1970s, made the interesting experiment of combining the two concepts of system networks and semantic features in his Towards a Semantic Description of English, published in 1969 (and later incorporated in his standard text book Semantics (Leech 1974/81).",
        "This, then, was an early attempt to provide an ontology-based logic for reasoning, and it was 'done at a level that Leech assumed to be the level of semantics, i.e., presumably, a level within language.",
        "(In the view taken in this paper and to be expanded later, reasoning is in fact better modelled as taking place at a level outside and 'above' language - while being heavily influenced by language.)",
        "Leech's model included a taxonomy of 'types of object', and it had most of the characteristics of current ontologies (which we shall summarise in Section 6).",
        "This work was, in effect, Leech's attempt to combine the relevant parts of a system network with the demands of a reasoning system.",
        "It was related to a fairly standard logic, so that the taxonomy could be used for simple reasoning tasks, in some of the ways that current ontologies are expected to.",
        "The crucial point, however, is that Leech's network was not in fact a system network, as the term is used in SFG, but an ontology.",
        "One striking visual icon of this difference is the contrast between Halliday's and Leech's notations.",
        "They both use the usual systemic notation of a right-opening square bracket to indicate 'or' and a curly right-opening bracket to mean 'and'.",
        "But in Halliday's diagrams there is always an arrow pointing right, i.e. from the term (or terms) that is/are the entry condition to the system towards the system itself.",
        "And in Leech's diagrams the arrows point from the system to the entry condition.",
        "In other words, the two apparently similar structures are to be used in different ways.",
        "As we shall see in Section 6, an ontology is typically (but not necessarily exclusively) traversed from right to left, which explains the direction of Leech's arrows.",
        "But a system network is intended to be traversed from left to right, i. e. from the less 'delicate' choices to the more 'delicate'; see further below.",
        "(Some later systemic linguists, including myself, have followed Winograd (1972) in dispensing with the arrow.4)",
        "systems; 'individual' vs. 'collective' and 'abstract' vs. 'real'.",
        "Further dependent systems, some of which are entered simultaneously (i.e. as 'cross-classifications'), introduce a total of 37 'category cuts' which, when all possible combinations are counted, generate 4272 potential 'combinations'.",
        "(This assumes that 'collective' leads on to 'mass' vs. 'set' vs. 'structure', as implied at one point; at another it does not.)",
        "Interestingly, Dahlgren advises at one point that 'care must be taken when adding cross-classifications at a higher node, .... to avoid proliferating empty terminal nodes', .... [because this] is a sure sign that the proposed cross-classification is spurious.' If this were indeed to be accepted as a major critenon, one would unfortunately have to give her ontology rather low marks.",
        "This is because, of her 4272 'terminal nodes', most are unused (all but 57 on one count).5 In fact, as we shall see in Section 5, Dahlgren's advice is fully appropriate for a systemic linguist who is using the network as a generator - but it is certainly much less relevant to an ontology.",
        "Why should this be so?",
        "The answer is that Dahlgren's taxonomy is not intended as a system network, and so it should not be thought of as operating by being traversed from left to right (e.g. as if to generate noun senses).",
        "An ontology is in fact typically used deductively, i.e. working from right to left TO REASON ABOUT OBJECTS (as Leech's arrows remind us).",
        "So the supposed 'overgeneration' of Dahlgren's ontology has no practical consequence - unless one wishes to use the ontology inductively.",
        "(In other words, many systems regularly use reasoning of the nature of 'If X is a rose then X is a flower', while there seems to be less demand for inductive reasoning.",
        "We shall return to the topic of reasoning in Section 6.",
        "I cite this case in order to show the need for clear principles in the construction of both (1) system networks at the level of semantics, i.e. within language, and (2) ontological relations in a belief system.",

        "There have been many of these, and many others that have incorporated significant aspects of the SFG approach to language (see Matthiessen and Bateman 1991 and Fawcett, Tucker and Lin 1993 for overviews of the use of SFGs in NLG).",
        "Here we shall consider just the two major SFG natural language generators: Penman, which is to be used as the generator for the current Pangloss project, and GENESYS, which is the generator in the COMMUNAL Project.",
        "Given the significant place of SFG generators in NLG, it is important to be clear about the theoretical framework for what such enterprises are attempting.",

        "In much of the detailed description in Halliday 1985, for example, the term 'semantic' abounds.",
        "And the concept of 'realization' itself - the process through which the choices in the system network are realized as structures - is one that explicitly invokes the two levels of 'meaning' and 'form'.",
        "Thus if one does not represent the lexicon in system network form - as of course Penman does not - there is a major gap in the overall system network of the language at just the place where one would wish to locate a system network of noun senses (to complement the list of noun forms).",
        "For the same reason the Penman network lacks the meanings of all the other major word classes.",
        "This has made it harder than it is in the COMMUNAL framework (see below) to follow the increasingly strong trend in linguistics to give a more central place to lexis than it had in the 60s and 70s.",
        "(Fawcett Tucker and Lin 1993 show how lexis is handled in COMMUNAL, and important current modifications are exploiting yet further the value of having, integrated lexicogrammatically realized networks of meanings - e.g. in verb complementation, and the many other cases where syntactic realizations depend upon lexical choice.)",
        "The Penman response to the position in which they found themselves was a sensible compromise.",
        "The development work that might have gone into the meaning potential of lexical forms went partly into the separate lexicon (building into it the relevant features from the ,,,,,grammar), and partly into the Upper Model (UM).",
        "The main function of the 'UM is to serve as an 'abstraction hierarchy' (Bateman 1990:57), and so to provide the usual functions of an ontology for property inheritance, etc.",
        "But at the same time each concept in it is 'known to Penman', in the sense that 'it is possible to state for each concept in the UM the fragments of grammatical or lexical realization that will be used to realize it' (Bateman et al.",
        "1990:5).",
        "However, the section of the UM corresponding to noun senses seems surprisingly small for this task - at least, as described in Bateman et al. 1990.",
        "It contains just over 30 categories (half being specialised within 'spatial-temporal').",
        "The idea is that these are 'common core' concepts and that users of the UM will add to these as required.6 (It is interesting to compare these with the early semantic COMMUNAL categories, summarized in Section 5.)",
        "In Penman, then, the ontological categories map directly to (1) grammatically realized options in the system network, and (2) the standard lexicon.",
        "The job does get done.",

        "The network is already very large, and it is growing all the time.",
        "What, then, are the principles on which it is constructed?",
        "The simplest 'network' for the noun senses of English would consist of just one large system, containing one long list of the noun senses, each realized by a noun form - i.e. a single, massive system.",
        "Why not do this?",
        "The main linguistic evidence is the existence of hyponymic and contrastive relations between words - or more strictly, between word senses.",
        "Thus the word-form cat is a hyponym of mammal, because the meaning 'cat' is systemically dependent on the meaning 'mammal'.",
        "And a system network is equally appropriate for giving formal expression to another major type of relationship between words, e.g. as specified in standard works on semantics such as Lyons 1977: that of 'contrast'; the sense of dog is in contrast with that of cat The evidence that such hyponymic and contrastive relations are anchored firmly within language - and not simply in some 'higher' component of the belief system - is the existence at the level of form of nouns such as thing, object, animal, mammal, person, etc; see the note on the as such' type of feature in 5.5.",
        "The overall structure is therefore taxonomic.",
        "Within this framework, we turn now to a 'guideline' criterion that derives directly from the practical experience of building ontologies.",
        "Our experience in COMMUNAL suggests that it is advisable to avoid simultaneous entry conditions, i.e. right-opening curly 'and' brackets.",

        "(We shall meet the formalism when we consider ontological relations in Section 6, because in that type of network they do have a role to play.)",
        "The problem in generation is that such parallel systems lead to parallel pathways through the network, and so, almost inevitably, to permitting more co-selections than are in fact possible.",
        "For example, the distinction between 'male' and 'female' is realized lexically in the case of only some animals.",
        "In COMMUNAL we simply allow the repetition of such systems, or gather the relevant features together into a disjunctive entry condition (as in Figure 2), whichever is easier in practical terms for the maintenance of the network as it is expanded.",
        "The key point is that, if a network designed to generate nouns allows one to go down pathways - and so to choose a set of features - FOR WHICH THERE IS NO REALIZATION, it is a bad system network.9 (But note that, while simultaneity tends to lead to problems in networks for lexis, it has a valuable role in modelling grammatically-realized meanings - and, as we shall see in Section 6, ontological relations.)",
        "The large network for noun senses in COMMUNAL therefore has essentially the structure illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "Neutrally, this structure can be described as: 'If 'a' then 'b' or 'c'.' More typically, in a SFG framework, we express it as: 'If 'a' is chosen (by a speaker or a computer generator) then either 'b' or 'c' must be chosen.' Each feature may become the entry condition to a subsequent system, thus building up a system network, so it might continue: 'If 'b' is chosen, then 'd' or 'e' must be chosen, and if 'c' is chosen then 'f or 'g' or 'h' must be chosen ....' and so on.",
        "However, there is one type of complex entry condition which we have found to be occasionally useful in the network for noun senses: the disjunctive entry condition.",
        "This has the form shown in Figure 2:",
        "Here is a (simplified) example of this phenomenon from the current network (where \"I\" signals 'or' and \"->\" signals 'entry to a system'): tomato_plant_c / pepper_plant_c / cucumber_plant_c / strawberry_plant_c -> 95% plantness_explicit (66.325) 5% plantness_implicit.",
        "This representation of a system network (in the COMMUNAL format) is to be read as follows: 'If you select either lomato_plant', etc (which come from the 'vegetable' section of the 'ground_crops' network) or 'strawberry_plant' (which comes from the 'fruit' subnetwork), then there is a choice between having the concept of 'plantness' made specific and leaving it implicit.",
        "So, if the choice is to make it explicit, forms such as tomato-plant will be generated, and, if implicit, forms such as tomato - but in the gardener's sense of 'tomato plant', as in I've watered the tomatoes this morning.",

        "Moreover, since we use probabilities in the grammar in any case (for _purposes that we cannot go into here), we can capture selection restrictions as relatively strong or weak 'preferences'.",

        "Suppose we have just generated a clause, with an Agent as Subject and ask as the main verb.",
        "We want to restrict the choices when the network is re-entered, so that, if a nominal group with a noun at its head is to be generated to fill the Agent, it will have one that is plausible as an 'asker'.",
        "We do this by specifying that, on re-entry to the network, the following, features are chosen: [thing, concrete, living, creature, 99.9% human / 0.1% non_human, whole_hum, 99% individual_hum / 1% group_hum].",
        "At two points, you will notice, there is not an absolute 'preselection' of Just one of the features in the system, but a preference for one over another.",
        "Thus the feature [human] is shown to be a thousand times more probable than [non_human] - thus allowing for talking computers and talking animals, such as the white rabbit in Alice in Wonderland.",
        "Rather similarly, individual humans are shown as being a thousand times more likely to be the Agents in a process of 'asking' than are groups of humans - though groups, such as a committee, may well ask questions on occasions.",
        "We turn now to an important issue that arises as a result of taking this position, and we shall illustrate it first from English.",
        "5.3 Problem case 1: the 'count' versus 'mass' contrast One important effect of deciding to organize the network around meanings (rather than around grammatical correlates of word forms) is to put in perspective the contrast between •count' and 'mass' noun senses that is so dominant in English (and many other European languages).",
        "If, for example, we are stating, preferences for the Affected entity in a process of 'eating', it is not important whether what is eaten is mass or count.",
        "The COMMUNAL network for food classifies types of food on semantic criteria - so that, for example, vegetables that typically occur with a meat course are placed together, with the mass noun sense 'cabbage' next to the count noun senses of 'potato' or 'pea'.",
        "Moreover, the network also includes a way of showing that, while 'potato' occurs regularly as either singular or plural, it is rather unusual to talk of a single pea.",
        "The result is that the system 'knows' that it is a thousand times more likely that \"peas\" will be generated than \"pea\".",
        "(Note that the system networks in COMMUNAL not only have probabilities, but the grammar can change these when required.",
        "For a more detailed account of this, together with a full worked example, see Fawcett, Tucker and Lin 1993.)",
        "However, there is not in fact a neat 'count' versus 'mass' distinction in English at all.",
        "It is one of those useful generalisations which hold for 95% of the time, but which, if one commits oneself to it, leads to considerable trouble when the idea is extended to the whole of language.",
        "It is certainly not a category that can be extended, on the basis of a system network for English, even to a close European language such as French.",
        "The illogicality - in physical 'number' terms - of items such as furniture and cutlery is just the well-known visible tip of quite a large iceberg.",
        "First, note the 'plural-only' nouns, such as police, staff and contents.",
        "Then there are the 'plural-preferring' items, with varying strengths of preference, as for example between pea and sprout, and pebble and leaf.",
        "There are also the 'paironly' nouns such as trousers, scissors, and binoculars - and, even though the word denotes two garments, of which only the bottom half conforms to the pattern, there is pyjamas.",
        "As an example of the dissonance within one relatively small semantic field between the grammatical criterion of 'number' and the semantic classification of noun senses, consider the field of clothing.",
        "Suppose the problem is that of stating the preferences for the entity that is to complete a clause such as He went home and put on It could be a nominal group with, at its head, (1) a mass noun such as some warm clothing, or (2) a plural-only noun as in some warm clothes, or (3) a singular noun such as a warm jersey, or (4) a pair-only noun such as some warm trousers.",
        "The COMMUNAL solution to this problem is as follows.",
        "Every feature in the system network for which there is a realization is given a suffix '_c' (for 'count' things) or '_m' (for 'mass' things) or '_pl' (for plural only' things) or '_pair' (for 'pair only' things).",
        "Those labelled '_c' lead into the system for NUMBER, where there is a choice between [singular] and [plural], while for the others there is no choice: they are either [mass] or [plural].",
        "Those for which a RELATIVE preference for [plural] has been stated will enter a version of the NUMBER system for which the probabilities have been reset according to the strength of the preference associated with than noun sense, i.e. the lexicogrammar 'knows' that for 'pea' the probabilities of choosing 'plural' are very much greater than for 'cabbage'.",
        "Consider too the question of where to place the two senses - realized as count and mass nouns - of cloud.",
        "In this case the differences between the two appear to derive mainly from the fact that one is an individual entity and the other is a non-discrete mass of 'stuff; they are not differentiated by function.",
        "So the system network shows them to be distinguished as follows: cloud -> cloud_as_individual / cloud_as_mass.",
        "Notice that this is a rather different matter from 'oak' as 'individual' and as 'mass'; in the first case the referent is a tree (with oak-tree as a possible variant, if Ireeness_explicit' is selected), and it is located with the rest of the trees as a type of plant, while in its other sense it is a material whose function is to be used for making things, and it is located with other types of wood, fairly close to 'iron', etc.",
        "In the COMMUNAL system it is even possible to build in the preference for meanings realized in expressions such as a pair, followed by of, as in a pair of trousers.",
        "This is because trousers rather than pair is treated as the head of the nominal group.",
        "The words a pair are generated as a special nominal group expressing 'quantity' that fills the quantifying determiner.",
        "It is because the noun sense of the nominal group is generated on the first pass through the network for the object in question - i.e. because the lexically realized meaning is integrated with the grammatically realized meaning; in COMMUNAL - that part of the realization of the choice of 'trousers' can be to express a preference for the way in which the quantifying determiner is filled - here by the embedded nominal group of a pair.",

        "However, it must be emphasised again that, important as the distinction is at many points, it is not the basic organising principle of the semantics of English noun senses.",

        "Is there a price to be paid for all of the advantages outlined in the preceding sections?",
        "The answer seems to be that there isn't. If the mechanism for handling NUMBER in a way that is dependent on noun senses (in 5.3) required one to work from a visual representation of the wiring, it would be tedious in the extreme But in the computer it is a simple matter - and this has in turn suggested a simple representation for the written version."

        "In our case we are experimenting with a specially developed logical form for the representation of both (1) complex beliefs about, say, the mating habits of dogs, and (2) the belief that dogs are mammals - and indeed the belief that dogs are typically pets ('multiple inheritance').",
        "The purpose of ontological relations, then, is to facilitate reasoning.",

        "In the simplest type of taxonomy, then, 'a' is subcategorized as 'b' or '6', 'b' as' d' or 'e', 'c' as 'f, 'g' or 'h', and so on; see Figure 4.",
        "Such a network shows that, if an object satisfies the conditions for being an 'h', it follows that it is also a 'c', and so also an 'a'.",
        "So far, this structure is similar to the simplest type of system network, as shown in Figure 1.",
        "This 'simplest structure' for an ontology is in practice augmented in various ways in all of the ontologies that I know of.",
        "The essential addition is as in Figure 5:",
        "This is to be read as, 'a' is subcategorized as 'b', 'c' or 'd', and also as 'e' or 'f; 'b' is subcategonzed as 'g' or 'h', and 'd' as 'i', 'j' or 'k', and also as 'I' or 'm'.",

        "properties of ontologies, and she quite rightly points out that, while binary ontologies 'have simplifying mathematical properties, they are not likely to be psychologically rear (e.g. suggesting that we operate with 'fish' vs. 'bird' vs. 'mammal', etc).",
        "She also points out the need for cross-classification, in that we classify animals, let us say, both in terms of their 'types' (a concept that itself needs to be unpacked, at least for some purposes), but also in terms of their 'role' in humankind's scheme of things ('tame' vs. 'wild' animals, probably with other such subcategories as well).",
        "Thus Dahlgren and others operate with the formalism shown in Figure 5.",
        "In the cases of other ontologies there is even more freedom, in that any feature can be linked by a line that represents a 'be-type' relationship to any feature to its left.",
        "And in some ontologies, of course, other relationships such as 'be-a-part-of are used.",
        "However, there is an important sense in which the above diagrams are misleading - at least in relation to the current COMMUNAL framework.",
        "This is because we consider that the relations do not hold, in fact, between the 'concepts' in the ontologies, but between generic objects.",

        "There are several aspects of the meaning of this representation of a belief which are assigned by default - most importantly, that the time position of the event is 'past, present and future', that the 'confidence level' is so high as to be interpretable as '100% confident'.",
        "Taken together, they state, in a natural language translation: All dogs are mammals.",
        "This event-based representation is used in order to enable the system to carry out reasoning on inputs to and outputs from the system that have the sorts of annoyingly messy complexity associated with natural language - representations of time position, usuality and quantification, for example.",
        "In the belief systems of the future it will no longer be possible, in our view, to depend on simple data structures such as frames.",
        "The need to incorporate more sophisticated representations of time, of modality and of other such phenomena related to events demands that information be stored in the form of some type of 'predicate logic', e.g. as in the (simplified) example above.",
        "The key point is that the representation, like the minimal operational syntactic unit of the clause, is based on the concept of an EVENT (our equivalent term to 'proposition' and 'eventuality' in other frameworks).",
        "It uses categories that reflect idealised aspects of systemic functional grammar, so it is a 'systemic functional logical form' (SFLF).",
        "Note, finally, that the relationship that it expresses is NOT one that holds between two concepts, but between two referring expressions, each with its SFLF structure, and each of which refers to a generic object.",
        "To adopt this position leads to a reappraisal of the status of diagrams representing ontological relationships such as those in Figures 4 and 5.",
        "Those relations are, in the approach advocated here, simply one event type among many within the mass of beliefs that the system holds about dogs.",
        "In other words, the 'fact' (i.e. the confidently held belief) that dogs are mammals is just one of many things that the system assumes that it 'knows' about the generic object of 'dogs'.",
        "7 Summary and conclusions The COMMUNAL Project (Fawcett, Tucker and Lin 1993) has demonstrated the immense advantages that follow from having a unified system network for all meanings, whether realized grammatically or lexically.",
        "Thus Halliday's original 1961 insight was well-founded, the only major modification needed bein._,0 that lexically realized meanings are not necessarily 'most delicate', in the sense of 'at or near the terminal leaves of the system network'.",
        "(Meanings realized in intonation should similarly be integrated into the overall network, and the way in which this is done in COMMUNAL is described in Fawcett 1980.)",
        "In other approaches some equivalent intralinguistic level of 'linguistic meaning' would surely be of similar value.",
        "It would be interesting to compare the COMMUNAL 'division of labour' in modelling lexical meaning with other current proposals, such as those of Reiter and Pustejovsky, but that is beyond the scope of this paper.",
        "What is clear is that information about the purposes of entities, how they come into being, etc is all handled through events attached to the equivalent generic object in the belief system.",
        "The two types of network - the system network of noun senses and the ontological relations in the belief system - serve different purposes.",
        "One is to generate nouns (and to control related structures such as those associated with participant roles) and the other is to facilitate reasoning.",
        "In the first it is preferable to avoid right-opening brackets - but in the second such 'cross-classifications (or their equivalents in an 'event-based' logical form) are vital to certain types of reasoning.",
        "Since the two structures serve different functions, both have their place in a holistic model of language.",
        "(I say 'structures', because it is probably unhelpful, in the new framework, to think of the equivalents of ontological relations in the belief system as a 'network'.)",
        "In the previous section we have seen how the COMMUNAL Project has begun to develop a new way of representing - and so thinking about - the relations found in standard ontologies.",
        "Since these are now seen as a part of the belief system, the suggestion is that we no longer need to think in terms of 'an ontology', in the sense of a taxonomy of 'concepts' - but rather in terms of relations between generic objects.",
        "We think that these fit more naturally into the more complex, event-based reasoning that we judge will be needed for the systems of the future.",
        "So perhaps there is no such thing as an ontology, but instead a set of mutually referring beliefs, each represented as an event?",
        "If this approach is on the right lines, or even if it is only partly on the right lines, it is time to be moving on to the exploration of the next generation of belief systems.",
        "These will make different assumptions about the nature of the relationship of word forms to word senses, and word senses to the related aspects of the belief system - and perhaps too about the nature of 'ontological' relations."

        "4 There are occasions in natural language processing when it may be desirable and/or necessary to use system networks by working from right to left, e.g. as proposed (1) by Patten (1988) for some aspects of generation and (2) by O'Donoghue (1994) for the higher stages of parsing.",
        "But these are adaptations of the central concept for specific purposes, and they do not affect the main point that system networks are designed to be used in generation, working from left to right.",
        "5 While Dahlgren has only 57 'category cuts', some of her terminal nodes such as 'animal' bring together a number of these and then lead off into further subsystems - and so effectively to further 'terminal nodes', such as 'vertebrate' vs, non-vertebrate', and then 'mammal' vs. 'bird' vs.'fish'.",
        "Thus there are in practice a few more than 57 'terminal nodes'.",
        "But this does not affect the more general point being made here.",
        "6 Our experience in COMMUNAL - working at both the semantic and the belief system levels - suggests that the development of even quite delicate areas of the network raises problems requiring a high level of expertise and experience for a satisfactory solution, and we believe that this experience is mirrored elsewhere.",
        "One can foresee that clients might be wise to subcontract the work of ontology-building back to the Penman team.",
        "7 Contrary to what is still a quite widespread assumption, there is no _need for a separate network from that for the nominal group to deal with the rank of the word; the nouns at the head of a nominal group are simply the realization of one part of its meaning (see Fawcett, Tucker and Lin 1993).",
        "8 These have ontological equivalents in the COMMUNAL belief system, so that interested persons may wish to compare this slicing of the universe of objects with those assumed for other ontologies.",
        "It would be an interesting exercise to get the creators of alternative taxonomies to explain their reasons for foregrounding their primary distinctions.",
        "9 A pseudo-remedy that some systemicists use is to add complex wiring that prevents the realization of all but those combinations of features for which there is a realization (e.g. 'dog' plus 'female' but not 'hare' plus 'female').",
        "But this to try to correct poor systemic modelling at too late a stage; it is the task of a system network to constrain possible co-selections.",
        "10 The random generation of sentences is frowned upon by some NLG researchers, but it serves a valuable role in developing large generators, because it tests the availability of the lexicogrammatical resources, and so has a role in solving the 'expressibility problem (Meteer 1992)."
