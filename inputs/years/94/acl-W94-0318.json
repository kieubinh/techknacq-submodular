        "Electronic publishing is an application domain in which the acquisition, representation and presentation of knowledge are major tasks which are to be fulfilled by an editor.",
        "State-of-the-art electronic publishing technology offers a number of possibilities both to facilitate these tasks and to improve on the quality of print and of electronic publications.",
        "In publishing in general, the document or text plays a central role in that it is both source and product of the publication process.",
        "Many of the tasks of an editor in this process are of a highly recursive character and are subject to a number of publisher-specific standards an editor must use.",
        "For example, the header of a biography text usually adheres to some specified standard of what information must be included and at which place.",
        "Typically, the header first gives the name or pseudonym of the artist, then his/her place and date of birth (and death), and possibly his/her main activity (painter, sculptor, architect etc).",
        "Such highly standardized information is currently automatically classified into a net of domain knowledge by applying pattern matching methods (see [Rostek et al., 1994] for examples and the methods employed).",
        "The construction of a taxonomic inheritance hierarchy that this allows already offers new opportunities for accessing the information included and can be used to assist some of the above mentioned tasks of an editor.",
        "If, however, one would like to be able to apply these methods improving information access and assisting the editor's tasks to other kinds of information that are less standardized, the question arises of how to acquire these and integrate them in an object net.",
        "For example, in a biography article, the typical information included is the artist's education, influences on his/her work by other artists and art styles, his/her major works etc.",
        "This is information that can appear in any place in the text – or even in several texts – and can be realized linguistically in various ways.",
        "Extracting such information from source texts requires more sophisticated methods and representations that reflect the facts contained in the source text.",
        "The most adequate way to acquire this knowledge is automatic NL text analysis.",
        "For an example of how this enriches the information represented in the object net see Figure 1, taking the example of the main activities and creations of the architect Peter Behrens.1 This is mostly a network obtained by the KONTEXT analysis system for German [Haenelt,",

        "However, having made available such a rich variety of potentially relevant information in this way, the complementary problem of presenting that information again to the user becomes the limiting factor.",
        "In our present case, the editor's workbench already offers a number of presentation styles for the information contained, such as the net or parts of the net (as shown in Figure 1, internal definitions associated with a node, article text associated with a node and cross-references to other objects, etc.",
        "Representation of complex information in the net style, however, quickly becomes too complex to be generally appropriate (as the rather simple example of Figure 1 probably already demonstrates).",
        "With a net augmented both in types of information and in quantity, other presentation styles as views on the information contained are essential for enabling an editor to deal with such complex information.",
        "One such presentation style that can flexibly express retrieved information is automatically generated text.",

        "For the kind of functionality set out in the previous section to be both achievable in theory and worthwhile in practise, we consider two features of a text generation component to be decisive.",
        "First, the text generation system must achieve a high degree of domain-independence in order to maximally reuse its resources.",
        "Such resources are too expensive to develop to allow redesign for different applications.",
        "And second, it must make provision for the systematic representation of genres and text types that it will be called to generate.",
        "The representation of genre not only offers a major constraint on the text generation process, including its access to domain knowledge, but also allows highly restricted fine-tuning of a system's generation capabilities.",
        "The generation system being used in our application scenario is one under development in two continuing directions.",
        "First, it is multilingual in the extreme sense defined by [Bateman et al., 1991a, Bateman et al., 1991b].",
        "The system thus supports extensive linguistic resource sharing on a functional basis.",
        "Second, it is intended to incorporate sensitivity to register as targetted by [Bateman and Paris, 1989, Bateman and Paris, 1991].",
        "The system processes are based on the PENMAN generation system [Mann and Matthiessen, 19851 as extended for multilinguality by [Zeng, 19921, and includes work on multilinguality and text planning undertaken within the KOMET project [Bateman et al., 1993].",
        "The resulting system therefore has the working title KPML (KOMET-Penman multilingual).",
        "The primary difference between the KOMET-PENMAN system and PENMAN is that KPML attempts to apply systemic-functional linguistic results at all levels of operation, following through some of the proposals for interaction between systemic linguistics and computational models made in [Bateman, 1988].",
        "It therefore includes linguistic resources at various strata such as:",
        "• the systemic functional grammar NIGEL for English [Matthiessen, 1992] and the KOMET grammars for German [Teich, 19921 and for Dutch [Degand, 1993], • a merged upper model [Henschel, 1993] appropriate for generation with all three grammars, • systemic-functional networks for register, based on [Martin, 1992], • system-functional networks for genre, also based on [Martin, 19921.",
        "Work on discourse semantics, in the sense defined in [Martin, 1992], is also in progress2 Realization is captured in terms of relational constraints holding across features and structures defined by the networks of adjacent strata.",

        "3.2 Genre and Register: the global-level textual resource According to systemic-functional theory (SFL), the ultimate constraints on all linguistic expression are the extralinguistic contexts of culture and situation.",
        "Especially in a multilingual application this must be taken into account since it is only in these extralinguistic contexts that commonalities and differences between languages can ultimately be rooted.",
        "In early work on text in context such as [Hasan, 1978], the cultural context is reflected in language in terms of text as the linguistic category of genre.",
        "Genre is a culture-specific category textually encoding a situation as it can typically occur in a culture or linguistic community.",
        "Thus, it is at the interface between what is linguistic and what is non-linguistic knowledge.",
        "The particular view on genre and context that we instantiate in the KOMET-PENMAN architecture3 is that proposed in [Martin, 1992].",
        "Here context is divided into two strata, register and genre.",
        "Both are fully represented in our model.",
        "Genre is represented in SFL by generic structure potential (GSP), specifying the potential typically occurring stages according to which a text belonging to a particular genre develops Masan, 19781 As a brief example of a GSP and its application, a typical field (one of the parameters of register; cf. below) in the domain of arts is information about an artist's life.",

        "Furthermore, as noted by [Matthiessen, 19881, generic structures are in many ways similar to [McKeown, 19853's rhetorical schemas.",
        "They can also be used, therefore, in order to pre-structure the information to be expressed in a text.",
        "Particular kinds of information go together with particular stages of the GSP.",
        "The specification of this information – in our case as constraints in the genre network concerning appropriate selections of field features and structures – provides the content for information retrieval inquiries that are passed on to the editor's workbench for instantiation.",
        "An example of such a specification is shown in the instantiate realizations for the genre-feature [biography] given in Figure 2.",
        "The realization constraints stage introduce generic stages in a GSP; the constraints inter-preselect-feature constrain a given generic stage to be realized by a particular register feature selection.",
        "The use of GSPs for knowledge selection is further enhanced by our requirement that domain information is already classified according to a general conceptual hierarchy for organizing domain information that is specified by KOMET-PENMAN internally.",
        "This guarantees that the retrieved information is in a form which can be readily interpreted by the other resources of the linguistic system maintained internally to KOMET-PENMAN.",
        "This provides the definitions for the semantic types used in the SPL-like second parameter to the 'instantiate' constraints shown in Figure 2.",
        "At present, information is retrieved from the editor's workbench which matches the these second parameters.",
        "Work in progress is exploring more sophisticated information retrieval operations.",
        "The representation of genre therefore offers a major constraint on the text generation process, including its access to domain knowledge.",
        "As mentioned before, not all of the stages of a GSP are obligatory.",
        "This gives rise to a number of subtypes of the biography genre.",
        "For example, a short biographical entry, as it typically occurs in an encyclopedia realizes all stages and tends to be activity-focussed and timeline organized.",
        "Our sample text 1, on the other hand, did not realize all stages; it presents more the roles Behrens took on as an artist (designer, architect) and his major works in one of these roles (the text therefore focuses on activities of creation and the results of these creative processes and is not explicitly timeline organized).",
        "Both kinds of texts are, however, useful for an editor (and for an information seeker) in particular contexts and so both should be available presentation styles.",
        "Unless the text generation component allows the ready definition of such genres and their linguistic realizations with maximal re-usablity of existing resources, such flexibility will be compromised.",
        "The next strata in the system, register, is further described in terms of the three parameters of field, tenor and mode.",
        "Field describes the states and events and participants occurring in a particular situation.",
        "Tenor refers to the roles and statuses of the participants in a particular situation.",
        "Mode refers to the symbolic organization of the situation as text, including the channel of communication and the rhetoric goals [Halliday and Hasan, 1989, p12].",
        "Specific sets of values that realize field, tenor and mode bring about situation types or registers.",
        "Particular situation types accordingly constrain the kind of language that may occur in those situations.",
        "Certain aspects of register are constrained by the situation that the text generator is to understand itself as being in – thus, whether the text is to be written or spoken, whether the relationship between the hearer and the speaker/writer is distant or close, etc.",
        "must be selected externally.",
        "The provision of such features in the register specification automatically provides a high degree of parameterization.",

        "Most of the upper structure for the domain knowledge is therefore represented externally in SFK (the `Smalltalk FrameKit' [Fischer and Rostek, 1993]), which is the implementation language for the editor's workbench.",
        "This is linked back to a KOMET-PENMAN internal portion of the hierarchy which directly attaches to the topmost field features and positions the combined field hierarchy with respect to tenor and mode.",
