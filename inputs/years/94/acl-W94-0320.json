        "In section 6 we will discuss the limitations of this approach.",

        "Consider the following scenario.",
        "An agent S wants an agent H to accept a proposal P. In the situation where H always deliberates and H knows of options which compete with proposal P, H cannot decide whether to accept P without a warrant.1 Previous work has assumed 'Elsewhere we consider scenarios in which H always accepts S's proposal without a warrant and in which H never knows of competing options to P [36].",

        "We define SALIENT as available in current Working Memory, referred to below as Attention/Working Memory or AWM.",
        "A model of the hearer H's attentional state will distinguish between those discourse entities and beliefs which are currently available in working memory, and thus salient, and those that are not.",
        "In section 3, we introduce an operationalization of AWM and discuss how S can model what is salient for H. When a warrant is not SALIENT, H must either infer the warrant information, or retrieve it from long term memory, or obtain it from an external source in order to evaluate S's proposal.",
        "Thus S's communicative choice as to whether to include the warrant satellite may depend on S's model of H's attentional state.",

        "Another possibility is that processing the warrant utterance requires effort that can be traded off against other processes such as retrieval and inference.",
        "In other words, S may decide that it is easier just to say the warrant rather than require H to infer or retrieve it.",
        "We will call a text planning strategy that always includes the warrant satellite the Explicit-Warrant strategy.",
        "We see that in addition to S modeling H's knowledge, H's attentional state and expectations about other aspects of H's cognitive processes may also influence S's text planning decisions, and S cannot simply represent H's beliefs as a set of pairs of propositions and associated utility.3 In sum, the choice is hypothesized to depend on cognitive properties of H, e.g. what H knows, H's attentional state, and H's processing capabilities, as well as properties of the task and the communication channel."

        "We can think of H's attentional state as comprising a (small) active working memory, and a larger long-term memory.",
        "We vary whether an agent has the ability to retrieve an item by varying the radius of AWM.",
        "We vary the amount of effort involved in retrieving an item by varying the cost of retrieval [17, '24, 2].",
        "If a warrant for the proposal is in short-term memory and can be accessed virtually cost-free, then figure 4 shows that generating the warrant explicitly can actually be detrimental, since it can displace other information.",
        "The effect is further magnified if communication is very costly, as shown in figure 6.",
        "(Cost of communication may by increased by a large number of factors, such as the linguistic complexity of the generated message, the fact that H is not fully competent in the language of communication, or noise in the channel of communication.)",
        "Thus, if S knows that information that can serve as a warrant is salient to H, then no warrant should be generated.",
        "On the other hand, if a cost is in fact associated with retrieval, as in the experiment reported in figure 5,",
        "then we can see that generating a warrant is beneficial, especially as the size of AWM increases and agents have the ability to access all of long term memory.",
        "We conclude that for a text planner to decide whether or not to communicate certain non-essential information, such as a warrant as part of a MOTIVATE relation, depends not just on the effect of the relation (which must of course match the discourse goal), but also on the attentional state of H, and on the other factors such as the cost of communication.",
        "A maximally efficient text planner will need to have access to:",
        "• a model of H's attentional state; • an algorithm that, given the attentional state model and additional parameters such as the costs of communication and retrieval determines whether H knows accessible information which can serve as a warrant.",

        "The values in the table are determined using the simulation environment.",

        "In particular, if a discourse segment consisting of a nucleus with a hierarchically complex satellite that is extremely long, then a further satellite to the same nucleus may well require repetition of the nucleus [35].",

        "In this paper, we used the theoretical construct of utility as the basis for degree of desire for the MOTIVATION relation.",

        "The speaker's desire for an aesthetic environment on her walk has in this case overridden her desire for the fastest route to work.",
