        "The part of R's response consisting of (1d) - (le) is what we call an indirect answer to a Yes-No question, and if (1c) had been uttered, (1c) would have been called a direct answer.",

        "e. The timing belt is broken.",
        "According to one study of spoken English (Ste84], 13 percent of responses to Yes-No questions were indirect answers.",
        "Thus, the ability to interpret indirect answers is required for robust dialogue systems.",
        "Furthermore, there are good reasons for generating indirect answers in a dialogue system.",
        "First, a direct yes or no alone may be misleading if extra information is needed to qualify the answer.",
        "Second, an indirect answer may contribute to a more efficient dialogue.",
        "For example, in addition to providing the requested information, it may anticipate a follow-up question from Q, or it may allow R to respond immediately without asking for clarification of the question.",
        "That is, the increased efficiency is more the result of avoiding the follow-up question or clarification sub dialogue than the result of omitting the direct answer.",
        "Third, an indirect answer may be preferable for politeness considerations, as in (1).",
        "We have developed a computational model for the interpretation and generation of indirect answers to Yes-No questions in English.",
        "More precisely, by a Yes-No question we mean one or more utterances used as a request by Q (the questioner) that R (the responder) convey R's evaluation of the truth of a proposition p. An indirect answer implicitly conveys via one or more utterances R's evaluation of the truth of the questioned proposition p, i.e. that p is true, that p is false, that there is some truth to p, that p may be true, or that p may be false.",
        "Our model presupposes that Q's question has been understood by R as intended by Q, that Q's request was appropriate, and that Q and R are engaged in a cooperative goal-directed dialogue.",
        "Both the interpretation and generation components have been implemented in Common Lisp on a Sun SPARCstation.",
        "A language user's pragmatic knowledge of how language is used to answer Yes-No questions in English can be used to constrain the problem of generating and interpreting indirect answers.",
        "This knowledge is encoded in our model as a set of domain-independent discourse plan operators and a set of coherence rules, described in section 2.1 Our system is reversible in that the same pragmatic knowledge is used by the generation and interpretation modules.",
        "Generation is modeled as discourse plan construction and interpretation as discourse plan inference.",
        "The output of generation is a discourse plan which can be realized by a tactical generation component [McK85], and the output of interpretation is the speaker's inferred discourse plan.",

        "problem of content-planning during generation.",
        "This paper describes our approach to generation, including our solution to this problem.",
        "Generation of a discourse plan, described in section 4, is performed in two phases: content planning and plan pruning.",

        "In other contexts, i.e. those in which the direct answer must be given explicitly, a plan for a direct answer with appropriate extra information is generated.",
        "Note that, according to the study mentioned earlier [Ste84], 85 percent of direct answers are accompanied by such information.",

        "Next, this instantiation of Use-obstacle must be expanded, i.e., the generator must decide which of the satellites of Use-obstacle to include.",
        "By a procedure similar to that described above, it would decide to include (another) Use-obstacle, where the existential variable is instantiated with the proposition (in-state (sick sitter) past).",
        "(Note that this proposition might be chosen because the model of R's beliefs includes the shared belief that being sick typically renders a sitter unfit to perform his or her duties.)",
        "The stimulus condition explanation-indicated might be the motivation for including this satellite.",
        "(For example, suppose it is shared knowledge that R's baby sitter is rarely unavailable.)",

        "The primary focus of our research has been on 1) use of pragmatic knowledge which is common to both the interpretation and generation of indirect answers, i.e. the so-called reversible knowledge, and 2) identifying stimulus conditions.",
        "In this section, we give a brief description of some other factors in generating indirect answers.",
        "First, note that we made the simplifying assumption that R's only initial goal is to answer the question (accurately, efficiently, and politely).",
        "However, it is possible for R to construct an indirect answer which satisfies multiple initial goals of R. For example, R might have decided to give the answer in (12c) not only as an explanation, but also as background for R's",
        "Second, stylistic goals may affect the generation of indirect answers.",
        "In addition to affecting syntactic and lexical aspects of discourse [Hov90, MG91, DH93], stylistic goals may affect which and how much information is given.",
        "For example, elaboration can be used to make an answer more lively, as shown in (13).",
        "Also, extra information that entails the direct answer (e.g. repetitions and generalizations) may be given for emphasis.",
        "Further, a stylistic goal of terseness may override the stimulus conditions we have provided for indirect answers.",
        "For example, depending upon the degree of Q's interest in R's affairs, the indirect answer in (14c) - (140 may provide Q with more than Q cares to know.",
        "Third, certain syntactic forms for expressing Yes-No questions require more than just yes/no to make clear whether R is confirming or disconfirming that a proposition p holds [Ste84].",
        "For example,18 (15) shows the use of amplification (i.e. supplying an auxiliary verb) in answer to a negative-polarity, positive-bias question.",
        "15.a.",
        "Q: Didn't Ann get the letter?",
        "b. R: Yes she did.",
        "c. R: No she didn't.",
        "(A question is said to have positive or negative polarity depending on the presence or absence of negation, respectively.",
        "Bias describes the questioner's presumed belief in the truth of the questioned proposition.)",
        "In answer to (16a), a negative-polarity, negative-bias question,19 R provides an indirect answer, giving the extent to which the proposition that R has been up18(15) and (16) are StenstrOm's (105) and (111), respectively.",
        "i9 Although it is expressed as a declarative sentence, StenstrOm classifies (16a) as a request for confirmation, which we treat as a type of Yes-No question."

        "In our model, the operators used as satellites of top-level answer discourse plan operators are based on RST's subject-matter relations.",
        "The primary goals of these operators are similar to the effect fields of the corresponding RST relation definitions.",
        "As Moore and Paris argue, goals based on these relation definitions are rhetorical goals, not intentional goals.",
        "However, in our model, it is possible to determine the intentional subgoals by checking which stimulus conditions motivated the speaker to include a particular satellite operator.",
        "For example, if explanation-indicated motivates R to include a Use-cause satellite, then one can view R as having the implicit intentional goal of giving an explanation.",
        "Thus, our model provides the information necessary to recover from the possible failure of (all or part of) an indirect answer.",
