        "Text planning and generation become more and more important as components of intelligent multimodal user interfaces.",
        "It has been proposed (see, e.g., Stein and Thiel, 1993) to model interaction with an intelligent information system as a conversation between two participants.",
        "The conversation metaphor applies to natural language as well as to graphical and multimodal user interfaces, if an appropriate model is provided.",
        "Employing features of human-human communication into interface design (even if only to a small extent), the system can respond to the user in a more natural way.",
        "Natural communication does not necessarily imply natural language, but undoubtedly, language plays an important role in conversation.",
        "Theories and tools developed in the areas of Natural Language Processing (NU') and Natural Language Generation (NLG) can help making models for conversations (or dialogues, as we will call it for the rest of the paper) more adequate and richer in 'their descriptive power.",
        "The speech-act oriented dialogue model COR (COnver-sational Roles) has been developed at GMD-IPSI (Sitter and Stein, 1992).",
        "It covers the genre of information seeking human-computer interactions as opposed to human-human conversations and other (less restricted) genres such as spontaneous conversations, narratives, arguments, etc.",
        "Due to its strong focus on the pragmatics of a dialogue, leaving semantics aside, COR is a domain independent conversation model.",
        "It is general in that it covers the basic illocutionary aspects and role expectations of cooperative information-seeking exchanges.",
        "In the search for ways to enhance the COR model further, we found the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) to be a very good candidate.",
        "This theory – initially developed for monologues only – has been formalized and integrated into many text generation and text planning systems, one of which has been developed at IPSI (cf. Bateman et al., 1991).",
        "Some empirical studies were carried out to find out possible points of integration (Fischer, 1993).",
        "The results were very promising and hence used to specify a dialogue manager of a prototypical information system, called Corinna.",
        "This dialogue system uses automatically generated natural language as its major interaction modality.",
        "The incorporation of RST within the COR dialogue model served as an important parameter within the text generation process.",
        "The remainder of the paper is divided into two main parts: the theoretical part concludes with the description of our own approach of integrating COR and RST (section 2.2), which is then elaborated and exemplified in the second part of the paper (section 3) presenting the basic features of the Corinna system."

        "Research activities in several areas, such as NLG, dialogue modeling, information retrieval and multimedia interfaces played an important role in motivating our work.",
        "Two streams of research were particularly interesting in our context: on one hand the incorporation of dialogue models in natural language systems, on the other hand the extension of RST and its application for (not exclusively natural-language-based) dialogue systems.",
        "The following gives some examples of work done in these two areas.",
        "As part of the Communal project (cf. Fawcett et al., 1988), which includes generation as well as understanding of natural language, a dialogue model called SFM (Systemic Flowchart Model) was developed.",
        "It uses a discrimination network to describe situations and actions that can occur in a dialogue.",
        "Due to the fact that many different speech acts (based on Searle, 1969) and speech act sequences were to be considered, the network is quite complex.",
        "Attempts were also made to integrate this model with RST(cf. Fawcett and Davies (1992) and section 2.1.2).",
        "A system which is capable of performing dialogues with a user on the basis of speech, was proposed by Smith, Hipp and Biermann (1992).",
        "Its domain is the maintenance of electrical appliances, and the emphasis in this approach lies on (nested) communicative goals, and concepts such as intentional, attentional and linguistic structures (Grosz and Sidner, 1986).",
        "Another system for the treatment of spoken dialogues is reported in Bilange (1991).",
        "The approach, which has been developed in the framework of the SUNDIAL project,",
        "is based on the assumption that dialogues can best be described by means of a multilevel approach.",
        "The author distinguishes four levels: a domain-specific transaction level, an exchange level, an intervention level modeling initiative, reaction and evaluation, and finally a level consisting of dialogue acts.",
        "The system has been developed for the domain of flight reservations.",
        "Plan-oriented approaches for dialogue modeling are described in Litman and Allen (1987) and Lambert and Carberry (1992).",
        "Both approaches distinguish domain or task, problem-solving and discourse levels.",
        "Knowledge from the various levels is employed to solve the task of plan recognition in dialogues.",
        "Connections do not only exist between the various levels but also between elements within one level.",
        "These links are modeled either as discourse plans which follow the course of the interaction (e.g.",
        "CONTINUATION, CLARIFICATION and TOPIC-SHIFT, see Litman and Allen (1987)) or as discourse actions that link an utterance with the context.",
        "A similar distinction of various levels of representation is made in O'Donnell (1990), except that the links between various elements of his discourse or exchange model are not made explicit.",
        "The EES project (Explainable Expert Systems) is the basis for the theoretical and practical work of Moore and Paris (1989), Moore and Swartout (1990), and Carenini and Moore (1993).",
        "A central goal in EES was the creation of a flexible explanation module for expert systems communicating in natural language, allowing the user to ask questions about explanations given by the system and generating appropriate system responses.",
        "Strategies incorporating parameters such as context and focus were used to disambiguate the user's utterances.",
        "To address the intentions behind utterances and communicative goals, concepts of RST (cf. Mann and Thompson, 1987) and Speech Act Theory were exploited.",
        "The focus, however, is on flexible explanation dialogues and, unlike COR-RST, not on modeling information-seeking dialogues as complex \"negotiations\" with flexible ways to withdraw and reject dialogue contributions.",
        "The Intelligent Documentation Advisory System (IDAS), developed by Reiter, Mellish and Levine (1992) represents an attempt to use dynamically generated natural language in the framework of an information retrieval system using hypertext techniques.",
        "To obtain information, the user clicks on the object under consideration and then chooses one out of a list of request options displayed by the system.",
        "However, there is no dialogue model at all, the system only allows simple query – answer cycles.",
        "The concepts of speech acts in combination with RST are used in several multimedia presentation systems.",
        "Among the first systems following this approach were the WIP system developed at DFKI (see Andre and Rist (1993)) and the system developed by Maybury (1991).",
        "However, neither the WIP project nor Maybury's system use high-level dialogue structures.",
        "As pointed out in Arens et al.",
        "(1993) global structures are necessary for establishing overall coherence in the context of multimedia interfaces.",
        "COR-RST takes this into account.",
        "It focuses on Natural Language Generation, yet allows the extension to multimodal dialogue acts.",
        "In the following two sections the two theoretical approaches (COR and RST) that were most influential for our work will be presented.",
        "Especially the COR model will be described in detail, because it is essential for understanding our approach."

      "text": [
        "In the field of information retrieval (IR) the interactive and communicative aspects of IR have only recently been emphasized (cf. for example, Belkin and Vickery, 1985; Belkin et al., 1993).",
        "There exist approaches to distinguish various types of information retrieval strategies and tactics (cf. Bates, 1979), task hierarchies and global phases of the interaction.",
        "However, no elaborate interaction models are provided in this field (except simplistic iterative question – answer models).",
        "In the area of conversational analysis and discourse theory, on the other hand, we find various discourse and dialogue models which address local dialogue structures (e.g., Fawcett et al., 1988; Grosz and Sidner, 1986, 1990; Reichman, 1985).",
        "To be able to design a flexible dialogue system which can engage in cooperative information-seeking dialogues we use the \"Conversational Roles\" model (COR) developed by Sitter and Stein (1992).",
        "It has been used to design the interface of a multimedia information system, called MERIT (cf. Stein et al., 1992).",
        "The COR model was originally influenced by the \"Conversation for Action\" (CfA) model (Winograd and Flores, 1986) which was applied to design computer-aided human-human interactions.",
        "By adopting basic concepts of speech act theory and existing discourse models, and extending the CfA model for the situation of information-seeking human-computer interactions, the COR model shows the following features:",
        "• it depicts the interaction as a cooperative two-party \"negotiation\" where commitments (to supply information or meta-information) can be made, retracted or rejected; • it permits mixed-initiative dialogues and is flexible enough to describe all possible – even extremely complex – interaction patterns (this includes the temporary role changes of information seeker/ information provider, which frequently occur in highly vague task settings such as information-seeking); • it provides the means for an explicit representation of the dialogue history in an abstract form, i.e., disregarding the interaction mode (graphical, linguistic, mixed).",
        "According to COR the two participants (A and B) have dialogue goals and pursue specific conversational tactics to achieve these goals.",
        "The speaker's and addressee's mutual expectations about possible responses and about the subsequent course of the dialogue are essential.",
        "The model can be represented as a recursive state-transition network (see figure 1).",
        "The network defines the full potential of all possible interactions where successfully completed dialogue contributions/ acts end in specialized states (circles).",
        "Transitions (arcs) represent the various types of dialogue acts: e.g., REQUEST, OFFER, and INFORM can exactly be mapped onto Searle's basic \"illocutionary types\": directives, commissives, and assertives (cf. Searle, 1979); the other generic acts belong to the same categories, but they are less significant because they are merely responsive, e.g., PROMISE is a commissive act, but it adopts the conditions of action expressed by the preceding REQUEST (cf. Sitter and Stein, 1992).",
        "The",
        "traversal of the graph stops in states which are marked by squares.",
        "State < 5 >, for instance, is reached when the information seeker (A) has expressed contentment with the given information and quits the dialogue.",
        "States < 6 > to < 11> are also terminal states, but here the information need could not be satisfied.",
        "Note that a dialogue which ends in one of these states can be well-formed, cooperative and complete (e.g., B rejects a request of A, because the requested information could not be retrieved).",
        "The bold arcs leading from state < 1 > to state < 5 > denote two \"idealized\" courses of the interaction which follow the basic role-expectations or role assignments.",
        "The two initiative acts (REQUEST, OFFER) typically establish new .conditions of action, whereas the subsequent acts are reactive and do not introduce new conditions (PROMISE, ACCEPT, INFORM, and BE-CONTENTED are all \"expected\" in that they are positive responses to the preceding acts).",
        "Really encountered information-seeking dialogues, however, often do not follow such a simple, linear conversational development.",
        "Directive acts (REQUEST, ACCEPT) can be rejected by the addressee, commissives (OFFER, PROMISE) are often withdrawn.",
        "Both rejections and withdrawals called \"alternative\" acts or responses) can either lead back to state < 1 >, where the dialogue is entered again (begin of a new dialogue cycle), or to a terminal state (definite REJECT, WITHDRAW).",
        "Another way of departing from the linear course of interaction is even more important.",
        "So far we have only considered \"atomic\" dialogue acts which are not further decomposed.",
        "But consider the following situations which often occur in information-seeking interactions: if the meaning of an utterance (atomic act) has not been understood by the addressee, or, if she needs additional information to be able to proceed, an embedded clarification dialogue might be necessary.",
        "In order to resolve this problem, the transitions in figure 1 must not be interpreted as atomic acts but as structured dialogue contributions.",
        "The extended COR model, therefore, defines basically two types of subnetworks: figure 2 displays the net of an INFORM contribution; figure 3 shows a representative net for all other types of contributions (here: REQUEST as an example).",
        "Thus, recursion is taken into account.",
        "In the figures 2 and 3 \"A: request\" and \"A: inform\" denote atomic acts, whereas a suffix notation indicates structured contributions, for example: AssERT(A,B) or DIALoGuE(B,A, solicit context information).",
        "The traversal of the INFORM net is quite simple: A's INFORM act can be followed by a subdialogue initiated by B (e.g., by a REQUEST such as a clarifying question), or, if B does not need additional information, state < c > is reached immediately (jump).",
        "Thus, A's (\"nuclear\") INFORM act might be sufficient, whereas the (\"satellitic\") sub dialogue is optional and depends on B's decision."

        "RST is a theory which describes the structure of written monologues.",
        "One of the most basic assumptions of RST is that coherence can be modeled by means of named relations which hold between adjacent text units.",
        "Such relations can be used to structure texts by iteratively applying relations thereby composing complex text units out of smaller ones.",
        "Another assumption of RST is that, in general, a relation imposes an asymmetric structure on the connected text units.",
        "For a given pair of related text units, the so-called nucleus corresponds to the unit which contains highly relevant information, while the satellite carries less significant information; the satellite can be either substituted or left out without significantly changing the overall meaning of the discourse.",
        "Since RST relations have been specified in a semi-formal way, this theory was a good candidate for a computational specification of coherence and later for an implementation of text planning and text generation systems.",
        "Recent attempts have been made to use this theory also for modeling dialogues, in particular for modeling both the connections within and between various dialogue contributions which is in contrast to approaches which only use RST to model links within a dialogue contribution like, e.g., Moore and Paris (1993).",
        "Nearly all approaches (see, for example, Fawcett and Davies, 1992, and Daradoumis, 1993) are in the area of human-computer interaction, where a generation component is responsible for the automatic production of system utterances.",
        "Another approach, which was developed for the domain of information-seeking dialogues, is reported in Maier and Sitter (1992).",
        "The authors showed that in such dialogues a specific subset of relations, the so-called interpersonal relations (see Maier and Hovy (1991)), are used.",

        "For example, in the REQUEST – PROMISE pair of dialogue acts, REQUEST is the nucleus and PROMISE the satellite - the latter one being the expected positive acknowledgement.",

        "The other constituent is either an ASSERT contribution (atomic or complex) or a DIALOGUE to negotiate the contextual information (see also section 2.1.1).",
        "The fact that ASSERT and DIALOGUE serve the same purpose in COR - namely to provide context information - also had to be modeled adequately in terms of RST.",
        "This was achieved by simply assigning the INFORM act to be the nucleus of the whole DIALOGUE.",
        "Both ASSERT and INFORM may contain the same proposition (contextual information).",
