        "In the natural use of natural language, a single event can be talked about in a variety of ways, taking a variety of viewpoints.",
        "Such variety is necessary across languages because of differences in how cultures prefer to express things (Delin et al., 1993) and because of differences in how languages make it possible to express things (Felshin, 1993).",
        "A selection of viewpoints is also needed within languages, both for coherence (Meteer, forthcoming) and for effective rhetoric (Hovy, 1988).",
        "For us, varied viewpoints are a way to expose learners of a foreign language to a variety of linguistic constructions in the naturalistic, situation-based, two-medium (graphical as well as linguistic) conversations that take place in our foreign language learning environment called Fluent-2.",
        "To achieve this objective, we have been developing and implementing our notion of an abstract situation viewpoint, hereafter called simply a view.",
        "A view specifies a way to operate on an action or a possible action in a situation to produce a language-independent conceptual structure that corresponds to a statement, command or question about an action or its results, purpose, participants, etc.",
        "This paper sketches an internal structure for views and indicates their range of expression.",
        "The choice of which view to use at a particular point can be made by the tutorial strategist, taking into account the student's limited knowledge of the language (Hamburger, in press).",
        "View processing is the deepest of three levels forming the NLG capability of the learning environment.",
        "The general idea of views can be seen from a few examples in three categories: action, state and plan views.",
        "1.",
        "Computer Science, George Mason Univ., Fairfax, VA 2.",
        "Institute for Informatics, Bucharest, Rumania 1.",
        "You picked up the pot.",
        "[description of an action] 2.",
        "The pot is in your hand.",
        "[description of a state] 3.",
        "Now fill the pot.",
        "[command to continue plan] 4.",
        "The water is not on.",
        "[unmet precondition] 5.",
        "What is (still) on the counter?",
        "[question on related object] 6.",
        "I asked you to pick up the cup, not the pot.",
        "[unheeded command]",
        "These examples show differences not only in views but also in the type of conversational interaction: #5 is a question, while #3 and #6 show different aspects of a command-act interaction.",
        "Views differ in what actions they refer to, with #1 as the most straightforward case, describing a single action that just occurred.",
        "In contrast, #6 refers to two actions, one of which was created earlier in formulating a command that was never performed.",
        "Among state views, the most straightforward is to comment on the new value of an object's attribute, as in #2, but it is usually also quite possible to comment on the cessation of the corresponding previous value.",
        "Yet another state view is applicable if the new value is the same as the corresponding one for another object; one can then say, for example, that there are two cups on the table or that both cabinet doors are open.",
        "Underlying sentence #3, above, is a plan view, in this case the notion of transition to the next action in the current plan.",
        "Plans can also refer to such things as the completion of a plan or subplan and the transition from one subplan to the next.",
        "Plans exist in the microworlds so that the successive actions will make sense, not only those chosen by the tutor to carry out itself, but also those the tutor tells the student to do, as in #3.",
        "The resulting situational continuity supports a language beginner by keeping it clear what is being talked about.",
        "For a more advanced student, plan views provide their own form of variety, including two-clause sentences like, \"Now that the pot is full, put it on the stove,\" in which the first clause involves a state view, the second an action view and the whole sentence comes from a plan view, the transition from a just completed subplan to the next action whose goal is not already satisfied."

        "Fluent-2 is a two-medium tutorial system whose principal goal is to provide an essential form of foreign language learning experience: realistic conversation in the target language.",
        "Figure 1 shows key parts of the system.",
        "Language interaction in Fluent-2 is tightly integrated with a visual second medium consisting of partially animated graphics under shared control of the student and the electronic tutor.",
        "Both the graphics and the language are the outward manifestations of an underlying microworld of objects, in a hierarchy of classes, taking part in actions that are structured into plans.",
        "The graphics and animation provide a realistic auxiliary source of information about what is being said.",
        "This independent channel helps the student pick up new vocabulary and language constructions in a clear situational context.",
        "This two-medium interaction capability, including the deep generation component sketched in this paper, should also be applicable to tutoring systems in other subject matter.",
        "Surface generation is done by a large natural language processing system, developed by Susan Felshin of the MIT Athena Language Learning Project (ALLP) and adapted for us.",
        "It is this system that takes semantic structures to syntactic structures and ultimately to sentences of English, Spanish and, to a lesser extent, other languages.",
        "The natural language processing, graphics, microworlds and tutorial reasoning are all in MCL2 Common Lisp with CLOS on a Mac-IIfx with 20MB of main memory.",
        "The availability of the two media, along with situational continuity, can provide to adults the kind of redundancy that seems essential to children in their race to fluent use of their native tongue.",
        "This is not to say that adults learn in the same way as children.",
        "Nevertheless, Fluent-2, has been designed with careful attention to successful second language pedagogy and appropriate second language research.",
        "Language generation is especially important at the outset, since the learner must comprehend language before meaningfully producing it.",
        "Second language research provides support for using simplified language in meaningful contexts.",
        "Three sources of such experience are foreigner talk (by native speakers, to foreigners), motherese (by parents and caregivers, to children) and teacher talk (by teachers, to students).",
        "We seek to replicate the benefits of these styles in a computational system, by identifying and adapting specific aspects that underlie their success.",
        "Such properties include: restricted vocabulary size; exaggerated intonation and stress; short grammatical sentences; use of concrete references; repetitions, expansions and rephrases; few pro-forms; few contractions; yes-no, choice and tag questions rather than Wh-questions; and so on.",

        "Just such a representation is in the Header slot of the action rule just triggered by the student (via the graphics input slot).",
        "It can be transformed to a semantic structure that is an appropriate input for the surface generation module, which can output the resulting sentence.",
        "We do exactly that, but not deterministically.",
