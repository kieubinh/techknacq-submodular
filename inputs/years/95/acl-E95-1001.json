        "Whenever we hear a sentence or read a text we build up mental representations in which some aspects of the meaning of the sentence or text are left underspecified.",
        "And if we accept what we have heard or read as true, then we will use these underspecified representations as premisses for arguments.",
        "The challenge is, therefore, to equip underspecified semantic representations with well-defined truth conditions and to formulate inference patterns for these representations that follow the arguments that we judge as intuitively correct.",
        "Several proposals exist for the definition of the language, but only very few authors have addressed the problem of defining a logic of ambiguous reasoning.",
        "[8] considers lexical ambiguities and investigates structural properties of a number of consequence relations based on an abstract notion of coherency.",
        "It is not clear, however, how this approach could be extended to other kinds of ambiguities, especially quantifier scope ambiguities and ambiguities triggered by plural NPs.",
        "[1], [7] and [6] deal with ambiguities of the latter kind.",
        "They give construction rules and define truth conditions according to which an underspecified representation of an ambiguous sentence is true if one of its disambiguations is.",
        "The problem of reasoning is adressed only in [5] and [7].",
        "[5]'s inference schemata yield a very weak logic only; and [7]'s deductive component is too strong.",
        "Being weak and strong depends of course on the underlying consequence relation.",
        "Neither [5] nor [7] make any attempt to systematically derive the consequence relation that holds for reasoning with ambiguities on the basis of an empirical discussion of intuitively valid arguments.",
        "The present paper starts out with such a discussion in Section 2.",
        "Section 3 gives a brief introduction to the theory of UDRSs.",
        "It gives a sketch of the principles to construct UDRSs and shows how scope ambiguities of quantifiers and negation are represented in an underspecified way.",
        "As the rules of inference presented in [7] turn out to be sound also with respect to the consequence relation defined in Section 2 these rules (for the fragment without disjunction) will be discussed only briefly in Section 4.",
        "The change in the deduction system that is imposed by the new consequence relation comes with the rules of proof.",
        "Section 5 shows that it is no longer possible to use rules like Conditionalisation or Reductio ad Absurdum when we deal with real ambiguities in the goal.",

        "The paper has shown that it is possible to reason with ambiguities in a natural, direct and intuitively correct way.",

        "Human interpreters seem to use both systems when they perform reasoning tasks.",
        "We know that we cannot surmount undecidability (in a non-adhoc way) if we take quantifiers and/or connectives as logical devices in the traditional sense.",
        "But as the deduction rules for top-level ambiguities given here present an extension of Aristotelian syllogism metamathematical results about their complexity will be of great interest as well as the proof of a completeness theorem.",
        "Apart from this research the use of the rule system within the task of natural language understanding is under investigation.",
        "It seems that the Replacement Rules are particularly suited to do special reasoning tasks neccessary to disambiguate lexical ambiguities, because most of the deductive processes needed there are independent of any quantificational structure of the sentences containing the ambiguous item."
