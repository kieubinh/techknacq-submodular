        "The Exoseme system [6, 7] is an operational application which continuously analyses the economic flow from Agence France Presse (AFP).",
        "AFP, which covers the current economic life of the major industrialised countries, transmits on average 400 dispatches per day on this flow.",
        "Their content is drafted in French in a journalistic style.",
        "Using this flow, Exoseme feeds various users concerning precise and varied subjects, for example, rating announcements, company results, acquisitions, sectors of activity, observation of competition, partners or clients, etc.",
        "50 such themes have currently been developed.",
        "They rely on precise filtering of dispatches with highlighting of sentences for fast reading.",
        "Exoseme is composed of several modules : a morphological analyser, a proper name module, a syntactical analyser, a semantic analyser and a filtering module.",
        "The proper name module has two goals segmenting and categorising proper names.",
        "During the whole processing of a dispatch, the proper name module is involved in three different steps.",
        "First, it segments proper names during the morphological analysis.",
        "Second, it categorises proper names during the semantic analysis.",
        "Third, it is invoked by the filtering module to supply some more information needed for routing the dispatch.",
        "The proper name module is based on different techniques which are used to detect and categorise proper names depending on whether they are known or unknown.",
        "Some of these techniques are taken out of existing systems but they have been unified and completed in constructing this single operational module.",
        "Besides some innovative techniques for desambiguating known proper names using the context have been implemented."

        "In addition, the number of words used in constructing proper names is potentially infinite.",
        "The first step of the processing is segmentation, i.e. accurate cutting-up of proper names in the text; the second step is categorisation, i.e. the attribution to each proper name of a conceptual category (individual, company, location, etc.).",

        "The segmentation of proper names enables the synctactical analyser to be relieved, particularly in the case of long proper names which contain grammatical markers (e.g. prepositions, conjunctions, commas, full stops).",
        "As illustrated in [4], segmentation firstly prevents long proper names from undertaking pointless analyses.",
        "For example, for Caisse de Credit Agricole du Morbihan the analyser will provide two interpretations depending on whether Morbihan is attached to Credit Agricole or to Caisse.",
        "Moreover, proper names often constitute agrammatical segments that sometimes confuse the synctactical analyser.",
        "For exam",
        "ple, in the sentence The director of Dollfus, Mieg and Cie has announced positive results, the analyser has difficulties in finding that The director is the subject of announce if it does not know the company Dollfus, Mieg and Cie.",
        "In the Exoseme process, the Sylex syntactical analyser [3] delegates the segmentation of these agrammatical gaps to our proper name module.",
        "Segmentation of known proper names has already been studied and is treated in some systems such as NameFinder [5]; segmentation of unknown proper names based on pattern matching is implemented in several systems [1, 2, 4, 9]; the morphological matching of acronyms is described in [11]."

        "The very nature of proper names contributes widely to the understanding of texts.",
        "The semantic analyser must be able to use the various categories of proper names as semantic constraints which are complementary for the understanding of texts.",
        "For example, in the filtering theme of acquisitions, the sentence Express group intends to sell Le Point for 700 MF indicates a sale of interests in the newspaper Le Point.",

        "In our system, these ontological categories are extended to attributes needed by the semantic analyser or the filtering module.",
