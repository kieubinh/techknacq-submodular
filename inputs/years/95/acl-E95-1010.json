        "Given texts in two languages that are to some degree translations of one another, an alignment of the texts associates sentences, paragraphs or phrases in one document with their translations in the other.",
        "Successful approaches to alignment can be divided into two primary types: those that use comparisons of lexical elements between the documents (Wu, 1994; Chen 1993; Catizone, Russell and Warwick, 1989), and 'This research was funded under DoD Contract #MDA 904-94-C-E086 those that use a statistical decision process derived from byte-length ratios between alignment blocks (Wu, 1994; Church, 1993; Gale and Church, 1991).",
        "Methods vary for the former approach, but in the latter approach, a dynamic programming framework is used to sequentially align blocks as the alignment process proceeds.",
        "Under this model, blocks are compared only with nearby blocks as the alignment proceeds, substantially reducing the computational overhead [0(n2) 0(n!)] of the alignment process.",
        "In the primary literature on alignment, the texts are typically well-behaved.",
        "In byte-length ratio approaches, the presence of long stretches of blocks that have roughly similar lengths can be problematic, and some improvement can be achieved by augmenting the byte-length measure by scores derived from lexical feature matching (Wu, 1994).",
        "When combined with radical formatting departures between documents that often arise in text translations, the difficulties of producing good alignments are exacerbated by the presence of untranslated segments, textual rearrangements and other problematic text features.",
        "The dynamic programming framework makes long runs of segments that have no translation in their parallel text difficult to ignore because the limited window size prevents passing over those segments to reach appropriate areas of the document further downstream.",
        "Taken together, these difficulties can be catastrophic to the alignment process.",
        "Our experience shows that the fraction of correct alignments can drop to less than 5%.",
        "Noisy translations of this sort do reflect human error and the preferences of translators, and they are probably much more prevalent than alignment work on legislative transcriptions has indicated.",
        "The purpose of this research was to ascertain what types of information contained in a document could be used to improve the alignment process, while not making gross assumptions about the source text format con67 ventions and peculiarities.",
        "The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) corpus was used as a test corpus for evaluating the performance of the modified alignment algorithm.",
        "The PAHO texts are a series of documents on Latin American health issues and our test segment consisted of 180 documents that ranged from 20 to 3825 lines in length.",

        "Although determining sentence boundaries can be problematic across languages, simple assumptions appear to work well even for comparisons between European and Oriental languages, primarily because the segmentation heuristic is uniformly applied to each document and therefore an \"undersegmented\" section can combine together to match with single blocks in the opposite language as necessary.",
        "Less general would be a method that relied on deep analysis of the source texts to determine appropriate boundaries for alignment blocks.",
        "A model that accounted for all of the formatting discrepancies, comparative rescalings of sentence or phrase length due to the economy of the language expression, and other properties that may define a corpus, will not necessarily be appropriate to other corpora or to text in general.",
        "We chose to remain as general as possible with our investigations of alignment methods.",
