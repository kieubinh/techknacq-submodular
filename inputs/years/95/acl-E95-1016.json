        "SRs can be seen as semantic type constraints that a word sense imposes on the words with which it combines in the process of semantic interpretation.",
        "SRs may have different applications in NLP, specifically, they may help a parser with Word Sense Selection (WSS, as in (Hirst, 1987)), with preferring certain structures out of several grammatical ones (Whittemore et al., 1990) and finally with deciding the semantic role played by a syntactic complement (Basili et al., 1992).",
        "Lexicography is also interested in the acquisition of SRs (both defining in context approach and lexical semantics work (Levin, 1992)).",
        "The aim of our work is to explore the feasibility of using an statistical method for extracting SRs from on-line corpora.",
