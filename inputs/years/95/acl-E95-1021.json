        "If a word is not in the lexicon, a guesser is consulted.",

        "We selected the Xerox tagger that learns from an untagged corpus.",
        "The task was not as straigth-forward as we thought.",
        "Without human assistance in the training the result was not impressive, and we had to spend much time tuning the tagger and guiding the learning process.",
        "In a month we achieved 95-97 % accuracy.",
        "The training process of a statistical tagger requires some time because the linguistic information has to be incorporated into the tagger one way or another, it cannot be obtained for free starting from null.",
        "Because the linguistic information is needed, we decided to encode the information in a more straightforward way, as explicit linguistic disambiguation rules.",
        "It has been argued that statistical taggers are superior to rule-based/hand-coded ones because of better accuracy and better adaptability (easy to train).",
        "In our experiment, both claims turned out to be wrong.",
        "For the constraint-based tagger we set one month time limit for writing the constraints by hand.",
        "We used only linguistic intuition and a very limited set of sentences to write the 75 constraints.",
        "We formulated constraints of different accuracy.",
        "Some of the constraints are almost 100 % accurate, some of them just describe tendencies.",
        "Finally, when we thought that the rules were good enough, we took two text samples from different sources and tested both the taggers.",
        "The constraint-based tagger made several naive errors because we had forgotten, miscoded or ignored some linguistic phenomena, but still, it made only half of the errors that the statistical one made.",
        "A big difference between the taggers is that the tuning of the statistical tagger is very subtle i.e. it is hard to predict the effect of tuning the parameters of the system, whereas the constraint-based tagger is very straightforward to correct.",
        "Our general conclusion is that the hand-coded constraints perform better than the statistical tagger and that we can still refine them.",
        "The most important of our findings is that writing constraints that contain more linguistic information than the current statistical model does not take much time."
