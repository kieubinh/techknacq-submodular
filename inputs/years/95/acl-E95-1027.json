        "One of the standard methods for the extraction of domain knowledge (or domain schema in another terminology) from texts is known as Distributional Analysis (Hirshman 1986).",
        "It is based on the identification of the sublanguage specific co-occurrence properties of words in the syntactic relations in which they occur in the texts.",
        "These co-occurrence properties indicate important semantic characteristics of the domain: classes of objects and their hierarchical inclusion, properties of these classes, relations among them, lexico-semantic patterns for referring to certain conceptual propositions, etc.",
        "This knowledge about domain in the form it is extracted is not quite suitable to be included into the knowledge base and require a post-processing of the linguistically trained knowledge engineer.",
        "This is known as a conceptual analysis of the acquired lingistic data.",
        "In general all this is a time consuming process and often requires the help of a domain expert.",
        "However, it seems to be possible to automate some tasks and facilitate human intervention in many parts using a combination of NLP and statistical techniques for data extraction, type oriented patterns for conceptual characterization of this data and an intuitive user interface.",
        "All these resources are to be put together into a Knowledge Acquisition Workbench (KAWB) which is under development at LTG of the University of Edinburgh.",
        "The workbench supports an incremental process of corpus analysis starting from a rough automatic extraction and organization of lexico-semantic regularities and ending with a computer supported analysis of extracted data and a refinement of obtained hypotheses."

        "The workbench we are aiming at integrates computational tools and a user interface to support phases of data extraction, data analysis and hypotheses refinement.",
        "The target domain description consists of words grouped into domain-specific semantic categories which can be further refined into a conceptual type lattice (CTL) and lexico-semantic patterns further refined into conceptual structures as shown elsewhere in the paper.",
        "KAW architecture is displayed in figure 1.",
        "A data extraction module provides the knowledge engineer with manageable units of lexical data (words, phrases etc.)",
        "grouped together according to certain semantically important properties.",
        "The data extraction phase can be subdivided into a stage of semantic category identification and a stage of lexico-semantic pattern extraction.",
        "Both of these stages complement each other: the discovery of semantic categories allows the system to look for patterns and discovered patterns serve as diagnostic units for further extraction of these categories.",
        "Thus both these activities can be applied iteratively until a certain level of precision and coverage is achieved.",
        "These data structures are initally produced by the procedures described above, and refined by the analysis/refinement tool to become a conceptual type lattice and a set of frames.",
        "The word class identification component encompasses tools for the linguistic annotation of texts, word clustering tools and tools for access to external linguistic and semantic sources like thesauri, machine-readable dictionaries and lexical data bases.",
        "Statistical clustering can be automatically checked and subcategorized with the help of external linguistic and semantic sources.",
        "The pattern finder component makes use of phrasal annotations of texts produced by a general robust partial parser.",
        "First, the corpus is checked for stable phrasal collocations for single words and entire semantic clusters by a special tool - a collocator.",
        "After collocations are collected another tool - a generalizer tries automatically deduce regularities and contract multiple patterns into their general representations.",
        "Such patterns are then presented for a conceptual characterization to the knowledge engineer and some predefined generic conceptual structures are suggested for specialization.",
        "The main aim of the analysis and refinement module is to uncover and refine structural generalities found in the previous phases.",
        "It matches in the text patterns which represent hypotheses of the knowledge engineer, groups together and generalizes the found cases and presents them to the knowledge engineer for a final decision.",
        "The matcher evaluates how good a given piece of text matches the pattern and returns matches at various levels of exactness.",
        "If modules are to communicate flexibly then an intermodule information representation format needs to be specified.",
        "Standard Generalized Markup Language (Goldfab 1990) is an international standard for marking up text.",
        "We use SGML as a way of exchanging information between modules in a knowledge acquisition system, and of storing that information in persistent store when it has been processed.",
        "In the rest of the paper we will embark on a more detailed characterization of tools themselves.",
        "We, however, will not present any technical details and suggestions on an actual implementation because the workbench should be able to incorporate different implementations .",
        "Some of the tools are already implemented while others still need implementation or reimplementation in terms of the open architecture of the workbench.",
        "For an illustration we have used samples from engineering for the cardiac-failure domain using OHSUMED (Hersh 1994) corpus and a corpus of patient discharge summaries ( PDS ) described in Mikheev 1994."

        "The tagger assigns categorial features to words.",
        "This is not a straightforward process due to the general lexical ambiguity of any natural language but state-of-the-art taggers do this quite well (more than 97% correctness) using different strategies usually based on an application of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs).",
        "It is well-known that a general text parsing is very fragile and ambiguous by its nature.",
        "Syntactic ambiguity can lead to hundreds of parses even for fairly simple sentences.",
        "This is clearly inappropriate.",
        "However, general and full scale parsing is not required for many tasks of knowledge acquisition but rather a robust identification of certain text segments is needed.",
        "Among these segments are compound noun phrases, verb phrases etc.",
        "To increase a precision of knowledge extraction in some cases it is quite important to resolve references of pronominal anaphora.",
        "At the moment in parsing sentences we are using a temporal expressions recognizer, a noun-phrase recognizer, a simple verb-phrase recognizer and a simple anaphoric binder.",
        "This can be further extended to treat other phenomena of natural language, providing that new components are robust and fast.",
        "The parser supplies information to a case attachement module.",
        "This module using semantically driven role filler expectations for verbs provides a more precise attachment of noun phrases to verbs.",
        "To do this we are using ESK - an event and state knowledge base (Whittemore 94) which for more that 700 verbs contains information on thematic roles, semantic types for arguments, expected adjuncts, syntactic information, propositional types, WordNet concept types and sense indices."

        "We now describe this method for inferring a syntactic and semantic classification of words from scratch.",
        "Firstly, we measure the contexts in which words w E W occur, and define a statistically motivated similarity measure between contexts of occurrence of words to infer a similarity between words, d(wi , w2), E W. In our case the context is defined to be a vector of word bigram statistics across the corpus for one and two words to the left and right, thus representing each word to be classified by a vector of bigram statistics.",
        "Then we apply a classification procedure to produce a hierarchical single link clustering (or dendrogram) (Sokal & Sneath, 1963) of words which we use as a basis for further classification.",
        "If this technique (as more fully described in Finch 1993) is applied to the OHSUMED corpus, some of the structure which is uncovered is displayed in figure 2.",
        "This figure displays part of a 3,000 word dendrogram which can then be \"cut\" at an appropriate level to form a set of disjoint classes which can then be ordered according to their frequency of occurrence.",
