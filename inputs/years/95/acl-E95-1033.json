      "text": [
        "This paper treats the resolution of anaphora within the framework of Parse Talk, a dependency oriented grammar model that incorporates strict lexicalization, head-orientation (based on valency specifications), feature unification, and inheritance among lexicalized grammar specifications (Broker et al., 1994; Hahn et al., 1994).",
        "The results we present rest upon two major assumptions:",
        "1.",
        "As many forms of anaphors (e.g., nominal and pronominal anaphors) occur within sentence boundaries (so-called intra-sentential or sentence anaphora) and beyond (inter- sentential or text anaphora), adequate theories of anaphora should allow the formulation of grammatical regularities for both types using a common set of grammatical primitives.",
        "2.",
        "Anaphora are only one, yet very prominent phenomenon that yields textual cohesion in discourse.",
        "Adequate grammars should therefore also be easily extensible to cover non anaphoric text phenomena (e.g., coherence relations, rhetorical predicates), which provide for additional levels of text (macro) structure, with descriptions stated at the same level of theoretical sophistkation as for anaphora.",
        "First, we will briefly compare our approach with work done in the context of government-binding (GB) grammar and discourse representation theory (DRT).",
        "As we conceive it, binding theory as developed within the GB framework (Chomsky, 1981; Kuno, 1987) offers one of the most sophisticated approaches for treating anaphora at the sentence level of description.",
        "This has also been recognized by advocates of competing grammar formalisms, who have elaborated on GB's binding principles (cf., e.g., Pollard and Sag (1992) within the context of HPSG, whose treatment is nevertheless restricted to reflexive pronouns).",
        "Interestingly enough, when faced with some crucial linguistic phenomena, such as topicalization, GB must assume rather complex movement operations in order to cope with the data in a satisfactory manner.",
        "Things get even more complicated when languages with relatively free word order, such as German, are taken into account.",
        "Finally, considering the case of text anaphora, binding theory has nothing to offer at all.",
        "Another strong alternative for considering anaphora constitutes the framework of DRT (Kamp and Reyle, 1993).",
        "Its development can be considered a landmark in the model-theoretic semantic analysis of various forms of quantified sentences, conditionals, and anaphorically linked multi-sentential discourse.",
        "At this level of description, DRT is clearly superior to GB.",
        "On the other hand, its lack of an equally thorough treatment of complex syntactic constructions makes it inferior to GB.",
        "These deficits are no wonder, since DRT is not committed to any particular syntactic theory, and thus cannot place strict enough syntactic constraints on the admissible constituent structures.",
        "Focusing on the text analysis potential of DRT, its complex machinery might work in a satisfactory way for several well-studied forms of anaphora, but it necessarily fails if various non-anaphoric text phenomena need to be interpreted.",
        "This is particularly true of conceptually-rooted and pragmatically driven inferences necessary to build up textual macro structures in terms of coherence relations (Hobbs, 1982) or rhetorical structures (Mann and Thompson, 1988).",
        "This shortcoming is simply due to the fact that DRT is basically a semantic theory, not a comprehensive model for text understanding; it lacks any systematic connection to comprehensive reasoning systems covering the conceptual knowledge and specific problem solving models underlying the chosen domain.",
        "Summing up, DRT is fairly restricted both with respect to the incorporation of powerful syntactic constraints at the sentence level and its extension to the level of (non-anaphoric) text macro structures.",
        "GB, on the other hand, is strong with respect to the specification of binding conditions at the sentence level, but offers no opportunity at all to extend its analytic scope beyond that sentential level.",
        "We claim, however, that the dependency based grammar model underlying Parse Talk",
        "1. covers intra-sentential anaphora at the same level of descriptive adequacy as current GB, although it provides less complex representation structures than GB analyses; these structures are nevertheless expressive enough to capture the relevant distinctions, 2. does not exhibit an increasing level of structural complexity when faced with crucial linguistic phenomena which cause considerable problems for current GB theory, 3. goes beyond GB in that it allows the treatment of anaphora at the text level of description within the same grammar formalism as is used for sentence level anaphora, and, 4. goes beyond the anaphora-centered treatment of text structure characteristic of the DRT approach in that it already accounts for the resolution of text-level ellipsis (sometimes also referred to as functional anaphora, cf. Hahn and Strube (1995)) and the interpretation of text macro structures (a preliminary study is presented in Hahn (1992))."

      "text": [
        "In this section, we present, quite informally, some constraints on intra-sentential anaphora in terms of dependency grammar (DG).",
        "We will reconsider these constraints in Section 3, where our grammar model is dealt with in more depth.",
        "We provide here a definition of d-binding and two constraints which describe the use of reflexive pronouns and anaphors (personal pronouns and definite noun phrases).",
        "These constraints cover approximately the same phenomena as the binding theory of GB (Chomsky (1981); for a computational treatment, cf. Correa (1988)).",
        "Dependency structures, by definition, refer to the sentence level of linguistic description only.",
        "The relation of dependency holds between a lexical head and one or several modifiers of that head, such that the occurrence of a head allows for the occurrence of one or several modifiers (in some pre-specified linear ordering), but not vice versa.",
        "Speaking in terms of dependency structure representations, the head always precedes and, thus, (transitively) governs its associated modifiers in the dependency tree.",
        "This basic notion of government must be further refined for the description of anaphoric relations in dependency trees (we do not claim a universal status for the following constraints, but restrict their validity to the description of the German language): D-binding: A modifier M is d-bound by some head H, if no node N intervenes between M and H for which one of the following conditions holds:",
        "(i) node N represents a finite verb, or (ii) node N represents a noun with a possessive modifier, i.e., possessive determiners, Saxon genitive, genitival and prepositional attributes.",
        "Based on the definition of d-binding, we are able to specify several constraints on reflexive pronouns and anaphors in DG terms: Reflexive pronoun: The reflexive pronoun and the antecedent to which the reflexive pronoun refers are d-bound by the same head.",
        "Pronominal and nominal anaphors: (i) The antecedent a to which an anaphor 7r refers must not be governed by the same head which d-binds 7r, unless (ii) applies.",
        "(ii) The antecedent a to which an anaphor 7r refers may only be governed by the same head 11.1 which d-binds r, if a is a modifier of a head H2, H2 is governed by H.1, and a precedes ir in the linear sequence of text items.",
        "Hence, a is not d-bound by the head Hi which d-binds 7r.'",
        "We will now illustrate the working of these constraints, starting with the consideration of reflexives.",
        "Usually, the antecedent of a reflexive pronoun is the subject of the clause to which the reflexive belongs.",
        "In (1), the subject Maria is d bound by the same head as the reflexive sich.",
        "(1) Maria, wischt sich, [Mary, washes herself,.]",
        "Of course, the government relation between antecedent and reflexive need not be an immediate one.",
        "For instance, a preposition may occur between reflexive and verb, since the notion of d binding does not discriminate between NPs and PPs (cf. (2)).",
        "If the finite verb is a modal or auxiliary verb, one or more non-finite verbs may occur between the reflexive and the finite verb (cf. (3)).",
        "The definition of d-binding roughly corresponds to the governing category in GB terminology, which relies upon the notion of c-command, while the latter two grammar constraints correspond to the three major binding principles of GB.",
        "(2) Maria; lacht fiber sichs [Mary, laughs about herself.]",
        "(3) Maria, mOchte sich, verbessern.",
        "[Mary, wants to improve herself.]",
        "(4) Maria erzallt Peters, Geschichte fiber sich,.",
        "[Mary tells Peter's, story about himself.]",
        "(5) \" Maria, erzhlt Peters Geschichte iiber sich,.",
        "[ Mary, tells Peter's story about herself.]",
        "(6) Maria, erzahlt eine Geschichte fiber sichs.",
        "[Mary, tells a story about herself.]",
        "We will now consider constraints on intrasentential anaphora (personal pronouns and definite NPs).",
        "As a general rule, the anaphor must not occupy the position of the reflexive pronoun.",
        "Hence, for all the examples given above, any of those sentences becomes ungrammatical if the reflexives are replaced by non-reflexive anaphoric expressions (cf. (7) vs. (2)).",
        "(7) * Maria, lacht fiber sie,.",
        "[* Mary, laughs about her,.]",
        "It is also obvious that whenever the anaphor belongs to a clause which is subordinate to one that contains the antecedent, both may be coreferent: this holds independently of the ordering of antecedent and pronoun (cf. (8) vs. (11)).",
        "On the other hand, if the anaphor belongs to the matrix clause and the antecedent to the subordinate clause, coreference is excluded (cf. (9)).",
        "But one can easily think of cases where this rule is overridden.",
        "Consider, e.g., a subordinate clause preceding its matrix, as is always true for topicalizations.",
        "The claim that a pronoun in the superordinate clause must not be coreferent to an antecedent in a subordinate clause is then obviously false (cf. (10) and (11)).",
        "In (10), the antecedent Peteris not d-bound by the head which d-binds the anaphor er, and Peter precedes er.",
        "Therefore, coreference is possible.2",
        "(8) Peter, erwartet, daB er, einen Brief bekommt.",
        "[Peter, expects that he will get a letter.]",
        "(9) * Er, erwartet, daB Peter, einen Brief bekommt.",

        "(11) DaB er, einen Brief bekommt, erwartet Peter,.",
        "[That he, will get a letter, Peter; expects.]",
        "Another special case arises if the antecedent is a modifier of the subject of a sentence.",
        "In this case the antecedent of a pronoun may be governed by the head which d-binds the pronoun.",
        "In (12) the pronoun belongs to the subordinate clause, but in (13) the antecedent of the pronoun belongs to the subordinate clause, and the example seems to be acceptable.",
        "In (14), where the subject Vater is modified by the genitive attribute des Gewinners, the antecedent is governed by the head which also d-binds the pronoun.",
        "Both the relative clause and the genitive attribute are modifiers of the subject, which usually occurs at the first position in the German main clause.",
        "In this case, the antecedent precedes the anaphor.",
        "Hence, coreference between anaphor and antecedent must be granted.3 (12) Der Mann, der sie, kennt, griiik die Frau,.",
        "[The man who knows her, greets the wornan,.]",
        "(13) Der Mann, der die Frau, kennt, grfifit sie,.",
        "[The man who knows the woman, greets herd.]",
        "(14) Der Vater des Gewinnersi gratuliert ihm,.",
        "[The winner's, father congratulates him,.]",
        "The incorporation of an ordering constraint is even more justified if one looks at sentences which have a similar structure, but are different with respect to word order (cf. (15) vs. (16)).",
        "In (15), the subordinate clause immediately follows its head word, while in (16) the subordinate clause is extraposed.",
        "In (16) the anaphor precedes its antecedent, which is governed by the head that d binds the anaphor.",
        "This violates the given constraints, hence coreference is excluded.",
        "G B explains topicalization with a move of the topicalized CP into the SpecComp phrase of the highest CP, so that the pronoun does not c-command its antecedent (in these cases movements into an A-position are assumed for which the binding principles of GB do not apply).",
        "(15) Die Frage, ob Peter, nach Dublin fahren sollte, konnte er, noch nicht beantworten.",
        "[The question, whether Peter, should go to Dublin, he, couldn't decide.]",
        "(16) * Die Frage konnte er, noch nicht beantworten, ob Peter, nach Dublin fahren sollte.",
        "r The question he, couldn't decide, whether Peter, should go to Dublin.]",
        "Structural constraints are necessary conditions, but additional criteria have to be considered when determining the antecedent of an anaphor.",
        "Morphosyntactic conditions require that a pronoun must agree with its antecedent in gender, number and person, while a definite NP must agree with its antecedent in number only.",
        "Moreover, conceptual criteria have to be met as in the case of nominal anaphors which must subsume their antecedents at the conceptual level.",
        "Similarly, for pronominal anaphors the selected antecedent must be permitted in those conceptual roles connecting the pronominal anaphors and its grammatical head.",
        "The DG constraints for the use of reflexives and intra-sentential anaphora cover approximately the same phenomena as GB, but the structures used by DG analysis are less complex than those of GB and do not require the formal machinery of empty categories, binding chains and complex movements (cf. Lappin and McCord (1990, p.205) for a similar argument).",

        "The main advantage of our approach lies in the unified framework for sentence and text-level anaphora, using a coherent grammar format, and the provision for access to grammatical and conceptual knowledge without prioritizing either one of them.",
        "It is also a striking fact that, given the same linguistic phenomena, structural dependency configurations are considerably simpler than their GB counterparts, though suitably expressive.",
        "The anaphora resolution module (for reflexives, intra and inter-sentential anaphora) has been realized as part of Parse Talk, a dependency parser which forms part of a larger text understanding system for the German language, currently under development at our laboratory.",
        "The parser has been implemented in Smalltalk; the Smalltalk system itself, which runs on a SUN SparcStation network, has been extended by asynchronous message passing facilities and physical distribution mechanisms (Xu, 1993).",
        "The current lexicon contains a hierarchy of approximately 100 word class specifications with nearly 3.000 lexical entries and corresponding concept descriptions from two domains (information technology and medicine) available from the LOOM knowledge representation system (MacGregor and Bates, 1987).",
        "Acknowledgments.",
        "We would like to thank our colleagues in the CCIF group who read earlier versions of this paper.",
        "In particular, improvements are due to discussions we had with S. Schacht, N. Broker, P. Neuhaus, and M. Klenner.",
        "We also like to thank J. Alcantara (Cornell U) who kindly took the role of the native speaker via Internet.",
        "This work has been funded by LGFG Baden-Wurttemberg (1.1.4-7631.0; M. Strube) and a grant from DFG (Ha 2907/1-3; U. Hahn)."
