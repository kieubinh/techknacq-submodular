        "It is part of a discourse grammar implemented in Carpenter's ALE formalism.",
        "The method for building up the temporal structure of the discourse combines constraints and preferences: we use constraints to reduce the number of possible structures, exploiting the HPSG type hierarchy and unification for this purpose; and we apply preferences to choose between the remaining options using a temporal centering mechanism.",
        "We end by recommending that an underspecified representation of the structure using these techniques be used to avoid generating the temporal/rhetorical structure until higher-level information can be used to disambiguate.",
        "the temporal component were to yield a detailed representation of the temporal structure of the discourse, taking into account the effect of tense, aspect and temporal expressions while at the same time minimising unnecessary ambiguity in the temporal structure.",
        "The method combines a constraint-based approach with an approach based on preferences: we exploit the HPSG type hierarchy and unification to arrive at a temporal structure using constraints placed on that structure by tense, aspect, rhetorical structure and temporal expressions, and we use the temporal centering preferences described by (Kameyama et al., 1993; Poesio, 1994) to rate the possibilities for temporal structure and choose the best among them.",
        "The starting point for this work was Scha and Polanyi's discourse grammar (Scha & Polanyi 1988; Priist et al. 1994).",
        "For the implementation we extended the HPSG grammar (Pollard and Sag, 1994) which Gerald Penn and Bob Carpenter first encoded in ALE (Carpenter, 1993).",

      "text": [
        "Probably the best known algorithm for tracking narrative progression is that developed by Kamp (1979), Hinrichs (1981), and Par-tee (1984), which formalises the observation that an event will occur just after a preceding event, while a state will overlap with a preceding event.",
        "This algorithm gives the correct results in examples such as the following:",
        "(1) John entered the room.",
        "Mary stood up.",
        "(2) John entered the room.",
        "Mary was seated behind the desk.",
        "In (1) the event of Mary's standing is understood to occur just after John enters the room, while in (2) the state in which Mary is seated is understood to overlap with the event of John's entering the room.",
        "However, if there is a rhetorical relationship between two eventualities such as causation, elaboration or enablement, the temporal defaults can be overridden, as in the following examples:",
        "(3) a. John fell.",
        "Mary pushed him.",
        "b.",
        "Local builders constructed the Ford St. Bridge.",
        "They used 3 tons of bricks.",
        "In (3a) there is a causal relationship between Mary's pushing John and his falling, and the second event is understood to precede the first.",
        "In (3b), the second sentence is an elaboration of the first, and they therefore refer to aspects of the same event rather than to two sequential events.",
        "It has been suggested that only world knowledge allows one to detect that the default is being overridden here.",
        "For example, Lascarides & Asher (1991) suggest that general knowledge postulates (in the case of (3a): that a pushing can cause a falling) can be invoked to generate the backward movement reading.",
        "The problem for practical systems is twofold: we could assume that in the case of narrative the Kamp/Hinrichs/Partee algorithm is the default, but each time the default is applied we would need to check all our available world knowledge to see whether there isn't a world knowledge postulate which might be overriding this assumption.",
        "Clearly this would make the processing of text a very expensive operation.",
        "An alternative is to assume that the temporal ordering between events in two consecutive sentences can be any of the four possibilities (just_after, precede, same-event and overlap).",
        "But then the resulting temporal structures will be highly ambiguous even in small discourses.",
        "And sometimes this ambiguity is unwarranted.",
        "Consider:",
        "(4) Mary stared at John.",
        "He gave her back her slice of pizza.",
        "Here, it would appear, only one reading is possible, i.e. the one where John gave Mary her slice of pizza just after she stared or started to stare at him.",
        "It would be undesirable for the temporal processing mechanism to postulate an ambiguity in this case.",
        "Of course, sometimes it is possible to take advantage of certain cue words which either indicate or constrain the rhetorical relation.",
        "For example, in (5) the order of the events is understood to be the reverse of that in (1) due to the cue word because which signals a causal relationship between the events:",
        "(5) John entered the room because Mary stood up.",
        "As Kehler (1994) points out, if forward movement of time is considered a default with consecutive event sentences, then the use of \"because\" in (5) should cause a temporal clash – whereas it is perfectly felicitous.",
        "Temporal expressions such as at noon and the previous Thursday can have a similar effect: they too can override the default temporal relations and place constraints on tense.",
        "In (6), for example, the default interpretation would be that John's being in Detroit overlaps with his being in Boston, but the phrase the previous Thursday overrides this, giving the interpretation that John's being in Detroit precedes his being in Boston: (6) John was in Boston.",
        "The previous Thursday he was in Detroit.",
        "This suggests that the temporal information given by tense acts as a weaker constraint on temporal structure than the information given by temporal adverbials.",
        "The possibilities for rhetorical relations (e.g., whether something is narration, or elaboration, or a causal relation) can be further constrained by aspect.",
        "For example, a state can elaborate another state or an event:",
        "(7) a. Mary was tired.",
        "She was exhausted.",
        "b. Mary built a dog house.",
        "It was a labour of love.",
        "But an event can only elaborate another event, as in (8):",
        "(8) a. Mary built a dog house.",
        "She used two tons of bricks.",
        "b. Mary was tired/working hard.",
        "?She built a dog house.",
        "For the eventive second sentence of (8b) to be an elaboration of the first sentence, it must occur in a stative form – for example as a progressive (i.e., She was building a dog house).",
        "Because of considerations like these, our aim in the implementation work was to treat tense, aspect, cue words and rhetorical relations as mutually constraining, with more specific information such as explicit cue words having higher priority than less specific information such as tense.",
        "The main advantage of this approach is that it reduces temporal structure ambiguity without having to rely on detailed world knowledge postulates.",
        "Table 1 lists the possible temporal relations between the eventualities described by two consecutive sentences without temporal expressions or cue words, where the first sentence (Si) may have any tense and aspect and the second sentence (S2) expresses a simple past event.",
        "We constrain S2 in this way because of lack of space; additional constraints are given in (Hitzeman et al., 1994).",
        "For example, if a simple past eventive sentence follows a simple past eventive sentence the second event can be understood to occur just after the first, to precede the first or to refer to the same event as the first (an elaboration relation), but the two events cannot overlap; these constraints",
        "are weaker, however, than explicit clues such as cue words to rhetorical relations and temporal expressions.",
        "When S1 expresses a state, it is possible for the temporal relation to hold between the event described by S2 and the event or activity most closely preceding Si, i.e., the temporal focus of Si, here referred to as TF1.1 However, we haven't solved the problem completely at this point: although tense can provide a further constraint on the temporal structure of such discourses, it can also add a further ambiguity.",
        "Consider (9):",
        "(9) Sam rang the bell.",
        "He had lost the key.",
        "Clearly, the event described by the past perfect sentence must precede the event described by the first, simple past sentence.",
        "However, if a third sentence is added, an ambiguity results.",
        "Consider the following possible continuations of (9):",
        "(10) a.",
        "...Hannah opened the door.",
        "b.",
        "...It fell through a hole in his pocket.",
        "The temporal relation between these continuations and the portion of earlier text they attach to is constrained along the lines sketched before.",
        "The problem here is determining which thread in (9) they continue; (10a) continues the thread in which Sam rings the bell, but (10b) continues the thread in which Sam loses the key.",
        "A further ambiguity is that when the third sentence is past perfect, it may be a continuation of a preceding thread or the start of a new thread itself.",
        "Consider:",
        "(11) a. Sam rang the bell.",
        "He had lost the key.",
        "It had fallen through a hole in his pocket.",
        "b. John got to work late.",
        "He had left the house at 8.",
        "He had eaten a big breakfast.",
        "In (a) the third sentence continues the thread about losing the key; in (b) the third starts a In this chart it appears that whether the tense is simple past or past perfect makes no difference, and that only aspect affects the possible temporal relations between Si and S2.",
        "However, it is important not to ignore tense because other combinations of tense and aspect do show that tense affects which relations are possible, e.g., a simple past stative S2 cannot have a precede relation with any Si, while a past perfect stative S2 can.",
        "new thread.2 For the problem with multi-sentence discourses, and the \"threads\" that sentences continue, we use an implementation of temporal centering (Kameyama et al., 1993; Poesio, 1994).",
        "This is a technique similar to the type of centering used for nominal anaphora (Sidner, 1983; Grosz et al., 1983).",
        "Centering assumes that discourse understanding requires some notion of \"aboutness.\" While nominal centering assumes there is one object that the current discourse is \"about,\" temporal centering assumes that there is one thread that the discourse is currently following, and that, in addition to tense and aspect constraints, there is a preference for a new utterance to continue a thread which has a parallel tense or which is semantically related to it and a preference to continue the current thread rather than switching to another thread.",
        "Kameyama et al.",
        "(1993) confirmed these preferences when testing their ideas on the Brown corpus.",
        "As an example of how the temporal centering preference techniques can reduce ambiguity, recall example (9) and the possible continuations shown in (10).",
        "The difficulty in these examples is determining whether the third sentence continues the thread begun by the first or second sentence.",
        "For example, in (10a) the preference technique which allows us to choose the first thread over the second is one which assigns a higher rating to a thread whose tense is parallel to that of the new sentence; in this case both Sam rang the bell and Hannah opened the door are in the simple past tense.",
        "In example (10b) the fact that the key is mentioned only in the second sentence of (9) links (10b) with the second thread.",
        "To handle an example like (12), we employ a preference for relating a sentence to a thread that has content words that are rated as semantically \"close\" to that of the sentence: (12) Sam rang the bell.",
        "He had lost the key.",
        "His keyring bioke, We store semantic patterns between words as a cheap and quick form of world knowledge; these 2We will not discuss the additional problem that if the final sentence in (11b) is the end of the text, the text is probably ill-formed.",
        "This is because a well-formed text should not leave threads \"dangling\" or unfinished.",
        "This is probably also the reason for the awkwardness of the well-known example Max poured a cup of coffee.",
        "He had entered the room.",
        "patterns are easier to provide than are the detailed world knowledge postulates required in some other approaches, and result in similar and sometimes more precise temporal structures with less processing overhead.",
        "Using the semantic patterns we know that key and keyrzng are semantically close, and through that semantic link between the second and third sentences we prefer to connect the third sentence to the thread begun by the second.' The approach to representing semantic relationships we take is one used by Morris & Hirst (1991) wherein the words in the lexicon are associated with each other in a thesaurus-like fashion and given a rating according to how semantically \"close\" they are.",
        "We thus avoid relying on high-level inferences and very specific world knowledge postulates, our goal being to determine the temporal structure as much as possible prior to the application of higher-level inferences."
