        "In this paper, we discuss the interaction of temporal anaphora and quantification over eventualities.",
        "Such interaction, while interesting in its own right, is also a good test-bed for theories of the semantic interpretation of temporal expressions.",
        "We discuss cases such as:",
        "(1) Before John makes a phone call, he always lights up a cigarette.",
        "(Partee, 1984) (2) Often, when Anne came home late, Paul had already prepared dinner.",

        "In DRT, such sentences trigger box-splitting with the eventuality of the subordinate clause and an updated reference time in the antecedent box, and the eventuality of the main clause in the consequent box, causing undesirable universal quantification over the reference time.",
        "This problem is analyzed in (de Swart, 1991) as an instance of the proportion problem and given a solution from a Generalized Quantifier approach.",
        "We were led to seek a solution for this problem within DRT, because of DRT's advantages as a general theory of discourse, and its choice as the underlying formalism in another research project of ours, which deals with sentences such as 1-4, in the context of natural language specifications of computerized systems.",

        "An analysis of the mechanism of temporal anaphoric reference hinges upon an understanding of the ontological and logical foundations of temporal reference.",
        "Different concepts have been used in the literature as primitives.",
        "These range from temporal instants in Tense logic (Prior, 67), through intervals of time (Bennet and Partee, 1978(1972)) as in the analysis of temporal connectives in (Heinamaki, 1978), to event structures (Kamp, 1979) as in Hinrichs' (1986) analysis of temporal anaphora.",
        "An important factor in the interpretation of temporal expressions is the classification of situations into different aspectual classes (or Aktionsarten), which is based on distributional and semantic properties.",
        "In this paper, we only consider events and states, together termed eventualities in (Bach, 1981).",
        "In narrative sequences, event clauses seem to advance the narrative time, while states block its progression.",
        "The mechanism used to account for this phenomena in (Hinrichs, 1986) and (Partee, 1984), is based on the notion of reference time, originally proposed by Reichenbach (1947).",
        "Reichenbach's well - known account of the interpretation of the different tense forms uses the temporal relations between three temporal indices: the utterance time, event time and reference time.",
        "The reference time according to (Reichenbach, 1947) is determined either by context, or by temporal adverbials.",
        "2.1 A unified analysis of temporal anaphora Hinrichs' and Partee's use of a notion of reference time, provides for a unified treatment of temporal anaphoric relations in discourse, which include narrative progression especially in sequences of simple past tense sentences, temporal adverbs and temporal adverbial clauses, introduced by a temporal connective.",
        "This concept of reference time is no longer an instant of time, but rather, an interval.",
        "This approach can be summarized as follows: in the processing of a discourse, the discourse-initial sentence is argued to require some contextually determined reference time.",
        "Further event clauses in the discourse introduce a new event, which is included within the then-current reference time.",
        "Each such event also causes the reference time to be updated to a time 'just after' (Partee, 1984) this event.",
        "State clauses introduce new states, which include the current reference time, and do not update it.",
        "As an example of such an analysis consider the following narrative discourse (Partee, 1984): (5) John got up, went to the window, and raised the blind.",
        "It was light out.",
        "He pulled the blind down and went back to bed.",

        "Figure 2 shows a DRS for the first two sentences of this discourse, according to Hinrichs' and Partee's analysis.",
        "The 'n' in the top DRS is a mnemonic for `now'- the utterance time.",
        "The first event in the discourse, el – John's getting up – is interpreted relative to a contextually understood reference time, ro.",
        "The event el is included in the current reference time, r0.",
        "A new reference time marker, r1 is then introduced.",
        "ri lies immediately after 7.0 (recorded as ro ri).",
        "ri serves as the current reference time for the following event e2.",
        "We continue in this fashion, updating the reference time, until the second sentence in the discourse is processed.",

        "Adverbial phrases, whether phrasal (e.g. 'On Sunday') or clausal (e.g. 'When Bill left'), are processed before the main clause.",
        "They introduce a reference time, which overrides the current reference time, and provides an anaphoric antecedent for the tense in the main clause.",
        "This mechanism is used to explain how tense and temporal adverbials can combine to temporally locate the occurrence, without running into problems of relative scope (Hinrichs, 1988).",
        "The tense morpheme of the main clause locates the event time with respect to the reference time, whereas temporal adverbials are used to locate the reference time.",
        "When-clauses, for example, introduce a new reference time, which is ordered after the events described in the preceding discourse.",
        "The eventuality in the when-clause is related to this reference time as discussed earlier with respect to narrative progression: a state includes its reference time, while an event is included in it.",

        "If the main clause is an event",
        "clause, this event introduces a new reference time, just after the event time of the main clause.",
