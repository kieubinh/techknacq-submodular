        "Although only speakers and writers instead of texts have topics (Brown and Yule, 1983, p. 68), natural language researchers always want to identify a topic or a set of possible topics from a discourse for further applications, such as anaphora resolution, information retrieval and so on.",
        "This paper adopts a corpus-based approach to process discourse information.",
        "We postulate that:",
        "Now, consider the following example quoted from the Lancaster-Oslo/Bergen (LOB) Corpus (Johansson, 1986).",
        "The topics in this example are \"problem\" and \"dislocation\".",
        "The two words are more strongly related to the verbs (\"explain\", \"fell\", \"placing\" and \"suppose\") and nouns (\"theories\", \"explanations\", \"roll\", \"codex\", \"disorder\", \"order\", \"disturbance\" and \"upheaval\").",
        "There is a whole group of theories which attempt to explain the problems of the Fourth Gospel, by explanations based on assumed textual dislocations.",
        "The present state of the Gospel is the result of an accident-prone history.",
        "The original was written on a roll, or codex, which fell into disorder or was accidentally damaged.",
        "An editor, who was not the author, made what he could of the chaos by placing the fragments, or sheets, or pages, in order.",
        "Most of those who expound a theory of textual dislocation take it for granted that the Gospel was written entirely by one author before the disturbance took place but a few leave it open to suppose that the original book had been revised even before the upheaval.",
        "We also postulate that (2) Noun-verb is a predicate-argument relationship on the sentence level and noun-noun relationship is associated on discourse level.",
        "The postulation (2) could be also observed from the above example.",
        "These relationships may be represented implicitly by collocational semantics.",
        "Collocation has been applied successfully to many possible applications (Church et al.",
        ", 1989), e.g, lexicography (Church and Hanks, 1990), information retrieval (Salton, 1986a), text input (Yamashina and Obashi, 1988), etc.",
        "This paper will touch on its feasibility in topic identification.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 presents a corpus-based language model and discuss how to train this model.",
        "Section 3 touches on topic identification in discourse.",
        "Section 4 shows a series of experiments based on the proposed model and discusses the results.",
        "Section 5 gives short remarks."

        "Brown and Yue (1983) pointed out there are two kinds of topics: one is sentence topic and the other is discourse topic.",
        "The discourse topic is usually the form of topic sentence.",
        "We postulate, further, that the noun in the topic sentence play important roles in the whole discourse.",
        "Thus nouns play the core part in the underlying language model.",
        "The associations of a noun with other nouns and verbs are supporting factors for it to be a topic.",
        "The importance of a specific verb or noun is defined by Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) (Salton, 1986b):",
        "where P is the number of documents in LOB Corpus, i.e. 500, 0(W) is the number of documents with word W, and c is a threshold value.",
        "LOB Corpus is a million-word collection of present-day British English texts.",
        "It contains 500 texts of approximately 2,000 words distributed over 15 text categories (Johansson, 1986).",
        "These categories include reportage, editorial, reviews, religion, skills, trades, popular lore, belles lettres, biography, essays, learned and scientific writings, fictions, humour, adventure and western fiction, love story, etc.",
        "That is to say, LOB Corpus is a balanced corpus.",
        "The tag set of LOB Corpus is based on the philosophy of that of Brown Corpus (Francis and Kucera, 1979), but some modifications are made.",
        "This is to achieve greater delicacy, while preserving comparability with the Brown Corpus.",
        "Those words that appear more than one half of the documents in LOB Corpus have negative log((P0(W))10(W)) shown below.",
        "The threshold values for nouns and verbs are set to 0.77 and 2.46 respectively.",
        "The two values are used to screen out the unimportant words, whose IDF values are negative.",
        "That is, their IDF values are reset to zero.",
        "The strength of one occurrence of a verb-noun pair or a noun-noun pair is computed by the importance of the words and their distances:",
        "where SNV denotes the strength of a noun-verb pair, SNN the strength of a noun-noun pair, and D(X,Y) represents the distance between X and Y.",
        "When i equals to k, the SNN(N,,Nk) is set to zero.",
        "Including the distance factor is motivated by the fact that the related events are usually located in the same texthood.",
        "This is the spatial locality of events in a discourse.",
        "The distance is measured by the difference between cardinal numbers of two words.",
        "We assign a cardinal number to each verb and noun in sentences.",
        "The cardinal numbers are kept continuous across sentences in the same paragraph.",
        "For example, With so many problems1 to solve2, it would be a great help3 to select4 some one problems which might be the key6 to all the others, and begin there.",
        "If there is any such key-problem8, then it is undoubtedly the problem9 of the unityio of the Gospeli I.",
        "There are three views12 of the Fourth Gospel13 which have been held14.",
        "Therefore, the cardinal number of problems, C(problems), equals to 1 and C(held) is 14.",
        "The distance can be defined to be",
        "The association norms of verb-noun and noun-noun pairs are summation of the strengths of all their occurrences in the corpus:",
        "where ANV denotes the association norm of a noun-verb pair, and ANN the association norm of a noun-noun pair.",
        "The less frequent word has a higher IDF value so that the strength SNV and SNN of one occurrence may be larger.",
        "However, the number of terms to be summed is smaller.",
        "Thus, the formulae IDF and ANV (ANN) are complementary.",
        "LOB Corpus of approximately one million words is used to train the basic association norms.",
        "They are based on different levels: the paragraph and sentence levels for noun-noun and noun-verb pairs respectively.",
        "Table 1 shows the statistics of the training corpus.",
        "The words with tags NC, NNU and NNUS and Ditto tags are not considered.",
        "Here NC means cited words, and NNU (NNUS) denotes abbreviated (plural) unit of measurement unmarked for number.",
        "Ditto tags are those words whose senses in combination differ from the role of the same words in other context.",
        "For example, \"as to\", \"each other\", and \"so as to\" (Johansson, 1986).",
        "Under the topic coherence postulation in a paragraph, we compute the connectivities of the nouns in each sentence with the verbs and nouns in the paragraph.",
        "For example, 439 verbs in LOB Corpus have relationships with the word \"problem\" in different degrees.",
        "Some of them are listed below in descending order by the strength.",
        "solve(225.21), face(84.64), specify(16.55), explain(6 .47), ... , fall(2.52), suppose(1.67), For the example in Section 1, the word \"problem\" and \"dislocation\" are coherent with the verbs and nouns in the discourse.",
        "The nouns with the strongest connectivity form the preferred topic set.",
        "Consider the interference effects.",
        "The constituents far apart have less relationship.",
        "Distance D(X,Y) is used to measure such effects.",
        "Assume there are m nouns and n verbs in a paragraph.",
        "The connective strength of a noun NI (1 i m) is defined to be:",
        "where CS denotes the connective strength, and PN and PV are parameters for CSNN and CSNV and PN+PV=1.",
        "The determination of PN and PV is via deleted interpolation (Jelinek, 1985).",
        "Using equation PN + PV = 1 and equation 9, we could derive PN and PV as equation 10 and equation 11 show.",
        "LOB corpus are separated into two parts whose volume ratio is 3:1.",
        "Both PN and PV are initialized to 0.5 and then are trained by using the 3/4 corpus.",
        "After the first set of parameters is generated, the remain 1/4 LOB corpus is run until PN and PV converge using equations 9, 10 and 11.",
        "Finally, the parameters, PN and PV, converge to 0.675844 and 0.324156 respectively."
