        "Several methods have been proposed to deal with anaphora resolution and prepositional phrase (PP) attachment phenomenon and separately, so that the literature is very abundant : for PPs see e.g., (Frazier and Fodor, 1979; Hobbs, 1990), and (Wilks and Huang, 1985), and for anaphora see e.g., (Carter, 1986; Reinhart, 1983) and (Sidner, 1983).",
        "However none of these methods has considered the way of dealing both phenomena in the same concrete system.",
        "We propose in this paper an algorithm that deals with both phenomena, in the same analyser.",
        "The anaphora module pertains to the recent methods, uses a set of resolution rules based on the focusing approach, see (Sidner, 1983).",
        "These rules are applied to the conceptual representation and their output is a set of candidate antecedents.",
        "Concerning the PPs, unattached prepositions involve empty or unfilled roles in the Conceptual Structures (CSs), expressed in a frame-based language (Zarri, 1992).",
        "The disambiguation procedure aims at filling the empty roles using attachment rules.",
        "This work was accomplished in the context of COBALT project (LRE 61-01 ), dealing with financial news.",
        "A detailed discussion about both procedures of anaphora resolution and PP attachment is largely developed in (Azzam, 1994)."

      "heading": "2 The algorithm",
      "text": [
        "Two of the main principles of the algorithm are : a) The algorithm is applied on the text sentence by sentence, i.e. the ambiguities of the previous sentences have already been considered (resolved or not).",
        "b) The anaphora procedure skips the resolution of a given anaphor when this anaphor is preceded by an unattached preposition.",
        "This is because the resolution rules may have an empty role as a parameter, due to this unattached preposition.",
        "The resolution of the anaphor is then postponed to the second phase of anaphora resolution.",
        "The proposed procedure is based on successive calls to the anaphora module and to the PP attachment module.",
        "The output of each call is a set of CSs that represent the intermediate results exchanged between each call and on which both modules operate in turn.",
        "The aim is to fill the unfilled roles in the CSs, due to anaphora or unattached PPs.",
        "To summarize the algorithm is:",
        "1) Apply the anaphora module first.",
        "2) Apply the PP attachment procedure.",
        "3) If some anaphorâ€¢are left unresolved, apply the anaphora module again.",
        "4) If there are still unattached PPs, apply the attachment procedure again.",
        "5) Repeat (3) and (4), until all PPs and anaphors are treated.",
        "The order in which the two modules are called is based on efficiency deduced from statistical data performed on COBALT corpuses.",
        "Three main cases are faced by the algorithm : a) When the anaphor occurs before a given preposition in the sentence, its resolution does not depend on where the preposition is to be attached (except for cataphors that are quite rare).",
        "In this",
        "case the anaphora module can be applied before the attachment procedure.",
        "The example 1 below shows that the resolution of the anaphoric pronoun that must be performed first and that the PP starting with of be attached later.",
        "(1) The sale of Credito was first proposed last August and that of BCI late last year.",
        "b) When the anaphor occurs after one or several unattached prepositions, it could be an intra-sentential anaphor (i.e. referring to an entity in the same sentence), then its resolution may depend on one of the previous prepositional phrases.",
        "In this case, the resolution of the anaphora is postponed to a next call of the anaphora module according to principle b) stated above.",
        "c) When the anaphor is included in a PP (particular case of b), PP attachment rules need semantic information about the \"object\" of the PP; when it is a pronoun, no semantic information is available, so that the attachment rules can not be applied.",
        "The anaphoric pronouns have to be resolved first, so as to determine what semantic class they re.",
        "fer to ; the PP attachment procedure can then be applied.",
        "When a sequence contains more than two such PPs, i.e., with anaphors as objects, the length of a cycle is more than 4."

      "text": [
        "The objective was to emphasise more than it has been done until now, the fact that PP attachment and anaphora resolution could interact in the same system in order to produce a complete conceptual analysis, instead of slowing down each other.",
        "The algorithm we proposed in this, paper, is independent of the used approaches in both anaphora and attachment modules.",
        "It concerns rather the way of managing the interaction between the two modules.",
        "Our actual work addresses more the problems inside each module.",
        "The attachment module has been implemented at 99%.",
        "Presently we are working on the extension of the anaphora module particularly to deal also with the anaphoric definite noun phrases."
