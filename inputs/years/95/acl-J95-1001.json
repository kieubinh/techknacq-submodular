        "Recent corpus-based work on word sense disambiguation explores the application of statistical pattern recognition procedures to lexical co-occurrence data from very large text databases.",
        "In this paper we argue for a linguistically principled approach to disambiguation, in which relevant contextual clues are narrowly defined, in syntactic and semantic terms, and in which only highly reliable clues are exploited.",
        "Statistical methods play a definite role in this work, helping to organize and analyze data, but the disambiguation method itself does not employ statistical data or decision criteria.",
        "This approach results in improved understanding of the disambiguation problem both in general and on a word-specific basis and leads to broadly applicable and nearly errorless clues to word sense.",
        "The approach is illustrated by an experiment discriminating among the senses of adjectives, which have been relatively neglected in work on sense disambiguation.",
        "In particular, the paper assesses the potential of nouns for discriminating among the senses of adjectives that modify them.",
        "This assessment is based on an empirical study of five of the most frequent ambiguous adjectives in English: hard, light, old, right, and short.",
        "About three-quarters of all instances of these adjectives can be disambiguated almost errorlessly by the nouns they modify or by the syntactic constructions in which they occur.",
        "Such disambiguation requires only simple rules, which can be automated easily.",
        "Furthermore, a small number of semantic attributes supply a compact means of representing the noun clues in a very few rules.",
        "Clues other than nouns are required when modified nouns are not useable.",
        "The sense of an ambiguous modified noun may be needed to determine the relevant semantic attribute for disambiguation of a target adjective; and other adjectives, verbs, and grammatical constructions all show evidence of high reliability, and sometimes of high applicability, when they stand in specific, well-defined syntactic relations to the ambiguous adjective.",
        "Some of these clues, however, may be hard to automate."

        "This paper is an application of corpus analysis to an issue in word sense disambiguation: to what extent adjectives' senses can be separated by the nouns they modify, or more generally, by the phrases they modify or take as complements.",
        "We are interested specifically in principled disambiguation – systematic interpretation using highly reliable inferences based on linguistically motivated features.",
        "The work is empirical, addressing five of the most common, broadly applicable adjectives in English: hard, light, old, right, and short.",
        "Nouns are intrinsically suited for principled disambiguation of adjectives.",
        "Most adjectives normally designate an attribute of an entity designated by the noun or noun",
        "phrase they modify.",
        "Often, one sense or group of senses designates an attribute that is much more typically relevant to the noun's referent.",
        "For example, when the adjective old characterizes a human being, as in old man or she is old, it usually means 'aged' – not 'used,' 'of long standing,' or 'former.'",
        "In such cases, the mutual relevance of the adjective and noun senses is content specific (semantic) rather than word specific (lexical).",
        "We presume that it is this semantic relation rather than a lexical association that is normally involved in disambiguation.'",
        "One of the issues to be addressed in disambiguation is the passage from word-specific evidence to conceptual representation, a problem that we do not pretend to have solved in this paper.",
        "In addition, we consider the syntactic constructions within which adjectives occur and through which the phrases or clauses they modify are determined.",
        "For example, some adjectives have senses that are not used predicatively; the use of such an adjective as a predicate rules out such senses.",
        "The syntactic clues we recognize are as reliable as the noun clues.",
        "Noun-based disambiguation of adjectives is of special interest because a selection among different attributes (adjective senses) is likely to be sensitive to the attribute bundles (noun senses) they characterize.",
        "It does turn out that a small number of semantic features of nouns do provide fairly high coverage and very high reliability in adjective sense discrimination.",
        "Noun-based disambiguation is a structured form of co-occurrence-based disambiguation, various forms of which are prominent in corpus-based work.",
        "In co-occurrence-based approaches, it is usual to take into account the entire set of words in the vicinity of a target (Maarek and Smadja 1989; Yarowsky 1992).",
        "Gale, Church, and Yarowsky (1992) demonstrate that high reliability and coverage are simultaneously attainable with such an approach.",
        "The type of work we are pursuing has the potential to be more readily interpretable, though it is more difficult to automate.",
        "We suspect that the success of the comparison of contexts in bulk is due in large part to the effect of a few highly structured types of clues, such as we examine, and in part to more diffuse clues of other types.",
        "We use statistical inference methods as tools for analyzing and attempting to understand the problem of disambiguation and the potential of resources such as modified nouns for solving this problem.",
        "Methodologically, our statistical analyses and our extraction of disambiguating features from the corpus are straightforward, with one exception: in order to be able to base inference on already disambiguated subcorpora, we had to devise a way to adjust for the bias brought into the sample by the criteria through which they had been disambiguated; the required formulas are presented and illustrated in the Appendix.",
        "The structure of the paper is as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we describe the notion of a word sense indicator; this defines the types of features we consider as clues for disambiguation generally, and how specifically we use nouns as clues to the recognition of adjective senses.",
        "In Section 3, we describe the type of data we use; by defining adjective senses in terms of the meanings of different antonyms, we can take advantage of a large database of examples for analysis, examples that are ideally disambiguated by the co-occurrence of adjectives and their antonyms in semantically concordant structures.",
        "Section 4 provides a detailed report on the structure and results of the investigation of noun-based disambiguation.",
        "Section 5 discusses more complex types of inference",
        "involved in some noun-based disambiguation and addresses the potential of other types of indicators for adjective senses."

        "Content words that have a close syntactic relation to one another are useful candidates for examination and are intuitively more likely to bear a close semantic relation than words that are near one another but are not related syntactically.",
        "One much-studied example is the semantic relation between a verb and its arguments (e.g., Boguraev et al.",
        "1989; Church and Hanks 1989; Braden-Harder 1991; Hindle and Rooth 1991).",
        "Discrimination among senses of adjectives based on the nouns they modify or of which they are predicated has been the subject of less intensive and systematic study.",
        "Determining the potential of this line of evidence is the focus of this paper.",
        "We do this by performing a noun-based disambiguation experiment.",
        "Certainly, some nouns are strongly associated with particular senses of some of the adjectives that modify them.",
        "This association can be illustrated for the ambiguous adjective old, which has senses roughly synonymous with aged, long existing, former, used, and obsolete, using sentences from our experimental corpus (see Section 4.1).",
        "Two of the nouns most frequently modified by old in general texts are man and house.",
        "Overwhelmingly, old is used in the sense 'aged (not young)' when it modifies man, e.g., in The man was very old and very frail, a widower.",
        "He was a strong old man: he had lived through forty-five years of those wretched casseroles, but she missed him already.",
        "\"Guilty!\"",
        "came the hoarse croaking sounds of the old men.",
        "In some sentences, in fact, this noun is the only real basis, within the sentence itself, for inferring the sense of old: The old man answered this time.",
        "\"Leave the other to the old man.\"",
        "\"All except the old man.\"",
        "Man, therefore, can be taken as a fairly good indicator of the 'aged' sense of old.",

        ".",
        ".",
        ".",
        "around the old Holton house he made many improvements.. .",
        "He saw the tractors come and tear down the old houses and plow up the land.. .",
        "When old modifies house, then, this is a good indication that old is being used in one of these senses.",
        "So man and house are reliably associated with different senses of old.",
        "We refer to man and house as indicators for the senses of old.",
        "More generally, a feature F (such as the modified noun man) that is associated with a target word T",
        "(such as the modifying adjective old) is an indicator for a sense S, (e.g., 'aged') of T if, when the feature is present, that sense S, is more likely than the other senses Si, j i.",
        "This statement is formalized in the Appendix.",
        "This characterization of the indicators for word senses also provides flexibility regarding sense definition.",
        "Not only does it not require a single assessment, once and for all, concerning what the senses of a word may be, it requires no commitment to the reality of word senses themselves, as classically construed (see Pustejovsky and Boguraev 1993).",
        "Disambiguation may be pursued relative to many distinct issues, e.g., grammatical class, functional role, document topic, or lexical translation equivalent; the entities to be discriminated are the effective \"senses\" being identified.",
        "In this paper, we disambiguate relative to a pair of word sense groups, operationally by disambiguating relative to sense-specific antonyms; an old man, for example, is a man who is not young, and an old house is a house that is not new.",
        "Such sense distinctions have some justification in terms of the semantic organization of adjectives (see Gross, Fischer, and Miller 1989).",
        "However, our purpose in choosing them was purely for convenience in designing an experiment useful for determining the potential of noun-based disambiguation of adjectives.",
        "The characterization of indicators is equally flexible with regard to the domain of its own applicability.",
        "It need not be assumed that all instances of the target word T are to be included in assessing the relative probabilities of different senses.",
        "In the experiment described here, we are determining the extent to which those senses of an adjective that are associated with one antonym can be distinguished from those associated with a different antonym according to the nouns that the target adjective modifies.",
        "We therefore discriminate between just these two sets of senses, which constitute the great majority of instances of the targets, and we exclude from both investigation and evaluation all instances in which the sense of the target does not fall in one of these two groups.",
        "We exclude all freezes from consideration as not being legitimate instances in which the adjectives actually have a definable sense (see footnote 1).",
        "In addition, we exclude the minority of instances that have definable senses that do not fall within these two groups.",
        "For example, short has a sense 'inadequate' that is related historically to its dimensional senses; however, this sense does not have a lexically specific antonym, whereas the dimensional senses do (long and tall)."

        "We adopted a different strategy, one that provided us with a large set of sentences in which target adjectives could be disambiguated automatically and with complete reliability.",
        "This strategy involved disambiguation of adjectives by their co-occurrence with sense-specific antonyms.",

        " as modifiers of different instances of the same noun reliably disambiguate that adjective.",

        "All the example sentences above involve one of these ten pairs, and they exemplify the concordance of the antonyms' senses.",

        "The following nouns were projected to show a preference for one or the other sense of the target adjectives that was statistically significant at the .05 level (nouns are in roman, classes in italic): hard–not easy: it, clauses hard–not soft: none light–not dark: none light–not heavy: cruiser, harness, load old–not new: proper names (of things), world, thing, car, way old–not young: man, people, proper names (of people), woman, proper names (of places), lady, you, wine, person, bull, he, I, one (animate pronoun) right–not left: hand right–not wrong: he, I, thing, way, what, clauses, answer, proper names (of people), act, country, decision, expert, masturbation, note, people, reason, technician, that, theory, you short–not long: term, syllable, hair, range, run, story short–not tall: none 4 When an adjective in a frozen noun phrase contributes no distinct meaning to the phrase (see footnote 1), it is excluded from consideration; such freezes should be found in the dictionary, and their identification in text is a separate problem.",
        "5 The total number of sentences containing the target word that were extracted to yield 100 such adjectival instances of the target was 160 for hard, 444 for light, 124 for old, 278 for right, and 147 for short.",
        "The statistical procedure that was used to identify these nouns as indicators is described in detail in the Appendix.",
        "The number of significant indicators recovered is quite variable, ranging from none for the 'not soft' sense of hard, the 'not dark' sense of light, and the 'not tall' sense of short, to 13 for the 'not young' sense of old and 20 for the 'not wrong' sense of right.",
        "At this point, we had extracted a small set of statistically significant nouns that are projected to be indicators for adjective senses in the random samples.",
        "We then identified each instance in these samples in which a target adjective modified a projected indicator and tested the agreement of the target's sense with that which the noun was projected to indicate.",
        "This procedure tests the sense specificity of the projected indicators in the 100-sentence samples.",
        "The results of this test appear in Table 1 under the heading Indicator Nouns.",
        "The indicators do turn out to discriminate as projected between target adjective senses, and they do so with 100% reliability.",
        "Given this result, the set of indicator nouns can be treated as the basis for a disambiguation procedure.",
        "The extent of applicability of such a procedure can be inferred from the Coverage column, which records the proportion of target adjectives that modify projected indicator nouns.",
        "Overall coverage is 26.6% (see Table 1), rather low for a disambiguation procedure.",
        "The amount of co-occurrence data available for inference has had a substantial effect on coverage.",
        "Five of the ten senses are represented by fewer than 100 co-occurrence sentences each, and only one of these five yields any coverage at all.",
        "The other five senses are represented by more than 100 sentences each, and every one provides some coverage of the 100-sentence samples.",
        "There is therefore every reason to believe that coverage would increase with a larger base for inference.",
        "While we found a good semantic matching of adjective senses with the indicators that were recovered from the co-occurrence sentences, the indicator selection depended on an arbitrarily selected 5% level of statistical significance.",
        "We therefore investigated the dependence of performance on the chosen significance level.",
        "This dependence is highlighted most clearly by comparing the performance of",
        "the statistically significant indicators, listed above, with that of the nouns from the subcorpora that are not significant as indicators of target sense.",
        "For this purpose, we therefore treated every noun from the co-occurrence sentences as an indicator of the sense which that noun is projected to favor in the sample sentences.",
        "The results are presented under All Nouns in Table 1.",
        "Coverage increased from 126 to 237 instances.",
        "The 111 newly covered instances are incorrectly assigned in only 7 cases; even when every noun from the co-occurrence sentences is treated as an indicator, reliability remains high (97.0%).",
        "The rather high reliability of even those nouns that are not statistically significant indicators of adjective sense suggests that in general text as well as in the co-occurrence sentences, most nouns are highly specific to the sense of their modifying adjectives.",
        "For example, not a single color word is a statistically significant indicator for the sense of light, although light blue, light brown, light gray, and light green all clearly use light in its 'not dark' sense.",
        "This example also illustrates that many of the individual nouns that we are treating as separate, independent cases actually manifest a smaller number of underlying semantic categories, e.g., color.",
        "Speakers' knowledge of language must somehow encode such cases, with patterns of use of individual nouns in relation to these adjectives emerging on the basis of that knowledge.",
        "A natural way to pursue the necessary revision is in terms of semantic attributes of these nouns, rather than in terms of the nouns themselves.",
        "We investigate this possibility, introspectively, in Section 4.4.",
        "This was already done to some extent when proper names were grouped together into classes.",
        "The modified noun is not always relevant to the process of disambiguation, and even when the noun is relevant, it is not always sufficient.",

        "short modifies sort ( – concrete) and was thus assigned the sense 'not long.'",

        "It is a cultural (and thus semantic) fact that wines and other nonanimate entities that undergo developmental changes and pass through maturational stages are treated as living things.",
        "Since the two instances of wine in the 100-sentence samples are of this sort, their old modifiers are properly assigned to 'not young'; we assigned them to 'not new' under a literal interpretation of – animate.",
        "The rules in Table 2 can be easily implemented.",
        "The approach presupposes that the natural language processing system within which it is applied includes a reliable, wide-coverage parser to determine the noun phrase modified by an adjective and the head of that noun phrase.",

        "Most of those used in this paper are already present in some available machine-readable dictionaries, such as the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English.",

        "We have found that a substantial proportion of adjectives can be disambiguated by the nouns they modify, largely on the basis of general semantic attributes characterizing those nouns.",
        "These attributes, being semantic, must relate in fact to noun senses and not to nouns per se.",
        "This issue is finessed, to some extent, in the projected indicator nouns and thus in our application of attributes based on them.",
        "Some attributes happen to apply to all senses of a given noun.",
        "For example, in the 100-sentence samples, course disambiguates short, though once it is used for 'path' and once for 'class,' because both senses are –concrete.",
        "Some indicator nouns were extracted, not because the attribute applies to all senses of these nouns, but because these nouns are used far more often in senses to which an indicator attribute applies than in those to which it does not apply.",
        "For example, people shows a statistically significant tendency to be associated with the 'aged' ('not young') senses of old (when people is the plural of person), as judged from the co-occurrence sentences, although one instance of the 'of long standing' ('not new') senses of old (when people meant 'ethnic group') was also found.",
        "In many instances in the 100-sentence samples, the noun modified by a target adjective was ambiguous with respect to one of the indicator attributes: an indicator attribute did characterize some of the noun's common senses, but not others.",
        "For example, the noun side is projected to occur equally often with each sense of right ('not left' 49.9%, 'not wrong' 50.1%).",
        "However, this noun has two broad classes of meanings: one refers to commitments on issues and is – concrete; the other refers to flanks and is +concrete.",
        "As expected on the basis of this semantic attribute, right usually means 'not left' when it modifies side in its (locational) sense 'flank,' but virtually always means 'not wrong' when modifying side in its commitment sense.",
        "The sense of side is therefore a more reliable indicator of the sense of right than is the noun itself.",
        "If these nouns are disambiguated with respect to the relevant attribute, reliability can be increased, as in the case of right side.",
        "Coverage will increase as well.",
        "Some nouns have two or more common senses that disagree in the value of relevant attributes and thus were not recovered as indicator nouns; their senses might well be reliable indicator features.",
        "Disagreements in the value of a semantic attribute for a given noun can even be systematic.",
        "Any noun N with sense S can be used to mean 'a type of S,' as with family doctor in",
        "When types are construed as – concrete, as when referring to roles, such uses are specific to 'not new' senses of old (and to 'not wrong' senses of right).",
        "Thus, any noun or semantic attribute that is associated with the alternative senses of these adjectives would be wrongly interpreted when a 'type of S' usage of the noun is not recognized.",
        "Another widely pertinent example is the more complex ambiguity in the reference of modified nouns for roles or relationships.",
        "A role noun almost always refers to an individual (+animate) who stands in that relationship to another, as in all the example sentences cited below; for example, when the nuns, new and old, filed out of the cloister, it was a set of persons and not of relationships who did so.",
        "The adjective, however, may apply to that individual (a +animate noun sense) or to the role itself (a – animate noun sense).",

        "On the contrary, these nuns, young and old, were invariably cheerful and happy, almost gay and full of childish fun and laughter.. .",
        "There is an inherent ambiguity concerning the relation of the adjective old to its noun: the referent of the noun is an individual (which is +animate), but it is an associated noun sense to which the adjective applies (which may be +animate or –animate) that strictly determines the sense of old.",
        "In the 100-sentence samples, when old modifies a role noun, it always applies in its 'aged' sense to the individual and in its 'former' sense to the role.",
        "Some role/relationship nouns are used overwhelmingly in their role senses (as with friend) or in their personal senses (as with doctor).",
        "Otherwise, inferring the correct sense for old involves a resolution of the function of the noun.",
        "For example, an old forest is 'not new' if it has existed for a great period of time and 'not young' if it is in an advanced stage of development in the life cycle of forests (cf., the discussion of wine in Section 4.4.2).",
        "This semantic ambiguity in the noun sense to which the adjective applies can therefore be resolved by the same rules formulated for unambiguous cases, once the relevant noun sense is identified.",
        "How to access the relevant noun sense is an unsolved problem: the noun's direct referent is an individual, whereas the semantic structure entailed by the noun is a semantic network, and the adjective may apply to the network's noun sense nodes rather than to the noun referent itself.",
        "The utility and elegance of such semantic representations is suggested by linguistic discussions on lexical semantics.",
        "They have been used with notable success by Fillmore and Atkins (1991), who exploit the intricacies of such networks in a now-classic account of the semantics of risk, with different nodes of the network providing the locus of what might be distilled as the word's distinct senses.",
        "Similar network representations are adopted and implemented in restricted domains in several computational models (e.g., Sowa 1986).",
        "The semantics of noun senses therefore relate more specifically and directly to adjective senses than do nouns themselves; in fact, 38 (30%) of the 125 cases not covered by the rules of Table 2 are resolved when these broader semantic structures are used.",
        "In most of these cases, noun senses themselves supplied the attributes used by the rules of Table 2 to disambiguate adjectives.",
        "In other cases, such as role nouns, with more complex semantic structures, we are able to resolve the semantic relation of adjective and noun, but this ability cannot be captured in rules as simple as those of Table 2."

        "This was systematically true for relationship nouns modified by old.",
        "Similarly, the adjective light can refer either to weight or to color in modifying most concrete nouns.",

        "The effectiveness of one such alternative has already been demonstrated – the special case of antonymic adjectives.",
        "In the special constructions discussed in Section 3 and, in particular, when they modify the same noun, they disambiguate one another with almost perfect reliability.",
        "Consider, for example, the sentence A piece will seldom bake uniformly, even with the most loving attention – that is, it will vary from light to very dark.. .",

        "piece (of food being baked).",
        "Light pieces of food may be either 'not dark' or 'not heavy,' so the noun provides no substantial aid to interpretation.",
        "However, the phrase from light to dark secures the intended sense of light.",
        "Verb senses can relate systematically to adjective senses, because adjectives often designate attributes pertinent to the application of the verbal action to/by the referent of the modified object/subject noun.",
        "Verbs are therefore useful to the interpretation of adjectives modifying subject or object nouns.",
        "Returning to the difficult case of light, one of the 7 sentences in which an error was made when all nouns were treated as indicators (see Section 4.3) is A spatula is also used for lifting light pieces of food.. .",
        "In this sentence, the head noun pieces is irrelevant, essentially empty semantically.",
        "The critical noun is food, but it is not a directly usable indicator; light food may be either 'not heavy,' as in this sentence, or 'not dark,' as in the previous example.",
        "It is instead the verb lifting that provides the best sentence-internal indication of the 'weight' sense of light in the example under consideration.",
        "The 5 APHB sentences that refer to the lifting of a light object all involve the 'not heavy' sense of light.",
        "This is not a logical requirement – both dark and heavy objects are also said to be lifted.",
        "But the weight of an object is intrinsically relevant and its color irrelevant to the lifting of object; a reference to the lifting of a light N in the 'not dark' sense is likely to be misconstrued unless additional cues to interpretation are provided.",
        "Similar results are found for semantically similar verbs.",
        "Thus, carry disambiguates light in Furniture movers, for example, carry light objects in their hands.",
        "whereas the modified noun is of no help.",
        "Accordingly, physically supports is a semantic attribute of some indicator verbs for the 'not heavy' sense of light.",
        "In some cases when a noun or even a noun sense is consistent with more than one sense of the target adjective that modifies it, a default target sense may be reliably inferred so long as there is no strong counter-evidence in the immediate context.",
        "Old doctor, for example, means 'aged doctor' in 28 of 30 instances in our corpus.",
        "The other 2 cases are both for old family doctor.",
        "In one, the sentence itself makes it clear that a generic 'type of doctor' sense was intended (see Section 5.1).",
        "Similarly, old means 'former' in the sentence I know that the old family doctor, Dr. Schlomm, always told Manya she could be stabilized on medication, that she could be kept under control.",
        "as shown by the immediately following sentence: So did her present doctor.",
        "A more complex example of default inference is provided by right as a modifier of side.",
        "The commitment sense of side strongly favors the correctness sense of right, whereas the locational senses of side favor the directional senses of right.",
        "However, even with the locational sense of side, 'not wrong' is not an anomalous usage.",
        "Compare, for example, the following sentences from the APHB Corpus: They were hiding behind the big oak on the left side of the road.",
        "In the face of such examples, it becomes difficult to interpret the adjective in such sentences as But the car, now on the right [not left] side of the road, was too late to veer away from the second tire.. .",
        "He was on the right [not wrong] side of the screen, he had an excellent day's work behind him, and in two minutes' time he would hear Bing Crosby sing.",
        "except with respect to the broader discourse context.",
        "In our data, locational senses of side always involve the directional sense of right in right side of unless there is decisive evidence to the contrary in the same sentence or in the immediately surrounding discourse.",
        "In many of the directional sense uses, we find no overt clue within the sentence or the immediate discourse to determine the sense; it appears to be simply the assumed interpretation when no specific information contradicts it.",
        "In contrast, for each of the (6 out of 45) instances in which a correctness sense of right modifies a locational sense of side in right side of, there is something explicit in the near context, usually in the same sentence.",
        "For example, the ambiguous case of the right side of the screen, above, is resolved by a preceding sentence (two short sentences intervene): Across the centre of the hall hung a screen, and on this screen was being projected a motion picture; half the men had to see the picture back to front, because they had to look at it from the back [the wrong side] of the screen, but nobody minded that very much.",
        "The directional sense of right cannot be construed as a general default, since the correctness sense is far more common overall.",
        "Evidently, the locational sense of side of is so powerful a semantic indicator for the directional sense of right that people do not use right side of in other senses without providing substantial countervaling evidence for the sense.",
        "Relative to a given indicator noun, then, it makes sense to think of adjective disambiguation in terms of default interpretations.",
        "Some noun-based disambiguation of adjectives involves the noun's functionality rather than its intrinsic semantic attributes; many such nouns relate to relevant attributes of indicator verbs.",
        "The adjective light, when modifying a +concrete noun, is a case in point.",
        "Both weight and color characterize all +concrete entities.",
        "In fact, however, we can reliably determine the sense of light in a number of these cases.",
        "Three nouns in the co-occurrence sentences emerged as significant indicators for the 'not heavy' sense of light – cruiser, load, and harness.",
        "It is the weight and not the color of a load that is functionally relevant; the thickness and thus weight of a harness that bears on the speed and load-bearing potential of the draught animals fitted with it; and the heaviness of a vessel that is relevant to the speed, ease of handling, load-bearing potential, and imperviousness to damage that is pertinent to military cruisers.",
        "In fact, if it were necessary to specify such entities as being light in color, we would expect that their functional specificity for lightness in weight would lead to the use of a more specific qualifier, such as light-colored, rather than simply light.",
        "Semantic attributes such as carried things would characterize nouns such as load, e.g., burden, cargo, or freight, and load-bearing equipment or load-relevant equipment would characterize nouns such as",
        "harness and cruiser.",
        "In the sample of sentences containing light, the following might be subsumed under such attributes: aircraft, brigade, car, cart, defense, guard, horse, industry, package, shell, tank, and weight.",
        "Some of these, such as shell and tank, have meanings to which the load-bearing issue is not relevant, though in the case of tank the application of the adjective light does appear to restrict its referent to the military vehicle.",
        "Others, such as car, involve issues of fashion and decoration to which color and thus darkness is potentially relevant as well, although the 5 instances of light car(s) in our corpus do refer to weight (with dark car(s) referring to a darkened interior).",
        "But suitably constrained either to subsets in which decoration is not a functional value (e.g., military/industrial equipment) or by treating feature combinations that include, e.g., – decorative relevance, it would be possible if not ideal to handle such nouns in terms of attribute values.",
        "Thus, some nouns can be disambiguated by relatively narrowly defined semantic classes, such as military/industrial equipment, and with high reliability, leading to something close to lexicalized noun phrases, e.g., light cruiser or light industry.",
        "But it is in fact the functional relevance of heaviness versus darkness in the context of its use that is actually involved.",
        "A more complex example is provided by those indicators for the 'not long' sense of short that are types of texts or utterances – book, manuscript, monologue, note, phrase, poem, speech, stanza, story, and syllable.",
        "These, like +time period, are largely subsumable under the – concrete feature, but there are also +concrete instances of some of these nouns, such as book, that still select the 'not long' sense of short.",
        "In these instances, it is not a physical dimension of the item that is short, and reference to such dimensions in the case of book relates instead to the 'not tall' sense of short.",
        "Superficially, this might support the pertinence of a special attribute, textual, for disambiguating short.",
        "However, the 'not long' characterization of shortness of texts refers explicitly or implicitly to the duration of the performance (e.g., reading or reciting) of the text.",
        "Accordingly, it is the time period attribute that would appear to be involved in this case – an attribute of activities that constitute the typical use of texts, not an attribute of texts themselves.",
        "The relationship involved in this case is comparable to that discussed by Pustejovsky and Boguraev (1993), in which a single sense of fast relates speed of vehicle motion in both fast car and fast highway via the qualia structure of lexical entries for highway and car.",
        "Accordingly, although most instances of nouns for text types can disambiguate short by being – concrete, the principled basis for disambiguating the adjective entails a more complex type of inference than simple characterization of semantic attributes of the modified noun itself."

      "text": [
        "For the adjectives and adjective senses under study, it has been demonstrated that the noun modified by an adjective provides, in most cases, an extremely reliable indication of the sense of that adjective.",
        "General semantic attributes of the modified noun provide equally reliable and more widely applicable indications of adjective meanings.",
        "These attributes are conceptually relevant and compact ways of representing the semantic relation between adjectives and their modified nouns.",
        "When the noun is such that it does not disambiguate the adjective, other words in other specific relations often provide this information.",
        "Once again, these words reflect semantic classes rather than specific lexical items and provide a compact and meaningful semantic characterization of the relation of the adjective to the related word class.",
        "This work also supports the view that a small number of close syntactic relations channel much of the semantic interpretation involved in disambiguation, at least in the case of sense dichotomies in adjectives.",
        "We suspect that when this highly struc",
        "tured type of evidence is removed, the more diffuse kinds of clues implicit in mass contextual comparison approaches still have a principled role in disambiguation, e.g., by providing a generalized feel for the overall topical preferences of target senses.",
        "The data on which this study is based were analyzed statistically, and our results were summarized quantitatively.",
        "These analyses, however, were not provided in anticipation of the creation of statistical procedures for automated word sense disambiguation, but rather to help us to explore and to establish a property of language – that general semantic attributes of noun senses correlate with the senses of the adjectives that modify these nouns.",
        "The phenomenon itself can now be formulated in nonquanti-tative terms.",
        "In addressing or utilizing this phenomenon, corpora remain quite useful, supplying examples of word use that can be used for insight and serious discourse analysis.",
        "The main goals of this paper were to investigate conceptual issues in adjective disambiguation.",
        "The above results, however, may provide a basis for a useful core component of an automated procedure that disambiguates adjectives, with the rest to be covered by an auxiliary procedure.",
        "This core component's coverage of three-quarters of adjective instances is lower than can be attained by other approaches, even those with quite high reliability.",
        "Nonetheless, such a core has practical advantages: when it is applicable, it is virtually errorless; and if there are errors, it is known where they will be concentrated – in the remaining quarter of cases, those resolved by the auxiliary procedure.",
        "The full procedure can then attain a 97-98% reliability level even if the auxiliary procedure has only 90% reliability.",
        "The results of this study need to be extended in several ways.",
        "First, they should be extended to cover a substantial number of adjectives.",
        "Any such enterprise always leads to improved understanding, but there is also reason to believe that the results will be comparable to those we report.",
        "The five adjectives investigated in this paper represent a fair range in terms of difficulty: the relations between the pairs of senses range from barely distinct (short), to interrelated in complex and sometimes subtle ways (old), to semantically orthogonal (light).",
        "These adjectives are among the most frequent in English and, correspondingly, are applicable to a variety of nouns, so they may be on average somewhat more useful than most for investigating the interpretation of adjectives based upon nouns.",
        "It is of course important to investigate types of sense discriminations other than the antonymically defined pairs that were imposed by the design of this study.",
        "The results should also be extended to investigate more fully the contributions of other types of syntactic relations of adjectives.",
        "Although it appears that verb-based disambiguation of adjectives can be formulated in the same way as noun-based disambiguation, we have not yet systematically studied the contribution of verbs.",
        "As in the case of nouns, we expect the appropriate representation to be in terms of semantic classes rather than sets of words (cf. Levin 1993).",
        "It would also be useful to address the possible contribution of adjectives other than the sense-specific antonyms.",
        "Finally, the results need to be extended beyond the class of adjectives.",
        "Most directly, nouns are probably as reliably disambiguated by adjectives as adjectives are by nouns."
