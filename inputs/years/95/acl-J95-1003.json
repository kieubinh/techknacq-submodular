        "The primary aim of our project is the development and the assessment of an interface that combines the positive features of the language mode and the action mode of interaction (Claassen et al.",
        "1990).",
        "EDWARD (Huls and Bos 1993; Bos et al.",
        "1994) integrates a graphical graph-editor called Gr2 (Bos in press) and a Dutch natural language (NL) dialogue system called DoNaLD (Claassen and Huls 1991).",
        "One of the application domains involves a file system environment with documents, authors, a garbage container, and so on.",
        "The user can interact with EDWARD by manipulating the graphical representation of the file system (a directed graph), by menus, by written natural or formal language, or by combinations of these.",
        "EDWARD responds in NL (either written or spoken) and graphics.",
        "In this paper we will go into the semantic and pragmatic processes involved in the referent resolution of deictic and deixis-related expressions by EDWARD.",
        "(Syntactic issues will not be discussed here; for these, see Claassen and Huls 1991.)",
        "The proper interpretation of deictic expressions depends on the identity of the speaker(s) and the audience, the time of speech, the spatial location of speaker and audience at the time of speech, and non-linguistic communicative acts like facial expressions and eye, hand, and body movements.",
        "Lyons (1977, p. 637), provides the following definition of deixis:",
        "the location and identification of persons, objects, events, processes and activities being talked about, or referred to, in relation to the spatiotemporal context created and sustained by the act of utterance and the participation in it, typically, of a single speaker and at least one addressee.",
        "In the context of the present paper, we distinguish three types of deixis: personal, temporal, and spatial deixis.",
        "Personal deixis involves first and second-person pronouns (e.g., I, we, and you).",
        "Temporal deixis is realized by the tense system of a language (e.g., he lives in Amsterdam) and by temporal modifiers (e.g., in an hour).",
        "Temporal deixis relates the time of speech to the relation(s) expressed by the utterance.",
        "Spatial deixis involves demonstratives or other referring expressions that are produced in combination with a pointing gesture (e.g., this/ file, in which / represents the pointing gesture).",
        "In the present paper, most attention will be given to spatial deixis.",
        "Deictic expressions can be contrasted with anaphors.",
        "Unlike deictic expressions, anaphors can be interpreted without regard to the spatiotemporal context of the speaking situation.",
        "Their interpretation depends merely on the linguistic expressions that precede them in the discourse.",
        "For example, this is an anaphor in Print the file about dialogue systems.",
        "Delete this.",
        "In many languages, the words used in deictic expressions are also used in anaphoric expressions.",
        "Deictic and anaphoric expressions frequently cause problems for NL analysis.",

        "(1989) describe XTRA, a German NL interface to expert systems, currently applied to supporting the user's filling out a tax form.",
        "XTRA uses a dialogue memory and a tax-form hierarchy to interpret multimodal referring expressions.",
        "Data from the dialogue memory and from gesture analysis are combined (e.g., by taking the intersection of two sets of potential referents suggested by these information sources).",
        "Neal and Shapiro (1991) describe a research prototype called CUBRICON, which combines NL (English) with graphics.",
        "The application domain is military tactical air control.",
        "Like XTRA, CUBRICON uses two models to interpret deictic expressions: an attentional discourse focus space representation (adapted from Grosz and Sidner 1986) and a display model.",
        "Stock (1991) describes ALFresco, a prototype built for the exploration of frescoes, using NL (Italian) and pictures.",
        "For referent resolution in ALFresco, topic spaces (Grosz, 1978) are combined with HajFeova's (1987) approach, in which entities are assumed to \"fade away\" slowly.",

        "In Shoptalk too, the interpretation process is based on the approach of Grosz and Sidner.",
        "We believe that the fact that these systems use two separate mechanisms for modeling linguistic and perceptual context is a disadvantage over the use of only one mechanism for referent resolution.",
        "From a computational and an engineering position, one mechanism that handles both deictic and anaphoric expressions in the same way is preferable.",
        "We will (try to) show how both deictic and anaphoric references can be resolved using a single model.",
        "We have used the framework presented by Alshawi (1987) to develop a general context model that is able to represent linguistic as well as non-linguistic effects on the dialogue context.",
        "This model is used, in conjunction with a knowledge base, by EDWARD's interpretation component to solve deictic and anaphoric referring expressions.",

        "We have collected some indications about the quality of the Context Model for referent resolution we implemented in our multimodal user interface EDWARD.",
        "We have compared the capabilities of this model with two alternative models, both empirically, using a test set of 125 user-generated referring expressions obtained from interactions with EDWARD and, analytically, studying the inherent limitations that follow from the models' designs.",
        "On empirical grounds we conclude that the Simplistic Model, in which anaphoric expressions are considered to refer to the last mentioned semantically appropriate object, is inadequate.",
        "Though it performed, by far, better than we anticipated, too often the wrong object is taken to be the referent.",
        "The quality of the other alternative model for referent resolution, the Grosz and Sidner Model, seems to compare to the quality of EDWARD's Context Model.",
        "As we understand the Grosz and Sidner Model, it processed 124 referring expressions correctly (but this may be inaccurate, since we do not have an implemented version of the model at our disposal).",
        "Furthermore, it will have problems with interpreting cataphora properly.",
        "EDWARD's Context Model performed well on all 125 test expressions, but cataphora will also be misinterpreted.",
        "The Grosz and Sidner Model has a much broader scope.",
        "In particular, their model addresses the notion of discourse coherence.",
        "It would be interesting to explore how the insights of Grosz and Sidner with respect to discourse coherence can be used to elaborate EDWARD's Context Model to render it able to deal with subdialogues.",
        "EDWARD's Context Model differs significantly from the Grosz and Sidner Model from an engineering and computational point of view.",
        "The Context Model is relatively simplistic.",
        "EDWARD never needs to figure out the type of an expression that is being analyzed: for all referring expressions, the most salient referent is chosen.",
        "Moreover, entities and relations are handled in a uniform fashion, and syntactic as well as perceptual influences on salience are incorporated into one model.",
        "The general applicability of the technique adds to its beauty.",
        "The language generation component uses it as well.",
        "Both components use the role-filler class restrictions, the cardinality information, and the role-set restrictions from the knowledge base, and they use the same CFs, with the same initial significance weights, and the same decay functions of the Context Model.",
        "Grosz and Sidner propose a complex system of rules.",
        "In the Context Model, on the other hand, influences originating from different levels and types of processing are modeled by individual CFs, which are created and managed locally, i.e., by these processes themselves.",
        "As a result, the influences on an object's salience are represented distributed and independently, which is attractive from a computational point of view.",
        "Furthermore, the addition of new CFs, which would require explicit detailed changes in Grosz and Sidner's rules, will be easier because the procedures that use the salience information can stay exactly the same.",
        "Though our empirical and analytical studies were only small and provide no firm basis for drawing conclusions, we do find indications that the quality of EDWARD's Context Model compares to a large extent to the quality of the more complex Grosz and Sidner Model.",
        "Therefore, if one is in need of a referent resolution model for a particular",
        "NL interpreter in a setting where subdialogues are rare, we think that EDWARD's Context Model is a good alternative to the complex rule system of Grosz and Sidner.",
        "The model is easy to build, to maintain, and to expand, and it is computationally fairly inexpensive."
