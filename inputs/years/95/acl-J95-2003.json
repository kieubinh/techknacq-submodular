        "It demonstrates that the attentional state properties modeled by centering can account for these differences.",
        "Preface Our original paper (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1983) on centering claimed that certain entities mentioned in an utterance were more central than others and that this property imposed constraints on a speaker's use of different types of referring expressions.",
        "Centering was proposed as a model that accounted for this phenomenon.",
        "We argued that the coherence of discourse was affected by the compatibility between centering properties of an utterance and choice of referring expression.",

        "This paper presents an initial attempt to develop a theory that relates focus of attention, choice of referring expression, and perceived coherence of utterances within a discourse segment.",
        "The research described here is a further development of several strands of previous research.",
        "It fits within a larger effort to provide an overall theory of discourse structure and meaning.",
        "In this section we describe the larger research context of this work and then briefly discuss the previous work that led to it.",
        "Centering fits within the theory of discourse structure developed by Grosz and Sidner (1986).",
        "Grosz and Sidner distinguish among three components of discourse structure: a linguistic structure, an intentional structure, and an attentional state.",
        "At the level of linguistic structure, discourses divide into constituent discourse segments; an embedding relationship may hold between two segments.",
        "The intentional structure comprises intentions and relations among them.",
        "The intentions provide the basic rationale for the discourse, and the relations represent the connections among these intentions.",
        "Attentional state models the discourse participants' focus of attention at any given point in the discourse.",
        "Changes in attentional state depend on the intentional structure and on properties of the utterances in the linguistic structure.",
        "Each discourse segment exhibits both local coherence – i.e., coherence among the utterances in that segment – and global coherence – i.e., coherence with other segments in the discourse.",
        "Corresponding to these two levels of coherence are two components of attentional state; the local level models changes in attentional state within a discourse segment, and the global level models attentional state properties at the intersegmental level.",
        "Grosz and Sidner argue that global coherence depends on the intentional structure.",
        "They propose that each discourse has an overall communicative purpose, the discourse purpose (DP); and each discourse segment has an associated intention, its discourse segment purpose (DSP).",
        "The DP and DSP are speaker intentions; they are correlates at the discourse level of the intentions Grice argued underlay utterance meaning (Grice 1969).",
        "If a discourse is multi-party (e.g., a dialogue), then the DSP for a given segment is an intention of the conversational participant who initiates that segment.",
        "Lochbaum (1994) employs collaborative plans (Grosz and Kraus 1993) to model intentional structure, and is thus able to integrate intentions of different participants.",
        "Satisfaction of the DSPs contributes to the satisfaction of the DP.",
        "Relationships between DSPs provide the basic structural relationships for the discourse; embeddings in the linguistic structure are derived from these relationships.",
        "The global coherence of a discourse depends on relationships among its DP and DSPs.",
        "Grosz and Sidner model the global-level component of the attentional state with a stack; pushes and pops of focus spaces on the stack depend on intentional relationships.",
        "This paper is concerned with local coherence and its relationship to attentional state at the local level.",
        "Centering is proposed as a model of the local-level component of attentional state.",
        "We examine the interactions between local coherence and choices of referring expressions, and argue that differences in coherence correspond in part to the different demands for inference made by different types of referring expressions,",
        "given a particular attentional state.",
        "We describe how the attentional state properties modeled by centering can account for these differences.",
        "Three pieces of previous research provide the background for this work.",
        "Grosz (1977) defined two levels of focusing in discourse: global and immediate.",
        "Participants were said to be globally focused on a set of entities relevant to the overall discourse.",
        "These entities may either have been explicitly introduced into the discourse or sufficiently closely related to such entities to be considered implicitly in focus (Grosz 1981).",
        "In contrast, immediate focusing referred to a more local focusing process – one that relates to identifying the entity that an individual utterance most centrally concerns.",
        "Sidner (1979) provided a detailed analysis of immediate focusing, including a distinction between the current discourse focus and potential foci.",
        "She gave algorithms for tracking immediate focus and rules that stated how the immediate focus could be used to identify the referents of pronouns and demonstrative noun phrases (e.g., \"this party,\" \"that party\").",
        "Joshi and Kuhn (1979) and Joshi and Weinstein (1981) provided initial results on the connection between changes in immediate focus and the complexity of inferences required to integrate a representation of the meaning of an individual utterance into a representation of the meaning of the discourse of which it was a part.",
        "To avoid confusion with previous uses of the term \"focus\" in linguistics, they introduced the centering terminology.",
        "Their notions of \"forward-looking\" and \"backward-looking\" centers correspond approximately to Sidner's potential foci and discourse focus.",
        "In all of this work, focusing, whether global or immediate, was seen to function to limit the inferences required for understanding utterances in a discourse.",
        "Grosz and Sidner were concerned with the inferences needed to interpret anaphoric expressions of various sorts (e.g. pronouns, definite descriptions, ellipsis).",
        "They used focusing to order candidates; as a result the need for search was greatly reduced and the use of inference could be restricted to determining whether a particular candidate was appropriate given the embedding utterance interpretation.",
        "Joshi, Kuhn, and Weinstein were concerned with reducing the inferences required to integrate utterance meaning into discourse meaning.",
        "They used centering to determine an almost monadic predicate representation of an utterance in discourse; they then used this representation to reduce the complexity of inference.",
        "In this paper, we generalize and clarify certain of Sidner's results, but adopt the \"centering\" terminology.",
        "We also abstract from Sidner's focusing algorithm to specify constraints on the centering process.",
        "We consider the relationship between coherence and inference load and examine how both interact with attentional state and choices in linguistic expression.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we briefly describe the phenomena motivating the development of centering that this paper aims to explain.",
        "Section 3 provides the basic definitions of centers and related definitions needed to present the theoretical claims of the paper.",
        "In Section 4, we state the main properties of the centering framework and the major claims of centering theory.",
        "In Section 5, we discuss several factors that affect centering constraints and govern the centering rules given in Section 6.",
        "In Section 7, we discuss applications of the rules and their ability to explain several discourse coherence phenomena.",
        "In Section 8, we briefly outline the properties of an underlying semantic framework that are required by centering.",
        "Finally, in Section 9 we conclude with a brief comparison of centering with the research that preceded it and a summary of research that expands on Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1986).",
        "In particular, Section 9 provides references to subsequent investigations of additional factors that control centering and examinations of its cross-linguistic applicability and empirical validity."

        "Discourses are more than mere sequences of utterances.",
        "For a sequence of utterances to be a discourse, it must exhibit coherence.",
        "In this paper, we investigate linguistic and attentional state factors that contribute to coherence among utterances within a discourse segment.",
        "These factors contribute to the difference in coherence between the following two discourse segments:2",
        "(1) a. John went to his favorite music store to buy a piano.",
        "b.",
        "He had frequented the store for many years.",

        "d. It was closing just as John arrived.",
        "Discourse (1) is intuitively more coherent than Discourse (2).",
        "This difference may be seen to arise from different degrees of continuity in what the discourse is about.",
        "Discourse (1) centers around a single individual, describing various actions he took and his reactions to them.",
        "In contrast, Discourse (2) seems to flip back and forth among several different entities.",
        "More specifically, the initial utterance (a) in each segment could begin a segment about an individual named 'John' or one about John's favorite music store or one about the fact that John wants to buy a piano.",
        "Whereas Discourse (1) is clearly about John, Discourse (2) has no single clear center of attention.",
        "Utterance (2b) seems to be about the store.",
        "If a reader inferred that utterance (2a) was about John, then that reader would perceive a change in the entity which the discourse seems to be about in going from (2a) to (2b); on the other hand, if the reader took (2a) to be about the store then in going to (2b), there is no change.",
        "In either case, in utterance (2c) John seems to be central, requiring a shift from utterance (2b), while the store becomes central again in utterance (2d), requiring yet another shift.",
        "This changing of 'aboutness' (in fact, flipping it back and forth) makes discourse (2) less coherent than discourse (1).",
        "Discourses (1) and (2) convey the same information, but in different ways.",
        "They differ not in content or what is said, but in expression or how it is said.",
        "The variation in 'aboutness' they exhibit arises from different choices of the way in which they express the same propositional content.",
        "The differences can only be explained, however, by looking beyond the surface form of the utterances in the discourse; different types of referring expressions and different syntactic forms make different inference demands on a hearer or reader.",

        "Thus, the focus of our investigation is on interactions among choice of referring expression, attentional state, the inferences required to determine the interpretation of an utterance in a discourse segment, and coherence.",
        "Pronouns and definite descriptions are not equivalent with respect to their effect on coherence.",
        "We conjecture that this is so because they engender different inferences on the part of a hearer or reader.",
        "In the most pronounced cases, the wrong choice will mislead a hearer and force backtracking to a correct interpretation.' The following variations of a discourse sequence illustrate this problem and provide additional evidence for our conjecture.",

        "It is only when one gets to the word \"sick\" that it is clear that it must be Tony and not Terry who is sick, and hence that the pronoun in utterance (e) refers to Tony not Terry.",

        "Here too we conjecture that the manner, i.e., linguistic form, in which a discourse represents a particular propositional content can affect the resources required by any procedure that processes that discourse.",
        "We use the phrase inference load placed upon the hearer to refer to the resources required to extract information from a discourse because of particular choices of linguistic expression used in the discourse.",
        "We conjecture that one psychological reflex of this inference load is a difference in perceived coherence among discourses that express the same propositional content using different linguistic forms.",
        "One of the tasks a hearer must perform in processing a discourse is to identify the referents of noun phrases in the discourse.",
        "It is commonly accepted, and is a hypothesis under which our work on centering proceeds, that a hearer's determination of noun phrase reference involves some process of inference.",
        "Hence a particular claim of centering theory is that the resource demands of this inference process are affected by the form of expression of the noun phrase.",

        "The same sentence uttered in different discourse situations may have different centers.",
        "Centers are thus discourse constructs.",

        "That is, the centers of an utterance in general, and the backward-looking center specifically, are determined on the basis of a combination of properties of the utterance, the discourse segment in which it occurs, and various aspects of the cognitive state of the participants of that discourse.",
        "Thus, for a semantic theory to support centering, it must provide an adequate basis for computing the realization relation.",

        "They are principles that must be elicited from the study of discourse itself.",
        "An initial formulation of some such principles is given in Section 8.6 The forward-looking centers of Un depend only on the expressions that constitute that utterance; they are not constrained by features of any previous utterance in the segment.",

        "Some recent psycholinguistic evidence suggests that the syntactic role in Un+i may determine this choice (Gordon, Grosz, and Gilliom 1993).",

        "6 In the examples in this paper, we will be concerned with the realization relationship that holds between a center and a singular definite noun phrase; i.e., cases where an NP directly realizes a center c. Several extensions to the theory presented here are needed to handle plural, quantified noun phrases and indefinites.",

        "The case is analogous for pair of retentions and a pair of shifts.",

        "It is not merely that utterances themselves contain only partial information, but that it may only be subsequent to an utterance that sufficient information is available for computing a unique interpretation.",
        "No matter how rich a model of context one has, it will not be possible to fully constrain the interpretation of an utterance when it occurs.",

        "Additional utterances may provide further constraints on an interpretation, and sequences of utterances may not be coherent, if they do not allow for a consistent choice of interpretation.",

        "The Cb(25b) and the Cb(26b) are both directly realized by the anaphoric element \"he.\" But Cb(25b) is the value-free interpretation of the noun phrase, \"the Vice-President\" (as in, \"The Vice-President of the United States is the President's key man in negotiations with Congress\"), whereas Cb(26b) is the value-loaded interpretation (as in \"the person who now is Vice-President of the United States\").",
        "That this is so is demonstrated by the fact that (25c) is true in 1994, whereas (26c) is not.",
        "Centering accommodates these differences by allowing the noun phrase \"the Vice-President of the United States\" potentially to contribute both its value-free interpretation and its value-loading at the world type to Cf(25a).",
        "Cb(25b) is then the value-free interpretation, and Cb(26b) is the value-loaded one (at the time of the writing of Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1986), George Bush, but now [1995] Al Gore).",
        "In each sequence, the (a) utterance underdetermines what element to add to Cf.",
        "This underdetermination may continue in a subsequent utterance with the pronoun.",
        "For example, that would be the case if the introductory adverbials were left off the (b) utterances.",
        "We conjecture that the correct approach to take in these cases is to add the value-free interpretation to Cf and then load it for the interpretation of subsequent utterances if this is necessary.",
        "This conjecture derives from a belief that this approach will most effectively limit the inferences required.",
        "These loading situations thus constitute a component of the centering constituent of the discourse situation.",
        "It remains an open question how long to retain these loading situations, although those corresponding to elements of Cf that are not carried forward (either as the Cb or as Cf s of the subsequent utterance) can, obviously, be dropped.",
        "It is possible for an utterance to prefer either a value-free (VF) or value-loaded (VL) interpretation but not force it.",
        "For example, the second utterance in the following sequence prefers a VF interpretation but allows for the VL interpretation that is needed in the third utterance.",
        "(27) a.",
        "A: The Vice-President of the U.S. is also President of the Senate.",
        "b.",
        "B: I thought he played some important role in the House.",
        "c. A: He did, but that was before he was the Vice-President.",
        "In a similar way the second utterance in the following sequence22 prefers the VL interpretation, but allows for the VF.",
        "The third utterance requires the VF interpretation.",
        "(28) a. John thinks that the telephone is a nuisance.",
        "b.",
        "He curses it every day.",
        "c. He doesn't realize that it is an invention that changed the world.",
        "In these examples, both value-free and value-loaded interpretations are shown to stem from the same full definite noun phrase.",
        "There appear to be strong constraints on the kinds of transitions that are allowed, however.",
        "In particular, if a given utterance forces either the VF or the VL interpretation, then only this interpretation is possible in the immediately subsequent utterance.",
        "However, if some utterance only prefers one interpretation (in a given context), but allows the other, then the subsequent utterance may pick up on either one.",
        "For example, the sequence,",
        "(29) a.",
        "The Vice-President of the United States is also President of the Senate.",
        "b. He's the President's key man in negotiations with Congress.",
        "in which \"he\" may be interpreted either VF, or VL, may be followed by either (30) or (31): (30) As Ambassador to China, he handled many tricky negotiations.",
        "(VL) (31) He is required to be at least 35 years old.",
        "(VF)",
        "However, if we change (29b) to force the value-loaded interpretation, as in (26), then only the value-loaded interpretation (30) is possible.",
        "Similarly, if (29b) is changed to force the value-free interpretation, as in (25b), then only the value-free interpretation (31) is possible.",
        "Speaker intentions may also enter into the determination of which entities are in the Cf.",
        "The referential uses of descriptions, of which Donnellan (1966) gives examples, demonstrate cases in which the \"referential intentions\" of the speaker in his use of the description play a role in determining Cb(U).",
        "For example, consider the following sequence:",
        "(32) a.",
        "Her husband is kind to her.",
        "b.",
        "No, he isn't. The man you're referring to isn't her husband.",
        "(33) a.",
        "Her husband is kind to her.",
        "b.",
        "He is kind to her but he isn't her husband.",
        "In these examples,' the speaker uses a description to refer to something other than the semantic denotation of that description, i.e. the unique thing that satisfies the description (if there is one).",
        "There are several alternative explanations of such examples, involving various accounts of speaker's intentions, mutual belief, and the like.",
        "A complete discussion of these issues is beyond the scope of this paper.",
        "The importance of these cases resides in showing that Cf(U) may include more than one entity that is realized by a single NP in U.",
        "In this case, the noun phrase \"her husband\" contributes two individuals, the husband and the lover, to Cf(32a) and Cf(33a).",
        "This can be seen by observing that both discourses seem equally appropriate and that the backward-looking centers of (32b) and (33b) are respectively the husband and the lover, which are realized by their anaphoric elements.",
        "These examples introduce a number of research issues concerning the representation and management of the Cb and Cf discourse entities.",
        "The account given here depends on a semantic theory that permits minimal commitment in interpretations.",
        "The open question is which constraints on centers are introduced at which points during processing.",
        "We must leave this as a topic for future work."

        "This theory can be contrasted with two previous research efforts that spurred this work: Sidner's (1979) original work on immediate focusing and pronouns, and Joshi and Weinstein's (1981) subsequent work on centering and inferences.",
        "The centering theory discussed here is quite close to Sidner's original theory, both in attacking local discourse issues and in the general outline of approach.",
        "However, it differs in several details.",
        "In Sidner's theory, each utterance provides an immediate discourse focus, an actor focus, and a set of potential foci.",
        "The discourse and actor foci may coincide, but need not.",
        "Her potential foci are roughly analogous to our Cf.",
        "The Cb for an utterance sometimes coincides with her actor focus and sometimes with her discourse focus.",
        "She distinguishes these two to handle various cases of multiple pronouns.",
        "However, as we have shown, utterances do not have multiple Cbs.",
        "Furthermore, utterances can have more than two pronouns, so merely adding a second kind of immediate focus is of limited use.",
        "The difference between these two theories can be seen from the following example (from Sidner [19791):",
        "(34) a. I haven't seen Jeff for several days.",
        "b. Carl thinks he's studying for his exams, c. but I think he went to the Cape with Linda.",
        "On Sidner's account, Carl is the actor focus after (34b) and Jeff is the discourse focus.",
        "Because the actor focus is preferred as the referent of pronominal expressions, Carl is the leading candidate for the entity referred to by he in (34c).",
        "It is difficult to rule this .",
        "case out without invoking fairly special domain-specific rules.",
        "On our account, Jeff is the Cb at (34b) and there is no problem.",
        "The type of example Sidner was concerned about would occur if utterance (34c) were replaced by \"He thinks he studies too much.\" However, the centering rules would still hold in this case.",
        "They provide no constraints on additional pronouns so long as the highest ranked Cf is realized by a pronoun.",
        "However, the rules are incomplete; in particular, as given they do not specify which pronoun in a multipronoun utterance refers to the Cb.",
        "The center management rules are based solely on the Cb and the highest ranked member of the Cf. As a result, while there are cases of multiple pronouns for which the theory makes incomplete predictions, having both an actor and a discourse focus will not handle these cases in general.",
        "Joshi and Kuhn (1979) and Joshi and Weinstein (1981) presented a preliminary report on their research regarding the connection between the computational complexity of the inferences required to process a discourse and the coherence of that discourse as assessed by measures that invoke centering phenomena.",
        "However, their basic definitions conflate the centers of an utterance with the linguistic expressions that realize those centers.",
        "In some of their examples it is unclear whether the shift in center or the particular expression used to realize the center is responsible for differences in coherence and inference load.",
        "Our present work has clarified these differences while maintaining Joshi and Weinstein's basic focus on the interaction between inference load and center management.",
        "Since Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1986) was first circulated a number of researchers have tested and developed aspects of the theory presented here.' This",
