        "This article presents an efficient, implemented approach to cross-linguistic parsing based on Government Binding (GB) Theory (Chomsky 1986) and followers.",
        "One of the drawbacks to alternative GB-based parsing approaches is that they generally adopt a filter-based paradigm.",
        "These approaches typically generate all possible candidate structures of the sentence that satisfy X theory, and then subsequently apply filters in order to eliminate those structures that violate GB principles.",
        "(See, for example, Abney 1989; Correa 1991; Dorr 1993; Fong 1991.)",
        "The current approach provides an alternative to filter-based designs that avoids these difficulties by applying principles to descriptions of structures without actually building the structures themselves.",
        "Our approach is similar to that of Lin (1993) in that structure-building is deferred until the descriptions satisfy all principles; however, the current approach differs in that it provides a parameterization mechanism along the lines of Dorr (1994) that allows the system to be ported to languages other than English.",
        "We focus particularly on the problem of processing head-final languages such as Korean.",
        "We are currently incorporating the parser into a machine translation (MT) system called PRINCITRAN.1 In general, parsers of existing principle-based interlingual MT systems are exceedingly inefficient, since they tend to adopt the filter-based paradigm.",
        "We combine the benefits of the message-passing paradigm with the benefits of the parameterized approach to build a more efficient, but easily extensible system, that will ultimately be used for MT.",
        "The algorithm has been implemented in C++ and successfully tested on well-known, translationally divergent sentences.",
        "We present a general framework for parsing by message passing and describe our implementation of GB principles as attribute-value constraints.",
        "We then present the parameterization framework, demonstrating the feasibility of handling cross-linguistic variation within the message-passing framework.",
        "A technique for automatic precom-pilation of parameter settings is described.",
        "Finally, we compare the efficiency of the",
        "Network representation of English and Korean grammar.",
        "parser to that of the original CFG algorithm as well as Tomita's algorithm (Tomita 1986) on a test suite of representative sentences.",
        "We argue that the efficiency of the system is not simply a side effect of using an efficient programming language (i.e., C++), but that the algorithm is inherently efficient, independent of the programming language used for the implementation."

        "There has been a great deal of interest in exploring new paradigms of parsing, especially nontraditional parallel architectures for natural language processing (Abney 1989; Cottrell 1989; Selman and Hirst 1985, among many others).",

        "Steven-son's model comes the closest in design to the current principle-based message-passing model in that it uses distributed message passing as the basic underlying mechanism and it encodes GB principles directly (i.e., there are precise correspondences between functional components and linguistic principles).",
        "However, the fundamental goals of the two approaches are different: Stevenson's objective concerns the modeling of human processing behavior and producing a single parse at the end.",
        "Her system incorporates, a number of psycholinguistic-based processing mechanisms for handling ambiguity and making attachment decisions.",
        "Our model, on the other hand, is more concerned with efficiency issues, broad-scale coverage, and cross-linguistic applicability; we produce all possible parse alternatives wherever disambiguation requires extra-sentential information.",
        "We provide a language-independent processing mechanism that accommodates",
        "structurally different languages (e.g., head-initial vs. head-final) with equally efficient run times.",
        "The grammar for each language is encoded as a network of nodes that represent grammatical categories (e.g., NP, Nbar, N) or subcategories, such as V:NP (i.e., a transitive verb that takes an NP as complement).",

        "There are two types of links in the network: subsumption links (e.g., V to V:NP) and dominance links (e.g., Nbar to N).",
        "A dominance link from a to (3 is associated with an integer id that determines the linear order between 0 and other categories immediately dominated by a, and a binary attribute to specify whether 0 is optional or obligatory.'",
        "Input sentences are parsed by passing messages in the grammar network.",
        "The nodes in the network are computing agents that communicate with each other by sending messages in the reverse direction of the links.",
        "Each node locally stores a set of items.",
        "An item is a triplet that represents an g structure a: <surface-string, attribute-values, source-messages>, where surface-string is an integer interval [i,j] denoting the i'th to j' th word in the input sentence; attribute-values specifies syntactic features of the root node (/3); and source-messages is a set of messages that represent immediate constituents of /3 and from which this item is combined.",
        "Each node has a completion predicate that determines whether an item at the node is \"complete,\" in which case the item is sent as a message to other nodes.",
        "When a node receives an item, it attempts to form new items by combining it with items from other nodes.",
        "Two items, <[ii,ji ], Ai, Si > and <[i2,j2], A2, S2>, can be combined if: (1) their surface strings are adjacent to each other: i2 = ji +1; (2) their attribute values Ai and A2 are unifiable; and (3) the source messages come via different links: links(S1) n links(S2) = 0, where links(S) is a function that, given a set of messages, returns the set of links via which the messages arrived.",
        "The result of the combination is a new item, <fi1,j21, unify(Ai, A2), Si U S2>.",
