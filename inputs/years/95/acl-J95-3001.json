        "The purpose of the architecture is to deliver to users in real time the behaviors needed for efficient human – machine dialog.",
        "Specifically, it is aimed at achieving the following: Convergence to a goal.",
        "Efficient dialog requires that each participant understand the purpose of the interaction and have the necessary prerequisites to cooperate in its achievement.",
        "This is the intentional structure of Grosz and Sidner (1986), the goal-oriented mechanism that gives direction to the interaction.",
        "The primary required facilities are a problem solver that can deduce the necessary action sequences and a set of subsystems capable of carrying out those sequences.",
        "Subdialogs and effective movement between them.",
        "Efficient human dialog is usually segmented into utterance sequences, subdialogs, that are individually aimed at achieving relevant subgoals (Grosz 1978; Linde and Goguen 1978; Polanyi and Scha 1983; Reich-man 1985).",
        "These are called \"segments\" by Grosz and Sidner (1986) and constitute the linguistic structure defined in their paper.",
        "The global goal is approached by a series of attempts at subgoals each of which involves a set of interactions, the subdialogs.",
        "An aggressive strategy for global success is to choose the subgoals judged most likely to lead to success and carry out their associated subdialogs.",
        "As the system proceeds on a given subdialog, it should always be ready to drop it abruptly if some other subdialog suddenly seems more appropriate.",
        "This leads to the fragmented style that so commonly appears in efficient human communication.",
        "A subdialog is opened, leading to another, then another, then a jump to a previously opened subdialog, and so forth, in an unpredictable order until the necessary subgoals have been solved for an overall success.",
        "An accounting for user knowledge and abilities.",
        "Cooperative problem solving involves maintaining a dynamic profile of user knowledge, termed a user model.",
        "This concept is described, for example, in Kobsa and Wahlster (1988, 1989), Chin (1989), Cohen and Jones (1989), Finin (1989), Lehman and Carbonell (1989), Morik (1989), and Paris (1988).",
        "The user model specifies information needed for efficient interaction with the conversational partner.",
        "Its purpose is to indicate what needs to be said to the user to enable the user to function effectively.",
        "It also indicates what should be omitted because of existing user knowledge.",
        "Because considerable information is exchanged during the dialog, the user model changes continuously.",
        "Mentioned facts are stored in the model as known to the user and are not repeated.",
        "Previously unmentioned information may be assumed to be unknown and may be explained as needed.",
        "Questions from the user may indicate lack of knowledge and result in the removal of items from the user model.",
        "Change of initiative.",
        "A real possibility in a cooperative interaction is that the user's problem-solving ability, either on a given subgoal or on the global task, may exceed that of the machine.",
        "When this occurs, an efficient interaction requires that the machine yield control so that the more competent partner can lead the way to the fastest possible solution.",
        "Thus, the machine must be able to carry out its own problem-solving process and direct the actions to task completion or yield to the user's control and respond cooperatively to his or her requests.",
        "This is a variable initiative dialog, as studied by Kitano and Van Ess-Dykema (1991), Novick (1988), Whittaker and Stenton (1988), and Walker and Whittaker (1990).",
        "As a pragmatic issue, we have found that at least four initiative modes are useful: (1) directive.",
        "The computer has complete dialog control.",
        "It recommends a subgoal for completion and will use whatever dialog is necessary to obtain the needed item of knowledge related to the subgoal.",
        "(2) suggestive.",
        "The computer still has dialog control, but not as strongly.",
        "The computer will make suggestions about the subgoal to perform next, but it is also willing to change the direction of the dialog according to stated user preferences.",
        "(3) declarative.",
        "The user has dialog control, but the computer is free to mention relevant, though not required, facts as a response to the user's statements.",
        "(4) passive.",
        "The user has complete dialog control.",
        "The computer responds directly to user questions and passively acknowledges user statements without recommending a subgoal as the next course of action.",
        "Expectation of user input.",
        "Since all interactions occur in the context of a current subdialog, the user's input is far more predictable than would be indicated by a general grammar for English.",
        "In fact, the current subdialog specifies the focus of the interaction, the set of all objects and actions that are locally appropriate.",
        "This is the attentional structure described by Grosz and Sidner (1986), and its most important function in our system is to predict the meaning structures the user is likely to communicate in an input.",
        "For illustration, the opening of a chassis cover plate will often evoke comments about the objects behind the cover; the measurement of a voltage is likely to include references to a voltmeter, leads, voltage range, and the locations of measurement points.",
        "Thus the subdialog structure provides a set of expected utterances at each point in the conversation, and these have two important roles: (1) The expected utterances provide strong guidance for the speech recognition system so that error correction can be enhanced.",
        "Where ambiguity arises, recognition can be biased in the direction of meaningful statements in the current context.",
        "Earlier researchers who have investigated this insight are Erman et al.",
        "(1980), Walker (1978), Fink and Biermann (1986), Mudler and Paulus (1988), Carbonell and Pierrel (1988), Young (1990), and Young et al.",
        "(1989).",
        "(2) The expected utterances from subdialogs other than the current one can indicate that a shift from the current subdialog is occurring.",
        "Thus, expectations are one of the primary mechanisms needed for tracking the conversation as it jumps from subdialog to subdialog.",
        "This is known elsewhere as the plan recognition problem, and it has received much attention in recent years.",
        "See, for example, Allen and Perrault (1980), Allen (1983), Kautz (1991), Litman and Allen (1987), Pollack (1986), and Carberry (1988, 1990).",
        "Systems capable of all of the above behaviors are rare, as has been observed by Allen et al.",
        "(1989): \"no one knows how to fit all of the pieces together.\" An impressive early example along these lines is the MINDS system of Young et al.",
        "(1989).",
        "This system maintains an AND–OR goal tree to represent the problem-solving space, and it engages in dialog in the process of trying to achieve subgoals in the tree.",
        "A series of interactions related to a given subgoal constitute a subdialog, and expectations associated with currently active goals are used to predict incoming user utterances.",
        "These predictions are further sharpened by a user model and then are passed down to the signal-processing level to improve speech recognition.",
        "The resulting system",
        "demonstrated dramatic improvements over performance levels that had been observed without such predictive capabilities.",
        "For example, the effective perplexity in one test was reduced from 242.4 to 18.3 using dialog level constraints, while word accuracy recognition was increased from 82.1 percent to 97.0 percent.",
        "In another dialog project, Allen et al.",
        "(1989) describe an architecture that concentrates on representations for subdialog mechanisms and their interactions with sentence-level processing.",
        "Their mechanism uses the blackboard organization, which displays at a global level all pertinent information and has subroutines with specialty functions to update the blackboard.",
        "There are subroutines, for example, to do processing at the lexical, syntactic, and semantic levels, to handle referencing problems, to manage discourse structure and speech act issues, tense, and much more.",
        "A typical task for their system is to properly parse and analyze a given dialog.",
        "A third interesting project has produced the TINA system (Seneff 1992), which uses probabilistic networks to parse token sequences provided by a speech recognition system, SUMMIT, created by Zue et al.",
        "(1989).",
        "The networks and their probabilities are created automatically from grammatical rules and text samples input by the designer.",
        "Their main utility is to provide expectation for error correction as we do in our system.",
        "However, their expectation is primarily syntax-based while ours uses structure from all levels, subdialog (or focus-based), semantic, and syntactic.",
        "Their semantics is built directly into the parse trees and translated into SQL for access to a database.",
        "Our approach resembles that of Young et al.",
        "(1989), except that we employ Prolog-style rules for the knowledge base and the associated proofs for directing the goal-oriented behavior.",
        "This leads to the \"missing axiom theory\" we describe for processing discourse, and some rather simple mechanisms for employing the user model, for managing multiple subdialogs, and for creating and using expectation.",
        "Our theory also shows how variable initiative is built into the same simple architecture.",
        "Our implementation shows that the mechanisms are efficient enough to run in real time and sufficiently well designed to yield successful dialogs with humans."

        "If the terminal string w can be generated by the grammar rules of the from A --- w1, then the analogous derivation using the rules A --- w2 will produce the translated output in GADL form.",

        "The selected meaning of the incoming utterance will be the least-cost match between an output for the translation grammar and the expectations.",
        "The mechanisms for finding this least-cost match will be described next.",
        "The cost C of selecting a given expectation is a function of two parameters: (1) the utterance cost U, which measures the distance of the perceived voice signal from a grammatical utterance as defined by the system grammar, and (2) the expectation cost E, which measures the degree of locality of the selected expectation with respect to",

        "Each such edit operation has an associated cost, depending on the significance of the word being edited.",
        "Some words, such as \"not\" or major nouns, make a large difference in sentence meaning; other words, such as articles, may not carry significant meaning in a given context.",

        "A low value was assigned for all expectations at the current subdialog.",
        "The sequential levels of more distant subdialogs each were given higher expectation costs.",
        "The original hypothesized combining function for U and E was",
        "where is a weighting factor between 0 and 1.",
        "A near 0 will tend to prefer matches to local expectation, regardless of the values of U; a near 1 will place most weight on getting a good match between the input graph and a grammatical string, regardless of the value of E. Our experimentation, as described in Hipp (1992), indicated that should be near 1.",
        "This supports the intuition that definitive source data at the time of the utterance should be the preferred evidence regardless of expectation.",
        "Consequently, the usefulness of the expectation is for selecting between grammatical utterances derived from the perceived voice signal that have minimal utterance cost.",
        "Reflecting this experimentally determined result, the cost computation was revised to",
        "where Umin is the smallest observed utterance cost for the given utterance.",
        "This function selects the meaning with minimum utterance cost and uses expectation to break ties.",

        "However, even these subjects did not continually refer to the charts, but only used them infrequently.",
        "Additional study of the data yielded some interesting information about the sub-jects' rate of learning of the system.",
        "One might wonder how users' behaviors improved with time.",
        "The total number of problems attempted in both modes in session 2 was 67, and this rose to 74 in session 3.",
        "The rate of success rose from 79 percent to 88 percent.",
        "It is also interesting to speculate how long it would be necessary to keep the experimenter at hand to give error messages.",
        "The number of experimenter interactions dropped from 162 in session 2 to 112 in session 3.",
        "Another phenomenon often noticed in the speech recognition world is the \"sheepgoats\" dichotomy that seems to divide users.",
        "Some users seem to function well with voice recognition equipment (\"sheep\") while others (\"goats\") have considerable difficulties.",
        "We noticed this in that four of our subjects were able to attempt all 80 problems given them and solved 79 of the 80.",
        "Their recognition rates tended to be in the high 80s or low 90s.",
        "The much lower reported average figures given above are the result of averaging in performance figures from the less successful class of users.",
        "A final issue of interest is the level of software reliability achieveable by such a system.",
        "It has been observed in previous research systems that the code is sufficiently complex and the level of development in a research laboratory sufficiently incomplete that substantial numbers of software failures do occur in such tests.",
        "For example, Damerau (1981), Miller, Herschman, and Kelly (1978) on the LADDER system, and Biermann, Ballard, and Sigmon (1983) reported software failures at the rates of approximately 5, 2, and 2 percents, respectively.",
        "In the current test, of the 2, 840 utterances that were processed, only one resulted in such a software failure.",
        "The reasons for the high reliability were (1) the quality of the code was high and (2) the nature of the design that finds a nearest neighbor to an input string among expected inputs is one in which high reliability is much more easily obtained.",
        "that there are behavioral differences as a function of initiative, there are two major problems in demonstrating the statistical significance of these differences: (1) only four subjects completed a high enough percentage of the dialogs to enable a within-subject comparison of these differences across all problems, and (2) there were large sample variances in the data.",
        "To alleviate these problems, behavioral differences were analyzed separately for each problem.",
        "This was possible because of the balancing of problems between sessions according to problem type.",
        "That is, problem \"k\" of each session had the same erroneous LED display.",
        "Consequently, the system's diagnosis procedure was virtually identical for problem \"k\" in each session.",
        "The only difference came in identifying the missing wire or wires that caused the circuit failure.",
        "The missing wires were different in each session.",
        "Three performance criteria were examined: (1) completion time, (2) number of utterances spoken, and (3) percentage of nontrivial utterances.",
        "By examining the dif",
        "ference in a subject's performance on problem \"k\" as a function of initiative, a paired t test (Larsen and Marx 1981) could be conducted.",
        "The null hypothesis would say that the average of the paired differences is 0.",
        "Table 3 shows the results.",
        "For example, for problem 1, there were five subjects who completed the dialog in both sessions, and their paired difference for each criterion is obtained by the following formula: \"directive mode value\" – \"declarative mode value\" For example, the first subject spoke 18 utterances in directive mode for problem 1, but only 11 utterances when in declarative mode, a paired difference of +7.",
        "The set of paired differences for a given problem provides the sample data for the test statistic.",
        "The t statistic and the individual observed significance levels are shown for each phenomena, one row per problem.",
        "In the results for number of utterances spoken, all problems but problem 2 showed an observed significance in user behavior as a function of initiative at the p = 0.05 level or less.",
        "There are also strong trends toward statistically significant behavioral differences with respect to completion time and nontrivial utterances for several of the problems.",
        "One difficulty with respect to completion time is the fact that the implementation of the parsing algorithm was not yet optimized during the experiment, and the more prevalent nontrivial utterances of declarative mode would require a longer time to parse.",
        "Note that while almost all of the significance levels support the hypothesis of a real difference, because the problems are interrelated, and the tested subjects overlap from problem to problem, we cannot claim overwhelming statistical significance.",
        "Nevertheless, we believe these results provide a strong indication that our system demonstrates variable initiative behavior, and that user behavior differs according to the level of initiative."

      "text": [
        "Grosz and Sidner (1986) have given a high-level theory of dialog.",
        "The theory specifies three components, the linguistic, intentional, and attentional structures, and describes their nature and relationships to each other.",
        "However, their theory leaves a whole variety of issues undetermined; without a full implementation, the question of its applicability remains unanswered.",
        "This project shows a successful instantiation of these ideas and provides some verification of their correctness.",
        "In fact, it presents a working speech dialog system that follows their theory in most of its details.",
        "In doing so, the project clarifies the nature of the three components and increases our understanding of them.",
        "The linguistic component is the actual sequence of dialog interactions, and its most significant characteristic is that it can be naturally divided into what Grosz and Sidner call segments.",
        "(We have used the term \"subdialog\" instead of \"segment\" because we feel the latter term connotes contiguity, which may be misleading.)",
        "These segments are semantically coherent subparts of the dialog, and their union constitutes the whole dialog.",
        "An individual segment may be a contiguous sequence of interactions, or it may be broken into several sequences, as described in earlier sections of this paper.",
        "Many researchers have studied the properties of such segments, including linguistic and intonational markers to delineate them (Hirschberg and Litman 1993; Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert 1986), the resolution of noun phrases within the context of a segment (Grosz 1978; Reichman 1985), and their semantic self-consistency (Hobbs 1979).",
        "Our theory provides an automatic mechanism for participating in dialogs, for following segments initiated by the user, for initiating segments on its own, and for properly utilizing segment semantics for many language-processing purposes, such as noun phrase resolution, error correction in speech recognition, and so forth.",
        "The intentional component specifies the purpose of the dialog.",
        "Grosz and Sidner (1986) use the notation DP and DSP to stand for \"discourse purpose\" and \"discourse segment purpose.\" These entities correspond to the predicate goals that our system poses and then builds the dialog around.",
        "Our system, in fact, constructs a set of partial proofs and these are our instantiation of the intentional component.",
        "Grosz and Sidner introduce the relation of \"dominance\" between two DSPs; one DSP dominates another if the other \"is intended to provide part of the satisfaction\" of the first.",
        "This relation corresponds to the natural precedence in our system that a Horn clause proof gives to the predicates in the proof tree.",
        "Grosz and Sidner emphasize that the number of possible discourse purposes must be infinite in a dialog system, an assertion that we agree with.",
        "Our predicates allow for arbitrarily complex nesting of functional structures.",
        "As a trivial example, in our theory applied to the block-stacking world, the DSP buildtower (A on B on C on ... on X) is a legal goal regardless of how many blocks are specified to be stacked.",
        "Another issue they discuss is the possibility of multiple simultaneous goals.",
        "Thus the speaker may wish to both convey information and impress the hearer with his or her intelligence.",
        "This is a problem we have not attempted to deal with in our theory, and we do not offer any solutions to it.",
        "Our system deals with multiple goals but each subdialog addresses only one at a time.",
        "The attentional structure is a stack in the theory of Grosz and Sidner and in many other theories as well (Litman and Allen 1987).",
        "The current incoming sentence is matched to local expectation, the entities at the top of the stack, and its meaning will be processed with respect to these structures in focus unless some kind of inconsistency occurs.",
        "If the sentence does not have meaning within this context, the stack may be pushed to introduce a new topic, or it may be popped and processing can occur within the next context in the priority.",
        "In our theory, the local expectation or focus is represented by the set of predicates that are related by our Prolog-style rules to the currently active predicate or DP.",
        "If no successful match is made, then other nonlocal but recently active DPs are tried.",
        "The fact that our representation of local focus is a set of predicates on the proof tree (the intentional structure) may seem to contradict the Grosz – Sidner assertions that the focus-space hierarchy and the intentional structure should not be conflated.",
        "However, a closer look reveals that our focus stack exists independently of the intentional structure even though the items on the stack are listed on the intentional structure.",
        "The focus structure may be thought of as a stack of pointers; those pointers give addresses on the intentional structure, but the independence of the two entities is not compromised.",
        "An example given by Grosz and Sidner (which in turn was borrowed from L. Polanyi and R. Scha) illustrates many of these points.",
        "Dl: John came by and left the groceries",
        "D2: Stop that you kids D3: and I put them away after he left",
        "Figure 3 shows our representation of the interaction after the utterance D1.",
        "Two goals are currently active, DSP=describe prepare dinner and DSP=reduce stress; their partial proof trees are shown.",
        "The focus stack contains the description of getting food as its top entry, and previous topics have been pushed down to lower levels.",
        "The speaker's priority system, however, in the next instant has pushed the goal \"reduce stress\" into the foreground with the associated utterance D2, as shown in Figure 4.",
        "Here the stack receives an additional entry, a pointer to the control-children DSP.",
        "With the control-children DSP achieved, the focus stack can pop back to the previous interaction and continue, as shown in Figure 5.",
        "Actually, we deviate from Grosz and Sidner here and keep the recent subdialog active near the top of the stack.",
        "It may be returned to; for",
        "The speaker's priority intervenes to reduce stress: \"Stop that you kids.\" example, the next utterance could be D4: Have you finished your homework?",

        "Their discussion focuses on the concept of the working set, which specifies \"the set of entities in the discourse context.\" As discourse proceeds, this working set is updated and it provides at each point in time the set of objects for definite noun phrase resolution.",
        "They describe two mechanisms for updating the working set; one, called context change by entity introduction, adds entities to the working set as they appear in the discourse.",

        "items from the working set as a side effect of planning.",

        "When a subdialog is invoked, all of its objects, relationships, and actions come into focus at once; when the subdialog is abandoned, all of these entities are demoted to nonprimary but still near-at-hand availability.",
        "Our system does not typically change subdialog merely because an unexpected entity has been introduced.",
        "The specification of a new entity without any sentential context would probably confuse our system; it looks for utterances that will be meaningful in the current subdialog and it changes subdialog when an incoming utterance fails to have meaning locally but does have meaning in another available subdialog.",

        "(1988).",
        "Abduction is needed when a literal interpretation of incoming tokens will not match the items or relationships in the existing database; it provides a mechanism to \"coerce\" a specific and literal meaning into a meaning that accounts for the sentence context.",

        "These properties etci (x) need not be known; they are what Hobbs et al.",
        "call \"assumable,\" and the act of making the assumption is the abductive act central to the \"coercion\" being carried out.",
        "This identity and the associated assumption make it possible to equate the fluid of the first sentence with the lube oil of the second sentence.",
        "The mechanism of our system achieves a similar result but via different means.",
        "Some currently active subdialog, which might or might not be at the highest level on the focus stack, would contain the lube oil and a variety of its characteristics and relationships.",
        "As incoming sentences arrive, their interpretations would be matched to the objects and relationships in the focus spaces using the minimum distance algorithm according to the stack priority until an acceptable match is found.",
