        "People are goal-oriented and can plan courses of actions to achieve their goals.",
        "But sometimes they might lack the knowledge needed to formulate a plan of action, or some of the actions that they plan might depend on coordinating their activity with other agents.",
        "How do they cope?",
        "One way is to work together, or collaborate, in formulating a plan of action with other people who are involved in the actions or who know the relevant information.",
        "Even the apparently simple linguistic task of referring, in an utterance, to some object or idea can involve exactly this kind of activity: a collaboration between the speaker and the hearer.",
        "The speaker has the goal of the hearer identifying the object that the speaker has in mind.",
        "The speaker attempts to achieve this goal by constructing a description of the object that she thinks will enable the hearer to identify it.",
        "But since the speaker and the hearer will inevitably have different beliefs about the world, the hearer might not be able to identify the object.",
        "Often, when the hearer cannot do so, the speaker and hearer collaborate in making a new referring expression that accomplishes the goal.",
        "This paper presents a computational model of how a conversational participant collaborates in making a referring action successful.",
        "We use as our basis the model proposed by Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs (1986), which gives a descriptive account of the conversational moves that participants make when collaborating upon a referring expression.",
        "We cast their work into a model based on the planning paradigm.",
        "We propose that referring expressions can be represented by plan derivations, and that plan construction and plan inference can be used to generate and understand them.",
        "Not only does this approach allow the processes of building referring expres",
        "sions and identifying their referents to be captured in the planning paradigm, but it also allows us to use the planning paradigm to account for how participants clarify a referring expression.",
        "In this case, we use meta-actions that encode how a plan derivation corresponding to a referring expression can be reasoned about and manipulated.",
        "To complete the picture, we also need to account for the fact that the conversants are collaborating.",
        "We propose that the agents are in a mental state that includes not only an intention to achieve the goal of the collaborative activity but also a plan that the participants are currently considering.",
        "In the case of referring, this will be the plan derivation that corresponds to the referring expression.",
        "This plan is in the common ground of the participants, and we propose rules that are sanctioned by the mental state both for accepting plans that clarify the current plan, and for adopting goals to do likewise.",
        "The acceptance of a clarification results in the current plan being updated.",
        "So, it is these rules that specify how plan inference and plan construction affect and are affected by the mental state of the agent.",
        "Thus, the mental state, together with the rules, provides the link between these two processes.",
        "An important consequence of our proposal is that the current plan need not allow the successful achievement of the goal.",
        "Likewise, the clarifications that agents propose need not result in a successful plan in order for them to be accepted.",
        "As can be seen, our approach consists of two tiers.",
        "The first tier is the planning component, which accounts for how utterances are both understood and generated.",
        "Using the planning paradigm has several advantages: it allows both tasks to be captured in a single paradigm that is used for modeling general intelligent behavior; it allows more of the content of an utterance to be accounted for by a uniform process; and only a single knowledge source for referring expressions is needed instead of having this knowledge embedded in special algorithms for each task.",
        "The second tier accounts for the collaborative behavior of the agents: how they adopt goals and coordinate their activity.",
        "It provides the link between the mental state of the agent and the planning processes.",
        "In accounting for how agents collaborate in making a referring action, our work aims to make the following contributions to the field.",
        "First, although much work has been done on how agents request clarifications, or respond to such requests, little attention has been paid to the collaborative aspects of clarification discourse.",
        "Our work attempts a plan-based formalization of what linguistic collaboration is, both in terms of the goals and intentions that underlie it and the surface speech acts that result from it.",
        "Second, we address the act of referring and show how it can be better accounted for by the planning paradigm.",
        "Third, previous plan-based linguistic research has concentrated on either construction or understanding of utterances, but not both.",
        "By doing both, we will give our work generality in the direction of a complete model of the collaborative process.",
        "Finally, by using Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs's model as a basis for our work, we aim not only to add support to their model, but also to gain a much richer understanding of the subject.",
        "In order to address the problem that we have set out, we have limited the scope of our work.",
        "First, we look at referring expressions in isolation, rather than as part of a larger speech act.",
        "Second, we assume that agents have mutual knowledge of the mechanisms of referring expressions and collaboration.",
        "Third, we deal with objects that both the speaker and hearer know of, though they might have different beliefs about what propositions hold for these objects.",
        "Fourth, as the input and the output to our system, we use representations of surface speech actions, not natural language strings.",
        "Finally, although belief revision is an important part of how agents collaborate, we do not explicitly address this."

        "Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs (1986) investigated how participants in a conversation collaborate in making a referring action successful.",
        "They conducted experiments in which participants had to refer to objects – tangram patterns – that are difficult to describe.",
        "They found that typically the participant trying to describe a tangram pattern would present an initial referring expression.",
        "The other participant would then pass judgment on it, either accepting it, rejecting it, or postponing his decision.",
        "If it was rejected or the decision postponed, then one participant or the other would refashion the referring expression.",
        "This would take the form of either repairing the expression by correcting speech errors, expanding it by adding further qualifications, or replacing the original expression with a new expression.",
        "The referring expression that results from this is then judged, and the process continues until the referring expression is acceptable enough to the participants for current purposes.",
        "This final expression is contributed to the participants' common ground.",
        "Below are two excerpts from Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs's experiments that illustrate the acceptance process.",
        "In this dialog, person A makes an initial presentation in line 1.",
        "Person B postpones his decision in line 2 by voicing a tentative \"okay,\" and then proceeds to refashion the referring expression, the result being \"the guy reading, holding his book to the left, kind of standing up.\" A accepts the new expression in line 3, and B signals his acceptance in line 4.",
        "(2.2) A:1 Okay, and the next one is the person that looks like they're carrying something and it's sticking out to the left.",
        "It looks like a hat that's upside down.",
        "B: 2 The guy that's pointing to the left again?",
        "A: 3 Yeah, pointing to the left, that's it!",
        "(laughs) B: 4 Okay.",
        "In the second dialog, B implicitly rejects A's initial presentation by replacing it with a new referring expression in line 2, \"the guy that's pointing to the left again.\" A then accepts the refashioned referring expression in line 3.",
        "Below, we give an algorithmic interpretation of Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs's collaborative model, where present, judge, and refashion are the conversational moves that the participants make, and ref, re, and judgment are variables that represent the referent, the current referring expression, and its judgment, respectively.",
        "(Since the conversational moves update the referring expression and its judgment, they are presented as functions.)",
        "The algorithm illustrates how the collaborative activity progresses by the participants judging and refashioning the previously proposed referring expression.' In fact, we can see that the state of the process is characterized by the current referring expression, re, and the judgment of it, judgment, and that this state must be part of the common ground of the participants.",
        "The algorithm also illustrates how the model of Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs minimizes the distinction between the roles of the person who initiated the referring expression and the person who is trying to identify it.",
        "Both have the same moves available to them, for either can judge the description and either can refashion it.",
        "Neither is controlling the dialog, they are simply collaborating.",
        "In later work, Clark and Schaefer (1989) propose that \"each part of the acceptance phase is itself a contribution\" (p. 269), and the acceptance of these contributions depends on whether the hearer \"believes he is understanding well enough for current purposes\" (p. 267).",
        "Although Clark and Schaefer use the term contribution with respect to the discourse, rather than the collaborative effort of referring, their proposal is still relevant here: judgments and refashionings are contributions to the collaborative effort and are subjected to an acceptance process, with the result being that once they are accepted, the state of the collaborative activity is updated.",
        "So, what constitutes grounds for accepting a judgment or clarification?",
        "In order to be consistent with Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs's model, we can see that if one agent finds the current referring expression problematic, the other must accept that judgment.",
        "Likewise, if one agent proposes a referring expression, through a refashioning, the other must accept the refashioning."

        "Although acts of reference have been incorporated into plan-based models, determining the content of referring expressions hasn't been.",

        "Rather, this action has an associated procedure that determines a description that satisfies the preconditions of describe.",
        "Such special procedures have been the mainstay for accounting for the content of referring expressions, both in constructing and in understanding them, as exemplified by Dale (1989), who chose descriptors on the basis of their discriminatory power; Ehud Reiter (1990), who focused",

        "Second, the constraints keep track of which objects could be believed to be the referent of the referring expression.",
        "Third, the constraints ensure that a sufficient number of surface speech actions are added so that the set of candidates associated with the entire referring expression consists of only a single object, the referent.",
        "These constraints enable the speaker to construct a referring expression that she believes will allow the hearer to identify the referent.",

        "The plan derivation expresses beliefs of the speaker: how actions contribute to the achievement of the goal, and what constraints hold that will allow successful identification.' So plan construction reasons about the beliefs of the agent in constructing a referring plan; likewise, plan inference, after hypothesizing a plan that is consistent with the observed actions, reasons about the other participant's (believed) beliefs in satisfying the constraints of the plan.",

        "Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs (1986) have presented a model of how conversational participants collaborate in making a referring action successful (see Section 2 above).",
        "Their model consists of conversational moves that express a judgment of a referring expression and conversational moves that refashion an expression.",
        "However, their model is not computational.",
        "They do not account for how the judgment is made, how the judgment affects the refashioning, or the content of the moves.",
        "Following the work of Litman and Allen (1987) in understanding clarification sub-dialogs, we formalize the conversational moves of Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs as discourse actions.",
        "These discourse actions are meta-actions that take as a parameter a referring expression plan.",
        "The constraints and decompositions of the discourse actions encode the conditions under which they can be applied, how the referring expression derivations can be refashioned, and how the speaker's beliefs can be communicated to the hearer.",
        "So, the conversational moves, or clarifications, can be generated and understood within the planning paradigm/ Surface Speech Actions.",
        "An important part of our model is the surface speech actions.",
        "These actions serve as the basis for communication between the two agents, and so they must convey the information that is dictated by Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs's model.",
        "For the judgment plans, we have the surface speech actions s-accept, s-reject, and s-postpone, corresponding to the three possibilities in their model.",
        "These take as a parameter the plan that is being judged, and for s-reject, also a subset of the speech actions of the referring expression plan.",
        "The purpose of this subset is to inform the hearer of the surface speech actions that the speaker found problematic.",
        "So, if the referring expression was \"the weird creature,\" and the hearer couldn't identify anything that he thought \"weird,\" he might say \"what weird thing,\" thus indicating he had problems with the surface speech action corresponding to \"weird.\" For the refashioning plans, we propose that there is a single surface speech action, s-actions, that is used for both replacing a part of a plan, and expanding it.",
        "This action takes as a parameter the plan that is being refashioned and a set of surface speech actions that the speaker wants to incorporate into the referring expression plan.",
        "Since there is only one action, if it is uttered in isolation, it will be ambiguous",
        " between a replacement and an expansion; however, the speech action resulting from the judgment will provide the proper context to disambiguate its meaning.",
        "In fact, during linguistic realization, if the two actions are being uttered by the same person, they could be combined into a single utterance.",
        "For instance, the utterance \"no, the red one\" could be interpreted as an s-reject of the color that was previously used to describe something and an s-actions for the color \"red.\" So, as we can see, the surface speech actions for clarifications operate on components of the plan that is being built, namely the surface speech actions of referring expression plans.",
        "This is consistent with our use of plan derivations to represent utterances.",
        "Although we could have viewed the clarification speech actions as acts of informing (Litman and Allen 1987), this would have shifted the complexity into the parameter of the inform, and it is unclear whether anything would have been gained.",
        "Instead, we feel that a parser with a model of the discourse and the context can determine the surface speech actions.8 Additionally, it should be easier for the generator to determine an appropriate surface form.",
        "Judgment Plans.",
        "The evaluation of the referring expression plan indicates whether the referring action was successful or not.",
        "If it was successful, then the referent has been identified, and so a goal to communicate this is input to the plan constructor.",
        "This goal would be achieved by an instance of accept-plan, which decomposes into the surface speech action s-accept.",
        "If the evaluation wasn't successful, then the goal of communicating the error is given to the plan constructor, where the error is simply represented by the node in the derivation that the evaluation failed at.",
        "There are two reasons why the evaluation could have failed: either no objects match or more than one matches.",
        "In the first case, the referring expression is overconstrained, and the evaluation would have failed on an action that decomposes into surface speech actions.",
        "In the second case, the referring expression is underconstrained, and so the evaluation would have failed on the constraint that specifies the termination of the addition of modifiers.",
        "In our formalization of the conversational moves, we have equated the first case to reject-plan and the second case to postpone-plan, and their constraints test for the abovementioned conditions.",
        "The actions reject-plan and postpone-plan decompose into the surface speech actions s-reject and s-postpone, respectively.",
        "By observing the surface speech action corresponding to the judgment, the hearer, using plan inference, should be able to derive the speaker's judgment plan.",
        "If the judgment was reject-plan or postpone-plan, then the evaluation of the judgment plan should enable the hearer to determine the action in the referring plan that the speaker found problematic due to the constraints specified in the action schemas.",
        "The identity of the action in error will provide context for the subsequent refashioning of the referring expression.' Refashioning Plans.",
        "If a conversant rejects a referring expression or postpones judgment on it, then either the speaker or the hearer will refashion the expression in the context of the rejection or postponement.",
        "In keeping with Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, we use two discourse plans for refashioning: replace-plan and expand-plan.",
        "The first is",
        "used to replace some of the actions in the referring expression plan with new ones, and the second is to add new actions.",
        "Replacements can be used if the referring expression either overconstrains or underconstrains the choice of referent, while the expansion can be used only if it underconstrains the choice.",
        "So, these plans can check for these conditions.",
        "The decomposition of the refashioning plans encodes how a new referring expression can be constructed from the old one.",
        "This involves three tasks: first, a single candidate referent is chosen; second, the referring expression is refashioned; and third, this is communicated to the hearer by way of the action s-actions, which was already discussed.' The first step involves choosing a candidate.",
        "If the speaker of the refashioning is the agent who initiated the referring expression, then this choice is obviously predetermined.",
        "Otherwise, the speaker must choose the candidate.",
        "Goodman (1985) has addressed this problem for the case of when the referring expression overconstrains the choice of referent.",
        "He uses heuristics to relax the constraints of the description and to pick one that nearly fits it.",
        "This problem is beyond the scope of this paper, and so we choose one of the referents arbitrarily (but see Heeman [19911 for how a simplified version of Goodman's algorithm that relaxes only a single constraint can be incorporated into the planning paradigm).",
        "The second step is to refashion the referring expression so that it identifies the candidate chosen in the first step.",
        "This is done by using plan repair techniques (Hayes 1975; Wilensky 1981; Wilkens 1985).",
        "Our technique is to remove the subplan rooted at the action in error and replan with another action schema inserted in its place.",
        "This technique has been encoded into our refashioning plans, and so can be used for both constructing repairs and inferring how another agent has repaired a plan.",
        "Now we consider the effect of these refashioning plans.",
        "As we mentioned in Section 2, once the refashioning plan is accepted, the common ground of the participants is updated with the new referring expression.",
        "So, the effect of the refashioning plans is that the hearer will believe that the speaker wants the new referring expression plan to replace the current one.",
        "Note that this effect does not make any claims about whether the new expression will in fact enable the successful identification of the referent.",
        "For if it did, and if the new referring expression were invalid, this would imply that the refashioning plan was also invalid, which is contrary to Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs's model of the acceptance process.",
        "So, the understanding of a refashioning does not depend on the understanding of the new proposed referring expression, but only on its derivation."

        "First, we have accounted for the tasks of building a referring expression and identifying its referent by using plan construction and plan inference.",
        "Second, we have accounted for the conversational moves that participants make during the acceptance process by using meta-actions.",
        "Third, we have accounted for collaborative activity by proposing that agents are in a certain mental state that includes a goal, a plan that they are currently considering, and intentions.",
        "This mental state sanctions the acceptance of clarification plans, and sanctions the adoption of goals to clarify.",
        "Although our work has focused on referring expressions, we feel that it is relevant to collaboration in general and to how agents contribute to discourse.",
        "This paper is based on the model of collaboration proposed by Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs (1986).",
        "Their model makes two strong claims about how agents collaborate.",
        "First, it minimizes the distinction between the roles of the person who initiates the referring expression and the person who is trying to identify it.",
        "Both have the same moves available to them, for either can judge the description and either can refashion it.",
        "This allows both participants to contribute without being controlled or impeded by the other.",
        "Second, their model gives special status to the role of the current referring expression (current plan): participants judge and refashion the current referring expression directly, rather than recursively modifying modifications (e.g. Litman and Allen 1987; Chu-Carroll and Carberry 1994) or incrementally adding to the current plan with each accepted proposal (e.g. Traum and Hinkelman 1992; Sidner 1992).",
        "In our work, we have taken Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs's descriptive model and recast it into a computational one, thus demonstrating the computational feasibility of their work and its compatibility with current practices in artificial intelligence.",
        "There are many ways that this research could be extended.",
        "Perhaps the most obvious would be to extend the planning component of our model.",
        "First, our coverage of referring expressions could be extended to handle references to objects in focus and to descriptions that include a plan of physical actions for identifying the referent.",
        "Second, the treatment of clarifications could be improved; specifically, how plan failures are reasoned about, how plan failures affect the agent's beliefs, and how these failures are repaired.",
        "Third, this research needs to be integrated into a more complete plan-based approach to language, and needs to be extended so as to handle more general discourse plan failures (McRoy and Hirst 1993; McRoy and Hirst 1995; Horton and Hirst 1991; Heeman 1993; Edmonds 1994; Hirst et al.",

        "Such a theory would do the following.",
        "First, it would give a more complete motivation for the processing rules that we used for how agents interact in a collaborative activity.",
        "Second, it would account for why agents would enter into such a mode of interaction, how it is initiated, how it is carried forward (especially how agents' beliefs and knowledge influence their actions), and how it ends.",
        "Third, it would be extendable to other forms of interaction, such as information-seeking dialogs.",
        "Fourth, it would specify how collaborative activity could be embedded in, or embed, other types of interactions.",
