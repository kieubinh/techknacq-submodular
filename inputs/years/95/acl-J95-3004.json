        "Yet, the primary point is not to propose a method for morphological disambiguation per se, but rather to suggest a method to compute morpho-lexical probabilities to be used as a linguistic source for morphological disambiguation.",
        "Let us start with a few definitions and terminology that will be used throughout this paper.",
        "We consider written languages, and for the purpose of this paper, a word is a string of letters delimited by spaces or punctuation.",
        "Given a language L, and a word w E L, we can find (manually or automatically by a morphological analyzer for L) all the possible morphological analyses of the word w. Suppose a word w has k different analyses, then A1, .",
        "Ak, will be used to denote these k analyses.",
        "A word is morphologically ambiguous if k > 2.",
        "The number and character of the analyses depend on the language model.",

        ", for each morphologically ambiguous word wi E T, with k analyses: A1, .",
        ", Ak, there is one analysis,' A, E {A1, ...,Ak} that is the",
        "right analysis, while all the other k –1 analyses of w are wrong analyses.",
        "The same word w, in a different text, may have, of course, a different right analysis, thus, right and wrong in this case are meaningful only with respect to the context in which w, appears.",
        "Morphological disambiguation of a text T is done by indicating for each ambiguous word in T – which of its different analyses is the right one.",
        "At present, this can be done manually by a speaker of the language, and hopefully in the future it will be done automatically by a computer program.",
        "When dealing with automatic disambiguation of a text it is sometimes useful to reduce its ambiguity level.",
        "A reduction of the ambiguity level of an ambiguous word w, with k morphological analyses: A1, .",
        "Ak, occurs when it is possible to select from A1, .",
        "Ak, a proper subset of 1 analyses 1 < 1 < k, such that the right analysis of w is one of these 1 analyses.",
        "In the case where 1 = 1, we say that the word w is fully disambiguated.",
        "Since this paper suggests a method for morphological disambiguation using probabilities, the notion of morpho-lexical probabilities is also required.",
        "Our model of the language is based on a large fixed Hebrew corpus.",
        "For a word w with k analyses, A1, , Ak, the morpho-lexical probability of A, is the estimate of the conditional probability P(A, I w) from the given corpus, i.e., Pi = P(Ai no.",

        "Since the word w has exactly k different analyses:",
        "For reasons that will be elaborated in Section 2, our problem is most acute in Hebrew and some other languages (e.g., Arabic), though ambiguity problems of a similar nature occur in other languages.",
        "One such problem is sense disambiguation.",
        "In the context of machine translation, Dagan and Itai (Dagan, Itai, and Schwall 1991; Dagan and Itai 1994) used corpora in the target language to resolve ambiguities in the source language.",

        "Part-of-speech tagging – deciding the correct part of speech in the current context of the sentence – has received major attention.",
        "Most successful methods have followed speech recognition systems (Jelinek, Mercer, and Roukos 1992) and used large corpora to deduce the probability of each part of speech in the current context (usually the two previous words – trigrams).",

        "(The difference in performance is due to different evaluation methods, different tag sets, and different corpora).",
        "See Church (1992) for a survey.",
        "Our work did not use the trigram model, since because of the relatively free word order in Hebrew it was less promising, and also, in some cases the different choices are among words of the same part-of-speech category.",
        "Thus tagging for part of speech alone would not solve our problems.",
        "Note that a single morphological analysis may correspond to several senses.",
        "Even though each sense may have different behavior patterns, in practice this did not present a problem for our program.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Sections 2 through 4 include a description of the morphological ambiguity problem in Hebrew, followed by the claim that knowing the morpho-lexical probabilities of an ambiguous word can be very effective for automatic morphological disambiguation in Hebrew.",
        "Then, in Sections 5 and 6, we present the key idea of this paper: How to acquire a good approximation for the morpho-lexical probabilities from an untagged corpus.",

        "• , Ak, probabilities P1,• • •,Pk that are an approximation to the morpho-lexical probabilities: P1, • • • /Pk.",

        "A description of an experiment that serves to evaluate the approximated morpho-lexical probabilities calculated using an untagged corpus will be given in Section 8.",
        "Finally, in Section 9, a simple strategy for morphological disambiguation in Hebrew using morpho-lexical probabilities will be described.",
        "This simple strategy was used in an experiment conducted in order to test the significance of the morpho-lexical probabilities as a basis for morphological disambiguation in Hebrew.",

        "Thus, finding methods to reduce the morphological ambiguity in the language is a great challenge for researchers in the field and for people who wish to develop natural language applications for Hebrew.",
        "Table 1 demonstrates the dimension of the morphological ambiguity in Hebrew.",
        "The data was obtained by analyzing large texts, randomly chosen from the Hebrew press, consisting of nearly 40,000 word-tokens.",
        "According to this table, the average number of possible analyses per word-token was 2.1, while 55% of the word-tokens were morphologically ambiguous.",
        "The main reason for this amount of ambiguity is the standard writing system used in modern Hebrew (unpointed script).",
        "In this writing system not all the vowels are represented, several letters represent both consonants and different vowels, and gemination is not represented at all (Oman 1986, 1991).",
        "The rich morphology of the language and the fact that many particles are attached to the word, forming a single string, further contribute to the morphological ambiguity.",
        "In order to demonstrate the complexity of the problem, we should take a closer look at Hebrew morphology.",
        "A morphological analysis of a word in Hebrew should extract the following information:",
        "• lexical entry",
        "• category • tense (for verbs only) • attached particles (i.e., prepositions, connectives, determiners) • status – a flag indicating whether a noun is in its construct or absolute form • gender, number, and person (for nouns, adjectives, verbs etc.)",
        "• gender, number, and person of pronoun suffixes For example, the morphological analysis of the Hebrew string 1)11)2,41V.JD1 (written in a Latin transliteration WK$RAYTYW) is as follows: • lexical entry: RAH (Mt1) – the verb 'to see' • category: verb • tense: past • attached particles: W + K$ (VD + 1) = 'and when' • gender: feminine/masculine, number: singular, person: first person • object pronoun: masculine, singular, third person",

        "Eliminating or reducing the ambiguity at this early stage of automatic processing of Hebrew is crucial for the efficiency and the success rate of parsers and other natural language applications.",
        "It should be noted that the morphological ambiguity in Hebrew makes even \"simple\" applications – as is often considered when dealing with other languages – complicated.",
        "One good example for this is full-text retrieval systems (Choueka 1980).",
        "Such systems must handle the morphological ambiguity problem.",
        "To see that, consider, for example, the case where we look for all the texts with the word HQPH ('encirclement').",
        "Without morphological disambiguation, we get many texts which really include the word H+QPH (`-the coffee'), or even HQP+H ('her perimeter') (Oman 1987).",
        "Another application which is more difficult in Hebrew than in other languages is text-to-speech systems, which cannot be implemented in Hebrew without first solving the morphological ambiguity, since in many cases different analyses of a word imply different pronunciations.",
        "A much simpler problem occurs in English, where for some words the correct syntactic tag is necessary for pronunciation (Church 1988).",
        "The notion that this ambiguity problem in Hebrew is very complicated and that it can be dealt with only by using vast syntactic and semantic knowledge has led researchers to look for solutions involving a considerable amount of human interaction.",
        "Oman (1986) for instance, developed a new writing system for Hebrew, called 'The Phonemic Script.' This script enables the user to write Hebrew texts that are morphologically unambiguous, in order to use them later as an input for various kinds of natural language applications.",
        "However, since regular Hebrew texts are not written in this script, they first must be transcribed to phonemic texts.",
        "Choueka and Lusignan (1985) presented a system for the morphological tagging of large texts that is based on the short context of the word but also depends heavily on human interaction.",
        "Methods using the short context of a word in order to resolve ambiguity (usually categorical ambiguity) are very common in English and other languages (DeRose 1988; Church 1988; Karlsson 1990).",
        "A system using this approach was developed by Levinger and Oman in order to serve as a component in their project of morphological disambiguation in Hebrew (Levinger 1992).",
        "The main resource, used by this system for disambiguation, is a set of syntactic constraints that were defined manually by the authors and followed two theoretical works that defined short context rules for Hebrew (Pines 1975; Albeck 1992).",
        "The syntactic constraints approach, which is an extension of the short context approach, was found to be useful and reliable, but its applicability (based on the proportion of ambiguous words that were fully disambiguated) was very poor.",
        "Hence, the overall performance of this system is much less promising in Hebrew than in other languages.",
        "These results can be explained by the following properties of the ambiguity problem in Hebrew: 1.",
        "In many cases two or more alternative analyses share the same category, and hence these alternatives satisfy the same syntactic constraints.",
        "Moreover, there are cases where two or even more analyses share exactly the same morphological attributes and differ only in their lexical entry.",
        "For instance, the word XLW (th) has two such morphological analyses:",
        "(a) The verb XLH (rIn), fem./masc., plural, third person, past tense ('they became ill').",

        "In Hebrew, these words are almost always morphologically ambiguous.",
        "Moreover, many of them appear as prefixes of the word to be analyzed, and their identification is part of the morphological analysis.",
        "We thus have a circularity problem: In order to perform the morphological analysis, we need the short context,",
        " to identify the short context, we have to find anchors, but in order to find such words, we need first to perform the morphological analysis.",

        "An element in this set is another word form of the same lexical entry that has similar morphological attributes to the given analysis.",
        "These words are assumed similar to the analysis in the sense that we expect them to have approximately the same frequency in the language as the analysis they belong to.",
        "A reasonable assumption of this kind would be, for instance, to say that the masculine form of a verb in a certain tense in Hebrew is expected to have approximately the same frequency as the feminine form of the same verb, in the same tense.",
        "This assumption holds for most of the Hebrew verbs, since all Hebrew nouns (and not only animate ones) have the gender attribute.' To see a concrete example, consider the word RAH (nxi) and one of its analyses: the verb 'to see', masculine, singular, third person, past tense.",
