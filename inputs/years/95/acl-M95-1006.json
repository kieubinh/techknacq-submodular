        "Since that time, we have successfully applied probabilistic models to the following:",
        "• part of speech tagging, using Hidden Markov Models (Weischedel, et al., 1993), • judgments of relevance of text (at the paragraph level) via a log odds model (Ayuso, et al., 1992), • learning semantic information (selection restrictions, or case frames) from supervised training (Weischedel, et.",
        "al., 1991, 1993), • learning word and word group associations (Matsukawa, 1993), • an example-based correction technique for segmentation and part-of-speech labeling for Japanese (Matsukawa, Miller, and Weischedel, 1993), and • induction of a statistical grammar and parser from training data (Magerrnan, 1995)."

        "In the last two years we have ported part or all of the PLUM system to several new languages (Chinese, German, Japanese, and Spanish) and new domains (law enforcement, name finding, heterogeneous newswire sources, and labor negotiations).",
        "Though we have a new, fully trainable, full parser of English (Magerman, 1995), there was insufficient time to integrate it into PLUM for the evaluation; as an independent component, it appears to have achieved the highest published evaluation scores for parsers.",
        "The new software developments employed in MUC-6 are",
        "• a stand-alone, C-based name spotter (IdentiFinderim), a rewrite of the initial components of PLUM, • a more robust message reader, • a revised discourse component and output generator to more cleanly separate discourse structures from the final template structure, and • a semantic inference component.",
        "We have begun making a distinction between lightweight techniques and heavyweight processing.",
        "IdentiFinder is made up solely of lightweight techniques, i.e., those that rely only on local processing, do not involve deep understanding, and can be optimized.",

        "Second, since there has been a marked improvement in the quality of full parsers, now achieving an F in the high 80s (Magerman, 1995), we believe it is now feasible to consider using full parsers again.",
        "The rationale is straightforward: for full templates (e.g., ST) scores have been mired with an F in the 50s ever since MUC-3 in 1991.",
        "Pattern matching has given us very robust, very portable technology, but has not broken the performance barrier all systems have run up against.",
        "Recent (statistical) full parsers (e.g., BBN's, IBM's, and UPenn's) have such quantitatively better performance that they are qualitatively better.",
        "We believe this offers the opportunity to again",
