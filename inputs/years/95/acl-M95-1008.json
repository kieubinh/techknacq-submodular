        "Late 1992, we realized that a company like Knight-Ridder Information (Dialog Information Services, at that time) had to get into the business of Value Added Reselling of information.",
        "An obvious question was: what kind of value can be added to the information?",
        "The obvious answer was that the added value should have the same nature as the original: it should be information.",
        "The plan was to introduce NLP into Dialog's technology to add informational value to raw documents.",
        "The industrial environment required that anything we work on has a fmite development time and is usable in production after the development is over.",
        "This dictated stepwise development and required starting with solvable problems.",
        "The obvious choice was smart tokenization, which included named entity detection.",
        "Originally, we tried to buy the technology from outside, so that a full-fledged partnership could be developed based on the initial project.",
        "Two first attempts ended in nothing (although they were quite useful experiences for Dialog, and probably for the potential partners as well).",
        "The third one, with SRI, led to development of the current system, VANF (Value Adding Name Finder), which is routinely used in production at Knight-Ridder Information.",
        "VANF is an independent reimplementation of FASTUS [1].",
        "At first, we wanted to use FASTUS as it was.",
        "However, the production requirements prohibited using a Lisp environment, and we decided to port it (to c++).",
        "A direct port was not feasible; at the same time, SRI decided that a declarative, grammar-like description of FSM was more intuitive and easier to work with than the graphical tools they were using at the time.",
        "So a grammar definition language was defined, we spent some time discussing and refining it, and I implemented an engine for Dialog's version of the language.",
        "Under the contract we had, SRI delivered a transcription of FASTUS rules in the new (declarative) language, although they did not have their own interpreter (nor even a complete language definition) at that time.",
        "Somehow, we made this transcription compile and work in Dialog's system, and used it as the core of VANF.",
        "Currently, about 30% of VANF rules are derived from FASTUS.",
        "Still, VANF should be considered a variation on the theme of FASTUS.",
        "Two thousand documents from different newspapers were processed by human content specialists and the names to be extracted as companies were tagged.",
        "The definition of a \"company\" was \"user oriented\" (e.g. football teams were to be considered companies, while publications, trade unions and government organizations were not).",
        "One thousand of the documents were then used as a training set, and the other 1000 as a blind test set.",

        "The Facts Extraction Engine uses cascaded non-deterministic state machines (cascaded NDFSM) to parse the text and to look for patterns.",
        "A grammar defines a set of NDFSM and the sequence of their application.",
        "The terminal symbols in the grammar are literal words and combinations of syntactic and dictionary flags.",
        "Given a NDFSM Mand a sequence of symbols S",
        "• all the paths are followed; • the longest matching sequence 3[1..i] is considered the result of the application; • the actions corresponding to all the longest paths are executed; • a single output symbol (i.e. a head word with a bunch of attributes) is sent to the next stage.",
        "Then Misapplied to the next segment of S[i+1..].",
        "The output of Misused as the input for another NDFSM.",
        "Each stage is responsible for specific kind of processing (see below).",
        "This approach allows us to restrict non-determinism and prevent combinatorial explosion.",
        "The expressive power of our formalism is the same as that of the attribute grammars; at the same time the efficiency is close to that of finite state machines.",

        "Most important are the actions which assert facts extracted from the text (in the VANF case, the facts are in the form \"NNN is a name of an entity of type X\").",
        "These assertions are not treated as the ultimate truth, but all the evidence is collected and combined by an evidence combiner.",
        "This includes",
        "• matching the variants of names • resolving conflicts between contradicting evidence",
        "• checking the names against the known names database",
        "The document scanner parses the input documents in their native format (fields, SGML tags, etc.",
        "), breaks a document into paragraphs, and does the lexicon lookup.",
        "It also takes care of entities like simple dates, phone numbers, and other regular quasi-lexical units.",

        "3) The chunker (2nd stage of NDFSM) brackets noun phrases and verb groups, replacing them with their head words.",
        "4) The pattern matchers; several stages of NDFSM detect certain interesting types of noun groups using patterns(\"ABC's president X\", and look for other patterns relevant to the VANF task; for each interesting pattern an attached function is executed to pass on a candidate name to the evidence combiner.",
        "5) The evidence combiner (C-1-1-) merges similar names and assigns types to the names whose type could not be derived from the form or from the context; database lookup happens here as well.",
        "Thus, the name type defmition is performed based on several kinds of evidence:",
