        "During the 1980s, General Electric Corporate Research and Development began the design and implementation of a set of text-processing tools known as the NLTooLset.",
        "This suite of tools developed, over time, in cooperation with a subgroup of the Management and Data Systems Operations component of General Electric Aerospace.",
        "Through corporate mergers, this subgroup has become the Language Exploitation Technologies group of the Lockheed Martin Management and Data Systems division.",
        "Over the years, the toolset has evolved into a robust set of aids for text analysis.",
        "It has been used to build a variety of applications, and the knowledge gained from each application has been utilized to improve the toolset, The LOUELLA PARSING system was designed with the latest version of the NLToolset.",

        "In particular, systems were required to mark locations, dates, times, organizations, people, and currency phrases in a text.",
        "2) The evaluation of systems that extract template elements (TE) corresponding to people and organizations from the text.",
        "These templates can be thought of as index cards containing information about people and organizations mentioned in a text.",
        "3) The evaluation of systems that extract information about corporate management successions from a text.",
        "This task is called the \"scenario template\" (ST), and requires a deeper anlysis of the text than the other tasks.",
        "This paper will give an overview of our systems, describe our performance on each of the tasks and the walkthrough article, and discuss areas where our systems need to be improved.",
        "LOUELLA's NE system was developed using the 'spotters\" from the NLToolset.",
        "The TE and ST systems were developed using a range of tools for reference resolution, for information extraction, for simple discourse processing, and for template generation, as well as a variety of spotters for spotting entities.",
