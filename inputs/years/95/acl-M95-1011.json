        "Information extraction research at the University of Massachusetts is based on portable, trainable language processing components.",
        "Some components are more effective than others, some have been under development longer than others, but in all cases, we are working to eliminate manual knowledge engineering.",
        "Although UMass has participated in previous MUC evaluations, all of our information extraction software has been redesigned and rewritten since MUC-5, so we are evaluating a completely new system this year.",
        "In particular, we are working with new string recognition specialists (for Named Entities), a new part-of-speech tagger, a new sentence analyzer, a new and fully automated dictionary construction algorithm, a new discourse analyzer, and a new coreference analyzer.",
        "The most interesting components in our system are CRYSTAL (which generates a concept node dictionary) [13], WRAP-UP (which establishes relational links between entities) [14, 15, 16], and RESOLVE (the coreference analyzer) [8].",
        "Each of these components utilizes machine learning techniques in order to customize crucial extraction capabilities based on representative training texts.",
        "Our preparations for MUC-6 began on June 19 (at the release of the Call for Participation) and ended on October 2 when we began our test runs.",
        "All of our ST-specific training began in September with the release of the ST keys.",
        "As much as we try to exploit trainable technologies, there are nevertheless places where some amount of manual coding is still needed.",
        "For example, we needed to write string manipulation functions to trim output strings in an effort to generate slot fills consistent with the MUC-6 slot fill guidelines.",
        "We also needed to create template parsers and text marking interfaces in order to map the MUC-6 training documents into data usable by our trainable components."

      "heading": "SYSTEM OVERVIEW",
      "text": [
        "At the foundation of all our system configurations are the string specialists: these are the pattern matching routines that attempt to recognize proper names, dates, and other stylized noun phrase descriptions.",
        "The specialists that we used for NE consist of separate routines designed to handle locations, organizations, people, dates, money, and percentages.",
        "The location, organization, and people specialists rely on dictionaries for their recognition.",
        "The organization and people specialists used for NE were based on code (heavily modified) developed in the Information Retrieval Laboratory at UMass.",
        "The dictionaries supporting those specialists were also borrowed from the IR Lab with some adjustments for MUC-6.",
        "All other specialists were developed in the NLP Lab, and the location specialist accessed a dictionary based on a subset of the Gazetteer entries.",
        "The BADGER sentence analyzer refers to a collection of processes associated with part-of-speech (p-o-s) tagging, a trainable decision tree used to locate appositive constructions, local syntactic analysis, and semantic case frame instantiation.",
        "The processing of BADGER is not significantly different than that of the CIRCUS system used in previous MUC evaluations [4, 5, 6].",
        "Concept node (CN) definitions are still used to create case frame instantiations and multiple CN definitions can apply to the same text fragment.",
        "BADGER is domain/task independent and requires no adjustment in order to move from one application to another.",
        "It does depend on CN definitions that are appropriate for a given domain/task, but different CN dictionaries can be plugged into BADGER as fully portable dictionary files.",
        "BADGER also relies on a p-o-s dictionary as well as semantic feature tags, and we do customize a po-s dictionary and a semantic feature hierarchy for specific domains.",
        "This customization is handled manually, but it is not a difficult task.",
        "BADGER currently recognizes 27 p-o-s tags and it took 24 hours to manually create a p-o-s dictionary for MUC-6.",
        "We began with our domain independent core tags lexicon, which includes prepositions, determiners, and a number of common verbs.",
        "We then added terms that occurred 500 or more times in the six years of Wall Street Journal articles (1987-1992) from the Tipster collection, based on manual inspection.",
        "The p-o-s tag lexicon has 2084 entries.",
        "Semantic features were assigned to those same terms and also to those terms of interest to the ST task that appeared in the formal training set (100 texts).",
        "The semantic lexicon has 5453 entries.",
        "We used 45 semantic features and the creation of this semantic tagging dictionary took 36 hours.",
        "The creation of a CN dictionary is now fully automated and accomplished by CRYSTAL, an inductive dictionary construction system.",
        "In previous MUC evaluations we used the AutoSlog system to generate CN dictionaries [10, 11, 12], but AutoSlog required human interaction for a quality control assessment of proposed CN definitions.",
        "CRYSTAL requires no such human review, and creates CN dictionaries on the basis of machine learning techniques [13].",
        "In order to map BADGER output into MUC-6 text annotations, a number of decisions must be made about important noun phrases, including semantic type identification, concept attribute assignments, and coreference recognition.",
        "These decisions are handled primarily by hand-coded consolidation routines, WRAP-UP, a trainable discourse analyzer designed to establish relational links between referents, and RESOLVE, a trainable coreference analyzer.",
        "When WRAP-UP makes a decision about the proper role of a given noun phrase or a possible relationship between two noun phrases, it considers evidence from a variety of sources.",
        "All of the features used by WRAP-UP are extracted using a domain-independent mechanism to encode features from CN slot values, from the relative position of the referents, and from verb patterns in which the noun phrase appeared.",
        "Sometimes these various sources provide consistent interpretations, but they often disagree with one another.",
        "All of WRAP-UP's decisions are handled by trained decision trees so discrepancies in the incoming data are managed on the basis of similar situations encountered during training.",
        "WRAP-UP is most effective when its training has given it the experience it needs to deal with various kinds of incongruencies.",
        "RESOLVE handles all the crucial merging decisions used by consolidation and WRAP-UP.",
        "It determines when two noun phrases refer to the same entity and should therefore be merged in order to consolidate feature descriptors into a single entity description.",
        "If RESOLVE merges entities too aggressively, recall will fall, and if RESOLVE is too passive in its merging decisions, precision will suffer due to spurious entities.",
        "RESOLVE's decisions are based on a decision tree induced from feature vector representations of noun phrases.",
        "Some of the features used in these representations are domain independent, and some are created for specific domains.",
        "The version of RESOLVE used for TE and ST relied on a subset of its domain-independent feature set rather than the larger, domain-enhanced feature set used for the CO task.",
        "TE and ST would probably have benefited from the larger feature set used for the CO task, but there was not enough time to incorporate all of RESOLVE's features into the systems used for the TE and ST tasks.",
        "Space prohibits us from going into much detail about each of the major components in our various MUC-6 system configurations, so we will concentrate on the trainable components that were present in the TB, CO, and ST tasks.",
        "Since different tasks required different configurations, we summarize the relevant system components in the table below:",
        "We also note that some major system components were designed and implemented during our preparations for MUC-6, including all the string specialists, all the consolidation routines, template parsers and text-marking interfaces to translate MUC-6 training documents into formats compatible with our various trainable components, and a completely new implementation of WRAP-UP."

        "RESOLVE succeeds here by examining pairwise combinations of noun phrases (NPs).",
        "The pairwise examination of NPs is handled by a C4.5 decision tree.",
        "This tree was created by an inductive algorithm in response to a collection of representative NP pairs extracted from available training data.",
        "The complete tree is large, containing 133 nodes or possible decisions points.",
        "To get a feel for the RESOLVE d-tree, we present a piece of the tree starting at the root node.",

        "Decision points are more reliable when a large number of training instances are examined for a given condition.",
        "The ALIAS feature is the root node of the tree.",
        "This feature is true when an NP is a recognized alias of the other NP (e.g. \"GM\" is an alias of \"General Motors Corp.\").",

        "This feature is true when phrase-1 and phrase-2 are compatible (number and gender), and when phrase-1 is the most recent SUBJECT in the text.",
        "This feature was included specifically to handle pronoun resolution, and represents a variation on the well-known heuristic of merging with any referent found in the most recent compatible phrase.",
        "However, RESOLVE's version adds an extra constraint: the previous phrase must be found in the SUBJECT buffer.",
        "If phrase-1 is the MOST-RECENT-COMPATIBLE-SUBJECT, and NAME-2 = No (i.e., phrase-2 has no name information - meaning that its probably a pronoun or other anaphoric reference), then the phrases are judged coreferent.",
        "If phrase-2 does have name information (NAME-2 = Yes), but phrase-1 does not have name information (NAME-1 = No), then they are also judged coreferent.",
        "It is interesting to note that SAME-TYPE is not checked until the fourth layer of the tree: if SAME-TYPE = No, then they are not coreferent.",
        "One might reasonably expect to see this at the root node since incompatible types should certainly be strong evidence for non coreference.",
        "But keep in mind that RESOLVE was not trained on perfect data.",
        "If NPs were not processed correctly by the string specialists, then RESOLVE is right to reduce its confidence in the SAME-TYPE feature accordingly.",
        "We know from our NE evaluation, that our string specialists sometimes",
        "labeled an organization as a person or location by mistake.",
        "This created a significant noise level for SAME-TYPE, enough to render the feature questionable.",
        "Had SAME-TYPE been more reliable, it probably would have found its way to the top of the tree.",
        "Here is a rundown of how the features at the top of RESOLVE's decision tree were operating during the complete walkthrough text: ALIAS = YES was used for 25 instances.",
        "Every instance was correctly classified, though 4 instances were scored incorrect due to faulty string trimming.",
        "SAME-STRING = YES was used for 19 instances.",
        "14 of those were correctly classified; all the misclassified instances were \"it\" phrases, so a little contextual knowledge would have probably helped (all \"it\" phrases were attempted, but many were irrelevant).",
        "MOST-RECENT-COMPATIBLE-SUBJECT = YES was used for 2 instances.",
        "Both times it misclassified the instances.",
        "This feature was supposed to apply only to pronouns and generic descriptions (\"the company\"), but in looking over the code for this feature extractor, we see that it was not properly constrained.",
        "PERSON-IS-ROLE = YES This feature was never used in the walk-through text.",
        "If the patterns used in this feature extractor were expanded (to include, for example, \"IS STEPPING DOWN AS\"), then it might have been more useful.",
        "To understand how RESOLVE handled our focus sentence, we have to examine portions of the tree further from the root.",
        "It appears that the following decision points were important for this sentence:",
        "Some intermediate nodes have been removed (all had value \"NO\").",
        "These branch points indicate that anytime we had two references to the same type of object, neither phrase is a pronoun, the second phrase is not a proper name, both are in the same sentence, and the first phrase is a proper name, then RESOLVE classified the two references as coreferent.",
        "The numbers at the leaf node (NAME-1 = YES) indicate that there were 20 instances that had the same feature values in the training set, and that 12 of these were positive and 8 were negative.",
        "Since the default classification for an ambiguous leaf node -- a leaf node that contained both positive and negative instances -- was to take the \"majority class\", the tree returned \"+\".",
        "This may seem to be an unintuitive and risky pattern for coreference classification, but in fact, this processing turned out to be correct in the walk-through text whenever RESOLVE received correctly extracted NPs.",
        "The only time it erred was when RESOLVE was handed badly trimmed phrases or phrases with incorrect semantic features.",
        "So we've stumbled upon a rule induced by RESOLVE that probably wouldn't have been discovered manually.",

        "Another reason for specially marking ST texts was a hope that the CO training could also be used for coreference resolution in the TE and ST tasks; unfortunately, time constraints prevented us from using this domain-specific coreference resolution training in the latter two tasks.",

        "Here is the TE score report that results from this minimal CN dictionary:",
        "In our system design, the ST task is equivalent to TE plus scenario-specific CNs for changes in position and status and WRAP-UP.",
        "WRAP-UP is responsible for all the relational links that describe successions and in-and-out instances.",
        "So it is fair to expect that TE will operate as an upper bound for ST.",
        "But we see significant drops in both recall and precision as we move from TE to ST. Part of this drop in recall and precision comes from low recall for new status, which is critical to this scenario.",
        "Persons and organizations which are not involved in a change of job status are discarded as irrelevant.",
        "CRYSTAL learned CNs named STATUS-IN and STATUS-OUT to identify persons involved in a change of status.",
        "The ST training texts provided only about 150 instances each for STATUS-IN and STATUS-OUT, which was insufficient training.",
        "CRYSTAL had limited recall for these CNs.",
        "WRAP-UP takes as input the output from BADGER and forms In-and-Out relations and Succession events.",
        "WRAP-UP learns to discard as irrelevant any persons and organizations that are not attached to an In-and-Out or a Succession.",
        "When our system does not extract a new status due to low recall by domain-specific CNs, this can cause WRAP-UP to discard relevant persons and organizations, further lowering recall.",
        "We believe that the training available to CRYSTAL and WRAP-UP was too sparse to enable intelligent inferences about succession events.",
        "The following graph shows the learning curve for CN definitions that identified Organization names.",
        "The 300 available TE texts were randomly partitioned into training set and a blind test set with training size ranging from 10% to 90% of the documents.",
        "This graph shows the average recall and precision for 50 random partitionings at each training size.",
        "This data suggests that ORG was probably finding quite a few of the organizations missed by the scanner, but it needed more training.",
        "Recall and precision had not leveled out after 270 training texts.",
        "With almost no training it got a fourth of the org names (relying heavily on the scanner).",
        "After 270 training texts it was getting half the org names, but appears from the slope of the learning curve that it was not reaching saturation yet.",
        "We expect that WRAP-UP would tell a similar story if we were to compute the learning curve for key relational decisions.",
        "Inductive learning algorithms eventually flatten out with enough training, but performance tends to increase steadily up until that plateau is reached.",
        "Although CRYSTAL was trained on 300 TE documents, WRAP-UP was only trained on 100 ST documents.",
        "The ST training corpus was undoubtedly much too small to support an inductive algorithm designed to learn relational decisions.",
        "Trainable technologies are valuable in the battle against the knowledge engineering bottleneck, but we feel that it is important to provide adequate levels of training in order to realize their potential."

      "text": [
        "In the time that has passed since MUC-5 we have been exploring trainable information extraction technologies in a number of different application areas [1, 7].",
        "We have rewritten all of our software in order to enhance cross-platform portability.",
        "In addition, we have exploited tagged text documents of the type used in MUC-6.",
        "Our experiences with previous MUC evaluations gave us a clear understanding of the hurdles that lie ahead.",
        "We made progress in some areas and ignored others completely.",
        "Over the years we have come to appreciate the significant difficulties of software evaluation and the unique problems associated with language processing evaluations.",
        "We have pondered the lessons of previous MUCs and worried about the wisdom of a research agenda dominated by score reports.",
        "Do performance evaluations succeed in bringing theoretical ideas closer to real-world systems?",
        "Or do they inadvertently create a wedge between basic research and applied research?",
        "These big questions are easier to ask than answer, but we have always found the MUC evaluations to be valuable for our own system development efforts.",
        "There are always lessons to be learned and a few genuinely new ideas to ponder as well.",
        "Two of this year's lessons are painfully obvious to us.",
        "Most notably, it pays to engineer the best possible string specialists.",
        "If you fail to recognize half of the organizations in a test set, it will be difficult to do well on extraction tasks involving organizations.",
        "It is also a mistake to rely on a trainable system component that is not given enough training.",
        "We learned that 100 documents do not provide enough training for our system.",
        "Other lessons are more subtle and were not immediately obvious (at least to us).",
        "Most notably, the TE task for MUC-6 could be effectively tackled without the benefit of a sentence analyzer.",
        "Noun phrase analysis was very important, and coreference resolution played a role, but we saw no benefit from CRYSTAL's dictionary for TE.",
        "If the CN definitions had been operating at a finer level of granularity, we might have been able to acquire useful extraction rules for noun phrase analysis.",
        "Although our current version of CRYSTAL does not operate at this level, we are currently developing a version of CRYSTAL to learn finer-grained CN definitions.",
        "BADGER's CN output was put to better use in ST where WRAP-UP used CN patterns in order to induce relations between entities.",
        "Unfortunately, there was not enough training to produce effective decision trees, so WRAP-UP didn't exactly get a fair trial here.",
        "We also noticed that CRYSTAL's dictionary was too sparse to cover all the useful morphological variants for important verbs and verb phrases.",
        "In previous MUC evaluations, where 1,000 or more training documents were provided, our dictionary construction tool picked up the more important morphological variants because the training corpus contained examples of them.",
        "With only 100 ST training documents this year, our dictionary was missing important verb constructions.",
        "For example, the training corpus contained a past tense instance for a specific verb but no present progressive instance.",
        "It appears that 100 training texts are not enough for CRYSTAL's dictionary induction algorithm.",
        "Or at the very least, a CRYSTAL dictionary based on so little training should be strengthened with recognition routines for morphological variants.",
        "These problems do not reflect any essential weakness on the part of CRYSTAL's learning algorithm: they merely illustrate the importance of adequate training materials for machine learning algorithms.",
        "In spite of these difficulties, we are quite pleased with the portability of our trainable system components.",
        "The one-month time frame for ST was not a problem for us as far as CRYSTAL, WRAP-UP, and RESOLVE were concerned.",
        "CRYSTAL and WRAP-UP could have trained on 1000 texts as easily as 100, and RESOLVE would have been in the same boat if it had been able to train from the MUC-annotated documents directly.",
        "The manual text annotations required for RESOLVE provide us with our final observation about MUC-6 and our MUC-6 system.",
        "When a trainable system relies on annotated texts for training, some annotations are more useful than others.",
        "Because RESOLVE was designed without any concern for the task definition of the MUC-6 CO task, the training annotations we developed for RESOLVE were not deducible from the annotation system used in MUC-6.",
        "As other trainable text processing technologies emerge and develop independent from MUC-6, it may be impossible to create an annotation system that is equally accommodating to all.",
        "The inevitable politics of such a",
        "situation will be difficult to mediate unless all sites agree to follow the lead of MUC annotation conventions for their own internal development efforts.",
        "Although this would ease the problem of diverging systems, it might also suppress imaginative new perspectives on the coreference problem.",
        "This conundrum has all the earmarks of a no-win situation.",
        "In summary, our greatest concern after MUC-6 is that the preparation of adequate training corpora may be too expensive or too labor-intensive to enable a fair evaluation of trainable text processing technologies.",
        "This will either drive those technologies \"underground\" (at least with rrespect to MUC meetings), or it may discourage a whole line of research which we feel holds great promise.",
        "In our experience, it seems clear that annotated text documents are much less difficult to generate than the key templates used in previous MUC evaluations.",
        "It therefore seems ironic to find such a small collection of training documents available to MUC-6 participants this year.",
        "We hope that this decision to minimize the training corpus can be reconsidered for future evaluations."
