        "For a little over two years, Sterling Software ITD has been developing the Automatic Templating System (ATS) [1] for automatically extracting entity and event data in the counter-narcotics domain from military messages.",
        "This system, part of the Counter Drug Intelligence System (CDIS), was built around the NLToolset [2], which was originally developed by GE and is now being developed and supported by Lockheed-Martin.",
        "Early results showed that the system was performing better than the human analysts in all aspects.",
        "ATS was in its final delivery phase at the same time as our MUC-6 development.",
        "We elected to participate despite this conflict, but it did limit us to 4 person-weeks on MUC-6, forcing us to scale back from our original plans and only participate in the NE and TE tasks.",
        "The results were more than gratifying."

        "Our MUC-6 system (Figure 1) consists of 5 major components, applied in sequence: Lexical Analysis, Reduction, Extraction, Merging, Postprocessing.",
        "It was designed to share as much of the processing sequence between tasks as possible.",
        "The processing for NE followed the identical sequence of steps (Lexical Analysis, and Reduction) as was followed for the TE and ST tasks, then diverged to its own Postprocessing component to write the NE file.",
        "The Reduction steps taken to identify portions of text for marking in NE also filled the slots with the appropriate text for the TE task.",
        "The processing specific to ST diverged after all the phrase-level Reductions for NE and TE had been performed."

    {
      "heading": "Lexical Analysis",
      "text": [
        "The Lexical Analysis component has several subcomponents.",
        "First, a tokenizer converts the input string for the entire article into a sequence of tokens.",
        "We modified the NLToolset-supplied tokenizer to try to prevent it from reordering or dropping text in ways that made it difficult to map back to the original text when writing the NE output file; we also modified it to preserve upper vs lower-case information.",
        "The second step in Lexical Analysis is the actual lexicon lookup, which attaches information from the lexicon to the tokens.",
        "This includes morphological analysis, which was useful primarily for determining the root form of nationalities, such as \"Canadian\" -> CANADA.",
        "It also includes finding multi-token lexicon entries, such as \"New York\" and \"Coca-Cola\".",
        "Since we weren't using the parser, the part-of-speech obtained by a lexical lookup was of interest mainly if it was something like city-name or orgname; we did also try to prevent the inappropriate inclusion of verbs, prepositions, etc in names, with mixed results.",
        "The third step in Lexical Analysis is the insertion of special marker tokens to indicate capitalized words.",
        "This was needed to be able to usethat information in name recognition, since there did not appear to be any good way to get the pattern matcher to use the capitalization information contained in the original tokens.",
        "Finally, Lexical Analysis splits the token sequence into sentences, including one each for headline, dateline, and date."
      ]
    },
    {
      "heading": "Reduction",
      "text": [
        "The Reduction components each consist of one or more stages of applying the NLToolset's pattern matcher to phrases.",
        "Any phrase matched is \"reduced\", usually but not always to a single multi-token, or \"mtoken\".",
        "In each stage, all the patterns appropriate to that stage are tried on each sentence in turn.",
        "The very first reduction stage is a \"junk\" reduction to delete tables so they are not seen by subsequent reduction stages.",
        "Each subsequent reduction has two useful side-effects: 1) identifying which tokens form the heart of the reduction and therefore should be marked for the NE task, and 2) filling the slots of the mtokens with appropriate pieces of the text that was reduced, for the TE task.",
        "Note that these two purposes often conflict -- for example, city, state references and date ranges were supposed to have pieces marked separately, but were reduced to single mtokens with one set of slot fillers.",
        "This called for some careful engineering.",
        "The applications of reduction patterns are done in sequence rather than all at once for a number of reasons: First, some references to a person, organization, or location may not be recognizable by themselves, but other references to the same thing may be easier to spot.",
        "Therefore, every new thing reduced is added to a temporary lexicon, and another reduction step is applied to look for other references (with certain allowed variations) to those same things; for example, relatively easy-to-recognize references to \"Mr. Jones\" or \"Robert L. James\" would enable later recognition of the more problematic \"Barnaby Jones\" and \"James\".",
        "And when adding to this lexicon, appropriate variations in an (organization) name are included so that they would be recognized if they occured; for example:",
        "When such a \"secondary\" organization reference is reduced, the text is put in the org_alias slot; the full form is pulled from the lexicon and put in the org_name slot to ensure proper merging (see below) of the two referents.",
        "Second, the results of reductions can be used to provide additional context for later reductions; for example, person reduction is done after organization, so a reduced organization can help the pattern matcher recognize a person, as in the token sequence [ARTIE MCDONALD , *ORG* 'S PRESIDENT], where *ORG* is the mtoken produced by the earlier reduction.",
        "A reduction can also involve multiple previously-reduced mtokens, filling the slots of one with information from another; for example, the reduction of the token sequence rORG* , A *LOC* - BASED MANUFACTURER] includes filling the org_descriptor, org_locale, and org_country slots of *ORG* with the descriptive phrase and the information from *LOC*."

      "heading": "Extraction",
      "text": [
        "An Extraction component uses the results of a pattern match to generate an \"expectation\" and fill its slots with pieces of the text matched.",
        "For ST, a typical expectation represents an event, with the person, organization, date, etc mtokens in the clause that was matched being used to fill its slots.",
        "For TE, each expectation is a trivial one containing one person or organization."
      ]
    },
    {
      "heading": "Merging",
      "text": [
        "The NLToolset provides a merging tool, which merges expectations of the same type (person, organization, etc) as long as the fillers of their corresponding slots do not conflict; a conflict occurs if both have a filler, the fillers are different, and the slot is not allowed to have multiple fillers.",
        "Obviously, the org_alias and org_descriptor slots were allowed to have multiple fillers and org_name was not.",
        "During reduction, our system actually splits a person's name across slots called given_name, family_name, and suffix_name, so that the expectations for, say, \"Harry L. James, Jr.\" and \"Mr. James\" would be merged.",
        "It also carefully fills slots such as org_type and a few others added just for this purpose so as to prevent improper merges; for example, it reduces the token sequence [THE *ORG* UNIT] to two *ORG* mtokens, one old and one new, with slots filled so that they could not merge with each other.",
        "Initially, we relied on this merging tool to bring together separated org names and descriptors, such as \"NEC Corp. ... the giant Japanese computer manufacturer\".",
        "We soon found, however, that even with careful use of slot fillers to prevent descriptors for commercial organizations from merging with, say, the name of a government organization or a library, too many merges were incorrect.",
        "We therefore devised a separate stack mechanism which keeps track of the org mtokens for each sentence; when an org descriptor is reduced in the final TE reduction stage, the stack is searched starting at the current sentence, to find the closest suitable referent that precedes the descriptor, and to add the descriptor text to the mtoken for that referent.",
        "This approach worked quite well."

        "For the NE task, the postprocessing step consists of traversing the token sequences in parallel with the original text, writing the original text and inserting markers as the reduction results attached to each token indicated.",
        "We had to go back to original text to include those portions of the article header which were not processed, and to recover from cases where the tokenizer had dropped characters despite our modifications.",
        "For the TE task, the postprocessing step consists of traversing the list of expectations and writing a template for each, performing final clean-ups like removing duplicate aliases, combining the person_name pieces, skipping slots used only to control merging, etc."

      "text": [
        "The bulk of the time spent in knowledge engineering was spent developing the patterns for all the Reduction and Extraction stages.",
        "These patterns were devised to take advantage of all the local contextual clues we could come up with, including upper vs lower-case information and descriptive appositives.",
        "Our results show that this approach works well; and the modularity of the patterns makes it easy to add coverage as we discover additional clues (such as those we discuss in the walkthrough with respect to organizations).",
        "The reliance on case information meant that headlines were a bit of a problem; despite giving them somewhat special treatment, our error rate was higher there than elsewhere:",
        "There was some lexicon work, as well.",
        "This included entries for all the countries, with alternate phrases (such as \"West Germany\" for \"Federal Republic of Germany\") and irregular derivations (such as \"Dutch\" for \"Netherlands\"), and entries for major cities and geographical regions, with their country information included.",
        "For organizations, we limited it to a few dozen major ones that have no reliable internal clues and often occur without any contextual clues (such as \"White House\", \"Fannie Mae\", \"Big Board\", \"Coca-Cola\" and \"Coke\", \"Macy's\", \"Exxon\", etc).",
        "The results on the walkthrough article (see Table 1) compared to our overall results show that this was indeed a relatively difficult article.",
        "They show three issues worth discussing.",
        "First, we had low precision on timex.",
        "Two out of the three \"spurious\" dates are due to our apparently mistaken belief that \"yesterday\" and \"tomorrow\" were supposed to be marked.",
        "This knowledge engineering error led to the worst recall or precision number on our overall NE results, a precision on timex of 84; avoiding that error would have raised it to 94.",
        "Second, recall and precision on organizations was a bit low.",
        "The system missed both \"Fallon McElligott\" and \"McCann-Erickson\".",
        "On the former, a phrase like \"ad agency Fallon McElligott\" would have caused it to be found, but the actual phrase \"other ad agencies, such as Fallon McElligott\" did not.",
        "On the latter, not having a pattern to cover things like \"chief executive officer of McCann-Erickson\" was an omission on our part.",
        "Other organization errors were: getting \"New York Times\", which in this article is incorrect; missing the two descriptors for \"Ammirati & Pulls\" and the locale for \"Coca-Cola\".",
        "The locale error points out another major cause of poor results -- a next-to-last-minute change in the final 'TE pattern for picking up combination of organization name plus location and/or descriptor, inadequately tested, led to inadvertantly dropping coverage of the most basic of combinations: rORG* $1prep *LOCI, where $1prep is a macro for: \"one of ',\"in\"of\".",
        "This unfortunate error had the following effect on total locale slot score on TE:",
        "After the Lexical Analysis, the input string has been converted into a list of 52 sentences, each sentence containing a list of tokens; this list includes *CAP* tokens inserted in front of every capitalized token.",
        "Attached to each token is the result of the lexical lookup.",
        "Note that at this point lexical lookup has replaced the surface representation of \"Coke\" and \"CEO\" with their \"canonical\" forms.",
        "Every token contains its original string, so we can still recover it for use in filling slots.",
        "The lookup on \"Atlanta\" has provided the information that it is a city and that its country is the US."

        "These results show that our semantic-pattern-based approach to entity detection and templating is a very good one, and one which can be brought to bear on a new application quickly.",
        "As we have noted, dramatic improvements in the worst numbers (timex in NE, org locale and country in 'TE) would have been obtained with very minor changes in the patterns -- literally, a couple hours worth of work.",
        "The org locale fix would actually have given us the highest f-measure on that category: 61.3.",
        "Despite that \"couple hours\" estimate, we would have to say that our greatest limiting factor was",
        "time -- time to test more thoroughly and isolate the causes of the biggest problems.",
        "Slowness of the system was a problem but not a major one, as it took only a minute or two per article.",
        "After those two improvements, we turn to the problem of org descriptors -- although we had the highest f-measure, it was only 43.6, which shows that there is still room for improvement.",
        "Here, the solutions are less obvious.",
        "One step to take is to add to the patterns to allow modifier phrases after the head noun in a descriptor noun phrase, such as \"the agency with billings of $400 million\".",
        "More exploration is needed on this, especially in light of the fact that both the recall and precision rates were low.",
        "Another area where we would like to make changes is in the order of reduction stages.",
        "For example, the system currently does all person reductions after organization reductions.",
        "This meant we had to prevent the secondary organization reduction from matching what are clearly person names (eg: primary \"Schecter Group\" -/-> secondary \"Mr. Schecter\").",
        "The solution, clearly, is to apply some of the person patterns before the organization patterns.",
