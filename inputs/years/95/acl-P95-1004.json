        "Semitic is known amongst computational linguists, in particular computational morphologists, for its highly inflexional morphology.",
        "Its root-and-pattern phenomenon not only poses difficulties for a morphological system, but also makes error detection a difficult task.",
        "This paper aims at presenting a morphographernic model which can cope with both issues.",
        "The following convention has been adopted.",
        "Morphemes are represented in braces, { }, surface (phonological) forms in solidi, / /, and orthographic strings in acute brackets, ( ).",
        "In examples of grammars, variables begin with a capital letter.",
        "Cs denote consonants, Vs denote vowels and a bar denotes complement.",
        "An asterisk, *, indicates ill-formed strings.",
        "The difficulties in morphological analysis and error detection in Semitic arise from the following facts: * Supported by a British Telecom Scholarship, administered by the Cambridge Commonwealth Trust in conjunction with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.",
        "t Supported by a Benefactor Studentship from St John's College.",
        "• Non-Linearity A Semitic stem consists of a",
        "root and a vowel melody, arranged according to a canonical pattern.",
        "For example, Arabic /kuttib/ 'caused to write - perfect pas-sive' is composed from the root morpheme {ktb} 'notion of writing' and the vowel melody morpheme {Ili} 'perfect passive'; the two are arranged according to the pattern morpheme {CVCCVC} 'causative'.",
        "This phenomenon is analysed by (McCarthy, 1981) along the lines of autosegmental phonology (Goldsmith, 1976).",
        "The analysis appears in (1).1",
        "• Vocalisation Orthographically, Semitic texts appear in three forms: (i) consonantal texts do not incorporate any short vowels but ma-tres lectionis,2 e.g. Arabic (ktb) for Acatab/, /kutib/ and /kutub/, but (kaatb) for /kaatab/",
        "and /lcaatibh (ii) partially vocalised texts incorporate some short vowels to clarify ambiguity, e.g. (kutb) for /kutib/ to distinguish it from /katab/; and (iii) vocalised texts incorporate full vocalisation, e.g. (tadahraj) for /tada.hraj/.",
        "1We have used the CV model to describe pattern morphemes instead of prosodic terms because of its familiarity in the computational linguistics literature.",
        "For the use of morale and affixational models in handling Arabic morphology computationally, see (Kiraz, ).",
        "21Mothers of reading', these are consonantal letters which play the role of long vowels, and are represented in the pattern morpheme by VV (e.g. /aa/, /uu/, /ii/).",
        "Matres lectionis cannot be omitted from the orthographic string.",
        "• Vowel and Diacritic Shifts Semitic languages employ a large number of diacritics to represent enter alio short vowels, doubled letters, and nunation.3 Most editors allow the user to enter such diacritics above and below letters.",
        "To speed data entry, the user usually enters the base characters (say a paragraph) and then goes back and enters the diacritics.",
        "A common mistake is to place the cursor one extra position to the left when entering diacritics.",
        "This results in the vowels being shifted one position, e.g. *(wkatubi) instead of (wakutib).",
        "• Vocalisms The quality of the perfect and imperfect vowels of the basic forms of the Semitic verbs are idiosyncratic.",
        "For example, the Syriac root {ktb} takes the perfect vowel a, e.g. /ktab/, while the root Inht1 takes the vowel e, e.g. /nhet/.",
        "It is common among learners to make mistakes such as */kteb/ or */nhat/.",
        "• Phonetic Syncopation A consonantal segment may be omitted from the phonetic surface form, but maintained in the orthographic surface from.",
        "For example, Syriac (mclinta.",
        ")`city' is pronounced fmdital.",
        "• Idiosyncrasies The application of a mor-phographemic rule may have constraints as on which lexical morphemes it may or may not apply.",
        "For example, the glottal stop [P] at the end of a stem may become [w] when followed by the relative adjective morpheme {iyy}, as in Arabic /samaa2-4-iyy/ -+ /samaawiyy/ 'heavenly', but /hawaaP-Fiyy/ /hawaaPiyy/ 'of air'.",
        "• Morphosyntactic Issues In broken plurals, diminutives and deverbal nouns, the user may enter a morphologically sound, but morphosyn-tactically ill-formed word.",
        "We shall discuss this in more detail in section 4•4",
        "To the above, one adds language-independent issues in spell checking such as the four Damerau transformations: omission, insertion, transposition and substitution (Damerau, 1964)."
