        "We identify a number of situations where the two accounts make different predictions, and find that generally the LCG account is superior.",
        "In the process we provide analyses for a number of constructions that have been recognized as problematic for 'unification-based' accounts of agreements (Zaenen and Karttunen, 1984; Pullum and Zwicky, 1986; In-gria, 1990).",
        "Our account builds on the analysis of coordination in applicative categorial grammar in Bayer (1994) and the treatment of Boolean connectives in LCG provided by Morrill (1992).",

        "In LCG semantic interpretation and long distance dependencies are handled independently of the feature system, so agreement phenomena seem to be the major application of a feature system for LCG.",
        "Since only a finite number of feature distinctions need to be made in all the cases of agreement we know of, we posit only a very simple feature system here.",
        "Roughly speaking, features will be treated as atomic propositions (we have no need to separate them into attributes and values), and a simple category will be a Boolean combination of such atomic 'features' (since we have no reason to posit a recursive feature structures either).",

        "al.",
        "(1994) show how a full attribute-value feature structure system having the properties described here can be incorporated into LCG.",

        "Formally, we adopt Morrill's treatment (Morrill, 1992) of the (semantically impotent) Boolean connectives 'A' and V (Morrill named these and 'LI' respectively).",
        "Given a set of atomic features F, we define the set of feature terms 'T and categories C as follows, where `/' and `V are the standard LCG forward and backward implication operators.",
        "In general, atomic categories in a standard categorial grammar will be replaced in our analyses with formulae drawn from T. For example, the NP Kim might be assigned by the lexicon to the category npAsgA3, the verb sleeps to the category s\\npAsgA3,",
        "and the verb slept (which does not impose person or number features on its subject) to the category s\\np.",
        "To simplify the presentation of the proofs, we formulate our system in natural deduction terms, and specify the properties of the Boolean connectives using the single inference rule P, rather than providing separate rules for each connective.",
        " – P where 0 I 7,b in the propositional calculus.",
        "The rule P allows us to replace any formula in T with a logically weaker one.",
        "For example, since Kim is assigned to the category npAsgA3, then by rule P it will belong to np as well.",
        "Finally, we assume the standard LCG introduction and elimination rules for the directed implication operators.",
        "This example brings out one of the fundamental differences between the standard treatment of agreement in 'unification-based' grammar and this treatment of agreement in LCG.",
        "In the 'unification-based' accounts agreement is generally a symmetric relationship between the agreeing constituents: both agreeing constituents impose constraints on a shared agreement value, and the construction is well-formed if these constraints are consistent.",
        "However, in the LCG treatment of agreement proposed here agreement is inherently asymmetric, in 'Because conjunction and disjunction are the only connectives we permit, it does not matter whether we use the classical or intuitionistic propositional calculus here.",

        "al.",
        "(1985) analysis discussed below, disjunction is not required in any of the LCG analyses below.",
        "However, Bayer (1994) argues that such a decomposition is not always plausible.",
        "that an argument must logically imply, or be subsumed by, the antecedent of the predicate it combines with.",
        "Thus in the example above, the rule P could be used to 'weaken' the argument from npAsgA3 to np, but it would not allow rip (without agreement features) to be 'strengthened' to, say, npAsgA3.",
        "Abstracting from the details of the feature systems, we can characterize the 'unification-based' approach as one in which agreement is possible between two constituents with feature specifications 0 and tk if 0 and tk are consistent, whereas the LCG approach requires that the argument 0 implies the corresponding antecedent of the predicate (i.e., 0)• Interestingly, in cases where features are fully specified, these subsumption and consistency requirements are equivalent.",
        "More precisely, say that a formula 0 from a feature constraint language fixes an atomic feature constraint x if x or 0 k For example, in single-valued feature systems (person) = 1 and (person) = 3 both fix (person) =1, (person) = 2, (person) = 3, etc., and in general all fully-specified agreement constraints fix the same set of formulae.",
        "Now let 0 and lk be two satisfiable formulae that fix the same set of atomic feature constraints.",
        "Then 0 A 0 is consistent if i,/).",
        "To see this, note that because 0 and ik fix the same set of formulae, each condition holds if 0 and are elementarily equivalent (i.e., for each feature constraint x, x iff X).",
        "However, the role of partial agreement feature specifications in the two systems is very different.",
        "The following sections explore the empirical consequences of these two approaches.",
        "We focus on coordination phenomena because this is the one area of the grammar where underspecified agreement features seem to play a crucial linguistic role, and cannot be regarded merely as an abbreviatory device for a disjunction of fully-specified agreement values."

        "On the other hand, a verb such as grew which selects solely AP complements (3a) requires that its complement satisfies (noun) = +, (verb) = -F. Thus the features on the coordinate structure in (3b) must include (verb) = + and so do not subsume the (verb) – feature on the NP complement, correctly predicting the ungrammaticality of (3b).",

        "(This weakening also takes place in non-coordination examples such as Kim became wealthy).",
        "On the other hand, (3b) is correctly predicted to be ill-formed because the strongest possible category for the coordination is npvap, but this does not imply the 'stronger' ap antecedent of grew, so the derivation in Figure 3 cannot proceed to form a vp.",
        "Thus on these examples, the feature-based subsumption account and the LCG of complement coordination constructions impose similiar feature constraints; they both require that the predicate's feature specification of the complement subsumes the features of each of the arguments.",

        "associated with each conjunct, while in the LCG account the features associated with the complement specification in a predicate must subsume those associated with the complement itself.",
        "Now consider the related construction in (4) involving conjoined predicates as well conjoined arguments.",
        "Similar constructions, and their relevance to the GPSG treatment of coordination, were first discussed by Jacobson (1987).",

        "Because the subsumption constraint in the LCG analysis is associated with the predicate-argument relationship (rather than the coordination construction, as in the feature-based subsumption account), an LCG analysis paralleling the one given in Figure 4 does not exist.",
        "By introducing and withdrawing a hypothetical ap constituent as shown in Figure 5 it is possible to conjoin grew and remained, but the resulting conjunction belongs to the category vplap, and cannot combine with the wealthy and a Republican, which belongs to the category npvap.",

        "the subproof showing that remained belongs to category vplap in Figure 5).",
        "As we remarked earlier, in LCG predicates are analysed as (directed) implicational formulae, and the argument features required by a predicate appear in the antecedent of such formulae.",

        "This paper has examined some of the differences between a standard complex feature-structure account of agreement, which is fundamentally organized around a notion of consistency, and an account in an extended version of LCG, in which agreement is fundamentally an asymmetric relationship.",
        "We have attempted to show that the LCG account of agreement correctly treats a number of cases of coordination which are problematic for the standard feature-based account.",
        "Although we have not shown this here, the LCG account extends straightforwardly to the cases of coordination and morphological neutralization discussed by Zaenen and Kartunen (1984), Pullum and Zwicky (1986) and Ingria (1990).",
        "The nature of an appropriate feature system for LCG is still an open question.",
        "It is perhaps surprising that the simple feature system proposed here can handle such complex linguistic phenomena, but additional mechanisms might be required to treat other linguistic constructions.",
        "The standard account of adverbial modification in standard LCG, for instance, treats adverbs as functors.",
        "Because the verb",
        "heading an adverbial modified VP agrees in number with its subject, the same number features will have to appear in both the antecedent and consequent of the adverb.",
        "Using the LCG account described above it is necessary to treat adverbs as ambiguous, assigning them to the categories (s\\npAsg)Vs\\npAsg) and (s\\npAp1)\\(s\\npApl).",
        "There are several approaches which may eliminate the need for such systematic ambiguity.",
        "First, if the language of (category) types is extended to permit universally quantified types as suggested by Morrill (Morrill, 1992), then adverbs could be assigned to the single type",
        "Second, it might be possible to reanalyse adjunction in such a way that avoids the problem altogether.",
        "For example, Bouma and van Noord (1994) show that assuming that heads subcategorize for adjuncts (rather than the other way around, as is standard) permits a particularly elegant account of the double infinitive construction in Dutch.",
        "If adjuncts in general are treated as arguments of the head, then the 'problem' of 'passing features' through adjunction disappears.",
        "The comparative computational complexity of both the unification-based approach and the LCG accounts is also of interest.",
        "Despite their simplicity, the computational complexity of the kinds of feature-structure and LCG grammars discussed here is largely unknown.",
        "Dorre et.",
        "al.",
        "(1992) showed that the satisfiability problem for systems of feature-structure subsumption and equality constraints is undecidable, but it is not clear if such problems can arise in the kinds of feature-structure grammars discussed above.",
        "Conversely, while terminating (Gentzen) proof procedures are available for extended LCG systems of the kind we presented here, none of these handle the coordination schema, and as far as we are aware the computational properties of systems which include this schema are largely unexplored."
