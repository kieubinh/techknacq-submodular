        "Many have argued that discourse has a global structure above the level of individual utterances, and that linguistic phenomena like prosody, cue phrases, and nominal reference are partly conditioned by and reflect this structure (cf. (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992; Hirschberg and Litman, 1993; Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert, 1986; Hobbs, 1979; Lascarides and Oberlander, 1992; Linde, 1979; Mann and Thompson, 1988; Polanyi, 1988; Reichman, 1985; Webber, 1991)).",
        "However, an obstacle to exploiting the relation between global structure and linguistic devices in natural language systems is that there is too little data about how they constrain one another.",
        "We have been engaged in a study addressing this gap.",
        "In previous work (Passonneau and Litman, 1993), we reported on a method for empirically validating global discourse units, and on our evaluation of algorithms to identify these units.",
        "We found significant agreement among naive subjects on a discourse segmentation task, which suggests that global discourse units have some objective reality.",

        "In other work (e.g., (Hobbs, 1979; Polanyi, 1988)), segmental structure is an artifact of coherence relations among utterances, and few if any specific claims are made regarding segmental structure per se.",
        "Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988) is another tradition of defining relations among utterances, and informs much work in generation.",
        "In addition, recent work (Moore and Paris, 1993; Moore and Pollack, 1992) has addressed the integration of intentions and rhetorical relations.",
        "Although all of these approaches have involved detailed analyses of individual discourses or representative corpora, we believe there is a need for more rigorous empirical studies.",
        "Researchers have begun to investigate the ability of humans to agree with one another on segmen",
        "tation, and to propose methodologies for quantifying their findings.",
        "Several studies have used expert coders to locally and globally structure spoken discourse according to the model of Grosz and Sidner (1986), including (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992; Nakatani et al., 1995; Stifleman, 1995).",
        "Hearst (1994) asked subjects to place boundaries between paragraphs of expository texts, to indicate topic changes.",
        "Moser and Moore (1995) had an expert coder assign segments and various segment features and relations based on RST.",
        "To quantify their findings, these studies use notions of agreement (Gale et al., 1992; Moser and Moore, 1995) and/or reliability (Passonneau and Litman, 1993; Passonneau and Litman, to appear; Isard and Carletta, 1995).",
        "By asking subjects to segment discourse using a non-linguistic criterion, the correlation of linguistic devices with independently derived segments can then be investigated in a way that avoids circularity.",
        "Together, (Grosz and Hirschberg, 1992; Hirschberg and Grosz, 1992; Nakatani et al., 1995) comprise an ongoing study using three corpora: professionally read AP news stories, spontaneous narrative, and read and spontaneous versions of task-oriented monologues.",
        "Discourse structures are derived from subjects' segmentations, then statistical measures are used to characterize these structures in terms of acoustic-prosodic features.",
        "Grosz and Hirschberg's work also used the classification and regression tree system CART (Breiman et al., 1984) to automatically construct and evaluate decision trees for classifying aspects of discourse structure from intonational feature values.",
        "Morris and Hirst (1991) structured a set of magazine texts using the theory of (Grosz and Sidner, 1986), developed a thesaurus-based lexical cohesion algorithm to segment text, then qualitatively compared their segmentations with the results.",

        "Subjects were given transcripts, asked to place a new segment boundary between lines (prosodic phrases)' wherever the speaker had a new communicative goal, and to briefly describe the completed segment.",
        "Subjects were free to assign any number of boundaries.",
        "The qualitative results were that segments varied in size from 1 to 49 phrases in length (Avg.=5.9), and the rate at which subjects assigned boundaries ranged from 5.5% to 41.3%.",
        "Despite this variation, we found statistically significant agreement among subjects across all narratives on location of segment boundaries (.114 x 10-6 < p < .6 x 10-9).",
        "We then looked at the predictive power of linguistic cues for identifying the segment boundaries agreed upon by a significant number of subjects.",
        "We used three distinct algorithms based on the distribution of referential noun phrases, cue words, and pauses, respectively.",
        "Each algorithm (NP-A, CUE-A, PAUSE-A) was designed to replicate the subjects' segmentation task (break up a narrative into contiguous segments, with segment breaks falling between prosodic phrases).",

        "The features are a subset of those described in section 3.",
        "To evaluate how well an algorithm predicted segmental structure, we used the information retrieval (IR) metrics described in section 3.",

        "Note that \"Learning 1\" performance is comparable to human performance (Table 1), while \"Learning 2\" is slightly better than humans.",
        "The results obtained via machine learning are also somewhat better than the results obtained using hand tuning – particularly with respect to precision (\"Condition 2\" in Table 2), and are a great improvement over the original NP results (\"Condition 1\" in Table 2).",

        "Comparison of Tables 4 and 5 shows that, as with the hand tuning results (and as expected), average performance is worse when applied to the testing rather than the training data particularly with respect to precision.",

        "While this method does not make sense for humans, computers can truly ignore previous iterations.",
        "For sample sizes in the hundreds (our 10 narratives provide 1004 examples) 10-fold cross-validation often provides a better performance estimate than the holdout method (Weiss and Ku-likowski, 1991).",
        "Results using cross-validation are shown in Table 6, and are better than the estimates obtained using the holdout method (Table 5), with the major improvement coming from precision.",

        "We have presented two methods for developing segmentation hypotheses using multiple linguistic features.",
        "The first method hand tunes features and algorithms based on analysis of training errors.",
        "The second method, machine learning, automatically induces decision trees from coded corpora.",
        "Both methods rely on an enriched set of input features compared to our previous work.",
        "With each method, we have achieved marked improvements in performance compared to our previous work and are approaching human performance.",
        "Note that quantitatively, the machine learning results are slightly better than the hand tuning results.",
        "The main difference on average performance is the higher precision of the automated algorithm.",
        "Furthermore, note that the machine learning algorithm used the changes to the coding features that resulted from the tuning methods.",
        "This suggests that hand tuning is a useful method for understanding how to best code the data, while machine learning provides an effective (and automatic) way to produce an algorithm given a good feature representation.",
        "Our results lend further support to the hypothesis that linguistic devices correlate with discourse structure (cf. section 2.1), which itself has practical import.",
        "Understanding systems could infer segments as a step towards producing summaries, while generation systems could signal segments to increase comprehensibility.7 Our results also suggest that to best identify or convey segment boundaries, systems will need to exploit multiple signals simultaneously.",
        "We plan to continue our experiments by further merging the automated and analytic techniques, and evaluating new algorithms on our final test corpus.",
        "Because we have already used cross-validation, we do not anticipate significant degradation on new test narratives.",
        "An important area for future research is to develop principled methods for identifying distinct speaker strategies pertaining to how they signal segments.",
        "Performance of individual speakers varies widely as shown by the high standard deviations in our tables.",
        "The original NP, hand tuned, and machine learning algorithms all do relatively poorly on narrative 16 and relatively well on 11 (both in the test set) under all conditions.",
        "This lends support to the hypothesis that there may be consistent differences among speakers regarding strategies for signaling shifts in global discourse structure."
