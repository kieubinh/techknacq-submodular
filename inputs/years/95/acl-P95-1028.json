        "It is generally assumed that sentences with multiple quantified NPs are to be interpreted by one or more unambiguous logical forms in which the scope of traditional logical quantifiers determines the reading or readings.",
        "There are two problems with this assumption: (a) without further stipulation there is a tendency to allow too many readings and (b) there is considerable confusion as to how many readings should be allowed arising from contamination of the semantics of many NL quantifiers by referentiality.",
        "There are two well-known techniques for redistributing quantifiers in quantification structures: quantifying-in (Montague, 1974; Cooper, 1983; Keller, 1988; Carpenter, 1994) and quantifier raising (May, 1985).",
        "The former provides a compositional way of putting possibly embedded quantifiers to the scope-taking positions, and the latter utilizes a syntactic movement operation at the level of semantics for quantifier placement.",
        "There are also approaches that put more emphasis on utilizing contextual information in restricting the generation of semantic forms by choosing a scope-neutral representation augmented with ordering constraints to capture linguistic judgments (Webber, 1979; Kamp, 1981; Heim, 1983; Poesio, 1991; Reyle, 1993).",
        "And there are computational approaches that screen unavailable and/or redundant semantic forms (Hobbs & Shieber, 1987; Moran, 1988; Vestre, 1991).",
        "This paper will show that these approaches allow unavailable readings, and thereby miss an important generalization concerning the readings that actually are available.",
        "This paper examines English constructions that allow multiple occurrences of quantified NPs: NP modifications, transitive or ditransitive verbs, that complements, and coordinate structures.",
        "Based on a critical analysis of readings that are available from these data, the claim is that scope phenomena can be characterized by a combination of syntactic surface adjacency and semantic function-argument relationship.",
        "This characterization will draw upon the old distinction between referential and quantificatio-nal NP-semantics (Fodor & Sag, 1982).",
        "We choose to use Combinatory Categorial Grammar to show how surface adjacency affects semantic function-argument relationship, since CCG has the flexibility of composing almost any pair of adjacent constituents with a precise notion of syntactic grammaticality (Steedman, 1990; 1993).1 The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "First, we discuss in ยง2 how traditional techniques address availability of readings and note some residual problems.",
        "Then we give a brief analysis of available readings (ยง3), a generalization of the analysis (ยง4), and finally describe a computational implementation in Prolog (ยง5)."

        "Quantifying-in is designed to make any (possibly embedded) NP take the matrix scope, by leaving a scoped variable in the argument position of the original NP.",
        "This would be acceptable for referential NP-semantics.",

        "(b) Every man seeks a white unicorn.",
        "His suggestion is adopted with various subsequent revisions cited earlier.",
        "Since any NP, referential or quantificational, requires quantifying-in to outscope another, quantifying-in consequently confounds referential and quantificational NP-semantics.",
        "This causes a problem when there is a distributional difference between referential NPs and non-referential NPs, as Fodor & Sag (1982) have argued, a view which has been followed by the approaches to dynamic interpretation of indefinite NPs cited earlier.",
