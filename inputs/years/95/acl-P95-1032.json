        "The paradigm for Fung & Church (1994); Fung & McKeown (1994) is based on two main steps - find a small bilingual primary lexicon, use the text segments which contain some of the word pairs in the lexicon as anchor points for alignment, align the text, and compute a better secondary lexicon from these partially aligned texts.",
