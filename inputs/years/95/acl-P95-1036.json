        "the so-called Explanation-Based Learning technique (EBL) to parsing Lexicalized Tree-Adjoining grammars (LTAG).",
        "EBL techniques were originally introduced in the Al literature by (Mitchell et al., 1986; Minton, 1988; van Harmelen and Bundy, 1988).",
        "The main idea of EBL is to keep track of problems solved in the past and to replay those solutions to solve new but somewhat similar problems in the future.",
        "Although put in these general terms the approach sounds attractive, it is by no means clear that EBL will actually improve the performance of the system using it, an aspect which is of great interest to us here.",
        "Rayner (1988) was the first to investigate this technique in the context of natural language parsing.",
        "Seen as an EBL problem, the parse of a single sentence represents an explanation of why the sentence is a part of the language defined by the grammar.",
        "Parsing new sentences amounts to finding analogous explanations from the training sentences.",
        "As a special case of EBL, Samuelsson and This work was partially supported by ARO grant DAAL03-89-0031, ARPA grant N00014-90-J-1863, NSF STC grant DIR-8920230, and Ben Franklin Partnership Program (PA) grant 93S.3078C-6 Rayner (1991) specialize a grammar for the ATIS domain by storing chunks of the parse trees present in a treebank of parsed examples.",
        "The idea is to reparse the training examples by letting the parse tree drive the rule expansion process and halting the expansion of a specialized rule if the current node meets a 'tree-cutting' criteria.",
        "However, the problem of specifying an optimal 'tree-cutting' criteria was not addressed in this work.",
        "Samuelsson (1994) used the information-theoretic measure of entropy to derive the appropriate sized tree chunks automatically.",
        "Neumann (1994) also attempts to specialize a grammar given a training corpus of parsed examples by generalizing the parse for each sentence and storing the generalized phrasal derivations under a suitable index.",
        "Although our work can be considered to be in this general direction, it is distinct in that it exploits some of the key properties of LTAG to (a) achieve an immediate generalization of parses in the training set of sentences, (b) achieve an additional level of generalization of the parses in the training set, thereby dealing with test sentences which are not necessarily of the same length as the training sentences and (c) represent the set of generalized parses as a finite state transducer (FST), which is the first such use of FST in the context of EBL, to the best of our knowledge.",
        "Later in the paper, we will make some additional comments on the relationship between our approach and some of the earlier approaches.",
        "In addition to these special aspects of our work, we will present experimental results evaluating the effectiveness of our approach on more than one kind of corpus.",
        "We also introduce a device called a \"stapler\", a considerably impoverished parser, whose only job is to do term unification and compute alternate attachments for modifiers.",
        "We achieve substantial speed-up by the use of \"stapler\" in combination with the output of the FST.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we provide a brief introduction to LTAG with the help of an example.",

        "This type of generalization is called feature-generalization.",
        "In other EBL approaches (Rayner, 1988; Neumann, 1994; Samuelsson, 1994) it is necessary to walk up and down the parse tree to determine the appropriate subtrees to generalize on and to suppress the feature values.",

        "Auxiliary trees in LTAG represent recursive structures.",
        "So if there is an auxiliary tree that is used in an LTAG parse, then that tree with the trees for its arguments can be repeated any number of times, or possibly omitted altogether, to get parses of sentences that differ from the sentences of the training corpus only in the number of modifiers.",
        "This type of generalization is called modifier-generalization.",
