        "Most natural language processing (NM') systems are designed to work on certain specific domains and porting them to other domains is often a very time-consuming and human-intensive process.",
        "As the need for applying NLP systems to more and varied domains grows, it becomes increasingly important that some techniques be used to make these systems more portable.",
        "Several researchers (Lang and Hirschman, 1988; Rau et al., 1989; Pustejovsky, 1992; Grishrnan and Sterling, 1993; Basili et al., 1994), either directly or indirectly, have addressed issues that assist in making it easier to move an NLP system from one domain to another.",
        "One of the reasons for the lack of portability is the need for domain-specific semantic features that such systems often use for lexical, syntactic, and semantic disambiguation.",
        "One such feature is the knowledge of the semantic clusters in a domain.",
        "Since semantic classes are often domain-specific, their automatic acquisition is not trivial.",
        "Such classes can be derived either by distributional means or from existing taxonomies, knowledge bases, dictionaries, thesauruses, and so on.",
        "A prime example of the latter is WordNet which has been used to",
        "provide such semantic classes (Resnik, 1993; Basili et al., 1994) to assist in text understanding.",
        "Our efforts to obtain such semantic clusters with limited human intervention have been described elsewhere (Agarwal, 1995).",
        "This paper concentrates on the aspect of evaluating the obtained clusters against classes provided by human experts."

        "Although there has been a lot of work done in extracting semantic classes of a given domain, relatively little attention has been paid to the task of evaluating the generated classes.",
        "In the absence of an evaluation scheme, the only way to decide if the semantic classes produced by a system are \"reasonable\" or not is by having an expert analyze them by inspection.",
        "Such informal evaluations make it very difficult to compare one set of classes against another and are also not very reliable estimates of the quality of a set of classes.",
        "It is clear that a formal evaluation scheme would be of great help.",
        "Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1993) cluster adjectives into partitions and present an interesting evaluation to compare the generated adjective classes against those provided by an expert.",
        "Their evaluation scheme bases the comparison between two classes on the presence or absence of pairs of words in them.",
        "Their approach involves filling in a YES – NO contingency table based on whether a pair of words (adjectives, in their case) is classified in the same class by the human expert and by the system.",
        "This method works very well for partitions.",
        "However, if it is used to evaluate sets of classes where the classes may be potentially overlapping, their technique yields a weaker measure since the same word pair could possibly be present in more than one class.",
        "An ideal scheme used to evaluate semantic classes should be able to handle overlapping classes (as opposed to partitions) as well as hierarchies.",
        "The technique proposed by Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown does not do a good job of evaluating either of these.",
        "In this paper, we present an evaluation methodology which makes it possible to properly evaluate over",
        "lapping classes.",
        "Our scheme is also capable of incorporating hierarchies provided by an expert into the evaluation, but still lacks the ability to compare hierarchies against hierarchies.",
        "In the discussion that follows, the word \"clustering\" is used to refer to the set of classes that may be either provided by an expert or generated by the system, and the word \"class\" is used to refer to a single class in the clustering."

        "As mentioned above, we intend to be able to compare a clustering generated by a system against one provided by an expert.",
        "Since a word can occur in more than one class, it is important to find some kind of mapping between the classes generated by the system and the classes given by the expert.",
        "Such a mapping tells us which class in the system's clustering maps to which one in the expert's clustering, and an overall comparison of the clusterings is based on the comparison of the mutually mapping classes.",
        "Before we delve deeper into the evaluation process, we must decide on some measure of \"closeness\" between a pair of classes.",
        "We have adopted the F-measure (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1993; Chincor, 1992).",
        "In our computation of the F-measure, we construct a contingency table based on the presence or absence of individual elements in the two classes being compared, as opposed to basing it on pairs of words.",
        "For example, suppose that Class A is generated by the system and Class B is provided by an expert (as shown in Table 1).",
        "The contingency table obtained for this pair of classes is shown in Table 2.",
        "The three main steps in the evaluation process are the acquisition of \"correct\" classes from domain experts, mapping the experts' clustering to that generated by the system, and generating an overall measure that represents the system's performance when compared against the expert."

        "In order to determine pairwise mappings between the clustering generated by the system and one provided by an expert, a table of F-measures is constructed, with a row for each class generated by the system, and a column for every class provided by the expert.",
        "Note that since the expert actually provides a hierarchy, there is one column corresponding to every individual class and subclass provided by the expert.",
        "This allows the system's classes to map to a class at any level in the expert's hierarchy.",
        "This table gives an estimate of how well each class generated by the system maps to the ones provided by the expert.",
        "The algorithm used to compute the actual mappings from the F-measure table is briefly described here.",
        "In each row of the table, mark the cell with the highest F-measure as a potential mapping.",
        "In general, conflicts arise when more than one class generated by the system maps to a given class provided by the expert.",
        "In other words, whenever a column in the table has more than one cell marked as a potential mapping, a conflict is said to exist.",
        "To resolve a conflict, one of the system classes must be remapped.",
        "The heuristic used here is that the class for which such a remapping results in minimal loss of F-measure is the one that must be remapped.",
        "Several such conflicts may exist, and remapping may lead to further conflicts.",
        "The mapping algorithm iteratively searches for conflicts and resolves them till no more conflicts exist.",
        "Note also that a system class may map to an expert class only if the F-measure between them exceeds a certain threshold value.",
        "This ensures that a certain degree of similarity must exist between two classes for them to map to each other.",
        "We have used a threshold value of 0.20.",

        "Details of these experiments can be found in (Agarwal, 1995).",

        "It has been our experience that, as semantic clustering is a highly subjective task, evaluating a given clustering against different experts may yield numbers that vary considerably.",
        "However, when different clusterings generated by a system are compared against the same expert (or the same set of experts), such relative comparisons are useful.",
        "The evaluation scheme presented here still suffers from one major limitation – it is not capable of evaluating a hierarchy generated by a system against one provided by an expert.",
        "Such evaluations get complicated because of the restriction of one-to-one mapping.",
        "More work definitely needs to be done in this area."
