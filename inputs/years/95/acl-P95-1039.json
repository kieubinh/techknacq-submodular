        "Statistical part-of-speech disambiguation can be efficiently done with n-gram models (Church, 1988; Cutting et al., 1992).",
        "These models are equivalent to Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) (Rabiner, 1989) of order n – 1.",
        "The states represent parts of speech (categories, tags), there is exactly one state for each category, and each state outputs words of a particular category.",
        "The transition and output probabilities of the HMM are derived from smoothed frequency counts in a text corpus.",
        "Generally, the categories for part-of-speech tagging are linguistically motivated and do not reflect the probability distributions or co-occurrence probabilities of words belonging to that category.",
        "It is an implicit assumption for statistical part-of-speech tagging that words belonging to the same category have similar probability distributions.",
        "But this assumption does not hold in many of the cases.",
        "Take for example the word cliff which could be a proper (NP)' or a common noun (NN) (ignoring capitalization of proper nouns for the moment).",
        "The two previous words are a determiner (AT) and an",
        "adjective (.1.1).",
        "The probability of cliff being a common noun is the product of the respective contextual and lexical probabilities p(NNIAT, 1.1) • p(cliff INN), regardless of other information provided by the actual words (a sheer cliff vs. Me wise Cliff).",
        "Obviously, information useful for probability estimation is not encoded in the tagset.",
        "On the other hand, in some cases information not needed for probability estimation is encoded in the tagset.",
        "The distributions for comparative and superlative forms of adjectives in the Susanne Corpus (Sampson, 1995) are very similar.",
        "The number of correct tag assignments is not affected when we combine the two categories.",
        "However, it does not suffice to assign the combined tag, if we are interested in the distinction between comparative and superlative form for further processing.",
        "We have to ensure that the original (interesting) tag can be restored.",
        "There are two contradicting requirements.",
        "On the one hand, more tags mean that there is more information about a word at hand, on the other hand, the more tags, the severer the sparse-data problem is and the larger the corpora that are needed for training.",
        "This paper presents a way to modify a given tagset, such that categories with similar distributions in a corpus are combined without losing information provided by the original tagset and without losing accuracy."

        "The aim of the presented method is to reduce a tagset as much as possible by combining (clustering) two or more tags without losing information and without losing accuracy.",
        "The fewer tags we have, the less parameters have to be estimated and stored, and the less severe is the sparse data problem.",
        "Incoming text will be disambiguated with the new reduced tagset, but we ensure that the original tag is still uniquely ide,itified by the new tag.",
        "The basic idea is to exploit the fact that some of the categories have a very similar frequency distribution in a corpus.",
        "If we combine categories with",
        "similar distribution characteristics, there should be only a small change in the tagging result.",
        "The main change is that single tags are replaced by a cluster of tags, from which the original has to be identified.",
        "First experiments with tag clustering showed that, even for fully automatic identification of the original tag, tagging accuracy slightly increased when the reduced tagset was used.",
        "This might be a result of having more occurrences per tag for a smaller tagset, and probability estimates are preciser.",
        "2.1 Unique Identification of Original Tags A crucial property of the reduced tagset is that the original tag information can be restored from the new tag, since this is the information we are interested in.",
        "The property can be ensured if we place a constraint on the clustering of tags.",
        "Let W be the set of words, C the set of clusters (i.e. the reduced tagset), and T the original tagset.",
        "To restore the original tag from a combined tag (cluster), we need a unique function",
        "To ensure that there is such a unique function, we prohibit some of the possible combinations.",
        "A cluster is allowed if and only if there is no word in the lexicon which can have two or more of the original tags combined in one cluster.",
        "Formally, seeing tags as sets of words and clusters as sets of tags:",
        "(2) If this condition holds, then for all words w tagged with a cluster c, exactly one tag 4,, fulfills",
        "So, the original tag can be restored any time and no information from the original tagset is lost.",
        "Example: Assume that no word in the lexicon can be both comparative (JJ R) and superlative adjective (JJT).",
        "The categories are combined to {JJR,JJ-1}.",
        "When processing a text, the word easier is tagged as {.1.1R,JJT}.",
        "Since the lexicon states that easier can be of category JJR but not of category JJT, the original tag must be JJ R."
