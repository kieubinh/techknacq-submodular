        "One of the issues to emerge from recent evaluations of information extraction systems (Sundheim, 1992) is the importance of discourse processing (Iwanska et al., 1991) and, in particular, the ability to recognise multiple events in a text.",
        "It is this task that we address here.",
        "We are developing a program that assigns message-level event structures to newswire texts.",
        "Although the need to recognise events has been widely acknowledged, most approaches to information extraction (IE) perform this task either as a part of template merging late in the IE process (Grishman and Sterling, 1993) or, in a few cases, as an integral part of some deeper reasoning mechanism (e.g. (Hobbs et al., 1991)).",
        "Our approach is based on the assumption that discourse processing should be done early in the information extraction process.",
        "This is by no means a new idea.",
        "The arguments in favour of an early discourse segmentation are well known – easier coreference of entities, a reduced volume of text to be subjected to necessarily deeper analysis, and so on.",
        "Because of this early position in the IE process, an event recognition program is faced with a necessarily shallow textual representation.",
        "The purpose of our work is, therefore, to investigate the quality of text segmentation that is possible given such a surface form.",
        "*I would like to thank Chris Mellish and the anonymous referees for their helpful comments.",

        "This is harder than it might at first seem.",
        "A closely related (though not identical) problem is found in recognising boundaries in discourse, and there seems to be little agreement in the literature as to the properties and functions they possess (Morris and Hirst, 1991), (Grosz and Sidner, 1986).",
        "Our system is aimed at documents typified by those in the MUC-4 corpus (Sundheim, 1992).",
        "These deal with Latin American terrorist incidents, and vary widely in terms of origin, medium and purpose.",
        "In the task description for the MUC-4 evaluation, two events are deemed to be distinct if they describe either multiple types of incident or multiple instances of a particular type of incident, where instances are distinguished by having different locations, dates, categories or perpetrators.",
        "(NRaD, 1992) Although this definition suffers from a certain amount of circularity, it nonetheless points to an interesting feature of events at least in so far as physical incidents are concerned.",
        "It is generally the case that such incidents do possess only one location, date, category or description.",

        "For example, the semantic components of both modules know about points in time/space only, and not about durations.",
        "There are practical and theoretical reasons for this policy decision – the aim of the system is only to distinguish between events, and though the ability to represent durations is in a very few situations useful for this task, the engineering overheads in incorporating a more complex reasoning mechanism make it difficult to do so within such a shallow paradigm.",

        "It therefore seems that, despite both the shallow level of analysis required to have been performed (the program doesn't know what the events actually are) and our simplification of the nature of events (we don't know what they really are either), a modular constraint-based event recognition system is a useful tool for exploring the use of particular aspects of language in structuring multiple events, and for studying the applicability of these aspects for automatic event recognition."
