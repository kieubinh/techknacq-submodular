        "In this paper, we address the problem of modelling interactions between different levels of language analysis.",
        "In agglutinative languages, affixes are attached to stems to form a word that may correspond to an entire phrase in a language like English.",
        "For instance, in Turkish, word formation is based on suffixation of derivational and inflectional morphemes.",
        "Phrases may be formed in a similar way (1).",
        "(1) Yoksul-la§-ttr-a-makta-lar poor-V-CAUS-PASS-ADV-PERS",
        "'(They) are being made poor (impoverished)'.",
        "In Turkish, there is a significant amount of interaction between morphology and syntax.",
        "For instance, causative suffixes change the valence of the verb, and the reciprocal suffix subcategorize the verb for a noun phrase marked with the comitative case.",
        "Moreover, the head that a bound morpheme modifies may be not its stem but a compound head crossing over the word boundaries, e.g.,",
        "(2) iyi oku-mu§ cocuk well read-REL child 'well-educated child'",
        "In (2), the relative suffix -mw (in past form of subject participle) modifies [iyi oku] to give the scope Niyi okulmuq] coeukl If syntactic composition is performed after morphological composition, we would get compositions such as [iyi [okurnu§ gocuk]J or ffiyi okuntu§1 cocuk] which yield ill-formed semantics for this utterance.",
        "As pointed out by Oehrle (1988), there is no reason to assume a layered grammatical architecture which has linguistic division of labor into components acting on one domain at a time.",
        "As a computational framework, rather than treating morphology, syntax and semantics in a cascaded manner, we propose an integrated model to capture the high level of interaction between the three domains.",
        "The model, which is based on Combinatory Categorial Grammars (CCG) (Ades and Steedman, 1982; Steedman, 1985), uses the morpheme as the building block of composition at all three linguistic domains."

        "When the morpheme is given the same status as the lexeme in terms of its lexical, syntactic, and semantic contribution, the distinction between the process models of morphotactics and syntax disappears.",

        "Both interpretations are plausible, with (la) being the most likely in the absence of a long pause after the first adjective.",
        "To account for both cases, the suffix -/u must be allowed to modify the head it is attached to (e.g., lb in Figure 1), or a compound head encompassing the word boundaries (e.g., 11 in Figure 1)."

        "In order to perform morphological and syntactic compositions in a unified framework, the slash operators of Categorial Grammar must be enriched with the knowledge about the type of process and the type of morpheme.",

        "The 3-tuple <direction, morpheme type, process type> indicates direction2 (left, right, unspecified), morpheme type (free, bound), and the type of morphological or syntactic attachment (e.g., affix, clitic, syntactic concatenation, reduplication).",

        "During composition, the surface forms of composed elements are mapped and saved in phon.",

        "A special feature value called none is used for imposing certain morphotactic constraints, and to make sure that the stem is not inflected with the same feature more than once.",

        "Turkish is a language in which grammatical functions can be marked morphologically (e.g., case), or syntactically (e.g., indirect objects).",
        "Semantic composition is also affected by the interplay of morphology and syntax, for instance the change in the scope of modifiers and genitive suffixes, or valency and thematic role change in causatives.",
        "To model interactions between domains, we propose a categorial approach in which composition in all domains proceed in parallel.",
        "As an implementation, we have been working on the modelling of Turkish causatives using this framework."
