        "As the amount of text available online keeps growing, it becomes increasingly difficult for people to keep track of and locate the information of interest to them.",
        "To remedy the problem of information overload, a robust and automated text summarizer or information extrator is needed.",
        "Topic identification is one of two very important steps in the process of summarizing a text; the second step is summary text generation.",
        "A topic is a particular subject that we write about or discuss.",
        "(Sinclair et al., 1987).",
        "To identify the topics of texts, Information Retrieval (IR) researchers use word frequency, cue word, location, and title-keyword techniques (Paice, 1990).",
        "Among these techniques, only word frequency counting can be used robustly across different domains; the other techniques rely on stereotypical text structure or the functional structures of specific domains.",
        "Underlying the use of word frequency is the assumption that the more a word is used in a text, the more important it is in that text.",
        "This method",
        "recognizes only the literal word forms and nothing else.",
        "Some morphological processing may help, but pronominalization and other forms of coreferen-tiality defeat simple word counting.",
        "Furthermore, straightforward word counting can be misleading since it misses conceptual generalizations.",
        "For example: \"John bought some vegetables, fruit, bread, and milk.\" What would be the topic of this sentence?",
        "We can draw no conclusion by using word counting method; where the topic actually should be: \"John bought some groceries.\" The problem is that word counting method misses the important concepts behind those words: vegetables, fruit, etc.",
        "relates to groceries at the deeper level of semantics.",
        "In recognizing the inherent problem of the word counting method, recently people have started to use artificial intelligence techniques (Jacobs and Rau, 1990; Mauldin, 1991) and statistical techniques (Salton et al., 1994; Grefenstette, 1994) to incorporate the sementic relations among words into their applications.",
        "Following this trend, we have developed a new way to identify topics by counting concepts instead of words."

        "And if in addition, the text also mentions workstation and mainframe, it is reasonable to say that the topic of the text is related to digital computer.",
        "Using a hierarchy, the question is now how to find the most appropriate generalization.",
        "Clearly we cannot just use the leaf concepts – since at this level we have gained no power from generalization.",
        "On the other hand, neither can we use the very top concept – everything is a thing.",

        "The higher the ratio, the less concept C generalizes over many children, i.e., the more it reflects only one child.",
        "Consider Figure 2.",
        "In case (a) the parent concept's ratio is 0.70, and in case (b), it is 0.3 by the definition of R. To generate a summary for case (a), we should simply choose Apple as the main idea instead of its parent concept, since it is by far the most mentioned.",
        "In contrast, in case (b), we should use the parent concept Computer Company as the concept of interest.",
        "Its small ratio, 0.30, tells us that if we go down to its children, we will lose too much important information.",
        "We define the branch ratio threshold (R4) to serve as a cutoff point for the determination of interestingness, i.e., the degree of generalization.",

        "We can start another exploration of interesting concepts downward from this interesting wavefront resulting in a second, lower, wavefront, and so on.",

        "In order to choose an adequate wavefront with appropriate generalization, we introduce the parameter starting depth, V. We require that the branch ratio criterion defined in the previous section can only take effect after the wavefront exceeds the starting depth; the first subsequent interesting wavefront generated will be our collection of topic concepts.",
