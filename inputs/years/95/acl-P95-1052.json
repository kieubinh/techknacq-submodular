        "We furthermore describe how Smith's notion of a neutral viewpoint can be helpful for the analysis of discourse in German.",
        "It turned out that proposals claiming that the German Preterite covers the progressive as well as the simple aspect can not sufficiently explain the data presented in this paper (Bauerle, 1988).",

        "Smith (1991) presents two terms which are assigned to two distinct phenomena in language: viewpoint and situation aspect.",
        "This two-level theory gives an explanation for the difference between aspectual information understood as a view on a situation and temporal features of a situation.",
        "The former can be gained after applying a certain viewpoint chosen by the speaker and the latter one is stored in the lexical entry of a lexeme.1",
        "Situation Aspects Smith introduces three so-called \"conceptual features\" of situation aspects which have binary values [±], namely stative, dura-tive and telic.",
        "Five different situation aspects have emerged which are distinguished using these features and certain temporal schemata.'",
        "Examples:",
        "- Sam owned three peach orchards.",
        "(State) - Lily swam in the pond.",
        "(Activity) - Mrs Ramsey wrote a letter.",
        "(Accomplishment) - Lily knocked at the door.",
        "(Semelfactive) - Mr Ramsey reached the lighthouse.",
        "(Achievement)",
        "Viewpoints Smith postulates three different viewpoints.",
        "Schematically she uses an idealised time line where the initial and finishing points of a situation are indicated by I and F respectively.",
        "The duration of the situation can be drawn in two different ways: as an unstructured ( – ) and a structured (...) phase which has internal stages.",
        "The viewpoint is understood in this representation as a focus on parts or on the whole situation (///) (figure 1).",
        "Two viewpoints correspond mainly to the well-known opposition perfective/imperfective.",
        "However, additionally Smith assumes a so-called neutral viewpoint which contains the initial point and at least one internal stage.",
        "Aspectually vague sentences which provide either an open or a closed reading back up Smith's consid",
        "erations (Smith, 1991:120).3 However, she restricts her analysis to single sentences and neglects the effects viewpoints can have in a discourse.",

        "Note that the English translation of (lb) is therefore only correct if an imperfective view is used.",
        "This data shows that the use of the Preterite in German does not commit the speaker to saying anything about the end point.",
        "Every inference regarding the ending of a situation is due to the context or our world knowledge.",
        "It may be concluded from (1) that we cannot assume a perfective viewpoint, because this view includes the end point of a situation.",
        "The following discourse will furthermore show that also the iniperfective view is not applicable to the German Preterite.",
        "It is commonly supposed that the imperfective viewpoint which refers to the middle of a situation omitting the initial as well as the final point can be used for describing a background within a discourse (cf. Smith, 1991:130): (2) The defendant had an accident.",
        "He was driving home (at this time).",
        "A direct German translation, however, expresses two subsequent events.",

        "Er fuhr nach Hause (?",

        "Adding the PP zu der Zeit ('at this time') the sentence functions as a background for the event described by the first sentence, but this discourse sounds awkward and the continuation with a state in (4) is clearly preferred.'",
        "(4) Er war auf dem Weg nach Hause.",
        "Discourse (3) shows that for the German Preterite the initial point is focussed by the viewpoint.",
        "This observation proves therefore that this tense is not ambiguous w.r.t the progressive and the simple aspect as Bauerle (1988) claims.",
        "To sum up, these two discourses can be seen to show that the German aspect system for the Preterite offers only a neutral view on every situation.",
        "Moreover, this data disproves Bauerle's explanation of (1), clarifies Smith's definition of a viewpoint and motivates the need for a neutral viewpoint in German.",
        "It is obviously a shortcoming of Smith's description to define the viewpoint merely as a focus on parts or on the whole situation.",
        "It emerged from the discourse examples that a crucial function of the viewpoint is the commitment the speaker gives as to whether the end point has been reached or not.",
        "In English, the perfective view sets the end point' and no cancellation is allowed afterwards.",
        "A neutral view on a situation gives only a confirmation of the initial point.",
        "It leaves open whether the end has been reached or not.",

        "No account will be given of the treatment of PPs like nach House for the time being.",
        "In our analysis for German, we therefore highlighted the following two properties which can be stipulated regarding the neutral viewpoint: • The end point of a situation is beyond the focus of this viewpoint.",
        "Default information given by the situation aspect may be overridden by the context.8 • The neutral viewpoint contains the initial point of the situation.",
        "Backgrounding – a typical function of the imperfective view where the initial point is not included – is therefore not applicable for this viewpoint.",
        "Furthermore, the proposed formalisation provides an account which can handle the discussed phenomena within an implementation; this is ongoing work."
