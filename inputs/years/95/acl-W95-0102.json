        "Researchers investigating the acquisition of phrase-structure grammars from raw text have had only mixed success.",
        "In particular, unsupervised learning techniques, such as the inside-outside algorithm (Baker, 1979) for estimating the parameters of stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs), tend to produce grammars that structure text in ways contrary to our linguistic intuitions.",
        "One effective way around this problem is to use hand-structured text like the Penn Treebank (Marcus, 1991) to train the learner: (Pereira and Schabes, 1992) demonstrate that the inside-outside algorithm can learn grammars effectively given such constraint; from a bracketed corpus (Brill, 1993) successfully learns rules that iteratively transform a default phrase-structure into a better one for a particular sentence.",
        "The necessity of bracketed corpora for training is grating to our sensibilities, for several reasons.",
        "First, bracketed corpora are not easy to come by.",
        "Second, there is a sense that in learning from them, little of interest is going on.",
        "In the case of the acquisition of stochastic context-free grammars, the parameters can be read off of a fully-bracketed corpus by simply counting.",
        "Finally, the inability of current models to learn (without supervision) the parameters we desire suggests that our models are mismatched to the problem.",
        "This paper examines why some previous approaches have failed to acquire desired grammars without supervision, and proposes that with a different conception of phrase-structure supervision might not be necessary.",
        "In particular, we examine some reasons why SCFGs are poor models to use for learning human language, especially when combined with the inside-outside algorithm.",
        "We argue that head-driven grammatical formalisms like dependency grammars (Mereuk, 1988) or link grammars (Sleator and Temperley, 1991) are better suited to the task."

        "Let us look at a particular example.",
        "In English, the word sequence \"walking on ice\" is generally assumed to have an internal structure similar to (A).1",
        "Why (A) and not one of (B-H)?",
        "An introductory linguistics book might suggest the following answers: • on ice can move and delete as one unit, whereas walking on can not.",
        "Thus, \"it is on ice that I walked\" and \"it is walking that I did on ice\" and \"it is ice that I walked on\" are sentences but there in no equivalent form for relocating walking on.",
        "Similarly, \"they walked and jumped on ice\" is grammatical but \"they walked on and jumped on ice\" is awkward.",
        "Therefore, if movement and conjunction is of single constituents, phrase-structures (A-D) explain this evidence but (E-H) do not.",
        "• In languages like German where case is overtly manifested in affix and determiner choice, the noun ice clearly receives case from the preposition rather than the verb.",
        "It seems to make for a simpler theory of language if case is assigned through the government relation, which holds between the preposition and noun in (A-D) but not in (E-H).",
        "• The phrase walking on ice acts like a verb: it can conjoin with a verb ( \"John walked on ice and sang\"), and takes verbal modifiers ( \"John walked on ice slowly\").",
        "So it makes little sense to call it a prepositional phrase or noun phrase, as in (C) or (D).",
        "on ice does not behave as a noun, so (A) is a better description than (B).",
        "These deductive steps leading to (A) require some assumptions about language: that constituent structure and category labels introduce specific constraints on sentence building operations, and that the range of hypothetical grammars is small (our enumeration AH was over grammars of binary rules where the category of a phrase is tied to the category of one of its constituents, its head).",
        "Statistical phrase-structure models of language2, such as SCFGs, are motivated by different assumptions about language, principally that a phrase grouping several words is a constraint on co-occurrence that makes it possible to better predict one of those words given another.",
        "In terms of language acquisition and parsing, if we assume that a sequence of words has been generated from a phrase-structure grammar, it suggests that we can recover internal structure by grouping subsequences of words with high mutual information.",
        "This is the approach taken by (Magerman and Marcus, 1990) for parsing sentences, who use mutual information rather than a grammar to reconstruct phrase-structure.",
        "The hope is that by searching for a phrase-structure or phrase-structure grammar that maximizes the likelihood of an observed sequence, we will find the generating structure or grammar itself.",
        "Unfortunately, there is anecdotal and quantitative evidence that simple techniques for estimating phrase-structure grammars by minimizing entropy do not lead to the desired grammars (grammars that agree with structure (A), for instance).",
        "(Pereira and Schabes, 1992) explore this topic, demonstrating that a stochastic context free grammar trained on part-of-speech sequences from English text can have an entropy as low or lower than another but bracket the text much more poorly (tested on hand-annotations).",
        "And (Magerman and Marcus, 1990) provide evidence that grouping sub-sequences of events with high mutual information is not always a good heuristic; they must include in their parsing algorithm a list of event sequences (such as noun-preposition) that should not be grouped together in a single phrase, in order to prevent their method from mis-bracketing.",
        "To understand why, we can look at an example from a slightly different domain.",
        "(Olivier, 1968) seeks to acquire a lexicon from unsegmented (spaceless) character sequences by treating each word as a stochastic context free rule mapping a common nonterminal (call it W) to a sequence of letters; a sentence is a sequence of any number of words and the probability of a sentence is the product over each word of the probability of W expanding to that word.",
        "Learning a lexicon consists of finding a grammar that reduces the entropy of a training character sequence.",
        "Olivier's learning algorithm soon creates rules such as W THE and W TOBE.",
        "But it also hypothesizes words like edby.",
        "edby is a common English character sequence that occurs in passive constructions like \"She was passed by the runner\".",
        "Here -ed and by occur together not because they are part of a common word, but because English syntax and semantics places these two morphemes side-by-side.",
        "At a syntactic level, this is exactly why the algorithm of (Magerman and Marcus, 1990) has problems: English places prepositions after nouns not because they are in the same phrase, but because prepositional phrases often adjoin to noun phrases.",
        "Any greedy algorithm (such as (Magerman and Marcus, 1990) and the context-free grammar induction method of (Stolcke, 1994)) that builds phrases by grouping events with high mutual information will consequently fail to derive linguistically-plausible phrase structure in many situations."

        "The conclusion of the above section might lead us to is that basing phrase-structure grammar induction on minimization of entropy is a poor idea.",
        "However, in this paper we will not discuss whether statistical induction is the proper way to view language acquisition: our current goal is only to better understand why current statistical methods produce the \"wrong\" answer and to",
        "explore ways of fixing them.",
        "Let us look again at (A), reproduced below, and center discussion on an extended stochastic context-free grammar model in which a binary context-free rule Z A B with terminal parts-of-speech on the right hand side first generates a word a chosen from a distribution pA(a), then generates a word b from a distribution pBa(b).3 If we call these two random variables A and B, then the entropy of the sequence AB is H (A) + H(BIA) H (A) + H(B) – I(A, B) (where H (X) is the entropy of a random variable X and /(X, Y) is the mutual information between two random variables X and Y).",
        "The point here is that using such a context free rule to model a sequence of two words reduces the entropy of the language from a model that treats the two words as independent, by precisely the mutual information between the two words.",
        "In English, verbs and prepositions in configuration (A) are closely coupled semantically, probably more closely than prepositions and nouns, and we would expect that the mutual information between the verb and preposition would be greater than between the preposition and noun, and greater still than between the verb and the noun.",
        "Under our hypothesized model, structure (A) has entropy H (V) + H(P) H (NIP) = H (V) + H (P) H(N) – I(P, N), which is higher than the entropy of structures (E-H), H (V) H(P) H(N) – I(V, P), and we wouldn't expect a learning mechanism based on such a model to settle on (A).",
        "However, this simple class of models only uses phrases to capture relations between adjacent words.",
        "In (A), it completely ignores the relation between the verb and the prepositional phrase, save to predict that a prepositional phrase (any prepositional phrase) will follow the verb.",
        "We modify our language model, assuming that nonterminals exhibit the distributional properties of their heads.",
        "We will write a phrase Z that is headed by a word z as (Z, z).",
        "Each grammar rule will look like either (Z', z) (Z, z)(Y, y) or (Z', z) (Y, y)(Z, z) (abbreviated Z' Z Y and Z' Y Z) and the probability model is",
        "Of course, this class of models is strongly equivalent to ordinary context free grammars.",
        "We could substitute, for every rule Z' Z Y, a large number of word-specific rules (Z,z,)(Y,ya) with probabilities p(Z' Z Y) • X,' (y3).",
        "Using our new formalism, the head properties of (A) look like",
        "The grammar derived from (A) is optimal under this model of language, though (C), (F), and (H) are equally good.",
        "They could be distinguished from (A) in longer sentences because they pass different head information out of the phrase.",
        "In fact, the grammar model derived from (A) is as good as any possible model that does not condition N on V. Under this class of models there is no benefit to grouping two words with high mutual information together in the same minimal phrase; it is sufficient for both to be the heads of phrases that are adjacent at some level.",
        "There is of course no reason why the best head-driven statistical model of a given language must coincide with a grammar derived by a linguist.",
        "The above class of models makes no mention of deletion or movement of phrases, and only information about the head of a phrase is being passed beyond that phrase's borders.",
        "The government-binding framework usually supposes that an inflection phrase is formed of inflection and the verb phrase.",
        "But the verb is likely to have a higher mutual information with the subject than inflection does.",
        "So it seems unlikely that this structure would be learned using our scheme.",

        "We have argued that there is little reason to believe SCFGs of the sort commonly used for grammar induction will ever converge to linguistically plausible grammars, and we have suggested a modification (namely, incorporating mutual information between phrase heads) that should help fix the problem.",
        "We have also argued that the standard context-free grammar estimation procedure, the inside-outside algorithm, is essentially incapable of finding an optimal grammar without bracketing help.",
        "We now suggest that a representation that explicitly represents relations between phrase heads, such as link grammars (Sleator and Temperley, 1991), is far more amenable to language acquisition problems.",
        "Let us look one final time at the sequence V P N. There are only three words here, and therefore three heads.",
        "Assuming a head-driven bigram model as before, there are only three possibile anlayses of this sequence, which we write by listing the pairs of words that enter into predictive relationships:",
        "To map back into traditional phrase structure grammars, linking two heads X-Y is the same as specifying that there is some phrase XP headed by X which is a sibling to some phrase YP headed by Y.",
        "Of course, using this representation all of the optimal phrase structure grammars (A,C,F and H) are identical.",
        "Thus we have a representation which has factored out many details of phrase structure that are unimportant as far as minimizing entropy is concerned.",
        "Simplifying the search space reaps additional benefits.",
        "A greedy approach to grammar acquisition that iteratively hypothesizes relations between the words with highest mutual information will first link V to P, then P to N, producing exactly the desired result for this example.",
        "And the distance in parse or grammar space between competing proposals is at most one relation (switching VP to V-N, for instance), whereas three different rule probabilities may need to be changed in the SCFG representation.",
        "This suggests that learning algorithms based on this representation are far less likely to encounter local maximums.",
        "Finally, since what would have been multiple parse hypotheses are now one, a Viterbi learning scheme is more likely to estimate accurate counts.",
        "This is important, given the computational complexity of estimating long-distance word-pair probabilities from unbracketed corpora.",
        "We have implemented a statistical parser and training mechanism based on the above notions, but results are too preliminary to include here.",
        "Stochastic link-grammar based models have been discussed (Lafferty et al., 1992) but the only test results we have seen (Della-Pietra et al., 1994) assume a very restricted subset of the model and do not explore the \"phrase structures\" that result from training on English text."
