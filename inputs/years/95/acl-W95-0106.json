        "A number of empirical studies have found bracketing to be a useful type of corpus annotation (e.g., Pereira & Schabes 1992; Black et al.",
        "1993).",
        "Bracketed corpora have been available for some time in English, and to some extent other European languages, the best-known example being perhaps the Penn Treebank (Marcus 1991).",
        "However, at present bracketed corpora for Chinese are unknown, as is the case for many other languages.",
        "Moreover, even for better-studied languages, parallel bracketed texts are scarce.",
        "The problem of bracketing such corpora is the focus of two new strategies described in this paper.",
        "The strategies build upon stochastic inversion transduction grammars (SITGs), a formalism that we have been developing for bilingual language modeling.",
        "Numerous experiments have shown parallel bilingual corpora to provide a rich source of constraints for statistical analysis (e.g., Brown et al.",
        "1990; Gale & Church 1991; Gale eta!.",

        "SITGs are a generalization of context-free grammars that have several desirable properties for parallel corpus analysis; a brief summary of these properties is given in Section 2.",
        "Our first strategy is to expropriate a very simple, coarse monolingual grammar of English as the backbone for a bilingual English-Chinese SITG, which is then used for bracketing parallel text.",
        "The effect of this is to transfer knowledge of English syntactic constraints (or more precisely, probabilistic preferences) to the bilingual task.",
        "This is discussed in Section 3.",
        "Our second strategy is to apply an unsupervised training algorithm to tune the probabilistic parameters of the SITG.",
        "For this purpose we have devised an EM-based algorithm, a bilingual generalization of the",
        "inside-outside method, that iteratively improves the likelihood of the training corpus.",
        "This is discussed in Section 4.",
        "It is important to stress at the outset that a parallel bracketed corpus is different from a bracketed parallel corpus.",
        "The latter is simply a parallel corpus in which both halves have been independently bracketed.",
        "In contrast, in a parallel bracketed corpus, the bracketed sub-constituents are themselves parallel in the sense that explicit matching relationships are designated between sub-constituents of each half.",

        "In Wu (1995b) we define an inversion tranduction grammar (ITG) formalism for bilingual language modeling, i.e., modeling of two languages (referred to as L1 and L2) simultaneously.",
        "The description here is necessarily brief; for further details the reader is referred to Wu (1995a, 1995b).",
        "An ITG is a context-free grammar that generates output on two separate streams, together with a matching that associates the corresponding tokens and constituents of each stream.",
        "The formalism also differs from standard context-free grammars in that the concatenation operation, which is implicit in any production rule's right-hand side, is replaced with two kinds of concatenation with either straight or inverted orientation.",
        "Thus, the following are two distinct productions in an ITG:",
        "Consider each nonterminal symbol to stand for a pair of matched strings, so that for example (A1, A2) denotes the string-pair generated by A.",
        "The operator ['performs the \"usual\" pairwise concatenation so that [AB] yields the string-pair (C1, C2) where C1 = A1 B1 and C2 = A2B2.",
        "But the operator 0 concatenates constituents on output stream 1 while reversing them on stream 2, so that C1 = Ai /31 but C2 = B2A2-The inverted concatenation operator permits the extra flexibility needed to accommodate many kinds of word-order variation between source and target languages.",
        "Since inversion is permitted at any level of rule expansion, a derivation may intermix productions of either orientation within the parse tree.",
        "More on the ordering flexibility will be said later.",

        "We call xl€ an Li-singleton and Ely an L2-singleton.",
        "Parsing, in the context of ITGs, means to take as input a sentence-pair rather than a sentence, and to output a parse tree that imposes a shared hierarchical structuring on both sentences.",

        "That is, the bilingual SITG parsing algorithm can perform constituent identification and matching using only a generic, language-independent bracketing grammar.",
        "Several earlier experiments (Wu 1995a) tested out variants of this hypothesis, using generic S1TGs similar to the one shown in Figure 2, which employs only one nonterminal category.",

        "Productions of the A ui /v., form list all word translations found in the translation lexicon, and the others list all potential singletons without corresponding translations.",

        "Performance, as reported in Wu (1995a), was encouraging, with precision on automatically-filtered",
        "sentence pairs in the 80% range with the aid of supporting heuristics.",
        "However, there are of course inherent limitations of any approach that relies entirely on crossing and fanout-constrained lexical matching.",
        "In particular, if the sub-constituents of any constituent appear in the same order in both languages, lexical matchings do not provide the discriminative leverage to identify the sub-constituent boundaries.",
        "This applies to both straight and inverted orientations; an example with inverted orientation is shown in Figure 3.",
        "In such cases, specific grammatical information about one or both of the languages is needed.",
        "Grammatical information is far less easily available for Chinese than for English, however, with respect to part-of-speech lexicons as well as grammars.",
        "The SITG formalism offers another possibility: the generic bracketing grammar can be replaced with a context-free backbone designed for English.",
        "It is critical under this approach that the English grammar be reasonably robust.",
        "It should also avoid being too specific, since to be effective at bracketing, its structure must accomodate Chinese to a reasonably broad extent.",
        "For these reasons it is best to employ a simple, coarse grammar, with fallback productions that simulate the generic bracketing grammar when the English productions are too inflexible.",
        "As before, the lexical productions will constitute the bulk of the rules set.",
        "However, we can now distinguish between different part-of-speech nonterminals.",
        "Different part-of-speech nonterminals may generate the same words.",

        "\"Parse-parse-match\" methods first bracket a parallel corpus by parsing each half individually using a monolingual grammar.' Heuristic procedures are subsequently used to select a matching between the bracketed constituents across sentence-pairs.",
        "These approaches can encounter difficulties with incompatibilities between the monolingual grammars used to parse the texts.",
        "The grammars will usually be of unrelated origins, not designed to make interlingual matching easy.",
        "Furthermore, how to deal with ambiguities presents another serious problem.",
        "Most sentences in the corpus will have multiple possible parses.",
        "In a pure \"parse-parse-match\" approach, however, the monolingual parsers must arbitrarily select one bracketing with which to annotate the corpus.",
        "The resulting parse may be incompatible with the parse chosen for the other half of the sentence-pair, causing a matching error even though some alternative parse might in fact been compatible.",
        "The coarse bilingual grammar approach proposed here solves these problems by choosing the parse",
        "structure for both sentences simultaneously with the interlingual constituent matching criteria.",
        "The weighting of the bracketing constraints and matching constraints is probabilistic.",
        "Even if a sentence pair's translations truly contain structural mismatches that are beyond syntactic accounts, the soft constraint optimization permits graceful degradation in the bilingual parse.",
        "The parser will attempt to match those constituents for which a partial decomposition and matching can be found, parsing the rest largely according to the English grammar backbone.",

        "1992; Matsumoto et al.",

        "This tactic bears closer resemblance to our approach, but still requires ad hoc heuristics to determine exactly how the matching task influences the monolingual parses that are chosen.",
        "On the other hand, the present framework incorporates all these aspects within a single probabilistic optimization.",
        "Another alternative approach discussed in Wu (1995b) is to first use a monolingual grammar to bracket only the English half of the text, followed by a SITG parallel bracketing procedure constrained by the English brackets.",
        "However, this hybrid approach is subject to the same incompatibility and ambiguity problems that arise for pure \"parse-parse-match\" procedures; thus the proposed coarse bilingual grammar approach is superior for the same reasons given above.",
        "For our experiments, we employed the grammar shown in Figures 4 and 5, with only 50 syntactic productions and 13 nonterminal categories, including 6 part-of-speech categories.",
        "Each syntactic production occurs in both straight and inverted orientations, to model ignorance of the ordering tendencies of the corresponding Chinese constituents.",
        "The part-of-speech categories were designed by conflating categories in the Brown corpus tagset, under the following general principle: categories should be as broad as possible, while still maintaining reasonable discriminativeness for bracketing structure.",
        "Thus, notice that adjectives and nouns are conflated, since complex nominal phrases have largely similar parse structures regardless of",
        "the difference between adjective and noun labels.",
        "Similarly, all verbs including auxiliaries are grouped to allow simple tail-recursive compounding.",
        "The S category (not to be confused with the start symbol SO) is a placeholder for miscellaneous items including punctuation and adverbs, and functions as a fallback category similar to the A nonterminal in the generic bracketing grammars.",
        "assigned a slightly smaller probability in order to break ties in favor of straight matchings.",
        "Probabilities were placed on the lexical productions as discussed above, with the following additional provisions.",
        "The translation lexicon was automatically learned from the HKUST English-Chinese Parallel Bilingual Corpus via statistical sentence alignment (Wu 1994) and statistical Chinese word and collocation extraction (Fung & Wu 1994; Wu & Fung 1994), followed by an EM word-translation learning procedure (Wu & Xia 1994).",
        "The latter stage gives us the lexical translation probabilities.",
        "The translation lexicon contained approximately 6,500 English words and 5,500 Chinese words, and was not manually corrected for this experiment, having about 86% translation accuracy.",
        "The English part-of-speech lexicon with relative frequencies was derived from the English portion of our corpus as tagged by Brill's (1993) tagger.",

        "Examples of the output are shown in Figure 6.",
        "The latter example shows problematic behavior on the example given earlier in Figure 3 of sentence pairs without sufficient ordering discrimination.",
