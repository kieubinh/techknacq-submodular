        "However, previous approaches require an annotated training corpus or some other type of manually encoded training data.",
        "Annotated training corpora are expensive to build, both in terms of the time and the expertise required to create them.",
        "Furthermore, training corpora for information extraction are typically annotated with domain-specific tags, in contrast to general-purpose annotations such as part-of-speech tags or noun-phrase bracketing (e.g., the Brown Corpus [Francis and Kucera, 1982] and the Penn Treebank [Marcus et al., 1993]).",
        "Consequently, a new training corpus must be annotated for each domain.",
        "We have begun to explore the possibility of using an untagged corpus to automatically acquire conceptual patterns for information extraction.",
        "Our approach uses a combination of domain-independent linguistic rules and statistics.",
        "The linguistic rules are based on our previous system, AutoSlog [Riloff, 1993], which automatically constructs dictionaries for information extraction using an annotated training corpus.",
        "We have put a new spin on the original system by applying it exhaustively to an untagged but preclassified training corpus (i.e., a corpus in which the texts have been manually classified as either relevant or irrelevant).",
        "Statistics are then used to sift through the myriad of patterns that it produces.",
        "The new system, AutoSlog-TS, can generate a conceptual dictionary of extraction patterns for a domain from a preclassified text corpus.",

        "Second, we describe the original AutoSlog system for automated dictionary construction and explain how AutoSlog was adapted to generate patterns from an untagged corpus.",

        "The information extraction task has received a lot of attention recently as a result of the message understanding conferences (MUCs) [MUC-5 Proceedings, 1993; MUC-4 Proceedings, 1992; MUC-3 Proceedings, 1991].",
        "The systems described in this paper use a conceptual sentence analyzer called CIRCUS [Lehn-ert, 1991].",
        "CIRCUS extracts information using domain-specific structures called concept nodes.",
        "Each concept node is triggered by a keyword, but is activated only in certain linguistic contexts.",
        "For example, a concept node called $murder-passive$ is triggered by the verb \"murdered\" but activated only when the verb appears in a passive construction.",
        "Therefore this concept node would be activated by phrases such as \"X was murdered\", \"X and Y were murdered\", and \"X has been murdered.\" The subject of the verb is extracted as the victim of the murder.",

        "AutoSlog uses simple domain-independent linguistic rules to create extraction patterns for a given set of noun phrases in a text corpus.",
        "Figure 2 shows the steps involved in dictionary construction.",
        "As input, AutoSlog requires a set of annotated texts in which the noun phrases that need to be extracted have been tagged.' For each \"targeted\" noun phrase, AutoSlog finds the sentence in which it was tagged2 and passes the sentence to CIRCUS for syntactic analysis.",
        "CIRCUS separates each sentence into clauses and identifies the subject, verb, direct object and prepositional phrases in each clause.",
        "AutoSlog then determines which clause contains the targeted noun phrase and whether it is a subject, direct object, or prepositional phrase.",
        "Next, AutoSlog uses a small set of heuristics to infer which other words in the sentence identify the role of the noun phrase.",
        "If the targeted noun phrase is the subject or direct object of a clause then AutoSlog infers that the verb defines the role of the noun phrase.",

        "In the direct object case, the sentence \"the armed men killed John Smith\" produces the pattern \"killed X.\" If the targeted noun phrase is in a prepositional phrase, then AutoSlog uses a simple pp-attachment algorithm to attach the prepositional phrase to a previous verb or noun in the sentence which is then used as a trigger word for a concept node.",
        "For example, \"the men were killed in Bogota by John Smith\" produces the pattern \"killed by X.\" It should be noted that, although we are using a simple phrase-like notation for the patterns, they are actually concept nodes activated by an NLP system so the words do not have to be strictly adjacent in the text.",

        "None of the words or phrases in the texts need to be tagged, but each text must be classified as either relevant or irrelevant to the targeted domain.6 Figure 4 shows the steps involved in dictionary construction.",

        "1.",
        "Given a corpus of preclassified texts, a sentence analyzer (CIRCUS) is applied to each sentence to identify all of the noun phrases in the sentence.",
        "For example, in Figure 4, two noun phrases are identified: \"The World Trade Center\" and \"terrorists.\" 2.",
        "For each noun phrase, the system determines whether the noun phrase was a subject, direct object, or prepositional phrase based on the syntactic analysis produced by the sentence analyzer.",

        "Pattern #3 is the only one that is satisfied, so a single concept node is generated that recognizes the pattern \"X was bombed.\" It is possible for multiple heuristics to fire; for example, patterns #1 and #2 may both fire if the targeted noun phrase is the subject of an active verb and takes a direct-object.",
        "After processing the training texts, we have a huge collection of concept nodes.",
        "The second stage involves collecting statistics to determine which concept nodes represent domain-specific expressions.",
        "2.",
        "Statistics are computed to determine how often each concept node was activated in relevant texts and how often it was activated in irrelevant texts.",
        "We calculate the relevancy rate of each concept node (i.e., the number of occurrences in relevant texts divided by the total number of occurrences), and the frequency of each concept node (i.e., the total number of times it was activated in the corpus).",
        "After Stage 1, we have a large set of concept node definitions that, collectively, can extract virtually7 every noun phrase in the corpus.",
        "Most of the concept nodes represent general phrases that are likely to occur in a wide variety of texts (e.g., \"X saw\").",
        "However, some of the concept nodes represent domain-specific patterns (e.g., \"X was bombed\").",
        "Stage 2 is designed to identify these concept nodes automatically under the assumption that most of them will have high relevancy rates.",
        "In other words, if we sort the concept nodes by relevancy rates then the domain-specific patterns should float to the top.",
        "One of the side effects of this approach is that the statistics provide feedback on which heuristics are most appropriate.",
        "In previous work with AutoSlog, we found that some domains require longer extraction patterns than others [Riloff, 1994].",
        "In particular, we found that simple verb forms usually suffice as extraction patterns in the terrorism domain (e.g., \"X was killed\").",
        "But in the joint ventures domain, good extraction patterns often require both verbs and nouns (e.g., \"X formed venture\" is better than \"X formed\").",
        "For this reason, we found it necessary to run AutoSlog with slightly different rule sets in these domains.",
        "In contrast, AutoSlog-TS simply allows all applicable heuristics to fire8, often producing multiple extraction patterns of varying lengths, and lets the statistics ultimately decide which ones work the best.",
        "For example, \"X formed\" would presumably have a much lower relevancy rate than \"X formed venture\" in the joint ventures domain.",
        "The original version of AutoSlog could have applied multiple heuristics as well, but its dictionary had to be manually filtered so it was preferable to keep the dictionary small.",
        "Since AutoSlog-TS uses statistical filtering, we don't have to worry as much about the number of concept nodes generated and therefore don't need separate rule sets.",

        "A good dictionary for information extraction should contain patterns that provide broad coverage of the domain.",

        "These patterns represent expressions that are highly indicative of the domain and are therefore useful for classifying new texts.",

        "This algorithm applies CIRCUS to a preclassified training corpus and corn-7Most, but not all, noun phrases will yield a concept node.",
        "AutoSlog's heuristics sometimes fail to produce a concept node when the verb is weak (e.g., forms of \"to be\"), when the linguistic context does match any of the heuristics, or when CIRCUS produces a faulty sentence analysis.",

        "Not surprisingly, most of the concept nodes in the AutoSlog dictionary had at least a 50% relevancy rate.",
        "However, the number of concept nodes drops off rapidly at higher relevancy rates.",
        "Again, this is not surprising because many useful extraction patterns will be common in both relevant and irrelevant texts.",
        "Finally, we filtered the AutoSlog-TS dictionary using both relevancy and frequency filtering (N=5) to get a rough idea of how many concept node definitions will be useful for information extraction.",
        "Figure 9 shows the size of the resulting dictionaries after filtering.",
        "The number of concept nodes drops off dramatically from 32,345 to 4,169 after frequency filtering alone.",
        "There is a roughly linear relationship between the relevancy rate and the number of concept nodes retained.",
        "It seems relatively safe to assume that concept nodes with a relevancy rate below 50% are not highly associated with the domain, and that concept nodes with a total frequency < 5 are probably not going to be encountered often.",
        "Using these two threshold values, we can reduce the size of the dictionary down to 1870 definitions.",
        "This dictionary is much more manageable in size \"This is consistent with earlier results which showed that a relatively small set of concept nodes typically do most of the work [Riloff, 1994].",
        "and could be easily reviewed by a person to separate the good definitions from the bad ones.15 for no other reason, a human would be required to assign semantic labels to each definition so that the system can identify the type of information that is extracted.",
        "Furthermore, the AutoSlog-TS dictionary should contain a higher percentage of relevant definitions that the original AutoSlog dictionary.",
        "Since the AutoSlog-TS dictionary has been prefiltered for both frequency and relevancy, many concept nodes that represent uncommon phrases or general expressions have already been removed.",
        "Because AutoSlog-TS is not constrained to consider only the annotated portions of the corpus, it found many good patterns that AutoSlog did not.",
        "For example, AutoSlog-TS produced 158 concept nodes that have a relevancy rate > 90% and frequency > 5.",
        "Only 45 of these concept nodes were in the original AutoSlog dictionary.",
        "Figure 10 shows a sample of some of the new concept nodes that represent patterns associated with terrorism.16 Figure 10: Patterns found by AutoSlog-TS but not by AutoSlog These results suggest that combining domain-independent linguistic rules with simple filtering techniques is a promising approach for automatically creating dictionaries of extraction patterns.",
        "Although it may still be necessary for a human to review the resulting patterns to build an information extraction system, this approach eliminates the need for text annotations and relies only on preclassified texts."

        "AutoSlog-TS demonstrates that conceptual patterns for information extraction can be acquired automatically from only a preclassified text corpus, thereby obviating the need for an annotated training corpus.",
        "Generating annotated corpora is time-consuming and sometimes difficult, though the payoffs are often significant.",
        "General purpose text annotations, such as part-of-speech tags and noun-phrase bracketing, are costly to obtain but have wide applicability and have been used successfully to develop statistical NLP systems (e.g., [Church, 1989; Weischedel et al., 1993]).",
        "Domain-specific text annotations, however, require a domain expert and have much narrower applicability.",
        "From a practical perspective, it is important to consider the human factor and to try to minimize the amount of time and effort required to build a training corpus.",

        "We have shown how a preclassified training corpus can be combined with statistical techniques to create conceptual patterns automatically.",
        "We believe that it is much easier for a person to separate a set of texts into two piles (the relevant texts and the irrelevant texts) than to generate detailed text annotations for a domain.",
        "Furthermore, the classifications are general in nature so various types of systems can make use of them.",
        "AutoSlog-TS suggests promising directions for future research in developing dictionaries automatically using only preclassified corpora without detailed text annotations."
