        "This airline company flies many jets.",
        "The girl will fly Japan Airlines.",
        "*The airline company will fly Japan Airlines.",
        "We see that an 'airline company' can be the subject of verb 'fly' (the value of case slot `argi'), when the direct object (the value of case slot `arg2') is an 'airplane' but not when it is an 'airline company\".",
        "These examples indicate that the possible values of case slots depend in general on those of the other case slots: that is, there exist `dependencies' between different case slots.",
        "The knowledge of such dependencies is useful in various tasks in natural language processing, especially in analysis of sentences involving multiple prepositional phrases, such as The girl will fly a jet from Tokyo to Beijing.",
        "Note in the above example that the case slot of `from' and that of 'to' should be considered dependent and the attachment site of one of the prepositional phrases (case slots) can be determined by that of the other with high accuracy and confidence.",
        "There has been no method proposed to date, however, that learns dependencies between case frame slots in the natural language processing literature.",
        "In the past research, the distributional pattern of each case slot is learned independently, 'One may argue that 'fly' has different word senses in these sentences and for each of these word senses there is no dependency between the case frames.",
        "Word senses are in general difficult to define precisely, however, and in language processing, they would have to he disambiguated from the context anyway, which is essentially equivalent to assuming that the dependencies between case slots exist.",
        "Thus, our proposed method can in effect 'discover' implicit word senses from corpus data.",
        "and methods of resolving ambiguity are also based on the assumption that case slots are independent (Hindle and Rooth, 1991), or dependencies between at most two case slots are considered (Brill and Resnik, 1994).",
        "Thus, provision of an effective method of learning dependencies between case slots, as well as investigation of the usefulness of the acquired dependencies in disambiguation and other natural language processing tasks would be an important contribution to the field.",
        "In this paper, we view the problem of learning case frame patterns as that of learning a multidimensional discrete joint distribution, where random variables represent case slots.",
        "We then formalize the dependencies between case slots as the probabilistic dependencies between these random variables.",
        "Since the number of dependencies that exist in a multidimensional joint distribution is exponential if we allow nary dependencies in general, it is infeasible to accurately estimate them with high accuracy with a data size available in practice.",
        "It is also clear that relatively few of these random variables (case slots) are actually dependent on each other with any significance.",
        "Thus it is likely that the target joint distribution can be approximated reasonably well by the product of component distributions of low order, drastically reducing the number of parameters that need to be considered.",

        "In this research, we assume that case frame instances with the same head are generated by a joint distribution of type,",
        "where index Y stands for the head, and each of the random variables Xi, i = 1,2, ... , represents a case slot.",
        "In this paper, we use 'case slots' to mean surface case slots, and we uniformly treat obligatory cases and optional cases.",
        "Thus the number n of the random variables is roughly equal to the number of prepositions in English (and less than 100).",
        "These models can be further classified into three types of probability models according to the type of values each random variable Xi assumes`.",
        "When Xi assumes a word or a special symbol '0' as its value, we refer to the corresponding model Yt( XL , , X„) as a 'word-based model.' Here '0' indicates the absence of the case slot in question.",
        "When Xi assumes a word-class or '0' as its value, the corresponding model is called a 'class-based model.' When Xi takes on I or 0 as its value, we call the model a 'slot-based model.' Here the value of `1' indicates the presence of the case slot in question, and '0' absence.",
        "Suppose for simplicity that there are only 4 possible case slots (random variables) corresponding respectively to the subject, direct object, 'from' phrase, and `to' phrase.",

        "Finally, Ppy(Xarili = Xarg2 = Xf rain 0, X to = 0) is assigned a specific probability by a slot-based model.",
        "We then formulate the dependencies between case slots as the probabilistic dependencies between the random variables in each of these three models.",
        "In the absence of any constraints, however, the number of parameters in each of the above three models is exponential (even the slot-based model has 0(2\") parameters ), and thus it is infeasible to accurately estimate them in practice.",
        "A simplifying assumption that is often made to deal with this difficulty is that random variables (case slots) are mutually independent.",
        "Suppose for example that in the analysis of the sentence saw a girl with a telescope, (7) two interpretations are obtained.",

        "Assuming that random variables (case slots) are mutually independent would drastically reduce the number of parameters.",
        "(Note that under the independence assumption the number of parameters in a slot-based model becomes 0(0.)",
        "As illustrated in Section 1, this assumption is not necessarily valid in practice.",
        "What seems to be true in practice is that some case slots are in fact dependent but overwhelming majority of them are independent, due partly to the fact that, usually only a few slots are obligatory and most others are optional.' Thus the target joint distribution is likely to be approxirnable by the product of several component distributions of low order, and thus have in fact a reasonably small number of parameters.",
