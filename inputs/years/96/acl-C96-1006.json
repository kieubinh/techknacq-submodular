        "Bilingual dictionaries are essential components for machine translation systems.",
        "One of the major problems with bilingual dictionaries is that they are expensive to build, since a huge number of terms are used in a variety of fields.",
        "Computer support is thus needed to reduce the cost of dictionary building.",
        "With the growing volume of text available in electronic form, a number of methods have been proposed for extracting word correspondences from bilingual corpora automatically.",
        "These methods can be divided into those taking a statistical approach (Gale & Church 1991a; Kupiec 1993; Dagan et al.",
        "1993; Inoue & Nogaito 1993; Fung 1995) and those taking a linguistic approach (Yamamoto & Sakamoto 1993; Kumano & Hirakawa 1994; Ishimoto & Nagao 1994).",
        "The statistical approach utilizes the occurrence frequencies and locations of words in a parallel corpus to calculate the pairwise correlations between the words in the two languages.",
        "The linguistic approach primarily extracts correspondences between compound words by consulting a bilingual dictionary of simple words.",
        "These proposed methods for extracting word correspondences from bilingual corpora have the following drawbacks.",
        "First, most of them assume that the input corpora are aligned sentence by sentence, which reduces their applicability remarkably.",
        "Although a number of automatic sentence alignment methods have been proposed (Brown et al.",
        "1991; Gale & Church 19911); Kay & Roscheisen 1993; Chen 1993), they are not very reliable for real noisy bilingual texts.",
        "Second, the statistical methods usually require a very large corpus as their input.",
        "However, it is not easy to obtain a very large corpus.",
        "Third, the linguistic methods are restricted to extracting correspondences between compound words.",
        "We have developed an extraction method that is free from the above drawbacks.",
        "In Sec. 2 we describe the basic idea of our method and give an overview.",
        "In Sec. 3 we describe the technical details, and in Sec. 4 we describe an experiment using patent-specification texts.",
        "In Sec. 5 we make a remark on the effectiveness of the proposed method, and discuss directions for improvement."

        "The finding underlying our proposed method is as follows.",
        "In a bilingual corpus, a pair of words corresponding to each other generally accompany the same context, although expressed in the two different languages.",
        "If we calculate the pairwise correlations between the contexts in which the words occur, a correponding pair of words will show a high correlation.",
        "Although one occurrence of a word may not give a sufficient context to characterize the word, accumulating all the contexts in which the word occurs throughout the text allows the word to be distinguished from the other words in the same language text.",
        "Figure 1 shows how two words are associated through their contexts, each expressed in its respective language.",
        "We use the set of words co-occurring with word w, which we refer to as the co-occurrence set of w, to concisely represent the accumulated contexts characterizing the word.",
        "To associate two co-occurrence sets whose elements are words in different languages, we consult a bilingual dictionary and extract the possible word correspondences between them.",
        "The point is that even if the pair of words to be associated is missing in the bilingual dictionary, their co-occurrence sets can be associated through the bilingual dictionary.",
        "Of cource, some of the correspondences between the co-occurrence sets may be also missing in the bilingual dictionary.",
        "Nevertheless, the co-occurrence sets can be still associated, owing to the other correspondences between them that are contained in the bilingual dictionary.",
        "Om proposed method (Fig.",
        "2) is based on the above",
        "idea.",
        "While the examples shown here are for Japanese and English, the method is applicable to any pair of languages.",
        "The method is divided into three parts: Japanese text processing, English text processing, and bilingual processing.",
        "The Japanese text processing is composed of sentence segmentation, morphological analysis, and co-occurrence data extraction.",
        "It extracts a co-occurrence set for each word from a Japanese text.",
        "Likewise, the English text processing extracts a co-occurrence set for each word from an Engish text.",
        "The bilingual processing then calculates the pairwise correlations between the co-occurrence sets for Japanese words and those for English words, and selects the pairs of words with the highest correlations."
