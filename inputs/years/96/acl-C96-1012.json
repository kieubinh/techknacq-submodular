        "Word sense disambiguation is a crucial task in many kinds of natural language processing applications, such as word selection in machine translation (Sato, 1991), pruning of syntactic structures in parsing (Lytinen, 1986; Nagao, 1994) and text retrieval (Krovets and Croft, 1992; Voorhees, 1993).",
        "Various researches on word sense disamibignation have recently been utilized in corpus-based approaches, reflecting the growth in the number of machine readable texts.",
        "Unlike rule-based approaches, corpus-based approaches free us from the task of generalizing observed phenomena, to produce rules for word sense disambiguation, e.g. subcategorization rules.",
        "Corpus-based approaches are executed based on the intuitively feasible assumption that the higher the degree of similarity between the context of an input word and the context in which the word appears in a sense in a corpus, the more plausible it becomes that the word is used in the same sense.",
        "Corpus-based methods are classified into two approaches: example-based approaches (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994; Uramoto, 1994) and statistic-based approaches (Brown et al., 1991; Dawn!'",
        "and .1.tai, 1994; Niwa and Nitta, .1.994; Schiitze, 1992; Yarowsky, 1995).",
        "We follow tine example-based approach in explaining its effectivity for verb sense disamibiguation in Japanese.",
        "A representative example-based method for verb sense disambiguation was proposed by Kuro-hashi and Nagao (Kurohashi's method) (Kuro-hashi and Nagao, 1994).",
        "Their method uses an example database containing examples of collocations as in figure 1.",
        "Figure 1 shows a fragment of the entry associated with the Japanese verb torn.",
        "As with most words, the verb torn has multiple senses, examples of which are \"to take/steal,\" \"to attain,\" \"to subscribe\" and \"to reserve.\"",
        "The database gives one or more case frame(s) associated with the verbs for each of their senses.",
        "In Japanese, a complement of a verb, which is a constituent of the case frame of the verb, consists of a noun phrase (case filler) followed by a case marker such as ga (nominative) or o (accusative).",
        "The database has an example set of case fillers for each case.",
        "As shown in figure 1, examples of a complement can be considered as an extensional description of the selectional restriction on it.",
        "The task considered in this paper is \"to in-terpret\" a verb in an input sentence, i.e. to choose one sense from a set of candidate senses of the verb.",
        "Given an input sentence, Kuro-hashi's method interprets the verb in the input by computing semantic similarity between the input and examples.",
        "For this computation, Kurohashi's method experimentally uses the Japanese word thesaurus Bunruigoihyo (National-Language Research Institute, 1.964).",
        "As with most thesauruses, the length of the path between two words in Bun-ruipoihyo is expected to reflect the similarity between them.",
        "Figure 2 illustrates a fragment of Bunruigoihyo including some of the nouns in figure Let us take the example sentence (1).",
        "In this example, it may be judged according to figure 2 that hisho (\"secretary\") and shindaisha (\"sleeping car\") in (1) are semantically similar to joshu (\"assistant\") and hikai (\"airplane\"), respectively, which are examples that collocate with torn (\"to reserve\").",
        "As such, the sense of torn in (1) can be interpreted as \"to reserve.\"",
        "However, in1Kurohashi's method, several useful properties for verb disambuguation are missing:",
        "accusative to verb sense disambiguation is greater than that of the nominative with the case of verb \"toru.\"",
        "2.",
        "The selectional restriction of a certain case is stronger than those of others.",
        "For example, in the accusative, the selectional restriction of \"to subscribe\" is stronger than that of \"to take/steal\" which allows various kinds of objects as its case filler.",

        "The nominative, shachO (\"company president\"), in (2) is found in the \"to attain\" case frame of torn and there is no other co-occurrence in any other sense of torn; therefore, the nominative supports an interpretation \"to attain.\"",
        "On the other hand,",
        "the accusative, shilkanshi (\"magazine\"), is most similar to the examples included in the accusative of the \"to subscribe\" and therefore the accusative supports another interpretation \"to subscribe.\"",
        "Although the most plausible interpretation here is actually the latter, Kurohashi's method would choose the former since (a) the degree in which the nominative supports \"to attain\" happens to be stronger than the degree in which the accusative supports \"to subscribe,\" and (b) their method always relies equally on the similarity in the nominative and the accusative.",
        "However, in the case of torn, since the semantic range of nouns collocating with the verb in the nominative does not seem to have a strong delinearization in a semantic sense, it would be difficult, or even risky, to properly interpret the verb sense based on the similarity in the nominative.",
        "In contrast, since the ranges are diverse in the accusative, it would be feasible to rely more strongly on the similarity in the accusative.",
        "This argument can be illustrated as in figure 3, in which the symbols \"1\" and \"2\" denote example case fillers of different case frames respectively, and an input sentence includes two case fillers denoted by \"x\" and \"y.\"",
        "The figure shows the distribution of example case fillers denoted by those symbols in a semantic space, where the semantic similarity between two case fillers is represented by the physical distance between two symbols.",
        "In the nominative, since \"x\" happens to",
        "be much closer to a \"2\" than any \"1,\" \"x\" may be estimated to belong to the range of \"2\"s although \"x\" accually belongs to both sets of \"1\"s and \"2\"s. In the accusative, however, \"y\" would be properly estimated to belong to \"1\"s due to the mutual independence of the two accusative case filler sets, even though examples did not fully cover each of the ranges of \"1\"s and \"2\"s. Note that this difference would he critical if example data were sparse.",
        "This argument suggests that we introduce the degree of contribution of case to verb sense disambiguation.",
        "One may argue that this property can be generalized as the notion that the system always relies only on the similarity ill the accusative for verb sense disambiguation.",
        "Although some typical verbs show this general notion, it is not guaranteed for any kind of verb.",
        "Our approach, which computes the degree of contribution for each verb respectively, can handle exeptional cases as well as typical ones.",
        "In (3) the most plausible interpretation of torn is \"to steal.\"",
        "The nominative does not give much information for interpreting the verb for the same reason as exatuple (2).",
        "In the accusative, the database in figure 1 has two example case fillers that are equally similar to omocita (\"toy\"): saifu (\"wallet\") and hikOki (\"airplane\").",
        "These examples equally support two different interpretations: \"to steal\" and \"to reserve,\" which means that the verb sense ambiguity still remains.",
        "Here, one may notice that since the accusative examples ill the case frame of loin ('h) reserve\") are less diverse in meaning than the other case frames, the sekw-clonal restriction on the accusative of torn (\"to re-serve\") is relatively strong, and thus that it call be estimated to be relatively implausible for mocha (\"toy\") to satisfy it.",
        "If such reasoning is correct, given that the examples in the accusative of torn (\"to steal\") are most widely distributed, the input verb can be interpreted as \"to steal,\" The consideration above motivated us to introduce the notion of relative strength of selectional restriction into our example-based verb sense disambiguation method."
