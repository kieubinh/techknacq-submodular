        "When constructing a Lexical Knowledge Base (L1{.13) useful for Natural Language Processing, the source of information from which knowledge is acquired and the structuring of this information within the LKB are two key issues.",
        "Machine Readable Dictionaries (MRDs) are a good source of lexical information and have been shown to be applicable to the task of li,K13 construction (Dolan et al., 1993; Calzolari, 1992; Copestake, 1990; Wilks et at, 1989; Byrd et al., 1987).",
        "Often though, a localist approach is adopted whereby the words are kept in alphabetical order with some representation of their definitions in the form of a template or feature structure.",
        "Effort in finding connections between words is seen in work on automatic extraction of semantic relations from MRDs (Ahlswede and Evens, 1988; Alshawi, 1989; Montemagni and Vanderwende, 1992).",
        "Additionally, effort in finding words that are close semantically is seen by the current interest in statistical techniques for word clustering, looking at co-occurrences of words in text corpora or dictionaries (Church and Hanks, 1989; Wilks et al., 1989; Brown et al., 1992; Pereira et al., 1995).",
        "Inspired by research it) the areas of semantic relations, semantic distance, concept clustering, and using Conceptual Graphs (Sowa, 1984) as our knowledge representation, we introduce Concept Clustering Knowledge Graphs (CCKGs).",
        "Each CCKG will start as a Conceptual Graph representation of a trigger word and will expand following a search algorithm to incorporate related words and form a Concept Cluster.",
        "The concept cluster in itself is interesting for tasks such as word disambiguation, but the CCKG will give more to that cluster.",
        "It will give the relations between the words, making the graph in some aspects similar to a script (Schank and Abelson, 1975).",
        "However, a CCKG is generated automatically and does not rely on primitives but on an unlimited number of concepts, showing objects, persons, and actions interacting with each other.",
        "This interaction will he set within a particular domain, and the trigger word should be a key word of the domain to represent.",
        "if that process would be done for the whole dictionary, we would obtain an LK13 divided into multiple clusters of words, each represented by a CCKG.",
        "Then during text processing for example, a portion of text could be analyzed using the appropriate CCKG to find implicit relations and help understanding the text.",
