        "In this paper we describe how syntactic and prosodic information interact in a translation module for spoken utterances which tries to meet the two – often conflicting – main objectives, the implementation of theoretically sound solutions and efficient processing of the solutions.",
        "As an analysis which meets the first criterion but seemingly fails to meet the second one, we take an analysis of the German clause which relies on traces in verbal head positions in the framework of Read-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (IIPSG, cf. (Pollard&Sag, 1994)).",
        "The methods described in this paper have been implemented as part of the IBM-SynSem• Module and the FAU-Erlangen/LMU-Munich-Prosody-Module in the MT project VNIIHMOBIL (cf. (Wahlster, 1993)) where spontaneously spoken utterances in a negotiation dialogue are translated.",

        "The output of the parser is the semantic representation for the best string hypothesis in the lattice.",
        "It is our main result that prosodic information can be employed in such a system to determine possible locations for empty elements in the input.",
        "Rather than treating prosodic information as virtual input items which have to match an appropriate category in the grammar rules (Bear&Price, 1990), or which by virtue of being 'unknown' in the grammar force the parser to close off the current phrase (Marcus&Hindle, 1990), our parser employs prosodic information as affecting the postulation of empty elements.",
        "2 An HPsG Analysis of German Clause Structure IIPSG makes crucial use of \"head traces\" to analyze the verb-second (V2) phenomenon pertinent in German, i.e. the fact that finite verbs appear in second position in main clauses but in final position in subordinate clauses, as exemplified in (la) and (lb).",

        "Following (Kiss&Wesche, 1991) we assume that the structural relationship between the verb and its arguments and modifiers is not affected by the position of the verb.",
        "The overt relationship between the verb 'reparierie' and its object 'den We-ecil' in (lb) is preserved in (1a), although the verb shows up in a different position.",
        "The apparent contradiction is resolved by assuming an empty element which serves as a substitute for the verb in second position.",

        "The structure of the main clause presented in (2) can be justified on several grounds.",
        "In particular, the parallelism in verbal scope between verb final and V2 clauses – exemplified in (3a) and (3b) – can be modeled best by assuming that the scope of a verb is always determined w.r.t.",

        "In a V2 clause, the scope of the verb is determined with respect to the empty verbal head only.",
        "Since the structural position of an empty verbal head is identical to the structural position of an overt finite verb in a verb final clause, the invariance does not come as a surprise.",

        "Information pertaining to empty heads are projected along the DOUBLE SLASH (DSO feature instead of the SLASH feature (cf. (Horsley, 1989)).",
        "The empty head is described in (4) where the LOCAL value is coindexed with the Dsr, value.",
        "The Dsr, of a head is identical to the Dsr, of the mother, i.e. Dsr, does not behave like a NONLOCAL but like a IIF,AD feature.",
        "A Ds', dependency is bound if the verbal projection is selected by a verb in second position.",
        "A lexical rule guarantees that the selector shares all relevant information with the Ds', value of the selected verbal projection.",
        "The relationship between a verb in final position, a verb in second position and the empty head can be summarized as follows: For each final finite verb form, there is a corresponding finite verb form in second position which licenses a verbal projection whose empty head shares its Locnr, information with the corresponding final verb form.",
        "It is thus guaranteed that the syntactic arguments of the empty head are identical to the syntactic arguments required by the selecting verb."

        "Direct parsing of empty elements can become a tedious task, decreasing the efficiency of a system considerably.",
        "Note first, that a reduction of empty elements in a grammar in favor of disjunctive lexical representations, as suggested in (Pollard&Sag, 1994, ch.9), cannot be pursued.",
        "(Pollard&Sag, 1994) assume that an argument may occur on the SUBCAT or on the SLASH list.",
        "A lexical operation removes the argument from SUBCAT and puts it onto SLASH.",
        "Hence, no further need for a syntactic representation of empty elements emerges.",
        "This strategy, however, will not work for head traces because they do not occur as dependents on a SUBCAT list.",
        "If empty elements have to be represented syntactically, a top-down parsing strategy seems better suited than a bottom-up strategy.",
        "Particularly, a parser driven by a bottom-up strategy has to hypothesize the presence of empty elements at every point in the input.",
        "In IIPSG, however, only very few constraints are available for a top-down regime since most information is contained in lexical items.",
        "The parser will not restrict the stipulation of empty elements until a lexical element containing restrictive information has been processed.",
        "The apparent advantage of top-down parsing is thus lost when llPsGs are to be parsed.",
        "The same criticism applies to other parsing strategies with a strong top-down orientation, such as left corner parsing or head corner parsing.",
        "We have thus chosen a bottom-up parsing strategy where the introduction of empty verbal heads is constrained by syntactic and prosodic information.",
        "The syntactic constraints build on the facts that a) a verb trace will occur always to the right of its licenser and b) always 'lower' in the syntax tree.",
        "Furthermore c) since the Dm, percolation mechanism ensures structure sharing between the verb and its trace, a verb trace always comes with a corresponding overt verb.",
        "As a consequence of c) the parser has a fully den",
        "specified verb form – although with empty phonology – at hand, rather than having to cope with the underspecified structure in (4).",
        "This form can be determined at compile time and stored in the lexicon together with the corresponding verb form.",
        "It is pushed onto the trace stack whenever this verb is accessed.",
        "Although a large number of bottom-up hypotheses regarding the position of an empty element can be eliminated by providing the parser with the aforementioned information, the number of wrong hypotheses is still significant.",
        "In a verb-2nd clause most of the input follows a finite verb form so that condition a) indeed is not very restrictive.",
        "Condition b) rules out a large number of structures but often cannot prevent the stipulation of traces in illicit positions.",
        "Condition c) has the most restrictive effect in that the syntactic potential of the trace is determined by that of the corresponding verb.",
        "If the number of possible trace locations could be reduced significantly, the parser could avoid a large number of subanalyses that conditions a)-c) would rule out only at later stages of the derivation.",
        "The strategy that will be advocated in the remainder of this paper employs prosodic information to accomplish this reduction.",
        "Empty verbal heads can only occur in the right periphery of a phrase, i.e. at a phrase boundary.",
        "The introduction of empty arcs is then not only conditioned by the syntactic constraints mentioned before, but additionally, by certain requirements on the prosodic structure of the input.",
        "It turns out, then, that a fine-grained prosodic classification of utterance turns, based on correlations between syntactic and prosodic structure is not only of use to determine the segmentation of a turn, but also, to predict which positions are eligible for trace stipulation.",

        "The classification experiments for this paper were conducted on a set of 21 human – human dialogs, which are prosodically labelled (cf. (Reyelt, 1995)).",
        "We chose 18 dialogs (492 turns, 36 different speakers, 6996 words) for training, and 3 dialogs for testing (80 turns, 4 different speakers, 1049 words).",
        "The computation of the acoustic – prosodic features is based on a time alignment of the phoneme sequence corresponding to the spoken or recognized words.",
        "To exclude word recognition errors, for this paper we only used the spoken word sequence thus simulating 100 % word recognition.",
        "The time alignment is done by a standard hidden Markov model word recognizer.",

        "• the normalized duration of the syllable nucleus • the minimum, maximum, onset, and offset of fundamental frequency (F0) and the maximum energy and their positions on the time axis relative to the position of the actual syllable • the mean energy, and the mean FO • flags indicating whether the syllable carries the lexical word accent or whether it is in a word final position",
        "The following features were computed only for the syllable under consideration:",
        "• the length of the pause (if any) preceding or succeeding the word containing the syllable • the linear regression coefficients of the FO – contour and the energy contour computed over 15 different windows to the left and to the right of the syllable",
        "This amounts to a set of 242 features, which so far achieved best results on a large database of read speech; for a more detailed account of the feature evaluation, (cf. (Kief3ling, 1996)).",
        "The full set of features could not be used due to the lack of sufficient training data.",
        "Best results were achieved with a subset of features, containing mostly durational features and FO regression coefficients.",
        "A first set of reference labels",
        "was based on perceptive evaluation of prosodically marked boundaries by non-naive listeners (cf. (Reyelt, 1995)).",
        "Here, we will only deal with major prosodic phrase boundaries (B3) that correspond closely to the intonational phrase boundaries in the ToBI approach, (cf. (Beck-man&Ayers, 1994)), vs. all other boundaries (no boundary, minor prosodic boundary, irregular boundary).",
        "Still, a purely perceptual labelling of the phrase boundaries under consideration seems problematic.",
        "In particular, we find phrase boundaries which are classified according to the perceptual labelling although they did not correspond to a syntactic phrase boundary.",

(Feldhaus&Kiss, 1995)), i.e. a labelling which is solely based on linguistic definitions of possible phrase boundaries in German.",
        "Thus instead of labelling a variety of prosodic phenomena which may be interpreted as boundaries, the labelling follows systematically the syntactic phrasing, assuming that the prosodic realization of syntactic boundaries exhibits properties that can be learned by a prosodic classification algorithm.",
        "The 21 dialogues described above were labelled according to this scheme.",
        "For the classification reported in the following, we employ three main labels, S3+ (syntactic boundary obligatory), S3 – (syntactic boundary impossible), and S3?",
        "(syntactic boundary optional).",
        "Table 1 shows the correspondence between the S3 and B3 labels (not taking turn-final labels into account).",

        "The MLP has one output node for S3+ and one for S3 – .",
        "During training the desired output for each of the feature vectors is set to one for the node corresponding to the reference label; the other one is set to zero.",
        "With this method in theory the MLP estimates posteriori probabilities for the classes under consideration.",
        "However, in order to balance for the a priori probabilities of the different classes, during training the MLP was presented with an equal number of feature vectors from each class.",
        "For the experiments, MLPs with 40/20 nodes in the first/second hidden layer showed best results.",
        "For both S3 and B3 labels we obtained overall recognition rates of over 80% (cf. table 2).",
        "Note, that due to limited training data, errors in FO computation and variabilities in the acoustic marking of prosodic events across speakers, dialects, and so on, one cannot expect an error free detection of these boundaries.",
        "Table 2 shows the recognition results in percent for the S3+/S3 – classifier and for the B3/not-B3 classifier using the S3 – positions as reference (first column) again not counting turn final boundaries.",
        "For example, in the first row the number 24 means that 24% of the S3+ labels were classified as S3 – , the number 75 means that 75% of the S3+ labels were classified as B3.",
        "What table 2 shows, then, is that syntactic S3 boundaries can be classified using only prosodic information, yielding recognition rates comparable to those for the recognition of perceptually identified B3 boundaries.",
        "This means for our purposes, that we do not need to label boundaries perceptually, but can instead employ an approach as the one advocated in (Feldhaus&Kiss, 1995), using only the transliterated data.",
        "While this system turned out to be very time-consuming when applied to larger quantities of data, (Batliner et al., 1996) report on promising results applying a similar but less labor-intensive system.",
        "It has further to be considered that the recognition rate for perceptual labelling contained those cases where phrase boundaries have been recognized in positions which are impossible on syntactic grounds – cf.",
        "the number of cases in table (1) where a S3 – position was classified as B3 and vice versa.",
        "It is important to note, that this approach does not take syntactic boundaries and phonological boundaries to be one and the same thing.",
        "It is a well-known fact that these two phenomena often are orthogonal to each other.",
        "However, the question to be answered was, can we devise an automatic procedure to identify the syntactic bound",
        "aries with (at least) about the same reliability as the prosodic ones?",
        "As the figures in table (2) demonstrate the answer to this question is yes.",
        "Our overall recognition rate of 84.5% for the S3-classifier (cf. table (2)) cannot exactly be compared with results reported in other studies because these studies were either based on read and carefully designed material, (cf., e.g., (Bear&Price, 1990), (Ostenhof&Veilleux, 1994)), or they used not automatically computed acoustic – prosodic features but textual and perceptual information, (cf.

        "In order to approximate the usefulness of prosodic information to reduce the number of verb trace hypotheses for the parser we examined a corpus of 104 utterances with prosodic annotations denoting the probability of a syntactic boundary after every given word.",
        "For every node whose S3 boundary probability exceeds a certain threshold value, we considered the hypothesis that this node is followed by a verb trace.",
        "These hypotheses were then rated valid or invalid by the grammar writer.",
        "Note that such a setting where a position in the input is annotated with scores representing the respective boundary probabilities is much more robust w.r.t unclear classification results than a pure binary 'boundary-vs.-nonboundary' distinction.",

        "Correct: 138 False Alarm : 274 no XO prop.",

        "Evaluation of these figures for our test corpus and a threshold value of 0,01 yielded the following result:",
        "In practice this means that the number of locations where the parser has to assume the presence",
        "of a verb trace could be reduced from 1121 to 412 while only 6 necessary trace positions remained unmarked.",
        "These results were obtained from a corpus of spoken utterances many of which contained several independent phrases and sentences.",
        "These segments, however, are also often separated by an S3-boundary, so that the error rate is likely to drop considerably if a segmentation of utterances into syntactically well-formed phrases is performed prior to the trace detection.",
        "Since cases where the verb trace is not located at the end of a sentence (i.e. where extraposition takes place) involve a highly characteristic categorial context, we expect a further improvement if the trace/notrace classification based on prosodic information is combined with a language model.",
        "The problem with the approach described above is that a careful estimation of the threshold value is necessary and this threshold may vary from speaker to speaker or between certain discourse situations.",
        "Furthermore the analysis fails in those cases where the correct position is rated lower than this value, i.e. where the parser does not consider the correct trace position at all.",
        "Thus, in a second experiment we examined how the syntactically correct verb trace position is ranked among the positions proposed by the prosody module w.r.t.",
        "its S3-boundary probability.",
        "If the correct position turns out to be consistently ranked among the positions with the highest S3 probability within a sentence then it might be preferable for the parsing module to consider the S3 positions in descending order rather than to introduce traces for all positions ranked above a threshold.",
        "For the second experiment we considered only those segments in the input that represent V2 clauses, i.e. we assumed that the input has been segmented correctly.",
        "Within these sentences we ranked all the spaces between words according to the associated S3 probability and determined the rank of the correct verb trace position.",
        "When performing this test on 134 sentences the following picture emerged:",
        "Table 5 shows that in the majority of cases the position with the highest S3 probability turns out to be the correct one.",
        "It has to be added though, that in many cases the correct verb trace position is at the end of the sentence which is often very reliably marked with a prosodic phrase boundary, even if this sentence is uttered in a sequence together with other phrases or sentences.",
        "This end-of-sentence marker will be assigned a higher S3 probability in most cases, even if the correct verb trace position is located elsewhere.",
        "In a third experiment finally we were interested in the overall speedup of the processing module that resulted form our approach.",
        "In order to estimate this, we parsed a corpus of 109 turns in two different settings: While in the first round the threshold value was set as described above, we selected a value of 0 for the second pass.",
        "The parser thus had to consider every postion in the input as a potential head trace location just as if no prosodic information about syntactic boundaries were available at all.",
