        "This paper shows how machine learning techniques can be used to induce linguistically relevant rules and categories from data.",
        "Statistical, con-nectionist, and machine learning induction (data-oriented approaches) are currently used mainly in language engineering applications in order to alleviate the linguistic knowledge acquisition bottleneck (the fact that lexical arid grammatical knowledge usually has to be reformulated from scratch whenever a new application has to be built or an existing application ported to a new domain), and to solve problems with robustness and coverage inherent in knowledge-based (theory-oriented, hand-crafting) approaches.",
        "Linguistic relevance or inspectability of the induced knowledge is usually riot an issue in this type of research.",
        "In linguistics, on the other hand, it is usually agreed that while computer modeling is a useful (or essential) tool for enforcing internal consistency, completeness, and empirical validity of the linguistic theory being modeled, its role in formulating or evaluating linguistic theories is minimal.",
        "In tins paper, we argue that machine learning techniques can also assist in linguistic theory for",
        "'nation by providing a new tool for the evaluation of linguistic hypotheses, for the extraction of rules from corpora, and for the discovery Of useful linguistic categories.",
        "As a case study, we apply Quinlan's C4.5 inductive machine learning method (Quinlan, 1993) to a particular linguistic task (diminutive formation in Dutch) and show that it call be used (i) to test linguistic hypotheses about this process, (ii) to discover interesting morphological rules, and (iii) discover interesting phonological categories.",
        "Nothing hinges on our choice of C4.5 as a rule induction mechanism.",
        "We chose it because it is an easily available and sophisticated instance of the class of rule induction algorithms.",
        "A second focus of this paper is the interaction between supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods in linguistic discovery.",
        "In supervised learning, the learner is presented a set; of examples (the experience of the system).",
        "These examples consist of an input output; association (in our case, e.g., a representation of a noun as input, and the corresponding diminutive suffix as output).",
        "Unsupervised learning methods do riot provide the learner with information about the output to be generated; only the inputs are presented to the learner as experience, not the target outputs.",
        "Unsupervised learning is necessarily more limited than supervised learning; the only information it has to construct categories is the similarity between inputs.",
        "Unsupervised learning has been successfully applied e.g. for the discovery of syntactic categories from corpora on the basis of distributional information about words (Finch and Chater 1992, Hughes 1994, Schiitze 1995).",
        "We will show that; it is possible and useful to make use of unsupervised learning relative to a particular task which is being learned in a supervised way.",
        "In our experiment, phonological categories are discovered in an unsupervised way, as a side-effect of the supervised learning of a morphological problem.",

        "For the experiments, we used C4.5 (Quinlan, 1993).",
        "Although several decision tree and rule induction variants have been proposed, we chose this program because it is widely available and reasonably well tested.",
        "C4.5 is a TDIDT (Top Down induction of Decision Trees) decision tree learning algorithm which constructs a decision tree on the basis of a set of examples (the training set).",

        "If T contains one or more cases all belonging to the same class then the decision tree for T is a leaf node with category 2.",
        "If T is empty, a category has to be found on the basis of other information (e.g. domain knowledge).",
        "The heuristic used here is that the most frequent class in the initial training set is used.",
        "3.",
        "If T contains different classes then (a) Choose a test (feature) with a finite number of outcomes (values), and partition T into subsets of examples that have the same outcome for the test chosen.",
        "The decision tree consists of a root node containing the test, and a branch for each outcome, each branch leading to a subset of the original set.",
        "(b) Apply the procedure recursively to subsets created this way.",
        "In this algorithm, it is not specified which test to choose to split a node into subtrees at some point.",
        "Taking one at random will usually result in large decision trees with poor generalization performance, as uninformative tests may be chosen.",
        "Considering all possible trees consistent with the data is computationally intractable, so a reliable heuristic test selection method has to be found.",
        "The method used in C4.5 is based on the concept of mutual information (or information gain).",
        "Whenever a test has to be selected, the feature is chosen with the highest information gain.",
        "This is the feature that reduces the information entropy of the training (sub)set on average most, when its value would be known.",
        "For the computation of information gain, see Quinlan (1993).",
        "Decision trees can be easily and automatically transformed into sets of if-then rules (production rules), which are in general easier to understand by domain experts (linguists in our case).",
        "In C4.5 this tree-to-rule transformation involves additional statistical evaluation resulting sometimes in a rule set more understandable and accurate than the corresponding decision tree.",
        "The C4.5 algorithm also contains a value grouping method which, on the basis of statistical information, collapses different values for a feature into the same category.",
        "That way, more concise decision trees and rules can be produced (instead of several different branches or rule conditions for each value, only one branch or condition has to be defined, making reference to a class of values).",
        "The algorithm works as a heuristic search of the search space of all possible partitionings of the values of a particular feature into sets, with the formation of homogeneous nodes (nodes representing examples with predominantly the same category) as a heuristic guide.",
