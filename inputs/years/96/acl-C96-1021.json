        "While one of the strong points of this algorithm is that it operates primarily on syntactic information alone, this also turns out to be a limiting factor for its wide use: current state-of-the-art of practically applicable parsing technology still falls short of robust and reliable delivery of syntactic analysis of real texts to the level of detail and precision that the filters and constraints described by Lappin and I pass assume.",
        "We are particularly interested in a class of text processing applications, capable of delivery of content analysis to a depth involving non-trivial amount of discourse processing, including anaphora resolution.",
        "The operational context prohibits us from making any assumptions concerning domain, style, and genre of input; as a result, we have developed a text processing framework which builds its capabilities entirely on the basis of a considerably shallower linguistic analysis of the input stream, thus trading off depth of base level analysis for breadth of coverage.",
        "n this paper, we present work on modifying the Lappin/Leans algorithm in a way which enables it to work off a flat morpho-syntactic analysis of the sentences of a text, while retaining a degree of quality and accuracy in pronominal anaphora resolution comparable to that"

        "In addition to extremely high levels of accuracy in recall and precision of tag assignment ((Voutilainen et al., 1992) report 99.77% overall recall and 95.54% overall precision, over a variety of text genres, and in comparison with other state-of-the-art tagging systems), the primary motivation for adopting this system is the requirement to develop a robust text processor with anaphora resolution being just one of its discourse analysis functions – capable of reliably handling arbitrary kinds of input.",
        "The tagger provides a very simple analysis of the structure of the text: for each lexical item in each sentence, it provides a set of values which indicate the morphological, lexical, grammatical and syntactic features of the item in the context in which it appears.",

        "For the purposes of anaphora resolution, the primary data set consists of a complete listing of all noun phrases, reduced to modifier-head sequences.",
        "This data set is obtained by means of a phrasal grammar whose patterns characterize the composition of a noun phrase (NP) in terms of possible token sequences.",
        "The output of NP identification is a set of token/ feature matrix/offset sequences, where offset value is determined by the offset of the first token in the sequence.",
        "The offset indicates the position of the NP in the text, and so provides crucial information about precedence relations.",
        "A secondary data set consists of observations about the syntactic contexts in which the NPs identified by the phrasal grammar appear.",

        "This is accomplished by running a set of patterns which identify NPs that occur locally to adverbs, relative pronouns, and noun-preposition or noun-complementizer sequences over the tagged text in conjunction with the basic NP patterns described above.",

        "The salience factors used by our algorithm are defined below with their values.",
        "Our salience factors mirror those used by (Lappin and Leass, 1994), with the exception of POSS-S, discussed below, and CNTX-S, which is sensitive to the context in which a discourse referent appears, where a context is a topically coherent segment of text, as determined by a text-segmentation algorithm which follows (Hearst, 1994).",
        "SENT-S: 100 iff in the current sentence CNTX-S: 50 iff in the current context",
        "Note that the values of salience factors are arbitrary; what is crucial, as pointed out by (Lappin and Leass, 1994), is the relational structure imposed on the factors by these values.",
        "The relative ranking of the factors is justified both linguistically, as a reflection of the role of the functional hierarchy in determining anaphoric relations (cf. (Keenan and Comrie, 1977)), as well as by experimental results – both Lappin and Leass' and our own.",
        "For all factors except CNTX-S and POSS-S, we adopt the values derived from a series of experiments described in (Lappin and Leass, 1994) which used different settings to determine the relative importance of The implementation of a COREF object needs to be aware of potential circularities, thus a CORED does not actually contain its member discourse referents, but rather a listing of their offsets.",

        "Our values for civrx-s and POSS-S were determined using similar tests.",
        "An important feature of our implementation of salience, following that of Lappin and Leass, is that it is variable: the salience of a COREF class decreases and increases according to the frequency of reference to the class.",
        "When an anaphoric link is established between a pronoun and a previously introduced discourse referent, the pronoun is added to the COREF class associated with the discourse referent, its COREF value is set to the COREF value of the antecedent (i.e., to the COREF object which represents the class), and the salience of the COREF object is recalculated according to how the new member satisfies the set of salience factors.",
        "This final step raises the overall salience of the COREF, since the new member will minimally satisfy SENT-S and CNTX-S. Salience is not stable, however: in order to realistically represent the local prominence of discourse referents in a text, a decay function is built into the algorithm, so that salience weight decreases over time.",
        "If new members are not added, the salience weight of a COREF eventually reduces to zero.",
        "The consequence of this variability in salience is that a very general heuristic for anaphora resolution is established: resolve a pronoun to the most salient candidate antecedent.",
        "As noted above, in terms of overall strategy, the resolution procedure follows that of Lappin and Leass.",
        "The first step in interpreting the discourse referents in a new sentence is to decrease the salience weights of the COREF classes that have already been established by a factor of two.",
        "Next, the algorithm locates all non-anaphoric discourse referents in the sentence under consideration, generates a new COREF class for each one, and calculates its salience weight according to how the discourse referent satisfies the set of salience factors.",
        "The second step involves the interpretation of lexical anaphors (reflexives and reciprocals).",
        "A list of candidate antecedent-anaphor pairs is generated for every lexical anaphor, based on the hypothesis that a lexical anaphor must refer to a coargument.",
        "In the absence of configurational information, coarguments are identified using grammatical function information (as determined by LINGSOFT) and precedence relations.",
        "A reflexive can have one of three possible grammatical function values: direct object, indirect object, or oblique.",
        "In the first case, the closest preceding discourse referent with grammatical function value subject is identified as a possible antecedent.",
        "In the latter cases, both the closest preceding subject and the closest preceding direct object that is not separated from the anaphor by a subject are identified as possible antecedents.",
        "If more than one possible antecedent is located for a lexical anaphor, the one with the highest salience weight is determined to be the actual antecedent.",
        "Once an antecedent has been located, the anaphor is added to the COREF class associated with the antecedent, and the salience of the COREF class is recalculated accordingly.",
        "The final step is the interpretation of pronouns.",
        "The basic resolution heuristic, as noted above, is quite simple: generate a set of candidate antecedents, then establish coreference with the candidate which has the greatest salience weight (in the event of a tie, the closest candidate is chosen).",
        "In order to generate the candidate set, however, those discourse referents with which",
        "a pronoun cannot refer must be eliminated from consideration.",
        "This is accomplished by running the overall candidate pool (the set of interpreted discourse referents whose salience values exceed an arbitrarily set threshold) through two sets of filters: a set of morphological agreement filters, which eliminate from consideration any discourse referent which disagrees in person, number, or gender with the pronoun, and a set of disjoint reference filters.",
        "The determination of disjoint reference represents a significant point of divergence between our algorithm and the Lappin/Leass algorithm, because, as is well known, configurational relations play a prominent role in determining which constituents in a sentence a pronoun may refer to.",
        "Three conditions are of particular relevance to the anaphora resolution algorithm:",
        "In the absence of configurational information, our algorithm relies on inferences from grammatical function and precedence to determine disjoint reference.",
        "In practice, even without accurate information about constituent structure, the syntactic filters described below are extremely accurate (see the discussion of this point in section 4).",
        "Condition 1 is implemented by locating all discourse referents with GRIN value direct object, indirect object, or oblique which follow a pronoun with GRIN value subject or direct object, as long as no subject intervenes (the hypothesis being that a subject indicates the beginning of the next clause).",
        "Discourse referents which satisfy these conditions are identified as disjoint.",
        "Condition 2 is implemented by locating for every non-adjunct and non-embedded pronoun the set of non-pronominal discourse referents in its sentence which follow it, and eliminating these as potential antecedents.",
        "In effect, the command relation is inferred from precedence and the information provided by the syntactic patterns: an argument which is neither contained in an adjunct nor embedded in another nominal commands those expressions which it precedes.",
        "Condition 3 makes use of the observation that a discourse referent contains every object to its right with a non-nil EMBED value.",
        "The algorithm identifies as disjoint a discourse referent and every pronoun which follows it and has a non-nil EMBED value, until a discourse referent with.",
        "EMBED value NIL is located (marking the end of the containment domain).",
        "Condiditon 3 also rules out coreference between a genitive pronoun and the NP it modifies.",
        "After the morphological and syntactic filters have been applied, the set of discourse referents that remain constitute the set of candidate antecedents for the pronoun.",
        "The candidate set is subjected to a final evaluation procedure which performs two functions: it decreases the salience of candidates which the pronoun precedes (cataphora is penalized), and it increases the salience of candidates which satisfy either a locality or a parallelism condition (described below), both of which apply to intrasentential candidates.",
        "The locality heuristic is designed to negate the effects of subordination when both candidate and anaphor appear in the same subordinate context, the assumption being that the prominence of a candidate should be determined with respect to the position of the anaphor.",
        "This is a point of difference between our algorithm and the one described in (Lappin and Leass, 1994).",
        "The salience of a candidate which is determined to be in the same subordinate context as a pronoun (determined as a function of precedence relations and EMBED and ADJUNCT values) is temporarily increased to the level it would have were the candidate not in the subordinate context; the level is returned to normal after the anaphor is resolved.",
        "The parallelism heuristic rewards candidates which are such that the pair consisting of the GFUN values of candidate and anaphor are identical to GFUN values of a previously identified anaphor-antecedent pair.",
        "This parallelism heuristic differs from a similar one used by the Lappin/ Leass algorithm, which rewards candidates whose grammatical function is identical to that of an anaphor.",
        "Once the generation and evaluation of the candidate set is complete, the candidates are ranked according to salience weight, and the candidate with the highest salience weight is determined to be the antecedent of the pronoun under consideration.",
        "In the event of a tie, the candidate which most immediately precedes the anaphor is selected as the antededent (where precedence is determined by comparing offset values).",
