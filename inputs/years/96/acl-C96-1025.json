        "Under the compositional assumption, semantic analysis relies on the combination of the meaning representations of parts to build the meaning representations of a whole.",
        "However, this composition often needs to call on implicit knowledge which helps to link the two meaning representations.",
        "This is the case, for instance, in metonymic expressions, where a word is used to express a notion closely related to its central meaning.",
        "A well-known stream of work addressing this phenomenon is the Generative Lexicon theory (Pustejovsky, 1991).",
        "At the heart of this theory is a lexical semantic representation called \"qualia struc-ture\".",

        "We address here the treatment of metonymic expressions from a knowledge representation perspective, in the context of the MENELAS medical text understanding system (Zweigenbaum et al., 1995).",
        "One of the goals of the overall system is to assign standardised, medical nomenclature codes to the input texts (patient discharge summaries).",
        "Semantic analysis starts from a syntactic representation of each sentence and produces a conceptual representation.",
        "It is then used by several language-independent, knowledge-based components to perform inferences (pragmatic enrichment) and then code assignment (Delamarre et al., 1995).",
        "Therefore, the conceptual representation output by the semantic analyser must be normalised: it must conform to a knowledge representation canon in which the target nomenclature codes can be mapped.",
        "The specification of this canon relies on the description of a rich model of the domain in a knowledge representation formalism, here Conceptual Graphs (CG) (Sowa, 1984).",
        "We focus in this paper on the part of the semantic analyser that deals with semantic composition.",
        "The conceptual representation built must be abstracted from initial linguistic variation, metonymy being a typical problem to be addressed.",
        "We explain how we use the domain model to handle metonymy, and more generally, to underlie semantic composition, using the knowledge descriptions attached to each concept of our ontology as a kind of concept-level, multiple-role qualia structure.",
        "The methods described have been implemented and applied to French texts.",
        "We first recall the problem addressed (section 2).",
        "Then, the proposed method is described (section 3) and illustrated on an example.",

        "A classical example of metonymy (Pustejovsky, 1991, p. 428ff) is",

        "In our domain (coronary diseases), one often finds expressions such as",
        "(2) une angioplastie du segment II (an angioplasty of segment II) (3) une angioplastie d'une artêre coronaire (an angioplasty of a coronary artery) (4) l'angioplastie de Monsieur X (the angioplasty of Mr X) (5) une angioplastie de la stenose (an angioplasty of the stenosis)",

        "If one considers that this theme must be a physical object, then examples (2)–(4) conform to the selectional restrictions of 'angioplasty', while (5) violates them.",
        "The mechanism of type coercion (Pustejovsky, 1991) consists in converting a word type into another so that semantic composition can work properly.",
        "(5) is then handled as a metonymy, where the stenosis and the stenosed object enter a state/thing alternation: `stenosis' is turned into an 'object'.",
        "However, it appears that this phenomenon is dependent on the underlying types (or \"sorts\") under consideration.",
        "For instance in our ontology, `segment', 'artery', `stenosis' and 'human' have four different types, and are not comparable by the IS-A relation, e.g. nothing can be both a segment and an artery.'",
        "This is a voluntary, methodological choice (Bouaud et al., 1995), motivated by the fact that these objects give rise to different inferences and must not be confused by the reasoning component.",
        "Additionally, in the target normalised conceptual representation, what constitutes the specific theme (in our conceptual model, the purported_obj) of action 'angioplasty' must be precisely defined.",
        "In the context of our application, 'angioplasty' acts on an artery_segment, a physical object corresponding to a part of an artery, which happens not to be comparable to any of the four preceding themes of 'angioplasty'.2 Therefore, all four examples (2)–(5) must be considered as metonymies.",
        "1Segment, in our ontology, corresponds to a portion of space, not of matter.",

        "Sowa discusses how background knowledge could help to process these metonymies, based on a knowledge description of what \"Prix Goncourt\" involves.",
