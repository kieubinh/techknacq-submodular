        "In this paper, we focus on the representative members of these classes in I and II: We would like to thank James Pustejovsky for extensive discussions on the data presented in this article.",

        "In the case of agent-oriented adjectives, the complement expresses the manifestation of the state and can be realized as an infinitive with a/pour or de (examples (2a,b)) or a prepositional phrase (2c): (2a,b,c) means that somebody is skilful in what he does or how he does it (see Croft, 1984).",

        "In the case of emotional state adjectives, this complement typically expresses the cause of the emotional state and may be realized as an de-infinitive or a que-sentence: (3a,b), for example, means that somebody is sad/angry because of something.",
        "Notice however that, in some contexts, the complement can also refer to the manifestation of the state, as for agent-oriented adjectives (3c).",

        "The two events are default events, as the adjective remains a state, even when it has a causative sense, contrary to real transitions (accomplishment or achievement), like couler 'sink', for example (as pointed out in Pustejovsky, 1995, chapter 10) The argument structure (ARGSTR) specifies that mental adjectives select for two arguments, one for human (arg1) and a second for event (see Croft, 1984, for a similar view).",
        "The second is a default argument (D_argl) as it need not to he present at the syntactic level (as shown in examples (1)).",
        "As agent-oriented adjectives refer to the manifestation of the state (examples (2)), the second argument is e3, the event which follows the state.",
        "It is subtyped as an intellectual act.",
        "For emotion adjectives, the second argument is e2 or e3, as they can refer either to the manifestation of the state (example (3c)) or its cause (examples (3a,b)).",
        "e2 is subtyped as an experiencing event, as we consider that the cause of an emotion corresponds to the experiencing of something.",
        "Following Croft (1990), we think that there are two processes implied in a causal emotional state: an experiencer must direct his or her attention to a stimulus and this causes the experiencer to enter in a mental state.",
        "The qualia structure (QUALIA) encodes the basic semantic type of a word (its Lexical Conceptual Paradigm, or LCP) and specifies how it is linked to other events and arguments of the event and argument structures (see Pustejovsky, 1995, chapter 6).",
        "To do this, it can use four possible different roles: the FORMAL role encoding the basic semantic type(s) of the word, the CONSTITUTIVE role its constitutive elements, the TELIC role its purpose or function and the AGENTIVE role the factors involved in bringing it about.",
        "In terms of temporal relations, the qualia encode specific constraints on the relative temporal ordering of the values of the qualia.",
        "That is, the event involved in the AGENTIVE role precedes that state existing in the FORMAL, and the associated CONSTITUTIVE value, should there be one.",

        "(15) AGENTIVE < FORMAL and CONST < TELIC",
        "In the case of mental adjectives, the qualia in (13) and (14) makes explicit that they denote a complex or clotted type (written typc.typc), which is the product of basic types, e.l and e3 for agent-oriented adjectives and el, e2 and c3 for emotive ones.",
        "Each of these types can be projected independently, if no other constraints apply (see 3.3).",
        "The state el is encoded in the FORMAL; an event encoded in the AGENTIVE role (e2) denotes the cause or origin of the state, i.e. the experiencing event; encoded in the TELIC role (c.7), it denotes then the manifestation of the state, i.e. the intellectual act.",
        "In other words, the CIL representation for emotion adjectives (13) stipulates that somebody (r) is in a state because of an experiencing event (e2), which can have a further manifestation (e3);2 that for agent-oriented adjectives (14) specifics that somebody is in a state which can have a manifestation."
