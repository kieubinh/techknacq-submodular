        "Within the strongly lexical framework of HPSG, lexical rules are used to express relations among descriptions-----a kind of indirect \"horizontal re latedness\" (Pollard & Sag 1987, 209) which can be contrasted with the vertical relations between the type(s) of lexical elements.",
        "Type relations are, of course, captured directly as the monotonic (typed) multiple inheritance network itself, which structures the lexicon.",
        "Typical examples of horizontal redundancy in the hierarchical lexicon thus conceived are the Alternation phenomena (e.g. Dative Shift, the Locative Alternation, etc) and word formation phenomena (inflectional and derivational morphology).",
        "In fact, Pollard and Sag also refer to declension class membership and similar facts as horizontal relations, and as we shall see, the boundary between vertical and horizontal relations is not immutably fixed once and for all.",
        "The notion of lexical rule is often given some status at the level of linguistic or psychological theory.",
        "(Pollard Sag 1987) make reference to a generative or procedural interpretation of lexical rules as a deductive mechanism which can be deployed on a needs only basis, for example, to generate words from a single base form.",
        "The conception of lexical rules as essential generative devices (rather than static statements expressing (sub-) regularities), is shared in much influential work (e.g. (Bresnan 1982), (Pinker 1989)), although it is by no means universal, even within HPSG.",
        "Viewed from an implementational perspective, on-the-fly application of lexical rules brings with it a nurnber of distinct advantages which follow from the drastic reduction in the size of the lexical database (lexical construction is less time consuming and parsing time should be reduced as lexical look up is less ambiguous, etc).",
        "At first sight then it appears that the benefit of adding an external Lexical Rule component outweighs the disadvantages (external powerful mechanisms).",
        "We will first show that their role is less clear than this suggests and certainly more problematic, before suggesting in Section 2 an alternative which eschews any extra mechanisms."

        "The parallel drawn above between vertical relatedness (expressed with the type system) and horizontal relatedness among descriptions of fully formed objects is however rather misleading.",
        "Monotonic multiple inheritance networks are most naturally used to represent generalisations over the properties that (groups of) linguistic objects",
        "share – inspection of any network will confirm that they are usually deployed to express what is essentially a componential analysis of objects and of the relationship between them (defined on the basis of this analysis).",
        "On the other hand, horizontal relations among descriptions (very often modelled by means of lexical rules) are essentially relations holding directly between objects themselves.",
        "While this intuition is clear, this is much less adequate an approach for morphological relatedness, where a componential approach may often appear just as natural as an object relatedness view, especially if the formalism includes functionally dependent values, permitting the expression of allomorphic variation and the like.",
        "In fact, many putatively horizontal relations may be simply re-expressed within a type hierarchy by viewing them from a componential perspective, obviating the need for expressing them on the \"horizontal.\"",

        "But this is only possible once one frees oneself from a view of lexical relatedness as something which holds essentially between words (objects which correspond to maximal types, that is types at the bottom of the type hierarchy).",
        "Horizontal relations are perhaps most naturally captured by an extra device (LRs) external to the lexical network and associated inference mechanism -- see (Krieger & Nerbon.ne 1993) and (Calcagno 1995) for recent IIPSG proposals.",
        "Some recent work ((Meurers 1.995) and (ltiehernann 1994)) partly departs from this view by expressing relations between objects using the vertical axis (that is, using the type system), but again the starting point is 'complete' lexical objects."

        "In architectural terms, it is simply accidental (if fortuitous) that lexical rules are often used to relate minimally different objects – they are capable of much more promiscious behaviour.",
        "This state of, affairs is amply demonstrated in the literature, which abounds with attempts to constrain horizontal relations by appeal to subsidiary principles (predicate locality in LFG, constraints of a psycholinguistic nature in the work of (Pinker 1989), etc).",
        "Horizontal relations must be constrained to account for 'exceptional' behaviour, that is, for those words which do not participate to a given horizontal relation despite the fact that their description makes them appropriate candidates for the relation (verb alternations offer several examples of these situtation, for instance, 'giving' verbs which do not exhibit the so-called 'dative shift' phenomenon).",
        "Modelling of 'exceptional' behaviour leads either to an extreme complexity of the type system or to non-monotonic solutions (Flickinger 1987) because it turns out that certain horizontal relations, usually defined over types, must be blocked for individual objects."
