        "Grammar checking stemmed as a logical application from former attempts to natural language understanding by computers.",
        "Many of the NLU systems developed in the 70's included a kind of error recovery mechanism ranging from the treatment only of spelling errors, PARRY (Parkinson et al., 1977), to the inclusion also of incomplete input containing some kind of ellipsis, LADDER/LIFER (Hendrix et al., 1977).",
        "The interest in the 80's begun to turn considering grammar checking as an enterprise of its own right (Carbonell & Hayes, 1983), (Hayes & Mouradian, 1981), (Heidorn et al., 1982), (Jensen et al., 1983), though many of the approaches were still in the NLU tradition (Charniak, [983), (Granger, 1983), (Kwasny Sondheinier, 1981), (Weischedel & Black, 1980), (Weischedel 8.4 Sond-heimer, 1983).",
        "A 1985 Ovum report on natural language applications (Johnson, 1985) already identifies grammar and style checking as one of the seven major applications of NLP.",
        "Currently, every project in grammar checking has as its goal the creation of a writing aid rather than a robust man-machine interface (Adriaens, 1994), (Bolioli et al., 1992), (Vosse, 1992).",
        "Current systems dealing with grammatical deviance have been mainly involved in the integration of special techniques to detect and correct, when possible, these deviances.",
        "In some cases, these have been incorporated to traditional parsing techniques, as it is the case with feature relaxation in the context of unification-based formalisms (Bolioli et al., 1.992), or the addition of a set of catching error rules specially handling the deviant constructions (Thurmair, 1990).",
        "In other cases, the relaxation component has been included as a new add-in feature to the parsing algorithm, as in the IBM's PLNLP approach (Heidorn et al., 1982), or in the work developed for the Translator's Workbench project using the METAL MT-system (TWB, 1992).",
        "Besides, an increasing concern in current projects is that of linguistic relevance of the analysis performed by the grammar correction system.",
        "In this sense, the adequate integration of error detection and correction techniques within mainstream grammar formalisms has been addressed by a number of these projects (Bolioli et al., 1992), (Vosse, 1992), (Genthial et al., 1992), (Geuthial et al., 1994).",
        "Following this concern, this paper presents results from the project GramCheck (A Grammar and Style Checker, MLAP93-11), funded by the CEC.",
        "GramCheck has developed a grammar checker demonstrator for Spanish and Greek native writers using ALEP (ET6/1, 1991), (Simpkins, 1994) as the NLP development platform, a client-server architecture as implemented in the X Windows system, Motif as the 'look and feel' interface and Xminfo as the knowledge base storage format.",
        "Generalized use of extensions to the highly typed and unification based formalism implemented in ALEP has been performed.",
        "These extensions (called Constraint Solvers, CSs) are nothing but pieces of PROLOG code performing different boolean and relational operations over feature values.",
        "Besides, GramCheck has used ongoing results from LS-GRAM (LRE61029), a project aiming at the implementation of middle",
        "coverage ALEP grammars for a number of European languages.",
        "The demonstrator checks whether a document contains grammar errors or style weaknesses and, if found any, users are provided with messages, suggestions arid, for grammar errors only, automatic correction(s).",
        "2 Brief grammar error typology for Spanish The linguistic statements made by developers of current grammar checkers based on NIT techniques are often contradictory regarding the types of errors that grammar checkers must correct automatically.",
        "(Veronis, 1988) claims that native writers are unlikely to produce errors involving morphological features, while (Vosse, 1992) accepts such morpho-syntactic errors, in spite of the fact that an examination of texts by the author revealed that their appearance in native writer's texts is not frequent.",
        "Both authors agree in characterizing morpho-syntactic errors as a sample of lack of competence.",
        "On the other hand, an examination of real texts produced by Spanish writers revealed that they do produce morpho-syntactic errors'.",
        "Spanish is an inflectional language, which increases the possibilities of such errors.",
        "Nevertheless, other errors related to structural configuration of the language are produced as well.",
        "Errors found fall into one of the following subtypes, assuming that featurization is the technique used in parsing sentences:",
        "1.",
        "Mismatching of features that do not affect representational issues (intra- or inter-syntactic agreement on gender, number, person and case for categories showing this phenomenon).",
        "These mismatchings produce non-structural errors.",
        "2.",
        "Mismatching of features which describe certain representational properties for categories, as wrong head-argument relations, word order and substitution of certain categories.",
        "These mismatchings produce structural errors.",
        "Table 1 shows the percentages of different types of errors found in the corpus.",
        "Punctuation errors must be considered as structural violations, while for style weaknesses, it depends on its subtype.",
        "Errors at the lexical level are difficult to classify arid most of them must, regarded as spelling rather than grammar errors.",
        "The number of errors identified in this corpus is 543.",
        "These statistics could 'The corpus used contains nearly 70,000 words including text fragments from literature, newspapers, technical and administrative documentation.",
        "It has been provided to a large extent by GramCheck pilot user, ANAYA, S.A. be regarded as a representative average of the frequency of errors/mistakes occurring in Spanish texts.",
        "A presupposition adopted in the project led to the idea that violations at the feature level can be captured by means of the relaxation of the possibly violated features while violations at the level of configuration may not be relaxed without raising unpredictable parsing results, thus being candidates for the implementation of explicit rules encoding such incorrect structures.",
        "Under this view, a comprehensive grammar checker must make use of both strategies, called in the literature feature or constraint relaxation and error anticipation, respectively.",
        "However, given the relevance of features in the encoding of linguistic information in TFSs, some structural errors can be reanalyzed as agreement errors in a wide sense (as feature mismatching violations rather than structural ones).",
        "This allows the implementation of a uniform approach to grammar correction, thus avoiding explicit rules for ill-formed input.",
        "This paper describes such implementation for both non-structural and structural violations."

        "• Diagnosis is performed by the CSs themselves with the aid of a heuristic technique for those errors where tests should be performed on several elements and a pattern-related technique which provides a means to extend feature values with a gradation of correct mid posible but incorrect information.",
        "The typical case for the former is agreement, thus for signs involving tins type of information, both an initial heuristic value is assigned and arithmetical operations are performed on (in)equality tests.",
        "As for the latter, head-argument relations where bound prepositions are involved are treated this way.",
        "t'or all grammar errors there is no notion of weak vs. strong diagnosis, being all considered strong errors needing automatic correction.",
        "• Correction is performed by means of tree transduction of Linguistic Structures (LSs) containing errors to a 'language' (actually a 'language use') defined as correct Spanish.",
        "These synthesized structures are displayed to the user.",
        "The overall design is then similar to a transfer-based MT system, where the usual cycle is analysis-transfer-synthesis, being the main differences the addition of the alu we-mentioned grammar correction devices and the fact that not all, but only incorrect sentences, will be pushed through the complete cycle.",
        "CSs allow the relaxation of certain features the grammar rules whose unification will he decided upon, in a noun-trivial way, within these CSs.",
        "Tunis, rules do not perform feature value checking, so CSs play a crucial role performing extended variable unification and taking appropriate decisions.",
        "Depending on the error type, CSs carry out different operations on features, scores and lists.",

        "Finally, for cases where equal scores are obtained, as it happens with a non-inherent masculine noun and a feminine determiner, both possible corrections should be performed, since there is not enough information so as to decide the correct value (unless this can be obtained from other agreeing elements in the sentence for instance an attribute to this NP).",
        "Basically, the final operation to be performed with the scores is to determine that the higher the score of an element the severer its substitution.",
        "Thus, scores are clues for the correction of those elements having the lowest scores.",

        "Note that agreement in Spanish is based on a binary value system.",
