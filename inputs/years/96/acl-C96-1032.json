        "Within the cooperative parallel grammar project PARGRAM (IMS-Stuttgart, Xerox-Palo Alto, Xerox-Grenoble), the analysis arid representation of structures in the grammars must be viewed from a more global perspective than that of the individual languages (German, English, French).",
        "One major goal of PARGRAm is the development of broad coverage grammars which are also modular and easy to maintain.",
        "Another major goal is the construction of parallel analyses for sentences of the same type in German, English, and French.",
        "If tins can be achieved, the problem faced by machine translation (MT) could be greatly reduced.",
        "Due to the recent development of a faster and more powerful version of the LEG (Lexical-Functional-Grammar) based Grammar Writer's Workbench (Kaplan and Maxwell 1993) at Xerox, the implementation of a linguistically adequate, broad coverage grammar appears viable.",
        "Given the flexible projection-based architecture of LEG (Dalrymple et al.",
        "1995) and the MT approach presented in Kaplan et al.",
        "(1989),1 a robust MT system is already in place.",
        "In this paper, we concentrate on two issues within the broader perspective of PARC RA M : the treatment of auxiliaries and the transparent representation of multiple genitive NPs in German.",
        "These phenomena represent two areas for which generally accepted proposals exist, but whose implementation in the context of parallel grammar development throws up questions as to their wider, crosslinguistic, feasibility.",
        "With respect to auxiliaries, the standard raising approach that is usually adopted yields undesirable structural complexity and results in idiosyncratic, language particular analyses of the role of auxiliaries.",
        "With regard to genitive NPs, the standard analysis for German yields structures winch are too ambiguous for a succesful application of machine translation.",
        "The following sections present a solution in that morphological wellformedness conditions are stated at a separate component, the morphology projection.",
        "Furthermore, a representation of argument structure is implemented that is related to, but not identical to the representation of grammatical functions.",
        "Language particular idiosyncratic requirements are thus separated out from the language universal information required for further semantic interpretation, or machine translation."
