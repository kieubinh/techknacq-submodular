        "Our corpus is composed of naturally-occurring instructions in the three languages of study.",
        "Our overall approach is to obtain different-language drafts that are congruent with the technical content embodied in the task to be performed (and with other relevant information about the task).",
        "A satisfactory level of congruence requires the use of syntactic and pragmatic rules appropriate to each target language, mapping from the semantics to appropriate expression in a way that is free from influence from any source language'.",
        "We 'See (Hartley and Paris, 1995) for discussion of the begin the generation process with a plan-based model of the underlying task.' In our study, we have looked at two specific procedural relations that can hold between pairs of actions in a task, identified by the philosopher Alvin Goldman as the relations of GENERATION and ENABLEMENT (Goldman, 1970) relations which have the advantage of being formally specified (see e.g.(Pollack, 1986; 13alkanski, 1993)), and need to be expressed regularly within instructional texts.",
        "In section 2, we give a brief definition of generation and enablernent, before going on in section 3 to describe how the two relations are realised in the corpus of Portuguese, English, and French instructions."

        "Generation and enablement are relations that can hold between pairs of states, events, processes, or actions.",
        "A simple test of generation holding between action pairs is whether it can be said that by performing one of the actions (a) under appropriate conditions, the other (#) will automatically occur (Pollack, 1986).",
        "If so, it can be said that a generates 0.",
        "The two actions must he performed, or perceived to be performed, by the same human agent, and the two actions must be asymmetric (i.e. if a generates [3, then p cannot generate a).",
        "Simple examples of generation are as follows:3",
        "(1) Heat gently to soften the coating.",
        "(2) Dial the numbers of the Mercury authorisation code by pressing the appropriate numbers on the keypad.",

        "pressing the correct keypad numbers has the automatic effect of dialing the numbers of the Mercury authorisation code.",
        "In each case, by performing the a action (or set of actions), the user has automatically performed the Q action.",
        "Note that the two actions can be presented in either order: generatING first, or generatED first.",
        "The term enablement is commonly used to refer to the procedural relation between preconditions and actions.",
        "It obtains between two actions where the execution of the first brings about a set of conditions that are necessary, but not necessarily sufficient for the subsequent performance of the second (Pollack, 1986).",
        "This is different from the generation case, since enablement requires the further intervention of an agent - and it need not be the same agent - to bring about the /9 eventuality.",
        "(3) Close cover and test as recommended in 'Operation' section, (4) For prolonged viewing, the slide may be pushed downwards and then backwards until it locks under the ledges at each end of the slot.",
        "Example 3, taken from the instructions for a household smoke alarm, shows the enablING action appearing first: closing the cover enables testing to take place, but does not automatically result in a test.",
        "Example 4, from the instructions for a home photographic slide viewer, presents the enablED action - prolonged viewing - first, and describes to the user what must be clone to facilitate it.",
        "These two relations have been formalised by Pollack (1986) and I3alkanski (1993) for the purposes of plan recognition, and can be represented in a plan formalism that is a simple extension of STRIPS-styled operators developed by tikes (1971) and expanded in the NOAH system (Sacer-doti, 1977).",
        "Here, we summarise the two relations in the form of the following planning statements:",
        "• a generates 0 a a is the body of a plan c whose goal is 0.",
        "• a enables /9 if a is a precondition of a plan c and is the goal of plan e, or if 0 is the body of e and a is a precondition off/.",
        "In order to generate instructions clearly, it must be obvious which, if either of the two relations is intended at any given point: confusion of one with the other will lead to inadequte, incomplete, or even dangerous execution of the task described."

        "French has a relatively broad range of expressions available for enablement (see figure 5) – much wider than Portuguese.",

        "In English (figure 6), although the imperative is the most popular expression of enablement, (over 60% of tokens), when it expresses the enablED part of the relation, it must appear second: to place it first would be misleading, as it would imply that this action should be performed first.",
        "There is also a constraint arising from the part of the semantic relation being expressed: infinitives do not express the enablING action.",

        "In particular, for rhetorical planning of the communication of particular content, we can use the preferences observed for selection of the preferred rhetorical relation in the language in question.",
        "Second, we can use our knowledge of how that relation is constituted and expressed in terms of syntax for marking the relation appropriately.",
        "The approach also reveals some interesting facts about the individual languages.",
        "In particular, we found different levels of tolerance of residual ambiguity: Portuguese has little ambiguity in the mapping from semantic content to syntactic realisation (the least ambiguous markers of rhetorical relation, fewest available syntactic realisations, least overlap in the roles of these realisations for conveying one or the other semantic relation, most restricted set of favoured rhetorical relations).",
        "English, on the other hand, had the opposite characteristics.",
        "We also found differing preferences for rhetorical relations in expressing semantic content: for example, while Portuguese expresses generation in over 80% of cases with the relation of PURPOSE, French generation divides this relation almost equally between PURPOSE and MEANS.",
        "The English corpus, on the other hand, while it has a strong showing for PURPOSE (around 50%), reveals a relatively strong showing (around 14%) for the relation of RESULT, a relation found in only 1.5% of the Portuguese relations and not at all in French.",
        "No natural language has an unambiguous mapping from semantics to surface syntax, which makes the information encoded by syntax, both semantic and pragmatic, very difficult to consciously 'unpack' from surface form in the performance of the translation task.",
        "We suggest that uncovering the decisions necessary for producing pragmatically-appropriate sets of parallel instructions is a task best performed as an empirical study along the lines suggested here.",
        "In this way, we can encode language-specific pragmatic principles into tools that support the process of multilingual document production."
