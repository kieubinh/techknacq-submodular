        "In the Laboratory of Artificial Perception, we started on text-to-speech synthesis one year ago (Gros96).",
        "Here we describe the acquisition of an appropriate diphone inventory in a first version of our Slovenian TTS system, which is supposed to serve as a reference system for future improvements.",
        "We start with a brief overview of the different modules of the Slovenian TTS system, then we go on to describe how the existing diphone inventory was obtained.",
        "The acquisition of a labelled diphone inventory or adaptation of a speech synthesis system to synthesise new voices is manually intensive and prone to errors, therefore automatic procedures are required (Taylor91, Schmidt93, Cosi91, Ottesen93).",

        "In concatenation systems, both the choice and the proper segmentation of the units to be concatenated play a key role.",
        "Acoustic differences between stored and requested segments, as well as acoustic discontinuities at the boundaries between adjacent segments have to be minimised.",
        "Diphone units are most commonly adopted as a compromise between the size of the unit inventory and the quality of synthetic speech.",
        "A diphone is, generally speaking, a unit which starts in the middle of one phone, passes through the transition to the next phone and ends in the middle of this next phone.",
        "So the transition between two phones is encapsulated and does not need to be calculated.",
        "Yet it is not clear whether speech segments should be extracted from nonsense plurisyllabic words, called logatoms, existing isolated words or meaningful sentences.",
        "Even the question of a best positioning of the units within the spoken corpus is still widely debated.",
        "Stressed syllables are longer, thus less submitted to coarticulation, which results in easily chainable units; while unstressed ones are more numerous in natural speech, so that producing them efficiently would both increase segmental quality and reduce memory requirements.",
        "Likewise, coarticulations are strongly subject to speaker's fluency, so that imposing a slow speaking rate results in more intelligible units.",
        "To a large extent, these issues are part of a necessary trade-off between intelligibility and naturalness.",
        "One diphone for every allophone combination possible in a given language is required.",

        "After the recording phase, logatoms were hand-segmented and the center of the transition between the phones was marked, using information from both temporal and spectral representation of the speech signal.",
        "A special user-friendly interface was developed for this purpose, allowing editing, scaling, viewing, labelling and pitch-marking of the speech signal.",
        "First the approximate neighbourhood of a diphone was determined, then a fine labelling of its boundaries was performed and the center of the phoneme transition was marked.",
        "Finally, pitch markers were manually set for voiced parts of the corresponding speech signal.",
        "Figure 2 gives an example of the diphone am along with its spectrum.",
        "To phonetically transcribe the logatom words we",
        "used a set of 34 symbols for allophones, which we adapted to the SAMPA standard requirements (Fourcin89)1.",
        "While concatenating diphones into words it suddenly turned out that there was a large discrepancy between the duration of allophones, as suggested by the prosody module, and the actual corresponding diphone duration stored in the diphone inventory.",
        "This happened due to the exaggerated eagerness of the speaker trying to pronounce the meaningless logatoms in a correct and clear way.",
        "Consequently, the quality of the synthetic speech was considerably affected and we are therefore planning to record another diphone inventory.",
        "As the transformation range for prosodic speech parameters needed for synthesising naturally sounding speech is large, the recording should thus be carefully controlled to achieve medium pitch and duration values."

        "The discrepancies between manual and automatic segmentation are considerable.",

        "The situation improves when plosives are taken as a whole, closures and bursts together.",
        "As a result, a fully automatic segmentation of speech segments is hardly conceivable in the context of concatenation synthesis.",
        "As most phonological units originate via phonological considerations rather than on acoustic grounds, isolating them requires a deep prior knowledge of their specific features.",
        "Unsupervised segmentation, i.e. segmentation on acoustic principles only, often results in segments and sub-segments boundaries being misplaced, or just missing, while undefined ones appear.",
        "However, it can be used as a segmentation outline, the refinement of which has to be performed by a human expert.",
