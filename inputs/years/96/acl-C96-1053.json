        "When analyzing long sentences with two or more predicates (i.e. compound and complex sentences), it is difficult to grasp the proper structure of sentences having a large number of possible dependency (modifier-modifee relation) structures.",
        "This difficulty is more marked in Japanese than in English, since there are more syntactically ambiguous structures in Japanese.",
        "The Japanese language has few syntactic indicators for dividing sentences into phrases or clauses, unlike English with its relative pronouns and subordinate conjunctions.",
        "One of the most critical features of Japanese is that the difference between a phrase and a clause is not clear.",
        "Even subjects or other obligatory elements of clauses are omitted very often when they are indicated by contexts.",
        "In addition, the Japanese language does not have any parts of speech to clearly indicate either the beginning or end of a phrase or a clause.",
        "Another critical feature is that the Japanese language is an almost pure Head-final language, i.e., predicates and function words to signify the sentence structure appear at the end of the clause or sentence.",
        "This means that it is syntactically possible for all phrases or clauses that can modify predicates to modify all other phrases or clauses that appear in the latter part of long sentences.",
        "These syntactic characteristics of the Japanese language make it difficult to determine the dependency (modification) structure of long sentences.",
        "Simple parsing of Japanese long sentences inevitably produces a huge number of possible modification structures.",
        "A conventional bottom-up parsing method can reduce ambiguity in modification by local information in the surface structure.",
        "However, this inclines toward an improper output, since the locally highest likelihood is sometimes low on the whole.",
        "To overcome this problem, several methods to predict the global structure of long sentences have been proposed.",
        "One is a top-down parsing method by matching the input sentence and the domain-specific patterns (Furuse et al., 1992).",
        "Improvements made by other researchers enabled this method to parse irregular, incomplete and multiplex patterns, by describing the domain-dependent patterns in the form of grammar (Doi, Muraki, et al., 1993).",
        "Another method employs global structure presumption to divide a sentence into clauses by utilizing general lexical information.",
        "It predicts the sentence structure prior to syntactic analysis only by utilizing domain-independent lexical information such as conjunctive particles, parallel expressions, theme transition, etc.",
        "(Mizuno et al., 1990; Kurohashi et al., 1992).",
        "Lexical Discourse Grammar (LDG) is one of the approaches with which a global structure of a long sentence is presumed by focusing on function words (Kamei et al., 1986; Doi et al., 1991).",
        "LDG assumes that Japanese function words, such as conjunctive particles (postpositions) located at the end of each clause, convey modality, or propositional attitude, and suggest global structures of Japanese long sentences in cooperation with modality in predicates, especially within",
        "auxiliary verbs.",
        "LUG can presume the inter-clausal dependency within Japanese sentences prior to syntactic and semantic analyses by utilizing the differences of the encapsulating powers each Japanese 'function word has, and by utilizing modification preference-between function words and predicates that reflects consistency of modality reading or propositional attitude interpretation.",
        "LUG is effective in reducing the syntactic ambiguities, and it has already been applied to a machine translation system.",
        "However, it has not clarified the level of the encapsulation powers of Japanese function words or the relation between modality and level.",
        "Hence we refined the concept of LUG, particularly the conjunction level of function words, and explain the outline of the refined LUG in this paper.",
        "First, we present the encapsulation power of Japanese function words, which are classified into six levels.",
        "Second, we state modification preference of ;Japanese conjunctive particles that reflects modality within them.",
        "Finally, we present evidence of the levels of Japanese function words.",
        "We think that the levels of clauses produce prosodic information, especially the location and length of pauses, which are influenced by the sentence global structure.",
        "We analyzed the speech utterances of a professional news announcer (male) and found a correlation between a particle's encapsulating power and the pause length inserted after the clause with a conjunctive particle."

        "In these two sentences, brackets { } show subordinate clauses.",
        "Consequently, \"nagara\"( VP' 6) is ranked at a lower level than \"node\"( (0-(1.).",
        "In LUG, conjunction levels of clauses are divided into six classifications according to the elements the clause can contain, as listed in Table 1.",
        "These levels construct a hierarchy, i.e., a lower level clause cannot subordinate a higher level one.",
        "The levels also represent the encapsulating powers of each Japanese function words located at the end of the clauses.",
        "Besides conjunctive particles, Japanese conjunction nouns or relative nouns are also classified and assigned a level.",
        "Here, Japanese conjunction nouns, such as \"toki\" (ill ,-,when) are nouns that can often be used just like conjunctive particles when they are attached at the end of clause.",
        "Japanese relative nouns, such as \"mac\" (1lti,--1-iefore) are another type of nouns that play roles similar to those of conjunctions in English when they are modified by predicative phrases or clauses."
