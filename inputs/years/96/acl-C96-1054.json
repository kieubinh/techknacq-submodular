        "The main motivation for using a semantic-based approach for transfer is the ability to abstract away from morphological and syntactic idiosyncrasies of individual languages.",

        "Examples include cases of categorial and thematic divergences.",
        "These are treated in the linking between syntactic arguments and their corresponding thematic roles.",
        "Another advantage of a semantic-based transfer approach over a pure interlingua approach, e.g. Dorr (1993), or a direct, structural correspondence approach, e.g. Slocum et al.",
        "(1987), is the gain in modularity by allowing language independent grammar development.",
        "Translation equivalences relating semantic entities of the source and target grammars can be formulated in a grammar independent bilingual semantic lexicon.",
        "In cases where the semantic representations of source and target language are not isomorphic, a nontrivial transfer relation between the two representations is needed.",
        "But it is clearly much easier to map between flat semantic representations than between either syntactic trees or deeply nested semantic representations An interlingua approach presumes that a single representation for arbitrary languages exists or can be developed.",
        "We believe from a grammar engineering point of view it is unrealistic to come up with such an interlingua representation without a strict coordination between the monolingual grammars.",
        "In general, a pure interlingua approach results in very application and domain specific knowledge sources which are difficult to maintain and extend to new languages and domains.",
        "This holds especially in the Verbmobil context with its distributed grammar development.",
        "Whereas our approach does not preclude the use of interlingua predicates.",
        "We use interlingua representations for time and (late expressions in the Verbmobil domain.",
        "Similarly for prepositions, cf. Buschbeck-Wolf and Niibel (1995), it makes sense Co use more abstract relations which express fundamental relationships like temporal location or spatial location.",

        "The interlingua rule in (12) identifies the abstract temporal location predicates under the condition that the internal argument is more specific than the sort time.",
        "This condition is necessary because of the polysemy of those prepositions.",
        "During compilation the SL class definition will be automatically expanded to the individual predicates, whereas the TL class definition will be kept unexpanded such that the target, grammar might be able to choose one of the idiosyncratic prepositions.",
        "Mixed approaches like Kaplan et al.",
        "(1989) can be characterized by mapping syntax as well as a predicate-argument structure (f-structure).",
        "As",
        "already pointed out, e.g. in (Sadler and Thompson, 1991), this kind of transfer has problems with its own multiple level mappings, e.g. handling of verb-adverb head switching, and does not cleanly separate monolingual from contrastive knowledge, either.",
        "In Kaplan and Wedekind (1993) an unproved treatment of head switching is presented but it still remains a less general solution.",
        "A semantic approach is much more independent of different syntactic analyses which are the source of a lot of classical translation problems such as structural and categorial divergences and mismatches.",
        "In our approach grammars can be developed for each language independently of the transfer task and can therefore be reused in other applications.",
        "At first glance, our approach is very similar to the semantic transfer approach presented in Alshawi et al.",
        "(1991).",
        "It uses a level of underspecified semantic representations as input and output of transfer.",
        "The main differences between our approach and theirs arc the use of fiat semantic representations and the non-recursive transfer rules.",
        "The set-oriented representation allows much simpler operations in transfer for accessing individual entities (set; membership) and for combining the result of individual rules (set union).",
        "Furthermore, because the recursive rule application is not part of the rules themselves, our approach solves problems with discontinuous translation equivalences which the former approach cannot handle well.",
        "A transfer rule for such a case is given in (4).",
        "Our current approach is strongly related to the Shake-and-Bake approach of Beaver' (1992) and Whitelock (1992).",
        "But instead of using sets of lexical signs, i.e. morpho-syntactic ernes as in Shake-and-Bake, we specify translation equivalences on sets of arbitrary semantic entities.",
        "Therefore, before entering the transfer component of our system, individual lex-ernes can already be decomposed into sets of such entities, e.g. for stating generalizations on the lexical semantics level or providing suitable representations for inferences.",
        "For example, the wh-question word when is decomposed into temp_loc(E,X), whq(X,R), time(R,X) (lit.",
        ": at which time), hence no additional transfer rules are required.",
        "Similarly, German composita like Ter-minvorschlag are decomposed into its compounds, e.g. termin(i2), vorschlag(i1) where.",
        "n_n denotes a generic noun-noun relation.",
        "As a result a compositional translation as proposal for a date is possible without stating any additional translation equivalences to the ones for the simplex nouns.",
        "Another major difference is the addition of conditions which trigger and block the applicability of individual transfer rules.",
        "For instance in the specific translation of schlecht to 'not good as defined in (3c), without conditions, one would have to add the verb pass en into the bag to test for such a specific context.",
        "As a consequence the translation of the verb needs to be reduplicated, whereas in our approach, the translation of the verb can be kept totally independent of this specific translation of the adverbial, because the condition functions merely as a test.",
        "These examples also illustrates the usefulness of labeled conditions, because the negation operator can take such a label as an argument and we can use unification again to achieve the correct coindexation.",
        "If we would use a hierarchical semantics instead, as in the original Shake-and-Bake aproach, where the negation operator embeds the verb semantics we would have to translate schlecht(e), passen(e) into not(suit(e), well(e)) in one rule because there is no coindexation possible to express the correct embedding without the unique labeling of predicates.",
        "Finally, we have filled the lack of an adequate control strategy for Shake-and-Bake by developing a nonmonotonic control strategy which orders more specific rules before less specific ones.",
        "This strategy allows the specification of powerful default translations.",
        "Whereas without; such an ordering special care is needed to prevent a compositional translation in cases where a more specific noncompositional translation also exists.",
        "The same argument about control holds in comparison to the unification-based transfer approach on Mimirnal Recursion Semantics (MRS) (Copestake et al., 1995; Copestake, 1995).",
        "In addition, we use matching on first order terms instead of feature structure unification.",
        "Full unification might be problematic because it is possible to add arbitrary information during rule application, e.g. by further unifying different arguments.",
        "The other main difference is our nonmonotonic control component whereas the MRS approach assumes a monotonic computation of all possible transfer equivalences which are then filtered by the generation grammar.",
        "It is difficult to judge the feasibility of their approach given the fact that only a limited coverage has been addressed so far."

        "This paper presents a new declarative transfer rule formalism, which provides an implementation platform for a semantic-based transfer approach.",
        "This approach combines ideas from a number of recent MT proposals and tries to avoid many of the well known problems of other transfer and interlingua approaches.",
        "The declarative transfer correspondences are compiled into an executable Prolog program.",
        "The compiler exploits indexing for more efficient search of matching rules.",
        "There is a nonmonotonic but rule-independent control strategy based on rule specificity.",
        "Currently, the transfer component contains about 1700 transfer rules.",
        "Thanks to the set orientation and indexing techniques we did not encounter any scaling problems and the average runtime performance for a 15 word sentence is about 30 milliseconds.",
        "Future work will include the automatic acquisition of transfer rules from tagged bilingual corpora to extend the coverage and an integration of domain specific dictionaries."
