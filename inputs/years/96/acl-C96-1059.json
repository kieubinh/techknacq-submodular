        "While interpreting instructions, an agent is continually faced with a number of possible actions to execute, the majority of which are not appropriate for the situation at hand.",
        "An instructor is therefore required not only to prescribe the appropriate actions to the reader, but also to prevent the reader from executing the inappropriate and potentially dangerous alternatives.",
        "The first task, which is commonly achieved by giving simple imperative commands and statements of purpose, has received considerable attention in both the interpretation (e.g., (Di Eugenio, 1993)) and the generation communities (e.g., (Vander Linden and Martin, 1995)).",
        "The second, achieved through the use of preventative expressions, has received considerably less attention.",
        "Such expressions can indicate actions that the agent should not perform, or manners of execution that the agent should not adopt.",
        "An agent may be told, for example, \"Do not enter\" or \"Take care not to push too hard\".",

        "Both of the examples just given involve negation (\"do not\" and \"take care not\").",
        "Although this is not strictly necessary for preventative expressions (e.g., one might say \"stay out\" rather than \"do not enter\"), we will focus on the use of negative forms in this paper.",
        "We will use the following categorisation of explicit preventative expressions:",
        "• negative imperatives proper (termed DONT imperatives).",
        "These are characterised by the negative auxiliary do not or don't. (1) Your sheet vinyl floor may be vinyl asbestos, which is no longer on the market.",
        "Don't sand it or tear it up because this will put dangerous asbestos fibers into the air.",
        "• other preventative imperatives (termed neg",
        "TC imperatives).",
        "These include take care and be careful followed by a negative infinitival complement, as in the following examples:",
        "(2) To book the strip, fold the bottom third or more of the strip over the middle of the panel, pasted sides together, taking care not to crease the wallpaper sharply at the fold.",
        "(3) If your plans call for replacing the wood",
        "base molding with vinyl cove molding, be careful not to damage the walls as you remove the wood base.",
        "The question of interest for us is under which conditions one or the other of the surface forms is chosen.",
        "We are currently using this information to drive the generation of warning messages in the DRAFTER system (Vander Linden and Di Eugenio, 1996).",
        "We will start by discussing previous work on negative imperatives, and by presenting an hypothesis to be explored.",
        "We will then describe the nature of our corpus and our coding schema,",

        "• Neg-TC imperatives.",
        "In general, neg-TC imperatives are used when S expects H to overlook a certain choice point; such choice point may be identified through a possible side effect that the wrong choice will cause.",

        "Here, H has some choices as regards the exact position where to drill, so S constrains him by saying Be careful not to drill through the pattern line.",
