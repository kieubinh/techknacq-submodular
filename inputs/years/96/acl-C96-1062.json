        "Interpreting nominal compounds consists in retrieving the predicative relation between the constituents.",
        "In many cases, no surface information is available to deduce the relation, and in particular no morphological evidence of a link between the constituents and the underlying predicate.",
        "This problem has been tackled in several types of NIT systems, mainly: - domain-dependent systems.",
        "Such systems are very efficient but are limited to the domain they are built for: interpretation rules are inferred from the observation of specific semantic patterns (Marsh, 1984) or from a fine-grained conceptual representation (Ter Stal, 1996).",
        "- domain-independent systems (Finin, 1980; Mac Donald, 1982), built to account for any kind of interpretation patterns, including rules that are not inferred from the properties of the constituents (what Finin calls productive rules, in opposition to structural rules).",
        "Frequency and probability scores are added to the rules.",
        "Such numeric weighting of general semantic rules is hardly defensible in the absence of any reference to a domain.",
        "Consequently, the questions that we propose to answer are: how far can we go in designing a model of interpretation rules which account for productive patterns of interpretation, independently of any domain?",
        "Conversely, what domain-specific information must be available to enrich this general model?",
        "The aim of our research is to define as precisely as possible the border line between what can be regularly described with general linguistic mechanisms, and what has to do with subregular or irregular phenomena which depend on corpus characteristics.",
        "This is a crucial issue when dealing with compound semantics because regular semantic patterns (involving relational properties of nominals) and extralinguistic data are mingled.",
        "We have designed a model' that accounts for structural rules (in Finin's terminology) of interpretation of N N compounds2, i.e. domain-independent rules that are deduced from the rnorpho-syntactic and semantic characteristics of the nominal constituents.",
        "The interest of this general model is to base the interpretation of compounds exclusively on general principles regarding the association between nouns and predicative information.",
        "Besides, this non-specialized model of interpretation allows us to draw a comparison with nominal sequences across languages, and es-'This project is supported by the CNET (contract CNET-INRIA n°951B030).",
        "Our model of interpretation of nominal compounds will be used to enrich information retrieval in a system that is open-domain.",
        "2 In this work, we only focus on non-recursive terms.",
        "The same interpretation mechanisms can be extended to compounds with three constituents or more, but furthermore these compounds raise the problem of ambiguous bracketing (Resnik, 1993).",
        "pecially with French sequences of the form \"N de N\" and \"N ti N\", in which the prepositional link is semantically weak (Fabre and Sebillot, 1994).",
        "We first describe this model, showing how compound interpretation must rely on an accurate description of the predicative properties of nominal constituents.",
        "We then suggest how this general model may be applied to the interpretation of compounds in texts, provided that it is made more specific with domain-dependent or text-specific information."

        "These results have been integrated in our model.",
        "The predicatice relation between the constituents is given by the verbal root of the deverbal noun.",
        "We differentiate two types of deverbals: a deverbal may refer to the accomplishment or the result of the process denoted by the verb (e.g. parsing) or it may saturate the role assigned to one of the arguments of the verb and thus refer to one of the actors of the process (mainly agent or instrument, e.g. parser).",
        "In the former case (action deverbals), the deverbal inherits the entire argument structure of the verb; in the latter (subject deverbals), it inherits the structure minus the agent saturated by the suffix.",

        "This first series of compounding patterns has often be considered as the only type of compound which can be described in semantic terms (Selkirk, 1982).",
        "Our own position is to argue that the same predicate-argument pattern may be used to deal with other types of compounds, provided that we rely on a richer semantic representation of noi-Mnals, when no morpho-syntactic clues are available to constrain the semantic interpretation."

        "The four typical nominal relations that constitute the (paha structure are the telic role, that refers to the purpose and function of the referent, the agentivc role, that concerns the factors involved in its origins, the constitutive role, that captures the relation between an object and its constituent parts, and the formal role, that distinguishes the object within a larger domain.",

        "Nevertheless, the argument structure of the underlying verb provides a clue for the distributional properties of the noun within compounds.",
        "The verb transport requires a subject and an object argument; since the noun pipeline refers to its first argument, the position which is left empty (the theme) may be occupied by the first constituent of a compound of the form N pipeline, as in oil pipeline 4 transport(instrument: pipeline, theme: oil).",
        "Agentive role.",
        "The agentive role is also selected by the compounding mechanism: the non-head may refer to the origin of the head noun, as in pancreas ptyalin 4 produce(agent: pancreas, theme: ptyalin), in compiler message emit(agent: compiler, theme: message), or in bullet wound cause(agent: bullet, theme: wound).",

        "This semantic framework demonstrates that the association between nominal constituents and underlying predicative relation in root compounds is not arbitrary: it involves conceptual mechanisms that are triggered in other linguistic phenomena such as type coercion (Pustejovsky, 1991), anaphora (Fradin, 1984) or adjectival constructions (Bouillon and Viegas, 1993)."
