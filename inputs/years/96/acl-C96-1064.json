        "On the other hand, word order information cannot be relied on conclusively due to the freedom allowed in the ordering of sentence constituents in Italian, where virtually all permutations of verb, subject and object are possible.",
        "The ambiguities stemming from this freedom are ubiquitous and represent a problem for any NEP system dealing with Italian, a problem to whose resolution a wide variety of' factors, both linguistic (i.e. phonological, morphological, syntactic, lexico-semantic and pragmatic) and extralinguistic (i.e. based on world knowledge), contributes, Here, we concentrate on how inorphosyntactically ambiguous SOAs can be solved on the basis of lexico-semantic knowledge; in particular, the focus is on the lexico-semantic restrictions that a verb or a noun imposes on its context."
