        "Second, there is a group which shows more syntactic and semantic flexibility.",
        "An example for the ,latter group, often called compositional or decomposable' idioms, is spill the beans 1 By classfying idioms with the terms compositional respectively decomposable the same property is de-cribed by two different point of views.",

        "2 Decomposable idioms and the referential status of their idiom chunks In contrast to non-compositional idioms, decomposable idioms are able to undergo several syntactic operations that lead to the opinion that \"pieces of an idiom typically have identifiable meanings which combine to produce the meaning of the whole\" (Wasow, 1982).",
