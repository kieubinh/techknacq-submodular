        "This is in contrast to trying to scale up domain specific applications, or by first attempting to obtain a general theory of language.",
        "A core problem for NLE is the design of the internal representation.",
        "An ideal representation should have several features including: rich expressiveness, readability, efficient storage/retrieval of information.",
        "Semantic networks have long been recognised as having the potential to fulfil many of these requirements.",
        "This paper introduces two new criteria for semantic networks distributedness and non-linearity and",

        "They are particularly relevant in large networks where search efficiency is vital to real-time system operation.",

        "Knowledge held in the network can be expressed for users by generating natural language from SerriNet.",
        "The fundamental principle of Semantic Networks is that information is stored as nodes and arcs, which represent concepts and relationships respectively.",
        "Within this framework a wide variety of networks exist, e.g. K LONE based systerus (Woods, 1992), SNePS/A.NALOG 1993), and Conceptual Graph Theory (Sowa, 1984).",
