        "Due to the complexity and wide coverage of lexical information, full-fledged lexicon systems easily grow undesirably big and must cope with in-tricate' nets of dependencies among lexical items.",
        "For keeping the speed of access at a satisfactory level, lexical information is often repeated in different entries to reduce the number of consultations needed for a single user query.",
        "This simplifies and speeds up the access of lexical information, but also blows up the size of the lexicon and leads to huge maintenance problems.",
        "In many cases, it also clutters the lexicon structure, so that important lexical relationships and generalizations are lost.",
        "Structuring the lexicon in inheritance hierarchies opens for more compact lexicon representations.",
        "So far, lexicons have been structured in syntactic inheritance hierarchies, in which more or less abstract syntactic classes form the upper nodes and actual words are associated with the leaf nodes (Flickinger and Nerbonne, 1992; Russell et al., 1992).",
        "However, the nature and number of these abstract syntactic classes are not very clear, and it seems difficult to come up with a sound method for how to decide on such classes.",
        "At the same time, there are also good reasons for assuming a similar hierarchy based on semantic properties (Hellan and Dimitrova-Vulchanova, 1994).",
        "Representing many competing hierarchies in the lexicon is a problem in itself and is here even more problematic as there are many complex relationships between semantic and syntactic properties (Gropen et al., 1992; Hellan and Dimitrova-Vulchanova, 1996).",
        "Another problem is related to the notions and structures adopted in the lexicon systems.",
        "Most lexicons today are constructed within the framework of some syntactic theory.",
        "This theory guides the structuring of lexical information and also decides what information should be available to the user (Andry et al., 1992; Flickinger and Nerbonne, 1992; Mereuk and Polguere, 1987; Russell et 01., 1992; Krieger and Nerbonne, 1991).",
        "Some lexicon systems try to be reasonably theory-independent, though they still have to adopt some basic syntactic notions that locate them into a family of theories (Gofli and Gonzalez, 1995; Grimshaw and Jackendoff, 1985; Grishman et al., 1994).",
        "The Sign Expansion Approach forms a basis for creating non-redundant lexicon systems that are structured along semantic lines.",
        "The stored lexical entries are sign frames rather than actual words, and a whole system of expansion rules and consistency rules are used to generate dynamic entries of words that contain all the necessary semantic, syntactic, and morphological information.",
        "In Section 2, we give a brief introduction to a sign expansion theory called the Sign Model.",
        "Section 3 explains the use of lexical expansion rules, whereas some concluding remarks and directions for further work are found in Section 4."

        "It posits an abstract level of sign representation that is not associated with any word classes and establishes a framework, within which word relationships as well as relationships between different kinds of linguistic properties can be described in a systematic way.",
        "At the abstract level of representation, one defines conceptual/phonological frames that underly the actual words found in a language.",
        "The frames combine with lexical expansion rules to create dynamic entries of actual words with morphological and syntactic properties, as illustrated by the LFG representations in Figure 1.",

        "The conceptual/phonological frame, which is referred to as a minimal sign, is made up of a semantic (conceptual) part and a realizational part.",
        "As we do not have very much to say about phonological representations here, we assume in the following that the realizational part is a simple graphemic representation.",
        "The semantic part is a conceptual structure of the sign, which is to capture all grammar-relevant aspects of its meaning.",
        "The meaning of a sign is analyzed as a situation involving a number of participants (also called arguments), and these participants as well as the situation as a whole are modeled in terms of aspectual values, semantic roles, criterial factors, and realizational and selectional properties.",
        "Consider the minimal sign PAINT in Figure 2, which is the lexical entry underlying the related words paintv, paintN, painting N , paintableA, etc.",

        "SOURCE means that this argument is the source of energy for the force involved in a painting process, whereas CONTROLLER indicates that the argument is in control of the process.",
        "Correspondingly, argument 2 is the entity on which the force is used (LIMIT) and the entity being controlled by argument 1 (GOAL).",
        "Argument 2 is also given the MONOTONIC role, which means that it undergoes some monotonic change in the course of painting.",
        "The change, of course, is that the surface is gradually covered by some paint.",
        "Each semantic role is further characterized by means of a criterial factor that imposes certain role-related observational properties on the argument.",
        "Specifying SOURCE and LIMIT as coloring means that the painter's use of force involves some observable actions that identifies him as painting, and that the surface being painted is recognizable from the same force.",
        "The gradual covering of the surface with paint, which is modeled by MONOTONIC, is also of the coloring type, since we can verify the covering by looking at the surface.",
        "CONTROLLER'S and GOAL's factor noncriterial means that no particular observable behavior is required for an argument to play these",
        "particular roles.",
        "In general, the criterial factors affect the implicitation of arguments in syntactic expressions (e.g. argument 2 in Jon painted) and the introduction of new ones (e.g. red in Jon painted the house red).",
        "As shown by the lexical entry of WALK in Figure 3, naturally intransitive verbs are rooted in minimal signs with only one conceptual argument.",
        "The argument of WALK is a SOURCE and a CONTROLLER, and it undergoes a monotonic development with respect to some one-dimensional path.",
        "In a sentence like Jon walked to the school, the phrase to the school describes this monotonic development of argument 1.",

        "The general format of the expansion rules is as follows:",
        "X contains the information to be added and Y the requirement for using the rule.",
        "S concerns the structure on which the rule is used and specifies which parts of this structure should be considered by the rule.",
        "Interpretationally, the rule in (1) can be applied on a structure Z if Y is a substructure of Z and X unifies with the selection of Z specified in S. The result of the operation is exactly this unified structure, and the operation itself is referred to as a derivation.",
        "If the whole lexical entry is to be addressed by the rule, the COMPOSITION part is omitted in the rule specification.",
        "Similarly, if the IF Y part is not present, it means that there is no requirement for using the rule.",
        "The expansion rules fall into five categories, depending on what kind of information they insert into the lexical representations: (1) Morpho-syntactic augmentations, (2) inflections, (3) conceptual expansions, (4) syntactic mappings, and (5) compositions.",
        "Morpho-syntactic augmentation rules add a word category and an inflectional paradigm to a minimal sign.",
        "The morpho-syntactic augmentation rule shown in Figure 4(a), for example, derives the basic entry for the verb paintv from the minimal sign PAINT.",
        "Assuming that the lexical entry has already been given a word class and a paradigm, the inflectional rule expands the graphemic representation into a particular inflected word form.",
        "The rule in Figure 4(b) expands the basic entry for paintv into the more specialized entry for the past form paintedv.",
        "The inflectional rules are grouped together into paradigms that are associated with the appropriate words (e.g. vi is linked to paints).",
        "Conceptual expansion rules are rules that extend the semantic part of the signs without combining them with other sign structures.",
        "These rules are semantically conditioned and typically explain how a particular sign can support a variety of subcategorization frames.",
        "The rule in Figure 4(c) shows how a resultative construction like Jon painted the wall red is supported by a minimal sign like PAINT.",
        "If the conceptual structure contains an argument that undergoes some monotonic development, the conceptual structure can be expanded with a new argument that serves as the medium for this development and has a dimension matching the criterial property of the MONOTONIC role.",
        "When an argument is a medium for some other argument, it means that its monotonic development is manifested or materialized through this other argument.",
        "Hence, as argument 2 of PAINT has a MONOTONIC role, the rule is able to add an argument that describes the resulting monotonic change of the surface being painted.",
        "The realization of this argument as an adjective (like red) comes from the fact that the new argument is of dimension coloring.",
        "For a minimal sign like WALK (see Figure 3), which contains an argument (the walker) that monotonically moves along some one-dimensional path, the rule adds a new argument of dimensionality 1-dim.",
        "The medium must then describe a one-dimensional path, as for example to the school in Jon walked to the school.",
        "Syntactic mapping rules are rules that derive syntactic properties from conceptual structures.",
        "Since no special syntactic notions are assumed, we must here decide on an existing syntactic theory before the mapping rules can be defined.",
        "The rule shown in Figure 4(d) is based on Gulla's rules (Gulla, 1994) for mapping from SM conceptual structures to LFG grammatical functions (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982).",
        "It states that if a verb is used",
        "in a completed sense', MEDIUM arguments of dimensionality coloring or existence can be mapped onto the xcomP function.",
        "Used together with rule 4(c) on PAINT, it introduces an )(come element that describes the resulting state of the surface being painted.",
        "A similar approach to the assignment of syntactic functions in LUG can be found in (A.lsina, 1993).",
        "The compositional rules combine two sign structures and create a new compound structure that includes parts of both of them.",
        "The rule in Figure 4(e) uses a suffix to create a noun that refers to some controlled, durative activity.",
        "Except for the control and duration requirement, the conceptual structure must also contain a criteriallg anchored argument, i.e. an argument that includes at least one semantic role that is not nonerite-rial.",
        "The COMPOSITION part says that there are two structures involved, a main structure and a suffix structure, whereas the expansion part turns the whole conceptual structure into an argument k. On the basis of the minimal signs PAINT and WALK, the rule can create the nouns painting N and walking N ."
