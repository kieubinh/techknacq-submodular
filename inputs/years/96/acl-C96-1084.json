        "Text phenomena, e.g., textual forms of ellipsis and anaphora are a challenging issue for the design of parsers for text understanding systems, since lacking recognition facilities either result in referentially incoherent or invalid text knowledge representations.",
        "At the conceptual level, textual ellipsis (also called functional anaphora) relates a quasi-anaphoric expression to its extrasentential antecedent by conceptual attributes (or roles) associated with that antecedent (see, e.g., the relation between \"Ladezeit\" (charge time) and \"Akku\" (accumulator) in (lc) and (lb)).",
        "Thus, it complements the phenomenon of nominal anaphora, where an anaphoric expression is related to its antecedent in terms of conceptual generalization (as, e.g., \"Rechner\" (computer) refers to \"316LT\" , a particular notebook, in (lb) and (la)).",
        "The resolution of text-level nominal (and pronominal) anaphora contributes to the construction of referentially valid text knowledge bases, while the resolution of textual ellipsis yields referentially coherent text knowledge bases.",
        "Both phenomena tend to interact, as evidenced by the examples below.",
        "\"Akku\" (accumulator) in (lb) is a nominal anaphor referring to \"Nickel-MetallHydride-Akku\" (nickel-metal-hydride accumulator) in (la), which, when resolved, provides the proper referent for relating \"Ladezeit\" (charge time) in (lc) to it.",
        "In the case of textual ellipsis, the missing conceptual link between two discourse elements occurring in adjacent utterances must be inferred in order to establish the local coherence of the discourse (for an early statement of that idea, cf. Clark (1975)).",
        "In sentence (lc) the information is missing that \"Ladezeit\" (charge time) links up with \"Akku\" (accumulator).",
        "This relation can only be made explicit if conceptual knowledge about the domain, viz. the relation charge-time-of between the concepts CHARGE-TIME and ACCUMULATOR, is available.",
        "The solution we propose is embedded within the centering model (Grosz et al., 1995).",
        "In this approach, discourse entities linking successive utterances in a discourse segment are organized in terms of centers.",
        "Local coherence in discourse is established whenever a center element of the previous utterance is associated with an expression that has a valid semantic interpretation (i.e., is realized) in the following utterance.",
        "Textual ellipsis has only been given insufficient treatment within the centering model in terms of rather sketchy realization conditions as opposed to the more elaborated constraints for (pro)nominal anaphora.",
        "The heuristics we propose include language-independent conceptual criteria and language-dependent information structure constraints reflecting the context-boundedness or unboundedness of discourse elements within the considered utterances."

        "A much more detailed presentation is given by Hahn et al.",

        "Concepts and roles are hierarchically ordered by subsumption (a terminological knowledge representation framework is assumed; cf. Woods & Schmolze (1992)).",
        "In order to determine suitable conceptual links between an antecedent and an elliptic expression, we distinguish two modes of constraining the linkage between concepts via conceptual roles.",
        "In the process of path finding an extensive unidirectional search is performed in the domain knowledge base and formal well-formedness conditions holding for paths between two concepts are considered, viz. complete connectivity (compatibility of domains and ranges of the included relations), non-cyclicity (exclusion of inverses of relations) and non-redundancy (exclusion of including paths).",
        "The mode of path evaluation incorporates empirically plausible criteria in order to select the strongests of the ensuing paths.",
        "Based on analyses of approximately 60 product reviews from the information technology domain and experimental evidences from several (psycho)linguistic studies (e.g., Chaffin (1992)), we state certain predefined path patterns.",
        "From those general path patterns and by virtue of the hierarchical organization of conceptual relations, concrete conceptual role chains can automatically be derived in a terminological reasoning system.",
        "As a consequence, we may distinguish between a subset of all types of well-formed paths, which is labeled \"plausible\", another subset which is labeled \"metonymic\", and all remaining paths which are labeled \"implausible\" .",
        "Examples of plausible paths are all paths of length 1 they arc explicitly encoded in the domain's concept descriptions and are therefore \"plausible\", by definition or any series of transitive relations, e.g. has-physical-part relations.",
        "Following well-established typologies of metonymies (Lakoff, 1987) we include producer-for-product, part-for-whole, and whole-for-part patterns among the metonymic paths.",
        "The computation of paths between an antecedent a and an elliptic expression y, however, may yield several types of well-formed paths, viz. \"plausible\", \"metonymic\" or \"implausible\".",
        "For proper selection we define a ranking on those path labels according to their intrinsic conceptual strength in terms of the relation \">,._,t,.\" (conceptually stronger than) (cf. Table 1).",
        "As a consequence of this ordering, \"metonymic\"",
        "paths will be excluded from a path list iff \"plausible\" paths already exist, while \"implausible\" paths will he excluded iff \"plausible\" or \"metonymic\" paths already exist.",
        "At the end of this selection process, only paths of the strongest type are retained in the final path list.",
        "All conceptual paths which meet the above linkage criteria for two concepts, a and y, are contained in the final list denoted by CP,,,y.",
        "As, in the case of textual ellipsis, we have to deal with paths leading from the elliptical expression to several alternative antecedents, we usually have to compare pairs of path lists CP,,y and CP,;,,, where x, y, z arc concepts.",
        "Obviously, the criterion which ranks conceptual paths according to their associated path markers is applicable as all paths in a single CP list have the same marker.",
        "A function, PathMarker(CPi,j), yields either \"plausible\", \"metonymic\" or \"implausible\" depending on the type of paths the list contains.",

        "This shortcoming is simply due to the fact that DRT is basically a semantic theory, not a full-fledged model for text understanding.",

        "A pattern-based approach to inferencing (including textual ellipsis) has also been put forward by Norvig (1989).",
        "The main difference to our work lies in the fact that these path patterns do not take the compositional properties of relations into account (e.g., transitive relations).",
        "Furthermore, numerical constraints like path length restrictions are posited without motivating their origin, whereas we state format well-formedness and empirical criteria the evidence for which is derived from psycholinguistic studies.",

        "Moreover, the crucial problem still unsolved in this logically very principled framework concerns a proper choice methodology for fixing appropriate costs for specific assumptions on which, among other factors, textual ellipsis resolution is primarily based.",
