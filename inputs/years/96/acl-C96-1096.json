        "There are five principal factors in Bantu languages which contribute to ambiguous analysis of word-forms.",
        "First, nouns are grouped into more than ten marked noun classes.",
        "The marking of these classes extends across the noun phrase, whereby the noun governs the choice of markers in dependent constituents.",
        "Second, verbs inflect stem-initially and mark the subject, object, and relative referent by prefixes, whereby the actual form of each prefix is governed by the noun class of the noun it refers to.",
        "In addition, verb derivation also adds to the complexity of verbal morphology.",
        "Third, reduplication is a productive phenomenon.",
        "Because its accurate description in lexicon is not possible, alternative ways in handling it are discussed.",
        "Fourth, the majority of Bantu languages have a tone system, but rarely this is indicated in writing.",
        "This adds to morphological ambiguity.",
        "Fifth, various semantic functions of word-forms are also a source of ambiguity.",
        "In this paper shall discuss the points one and two by using Swahili as a test language."

        "The application of this formalism to Swahili has been under process since 1987, and it has now, after having been tested with a corpus of one million words, reached a mature phase with a recall of 99.8% in average running text, and precision of close to 100%.",
        "The performance of SWATWOL corresponds to what is reported of ENGTWOL, the morphological parser of English (Voutilainen et al. 1992; Tapanainen and Jarvinen 1994), and SWETWOL, the morphological analyzer of Swedish (Karlsson 1992).",

        "Unlike in languages with right-branching word formation, where word roots can be grouped together into a root lexicon, here word roots have been divided into several sub-lexicons.",

        "The number of word-forms with more than one reading is almost equal in both corpora, slightly over 50%.",
        "The percentages in Table 2 decrease rather systematically the more readings a word-form has.",

        "While the reported ambiguity counted from word-form tokens is generally much higher than that counted from word-form types, in Swahili the difference is small.",
        "This is due to the fact that in addition to ambiguity found in several of the most common words, verb-forms are typically ambiguous, as are almost half of the nouns.",
        "Karlsson (1994:23) suggests an inverse correlation between the number of unique word-forms and rate of ambiguity.",
        "Therefore, heavily inflecting languages would tend to produce unambiguous word-forms.",
