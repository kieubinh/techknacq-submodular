        "Alignment of corpora is now being actively studied to support example-based automatic translation and dictionary refinement.",
        "Focusing on the latter, in order to obtain lexical translations, the maximum likelihood method is applied to roughly aligned corpus.",
        "One of the problems of this method is that it needs a large amount of aligned corpus for training (Brown, 1993).",
        "When it exists, a qualified dictionary is also likely to exist, because it should have been created and used when the corpus in the source language was translated by hand to make the aligned corpus.",
        "There are few requirements to improve dictionaries in such a case.",
        "On the other hand, when a large amount of aligned corpus does not exist but only two independent corpora do, for example, the corpora between two 'not so international'",
        "languages or those in a constrained domain, the low quality dictionaries need to be improved.",
        "To make a new dictionary between two uncommon languages, it is often necessary to transform published dictionaries, one between the source and the international language, the other between the international and the target language.",
        "The problem in this process is to eliminate the irrelevant translations introduced by words with ambiguous meanings (Tanaka, 1994).",
        "This can be thought of as choosing the translations from several candidates without aligned corpus.",
        "Note that adopting aligned corpus of insufficient size cause the same situation.",
        "We therefore propose a method to extract lexical translations using two corpora which are not aligned in the source and target language.",
        "Our method is proposed as the extension of the framework to solve the problem of choosing the translation according to the context.",
        "Thus, one of the merits of our research is that two problems, looking for the translation according to the global and local context, are handled within the same framework."
