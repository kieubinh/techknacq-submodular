        "The research benefited from the possibility to store huge amounts of information in computer systems, and the optimism could be overwhelming when the problems were simplified and thought mostly restricted by the size of the corpus.",

        "Co-occurrence is still interesting because bigrams occur non-randomly, sometimes to such an extent that we discern some structure beyond co-occurrence.",
        "The reason why it should be so is probably that part of the use of words is reflected by the company that words keep.",
        "Researchers (Church & Hanks, 1990; Kita & al., 1994, inter al.)",
        "have noted that mutual information tends to be insensitive to high frequency patterns, and unstable for low frequency patterns.",
        "Johansson (1994) compared another measure, the difference in mutual information (AO, of collocational strength with mutual information (0.",
        "That measure ranked high frequency bigrams higher than other bigrams if the order was consistent, whereas mutual information tended to pick out combinations of low frequency items.",
        "Since low frequency items carry more specific information such bigrams give an illusion of semantic content.",
        "It is usually this semantic illusion that we are interested in, but what says that \"of the\" or \"in a\" are worse bigrams than \"wooden spades\" or \"various pretexts\".",
        "Johansson proposed the test of finding some of the characters in the children's story \"Alice in Wonderland\", and showed that a 'new' measure was to some degree \"better\" than mutual information.",
        "Unfortunately, some of that result was based on the fact that mutual information is very sensitive to low frequency items."
