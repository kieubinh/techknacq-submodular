        "Two general approaches can be distinguished in dialogue management: the structural approach, which uses a dialogue grammar to capture regularities of the dialogue in terms of exchanges and moves (Bilange, 1992; Cawsey, 1993; Grosz and Sidner, 1986), and the intention-based approach, which classifies the speaker's beliefs and intentions into speech acts, and uses planning operators to describe them (Appelt, 1985; Allen and Perrault, 1980; Bunt et al., 1984).",
        "Both regard natural language as purposeful behaviour, but differ in how this behaviour is to be described.",
        "The former sees dialogues as products and compiles participants' beliefs and intentions into a predefined dialogue structure, whereas the latter focusses on the par-ticipants' goals, and hides the structure in the relations between acts which contain appropriately chosen sets of beliefs and intentions as their preconditions and effects.",
        "We will not go into detailed evaluation of the approaches, see e.g. (Jokinen, 1994), but draw attention to three aspects of dialogues which have *1 am grateful to Yuji Matsumoto for providing an excellent research environment during my JSPS Post-doctoral Fellowship, and Graham Wilcock for helpful discussions.",
        "not been properly addressed before, although widely acknowledged in literature, and important in building robust Natural Language interfaces:",
        "1. dialogue is a collaborative process and its structure is recognised by external observation, not prescribed as an internal constraint of dialogue management (Sacks et al., 1974; Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1990), 2. the speakers' beliefs and intentions in a given dialogue situation are various, and cannot all be checked when deciding on the next response (Cherniak, 1986), 3. communicative acts are part of social activ",
        "ity, constrained by normative obligations of rational agency (Allwood, 1976).",
        "We discuss these aspects from the point of view of cooperative goal formulation and present the Constructive Dialogue Model as a new approach to plan system responses.",
        "Our departure point is in general communicative principles which constrain cooperative and coherent communication, and radical steps are taken in two respects: the dialogue grammar is abandoned as an infeasible way to describe dialogues, and also speech act recognition is abandoned as a redundant labelling of intention configurations.",
        "The first step means that the structure is not built according to structuring rules, but emerges from local coherence as the dialogue goes on.",
        "The second step means that beliefs and intentions are dealt with by reasoning about the utterance context and communicative constraints instead of speech act types.",
        "The decision about what to say next falls out as a result of the agent complying with the communicative principles which refer to the agent's rationality, sincerity, motivation and consideration.",
        "Combined with contextual knowledge, they account for the acceptability of different alternative responses.",
        "The paper is organised as follows.",
        "The theoretical framework and its formalisation as the Constructive Dialogue Model are discussed in Section 2.",
        "Section 3 presents how the system's communicative goal is determined, and Section 4 provides comparision with related work.",
        "Finally, conclusions and future directions are given in Section 5."

      "text": [
        "Rational agents try to follow the principles of Ideal Cooperation (Allwood, 1976) in communication: (1) assume a joint purpose, (2) show cognitive consideration (epistemic rationality regarding appropriate ways to react) and ethical consideration (intention to react in a way that does not prevent the partner from fulfilling her goals), and (3) trust that the partner is acting according to the same principles.",
        "Ideal cooperation does not mean that the agents always react in the way the partner intended to evoke, but rather, it sets the normality assumptions for the way the agents would behave if no disturbing factors were present.",
        "As (Gal-hers, 1989) points out, conflict resolution forms an important part of human communication, and if systems are always ready to adopt the user's role, they become rigid and unrealistic.",
        "However, if the conflict becomes so serious that it makes any cooperation impossible, communication will break down as well.",
        "Rational agents thus try to communicate so as to conform to the shared assumptions about operationally appropriate and ethically acceptable acts in a given situation (Jokinen, 1995).",
        "Empirical dialogue research has emphasised collaborative nature of dialogues (Sacks et al., 1974; Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1990).",
        "Also computationally oriented dialogue studies show that the users express themselves vaguely and continue with follow-up questions (Moore and Paris, 1993), and our corpusi supports the view that even simple information seeking dialogues resemble negotiations rather than straightforward question-answer sequences.",
        "Based on these obeservations and the theoretical assumptions of Ideal Cooperation, we distinguished the main factors in rational, cooperative dialogue management as follows: whereas the information seeker is not expected to teach the information provider how to look for the information.",
        "The roles can be further differentiated with respect to social factors such as acquaintance of the addressee and formality of the situation.",
        "• Communicative obligations.",
        "Social, normative requirements that concern the agent's sincerity (exchange information which is true or for which evidence can be provided), motivation (exchange information which is related to one's goals and strategies), and consideration (exchange information which the partner is able to deal with).",

        "Task goals are planned to complete a real world task (rent a car, book a flight, repair a pump) hut because of uneven distribution of knowledge, the agents usually need to collaborate to achieve the goal, and thus formulate communicative goals to obtain missing information, cf. (Guinn, 1994).",
        "B. Communicative act: • Expressive and evocative attitudes.",
        "To distinguish between the effects of an utterance and the intentions behind it, Austin's concept of illocution is split up into two: expression of the speaker's attitude and evocation of a reaction in the partner; perlocution corresponds to what is actually achieved by the act: the evoked response, cf. (Allwood, 1976).",
        "Expression may differ from evocation (irony, indirectness), and the evoked response from the evocative intentions (the agent requests information that the partner cannot or does not want to disclose; the agent fails to frighten the partner because this has guessed the agent's malicious intentions).",

        "If the expressive attitudes of the partner's response match the evocative intentions of the agent's contribution, the communicative goal of the agent's contribution is fulfilled.",

        "It is possible to modify our joint purpose algorithm with information about rhetorical relations so as to check expectations in regard to argumentation, or to include rhetorical knowledge in the obligations used when reasoning about multisentential contributions, but as our primary goal has been to specify communicative principles and use them in the formalisation of the cooperative and rational nature of dialogues, this kind of extension is left for future.",
