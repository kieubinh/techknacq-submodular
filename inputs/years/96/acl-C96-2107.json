        "For ambiguity resolution, processing of a discourse structure is one of the important processes in Natural Language Processing (NLP).",
        "Indeed, discourse structures play a useful role in speech recognition, which is an application of NLP.",
        "In the case of Japanese, it is very difficult to recognize the end in utterances by using current speech recognition techniques because the sound power of an ending tends to be small.",
        "For example, \"desu\", which represents the speech act type \"response\", is often misrecognized as \"desu-ka (question)\" or \"desu-ne (confirmation)\".",
        "On the other hand, Japanese can easily select the adequate expression \"desu\", when the intention of the previous utterance is concerned with a question.",
        "This is because they use the coherence relation (local cohesion) between the two utterances, question-response.",
        "In the conventional approach (i.e., rule-based approach) to processing the discourse structure [Hauptmann 88][Kudo 90][Yamaoka 91][Young 91], NLP engineers built discourse knowledge by hand-coding.",
        "However, the rule-based approach has a bottleneck in that it is a hard job to add discourse knowledge when the employed NLP system deals with a larger domain and more vocabulary.",
        "Recently, statistical approaches have been attracting attention for their ability to acquire linguistic knowledge from a corpus.",
        "Compared with the above rule-based approach, a statistical approach is easy to apply to larger domains since the linguistic knowledge can be automatically extracted from the corpora concerned with the domain.",
        "However, little research has been reported in discourse processing [Nagata 94] [Reithinger 95], while in the areas of morphological analysis and syntactic analysis, many research studies have been proposed in recent years.",
        "This paper presents a method for automatically recognizing local cohesion between utterances, which is one of the discourse structures in task-oriented spoken dialogues.",
        "We can automatically acquire discourse knowledge from an annotated corpus with local cohesion.",

        "Our method has obtained a 93% accuracy for closed data and a 78% accuracy for open data in recognizing a pair of utterances with local cohesion.",

        "The discourse structure in task-oriented dialogues has two types of cohesion: global cohesion and local cohesion.",
        "Global cohesion is a top-down structured context and is based on a hierarchy of topics led by domain (e.g., hotel reservation or flight cancellation).",
        "Using this cohesion, a task-oriented dialogue is segmented into several subdialogues according to the topic.",
        "On the other hand, local cohesion is a bottom-up structured context and a coherence relation between utterances, such as question-response or response-confirmation.",
        "Different from global cohesion, local cohesion does not have a hierarchy.",
        "This paper focuses on local cohesion.",
        "Figure 1 shows a Japanese conversation between a person and a hotel staff member, which is an example of a task-oriented dialogue; The person is making a hotel reservation.",
        "The first column represents global cohesion and the second column represents local cohesion.",
        "For example, the pair of U3 and U4 has local cohesion, because it has a coherence relation for each word in the utterances as follows: cl) speech act pattern between \"onegai-itashimasu (requirement)\"in U3 and \"desu (response)\" in U4 c2) semantic coherence between nouns, \"hinichi (date)\"in U3, and \"hachi-gatsu to-ka (August 10th)\" and \"ju-ni-nichi (12th)\"in U4 In the same way, (U4, U5) and (U5, U6) have local cohesion.",
        "Thus, 153 to U6 are built up as one structure and form a subdialogue with the topic \"date\".",
        "As observed from this example, whether two utterances have local cohesion with one another or not is determined by coherence relations between the speech act types in the utterances, coherence relations between the verbs in them and coherence relations between the nouns in them.",
        "In recognizing local cohesion, our method uses these three coherence relations."
