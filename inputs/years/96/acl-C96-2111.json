        "Complex-feature-based formalisms are understood here as equivalent to unification-based formalisms as exemplified by PATR-II, HPSG, and others (cf Shieber 1986, Carpenter 1992).",
        "Such formalisms typically include a context-free (CF) base, which allows the use of parsing algorithms designed for CF languages despite the fact that complex-feature-based formalisms are essentially more powerful than CF grammars.",
        "However, such an adaptation of CF algorithms involves their extension to possibly infinite nonterminal domains, which, as Shieber (1985) and Haas (1989) have shown, is nontrivial.",
        "Various CF algorithms make use of a binary relation between a goal category and the category of a constituent (phrase or word) which either has just been parsed or is to be parsed next.",
        "Different terms have been used to designate this relation; Kay (1980) speaks of reachability, while Pereira/Shieber (1987) and others before them use the term linking for the relation.",
        "Whatever term one takes, an important aspect of the relation is that it can be used to reduce the search space of possible syntactic analyses at an earlier point in parsing and thus serves to improve the efficiency of a parser.",
        "Shieber (1985, 1992) follows established terminology in speaking of top-down filtering in connection with the prediction step of the Earley algorithm.",
        "His central notion of restriction, whereby a restrictor is a finite subset of the paths specified in a feature structure, is related to the technique we introduce here, since both guarantee the finiteness of an otherwise possibly infinite domain of complex categories, but Shieber's re-strictors are specified manually.",
        "We propose a general algorithmic method of compilation that avoids manual specification.",
        "The focus of this discussion is on the linking relation used to extend left-corner parsers, rather than on the prediction step of the Earley algorithm as with Shieber, although the results carry over.",
        "Whereas Shieber et al.",
        "(1990) have discussed similar techniques in the context of semantic-head-driven generation, we are concerned here with parsing.",
        "We view the linking relation not simply as a filter to increase efficiency within the domain of syntactic analysis--this aspect is stressed by Shieber (1985) and other investigators such as Bouma (1991)--but rather as a device for the top-down predictive instantiation of information, as Shieber et al.",

        "It has been presented so often since and is now so well-known that a brief informal statement of the algorithm should suffice here: The algorithm applies to CF grammars in general; it is both correct and, with the exception of derivations of the form A -->* A, where A is a nonterminal, is complete.",
        "It can be used either to compile a given CF grammar into a parser or to interpret it.",
        "The principle is simple.",
        "To parse a string, the current word form is first parsed, i.e. looked up in the lexicon.",
        "Whenever a constituent, be it a word form or a phrase, is successfully parsed, the syntax rules are chosen which have the category of the identified constituent as their left corner, i.e. the leftmost category in the right-hand side of the rule.",
        "If the remaining sister categories of the left corner can be parsed, then the mother category of the rule is the result for the corresponding substring, and the algorithm continues recursively until the entire string is covered by a category; if the category of an expectation was specified, it must match the category found."

        "It was soon noted that the efficiency of the algorithm could be improved significantly through the use of a reachability or linking relation compiled out of the grammar before parsing; this consists of the reflexive and transitive closure of the relation defined by the pairs of mother and LC categories specified in the set of syntax rules of the grammar.",
        "Whenever a lexical entry is found that assigns a category C to a given word form, the linking relation is used to determine whether C can be useful in reaching the goal category C', i.e. whether C is a (transitive) left corner of C; this test is carried out before the parser looks for rules having C as the left corner.",
        "Of course, C may itself be the category C' sought, hence the reflexive closure.",
        "Likewise, when a rule is found in which C is the left corner, the relation tests whether the mother C, of C can be used to reach the goal C' before an attempt is made to parse the sisters of C. Computation of the linking relation from a set of CF syntax rules is straightforward.",

        "We quote Shieber's syntax rules for his second analysis of subcategorization (p.84), in which the subject of a verb appears as the first element of the subcategorization list:",
        "The difficulties clearly lie in the last syntax rule: VP (or VPJ and VP _2) seems to be left recursive--whatever we may mean by that at this point--so perhaps no link arises at all from this rule.",
        "On the other hand, the two feature structures are unifiable, but their unification produces a cyclic feature structure, which raises additional problems for the definition of linking and possibly for implementation.",
        "The difficulty, of course, is that VP_I and VP _2 are schematic and that these rules recursively generate a de-numerably infinite set of VP-type categories, all of which may give rise to distinct elements in the linking relation.",
        "Whether this is linguistically important, which is improbable, or merely a mathematical game is beside the point: the formal problem is there, and we cannot individually specify infinitely many links.",
        "Consider the LC analysis of the sentence John loves Mary.",

        "Now, there is an entry for [loves]v, so a link <VP [1], V[2]> is needed since loves subcategorizes for a subject and an object.",
        "Indeed, since the grammar allows verbs to subcategorize for any finite number of complements, we need an infinite number of links between VP[1J and V[n] categories.",
        "Moreover, once we have these links we need the same number between VP[1J and VP [IV categories since the first VP expansion simply unifies the subcategorization of the V daughter with that of the VP mother.",

        "The rules account for sentences like The child's father sleeps.",
        "We must take care not to exclude A mother's children sleep, which will happen if the linking relation is defined so that any determiner--also in a possessive construction-must have the same agreement features as the sentence subject of which it is a left corner."

        "The aim of our proposal is to define equivalence relations that keep the linking relation finite while also preventing it from being too restrictive; this turns the linking relation into a weak prediction table in the sense of Haas (19- 89: 227f0.",
        "Like Shieber (1985, 1992) with the notion of restriction, we confine our attention to a subset of specifications; in particular, we can define a feature structure that subsumes all VP-type feature structures of Shieber's recursive subcategorization rules.",
        "But unlike Shieber, our restrictors are computed automatically by building the generalization of the occurrences of left-recursive categories in a grammar.",
        "The intuitive idea is that we consider categories to be left recursive if their tokens can be unified (rather than being identical, as in the case of atoms); we then use their generalization, or greatest lower bound, as a common denominator defining an equivalence relation.",
        "We shall say that two categories build a left-recursive link, i.e. <X, X'> E L1 iff on the basis of the given grammar there is a derivation A -4* A' a' (where cc' is a string of categories and terminal symbols) such that the unification A u A' exists, whether or not it is cyclic, and there is no A\" such that A + A\" a\" -->+ A' oca where A u A\" and A\" u A' exist.",
        "Let Age be the generalization A n A' of A and A; then we define X and X' as distinct copies of Age such that for every path 7C where Agn= A 'gn, it also holds that Xgrt = X'@lt, where F@rc is \"the value of the feature structure F at some path TC at which it is defined\" (Carpenter 1992:38) and '=' denotes token identity.",
        "We thus expressly allow reentrancies between the distinct feature structures X and X; as we shall see below, this is essential in order for us to use the linking relation to instantiate information during parsing.",
        "A second relation, corresponding directly to the conventional notion of links as compiled directly from rules, can now be defined: two categories build a rule link, i.e. <A0', An5 E L2 iff on the basis of the given grammar there is a finite derivation Ao ----> Alas...A4a,_--> Ana with 1 5 n such that for all i with 1 i n it is the case that Ao u A, is undefined (i.e. the derivation is nonrecursive), and for all i with 0 i n it is the case that if <X, X'> c L, and A, u X exists, then A,' also exists and is the extension X'L A,' that arises when A, is unified with X.",
        "Intuitively, L2 is given by the set of nonrecursive derivations licensed by the grammar, where each left-recursive leftmost category in the derivation is replaced by (i.e. restricted to) the generalization of the instances of that left-recursive category.",
        "The overall linking relation L is then defined so that <B, B'> E L iff (1) there is a <X, X'> E (L, u L2) such that B u X and B' u X' exist, or else (2) B u B' exists (the reflexive case where B' satisfies the parse goal B).",
        "Moore and Alshawi (1992: 134ff) describe a similar algorithm that compiles the linking relation for complex-feature-based formalisms.",
        "But rather than computing the generalization of left-recursive categories to avoid the possibility of generating an infinite relation, they instead \"impose a cutoff after two nested occurrences of the same functor in a feature specification,",
        "substituting new unique variables for the arguments of the inner occurrence of the functor, so that any constituent with a more complex feature description will be accepted.\" Moreover, they discuss linking only with regard to filtering.",
        "Our use of the linking relation with destructive unification in parsing requires special comment.",
        "If B is a goal and B' is a parsed left corner such that <X, X''> E L and B u X and B' u X' exist, then there is a link between B and B; we can stop here with a mere test of unification if we only want to use linking as a filter to reduce the search space.",
        "But if B and B' are actually unified with X and X', respectively, information may become shared between B and B'.",
        "In the reflexive case of linking for completion, B and B' are unified with each other.",
        "Since the information that becomes shared via L, is subsumed by that of the reflexive case, completion works correctly for left-recursive categories, but B and B' must still be unified in the actual completion step.",
        "We have employed generalization in the definition of linking to make a kind of mask allowing just the appropriate information to become shared between B and B'.",
        "Thus, linking ceases to be a mere test or filter and can instead function as an independent device for the transmission of information in parsing.",
        "Returning to Shieber's rules for subcategorization, the definition of L given here allows instantiated head features of a VP goal to be passed top-down to a verb.",

The facts of German inflection lead to massively disjunctive analyses in conventional systems of morphological analysis that simply take an isolated inflected word form and consider what it might be.",
        "But if we are given a top-down prediction or expectation of the lexical category from the linking relation, then we can first find a lexical entry for the stem, use linking to confirm the appropriateness of the entry (in our example, the appropriateness of the category N, A, or V) for the context, simultaneously use linking to further instantiate features (in particular for agreement) on the category, and then check the given inflection within a highly restricted search space.",

        "The theoretical and practical significance of such unknown forms is great; see the discussion in Kilbury/Barg/Renz (1994).",
        "Even without the linking relation, unification, together with backtracking through a space of possible analyses (or corresponding use of a chart) gives us information for the missing entry; this in itself is not novel.",
        "But simple extensions of well-known parsing algorithms presuppose a random search through the space of open lexical classes to get the candidate category.",
        "The procedure is roughly as follows: (1) once it is established that no appropriate entry is in the lexicon, (2) arbitrarily select a category for an open lexical class, (3) check whether it fits the given context, and (4) if it fits, take the final feature structure for the form which is instantiated in the course of a successfully completed parse.",
        "In contrast, top-down predictive linking provides for a directed search since top-down instantiation can propose a category.",
