        "Moreover, a strategy of argument transfer is used in cases of long-distance scrambling, according to which arguments and adjuncts are attached to the domain of the coherent verb, ECM verb, or raising verb, and transferred to the infinitival complement for interpretation."

        "The parsing strategy is data-triggered (mainly bottom-up), proceeds from left to right, and treats alternatives in parallel by using a chart (cf. Kay 1980/1986 and Kaplan 1973).",
        "The analysis of a sentence proceeds at two levels: the lexical level and the syntactic level.",
        "The lexical analysis looks up the words in the lexicon; each lexical item (word) projects the node corresponding to its category; thus, the lexical features are transferred to the syntactic level in accordance with the Projection Principle (Chomsky 1981).",
        "The projected node is then inserted into the chart as an edge.",
        "The syntactic analysis builds all possible structures by making use of cross-category projections (similar to Grimshaw's 1991 \"extented pro-jections\") and attachments, which are further filtered by grammatical constraints; structure building is incremental, as the current constituent is immediately integrated into the existing hypotheses.",
        "A cross-category projection creates a new constituent with the same start and end vertex in the chart as the subconstituent from which it is projected.",
        "This kind of projection is limited to some categories and triggered by intrinsic features.",
        "For instance, an infinitival verb projects the structure in Figure 1 from VP to CP.",
        "Attachment combines the current constituent with the constituents which immediately precede this current constituent in the chart.",

        "• Non-formal attachments concern thematic complements and are licensed by subcatego-rization and theta properties.",

        "The aim of the AIS is to match the arguments with the subcategorization properties (argument structure) of the predicate, and thus to establish an interpretation, which corresponds to the assignment of the thematic roles.",
        "The argument structure of a verb (predicate) is provided by the lexicon and specifies the number and type of arguments that the predicate can take; while there can be more than one argument structure for a verb at the lexical level, there is only one argument table for a (verb) node at the syntactic level, which contains the arguments of the clause.",
        "This argument table is matched with the corresponding argument structures, which has the effect of filtering the inappropriate argument structures.",
        "The AIS has to deal with two types of difficulties: first, the predicate (with its argument structure) is not always available at the time the argument is attached; second, the large number of possible word orders in German makes the argument's grammatical function difficult to determine.",
        "The argument structure is only available if the main verb (predicate) occurs in C°, that is the second position in the clause (verb second with the main verb), and thus at most one argument precedes the verb.",
        "In this case, a final interpretation of the arguments is established immediately (at the moment of attachment); the arguments are inserted into the definitive argument table of the clause and interpreted by being matched with the argument structure of the verb (theta assignment); if more than one interpretation is possible, different hypotheses are considered in parallel.",

        "ment table and the argument structure eventually takes place at the time the main verb is attached.",
        "The task of identifying the grammatical function of an argument is complicated by the large number of possible word orders, which results from the interaction of three syntactic processes: verb second, scrambling, and extraposition.",
        "The verb second constraint requires that the tensed verb occupies the second position of the main clause; for the first position, however, a large number of constituents (XP) is possible, such as the subject, an object, an adjunct, an empty operator.",
        "Scrambling is a process that modifies the order of clause-internal arguments and adjuncts under some constraints (cf. for instance, Uszkoreit 1987).",
        "Extraposition is the occurrence of prepositional or sentential complements or adjuncts after the verb in its base position V°.",
        "Thus, the grammatical function of an argument depends not only on its position, but also on case and agreement information and (scrambling) ordering constraints.",
        "The interpretation module works as follows: The first step is to check whether there are arguments to be interpreted.",
        "If so, it is further checked whether the main verb is available, with the argument structures.",
        "In case it is not available, the new argument is inserted into the provisional argument table (and its interpretation can be checked only later, when the argument structure is available).",
        "If it is available, the new argument is matched with the argument structures; if there is a provisional argument table instead of one argument, the matching is effected for each argument in turn.",
        "Thus, the list of argument structures is filtered and a list of new argument tables is returned.",
        "For each of these argument tables, it is checked whether its arguments obey the ordering constraints.",
        "If so, the new structure is completed and for each argument that is not in its base position, a chain is created to link the argument with that position, in which a trace is inserted.",
