        "Our development effort was initiated with a speech-to-speech translation system, called CCLINC (Tummala et al., 1995), which consists of a modular, multilingual structure including speech recognition, language understanding, language generation, and speech synthesis in each language.",
        "The system architecture of CCLINC is given in Figure 1.",

        "The analysis module produces a semantic frame, which is an interlingua representation of the input sentence.",
        "The intractable ambiguities of natural language are overcome by restricting the domain and the grammar rules which specify the semantic co-occurrence restrictions of head categories.",
        "The structural difference between the source (English) and the target (Korean) language is easily captured by the flexible interlingua representation and the strictly modularized target language grammar tern-plate, external to the core generation system.",
        "The simplicity of the system enables us to detect problems and provide solutions easily.",
        "Currently the system has a vocabulary of 1427 words.",
        "The system runs on a SPARC 10 workstation.",
        "The Korean translation outputs are displayed on a hangul window running on UNIX.",
        "In addition, we are in the process of porting the system to a Pentium laptop running on Linux.",

        "As is reflected in the parse tree, both syntactic and semantic categories are utilized in our grammar specification.",
        "Top level categories such as `sentence,' `subject,' etc.",
        "are syntax-based, whereas lower-level categories such as `ship_name,' `time_expression,' etc.",
        "are semantics-based.",
        "The main advantage of adopting semantic categories is that we can easily specify the co-occurrence restrictions of head categories (e.g., the parse tree specifies that the category ships occurs with a small subset of nominal modifiers including uss which we call (ship_mod'), and therefore reduces the ambiguity of the input sentence.",
        "In addition, it provides for easy access to the meaning of domain-specific expressions.",
        "The parse tree directly encodes the knowledge that sterett and kirov are ship names, ssn-12 a submarine name, and z stands for Greenwich Mean Time.",
        "As for mapping from parse tree to semantic frame, we reduce all the major parse tree constituents into one of the three syntactic roles, i.e. clause, topic, and predicate.",
        "All clause-level categories including statements, infinitives, etc., are mapped onto clause.",
        "All noun phrases are mapped onto topic, and all modifiers as well as verb phrases are mapped onto predicate.",
        "However, there is no limit to the number of semantic frame categories, and we can easily create new categories for a more elaborate representation.",
        "In Figure 4, we have additional categories like `time_expression.' Whether or not we add more categories to the semantic frame depends on how elaborate a translation output is desired.",
        "If elaborate translations are required, we increase the number of semantic frame categories.",
        "The flexibility of the semantic frame representation makes the TINA system an ideal tool for machine translation of various (i) purposes (i.e., whether a detailed or rough translation is required), and (ii) languages (e.g., some languages require a more elaborate tense representation or honorification than others, and the appropriate categories can be easily added.)"
