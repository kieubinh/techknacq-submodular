        "One of the oversimplification assumed by this learning technique was the acquisition of morphological rules which obey only simple concatenative regularities of the main word with an affix.",

        "Part-of-speech (Pos) taggers are programs which assign a single Pos-tag to a word-token, provided that it is known what parts-of-speech this word can take on in principle.",
        "In order to do that taggers are supplied with a lexicon that lists possible Pos-tags for words which were seen at the training phase.",
        "Naturally, when tagging real-word texts, one can expect to encounter words which were not seen at the training phase and hence not included into the lexicon.",
        "This is where word-Pos guessers take their place - they employ the analysis of word features, e.g. word leading and trailing characters to figure out its possible POS categories.",
        "Currently, most of the taggers are supplied with a word-guessing component for dealing with unknown words.",
        "The most popular guessing strategy is so-called \"ending guessing\" when a possible set of Pos-tags for a word is guessed solely on the basis of its trailing characters.",
        "An example of such guesser is the guesser supplied with the Xerox tagger (Kupiec, 1992).",
        "A similar approach was taken Rome of the research reported here was funded as part of EPsuc project IED4/1/5808 \"Integrated Language Database\".",
        "in (Weischedel et al., 1993) where an unknown word was guessed given the probabilities for an unknown word to be of a particular POs, its capitalisation feature and its ending.",
        "In (Brill, 1995) a system of rules which uses both ending-guessing and more morphologically motivated rules is described.",
        "Best of these methods were reported to achieve 82-85% of tagging accuracy on unknown words, e.g. (Brill, 1995; Weischedel et al., 1993).",
        "In (Mikheev, 1996) a cascading word-Pos guesser is described.",
        "It applies first morphological prefix and suffix guessing rules and then ending-guessing rules.",
        "This guesser is reported to achieve higher guessing accuracy than quoted before which in average was about by 8-9% better than that of the Xerox guesser and by 6-7% better than that of Brill's guesser, reaching 87-92% tagging accuracy on unknown words.",
        "There are two kinds of word-guessing rules employed by the cascading guesser: morphological rules and ending guessing rules.",
        "Morphological word-guessing rules describe how one word can be guessed given that another word is known.",
        "In English, as in many other languages, morphological word formation is realised by affixation: prefixation and suffixation, so there are two kinds of morphological rules: suffix rules (As) – rules which are applied to the tail of a word, and prefix rules (AP) -- rules which are applied to the beginning of a word.",
        "For example, the prefix rule:",
        "says that if segmenting the prefix \"un\" from an unknown word results in a word which is found in the lexicon as a past verb and participle (VBD VBN), we conclude that the unknown word is an adjective (JJ).",
        "This rule works, for instance, for words [developed --sundeveloped].",
        "An example of a suffix rule is: AS : [ed (NN VB) (JJ VBD VBN)] This rule says that if by stripping the suffix \"ed\" from an unknown word we produce a word with the Pos-class noun/verb (NN VB), the unknown word is of the class adjective/past-verb/participle (JJ VBD VBN).",
        "This rule works, for instance, for",
        "word pairs [hook -+booked], [water ->watered], etc.",
        "Unlike morphological guessing rules, ending-guessing rules do not require the main form of an unknown word to be listed in the lexicon.",
        "These rules guess a Pos-class for a word just on the basis of its ending characters and without looking up its stem in the lexicon.",

        "Unlike a morphological rule, this rule does not ask to check whether the substring preceeding the \"ing\"ending is a word with a particular ms-tag.",
        "Not surprisingly, morphological guessing rules are more accurate than ending-guessing rules but their lexical coverage is more restricted, i.e. they are able to cover less unknown words.",
        "Since they are more accurate, in the cascading guesser they were applied before the ending-guessing rules and improved the precision of the guessings by about 5%.",
        "This, actually, resulted in about 2% higher accuracy of tagging on unknown words.",
        "Although in general the performance of the cascading guesser was detected to be only 6% worse than a general-language lexicon lookup, one of the oversimplifications assumed at the extraction of the morphological rules was that they obey only simple concatenative regularities: book book-Fed; take -4take±n; play --play-Fing.",
        "No attempts were made to model non-concatenative cases which are quite common in English, as for instance: try --Aries; reducereducing; advise->advisable.",
        "So we thought that the incorporation of a set of guessing rules winch can capture morphological word dependencies with letter alterations should extend the lexical coverage of time morphological rules and hence might contribute to the overall guessing accuracy.",
        "In the rest of the paper first, we will briefly outline the unsupervised statistical learning technique proposed in (Mikheev, 1996), then we propose a modification which will allow for the incorporation of the learning of non-concatenative morphological rules, and finally, we will evaluate and assess the contribution of the non-concatenative suffix morphological rules to the overall tagging accuracy on unknown words using the cascading guesser."

        "is the Pos-class which is assigned to unknown words if the rule is satisfied.",
        "Here we extend this structure to handle cases of the mutation in the last n letters of the main word (words of I-class), as, for instance, in the case of try -*tries, when the letter \"y\" is changed to \"i\" before the suffix.",
        "To accommodate such alterations we included an additional mutation element (M) into the rule structure.",
        "This element keeps the segment to be added to the main word.",
        "So the application of a guessing rule can be described as:",
        "i.e. from an unknown word we strip the affix 8, add the mutative segment M, lookup the produced string in the lexicon and if it is of class I we conclude that the unknown word is of class R. For example: the suffix rule A8: [ S= ied I= (NN, V13) R= (JJ VBD VBN) M =y1 or hi short [led (NN VB) (JJ VBD VBN) says that if there is an unknown word which ends with \"ied\", we should strip this ending and append to time remaining part the string \"y\".",

        "Then it tries to segment an affix by subtracting the shorter word without the mutative ending from the longer word.",
        "If the subtraction results in an non-empty string it creates a morphological rule by storing the Pos-class of the shorter word as the I-class, the Pos-class of the longer word as the R-class and the segmented affix itself.",

        "The target of the research reported in this paper was to incorporate the learning of morphological word-pos guessing rules winch do not obey simple concatenations of main words with affixes into the learning paradigm proposed in (Mikheev, 1996).",
        "'lb do that we extended the data structures and the algorithms for the guessing-rule application to handle the mutations in the last n letters of the main words.",
        "Thus simple concatenative rules naturally became a subset of the mutative rules they can be seen as mutative rules with the zero mutation, i.e. when the M element of the rule is empty.",
        "Simple concatenative rules, however, are not necessarily regular morphological rules and quite often they capture other non-linear morphological dependencies.",
        "For instance, consonant doubling is naturally captured by the affixes themselves and obey simple concatenations, as, for example, describes the suffix rule As:",
        "This rule, for example, will work for word pairs like tag - tagging or dig - digging.",
        "Note that here we don't specify the prerequisites for the stem-word to have one syllable and end with the same consonant as in the beginning of the affix.",
        "Our task here is not to provide a precise morphological description of English but rather to support computationally effective ms-guessings, by employing sonic morphological information.",
        "So, instead of using a proper morphological processor, we adopted an engineering approach which is argued for in (Mikheev&Liubushkina, 1995).",
        "There is, of course, nothing wrong with morphological processors perse, but it is hardly feasible to retrain them fully automatically for new tag-sets or to induce new rules.",
        "Our shallow technique on the contrary allows to induce such rules completely automatically and ensure that these rules will have enough discriminative features for robust guessings.",
        "In fact, we abandoned the notion of morpheme and are dealing with word segments regardless of whether they are \"proper\" morphemes or not.",
        "So, for example, in the rule above \"ging\" is considered as a suffix which in principle is not right: the suffix is \"ing\" and \"g\" is the dubbed consonant.",
        "Clearly, such nuances are impossible to learn automatically without specially prepared training data, which is denied by the technique in use.",
        "On the other hand it is not clear that this fine-grained information will contribute to the task of morphological guessing.",
        "The simplicity of the proposed shallow morphology, however, ensures fully automatic acquisition of such rules and the empirical evaluation presented in section 2.3 confirmed that they are just right for the task: precision and recall of such rules were measured ill time range of 96-99%.",
        "The other aim of the research reported here was to assess whether non-concatenative morphological rules will improve the overall performance of the cascading guesser.",
        "As it was measured in (Mikheev, 1996) simple concatenative prefix and suffix morphological rules improved the overall precision of the cascading guesser by about 5%, which resulted in 2% higher accuracy of tagging on unknown words.",
        "The additional rule-set of suffix rules with one letter mutation caused some further improvement.",
        "The precision of the guessing increased by about 1% and the tagging accuracy on a very large set; of unknown words increased by about 1%.",
        "In conclusion we can say that although the ending-guessing rules, which are much simpler than morphological rules, can handle words with affixes longer than two characters almost equally well, in the framework of PDXtagging even a fraction of percent is an important improvement.",
        "Therefore the contribution of the morphological rules is valuable and necessary for the robust Pos-tagging of real-world texts."
