        "2) The distribution of usage of TO and REBA, and that of TARA and NARA are complementary to each other.",

        "From simple electrical appliances to complex computer systems, almost all machines are accompanied by instruction manuals.",
        "Since recently there are many machines whose operating procedures are complicated, we have much trouble in many cases including translating their manuals into other languages, maintaining consistency between the description in manuals and the actual behavior of the machines.",
        "To solve these problems, we have to have a computer assisted system for processing Japanese manual sentences, especially for understanding manual sentences.",
        "A large number of researchers have gotten to grip with the method of understanding some types of text including instruction manuals(Abe et al., 1988; Nomura, 1992; Eugenio, 1992).",
        "One of the most important matters of concern in these types of system is how we can fix ambiguities in semantic representations and fill underspecified parts of them.",
        "Generally speaking, almost all systems described above take the following scheme.",
        "Firstly, each sentence in' a text is translated into a semantic representation.",
        "In this process, the system uses only non-defeasible syntactic and semantic constraints.",
        "Most of pragmatic: information and commonsense knowledge are not used here, because the result of these knowledge would be overridden by some other information such as contextual information.",
        "Therefore the semantic representation would include some undetermined parts which would be fixed by other kind of information including context.",
        "This way of analysis is known as the Nondefeasibility Thesis(Karneyama, 1995).",
        "Secondly, all of undetermined parts of the semantic representation are filled or settled by some kind of inferences based on the domain knowledge.",
        "This type of method, which uses a large amount, of domain knowledge, seems to be dominant from the viewpoint of disambiguation.",
        "Moreover it scarcely depends on the language in use because the way of disambiguation is based on the inference with a certain knowledge base.",
        "On the other hand, in order to use this method, we have to prepare the amount of knowledge being large enough to cope with various type of described objects.",
        "Unfortunately, so far we have not had such a commonsense knowledge base.",
        "One of ways to get rid of this situation is to adopt some knowledge which hardly depends on some particular domain.",
        "As such a kind of knowledge, we pay our attention to pragmatic constraints, which have not been used sufficiently in the former methods.",
        "We expect that by prag-rnatic constraints the ambiguity in manual sentences would be resolved to some extent not in the process of inference but in the process of the translation of manual sentences into semantic representations.",
        "We do not commit ourselves to the domain specific; knowledge, but use some ontological knowledge in general manuals.",
        "For example, the correspondence of objects in the manual sentences to the objects in linguistic constraints, like the speaker, the hearer, and so on.",
        "Note that the ontology in this paper does not refer to all of objects in the world described by manuals, like a certain part of machine.",
        "Aiming at independence from the domain knowledge of objects, we adopt one of general ontologies which is applicable to almost all manuals.",
        "In short, our scheme consists of the following three parts: 1) a parser based on the non-defeasiblity thesis, 2) pragmatic constraints specific to linguistic expressions, and 3) the general ontology of the world described by manuals.",
        "In the rest of this paper, we will focus on the zero pronoun resolution.",
        "In Japanese, zero pronouns frequently make a sentence ambiguous.",
        "Zero pronouns are ellipsis of obligatory cases, which very frequently appear in Japanese sentences.",
        "Especially, subjects are omitted very often.",
        "It is called \"zero subject.\" In some sense, the resolution of zero pronouns' referents, especially the resolution of \"zero subject\", is the essential part of the knowledge extraction from Japanese manuals, because once referents of zero pronouns are identified, we can use various methods already been proposed to recognize the structure of sentence and to map it into the suitable knowledge representation.",
        "To capture pragmatic constraints, we have paid our attention to conditionals, which occur very frequently in instruction manuals.",
        "In this paper, we will show that in instruction manuals, the constraint of conditionals can be used to identify the referents of zero subjects.",
        "Although, of course, not all the zero pronouns can be solved with the constraints shown in the paper, our examination for a lot of manual sentences shows that the constraints work very effectively and accurately in sentences with conditionals.",
        "Now we have to define the term 'subject' we used in this paper.",
        "Generally, the term 'subject' denotes a nominative from the grantmatical point of view.",
        "In this paper, however, we will use the term SUBJECT to denote a main participant of the sentence.",
        "Roughly speaking, in the active voice, the SUBJECT is the nominative, on the other hand, in the passive voice, the SUBJECT is the nominative of the corresponding sentence in the active voice."
