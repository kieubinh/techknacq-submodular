        "In what follows, I assume a version of IIPSG that deviates from standard HPSG in that the surface string of a phrasal sign is not determined by a relation that relates the PITON values of a sign to the PITON values of its daughters (Pollard and Sag, 1987, p. 169).",
        "Instead I will follow Reape's (1994) approach.",
        "Reape assumes word order domains as an additional level of representation.",
        "In such a domain, all daughters of a head occur.",
        "These domains differ from the daughter list in that the elements in a domain (signs) correspond in their serialization to the surface order of the words in the string.",
        "LP-constraints apply to elements of the order domain.",
        "Another basic assumption of Reape is that constituents may be discontinuous.",
        "As Hinrichs and Nakazawa (1994a) have shown, it is reasonable to assume in addition to the head complement schema a schema that licenses the verbal complex.",
        "Hinrichs and Nakazawa introduced the concept of argument attraction into the HPSG framework.",
        "If a verbal complex is build two verbs are combined and the resulting sign inherits all arguments from both verbs.",
        "In their paper, Hinrichs and Nakazawa treat verbal complements as ordinary complements that are included in the COMPS list of their heads.",
        "It has however proven to be useful to distinguish the verbal complement from other complements (Rentier, 1994a; Muller, 1995a).",
        "The merits of this move will be discussed shortly.",
        "For the purpose of representing the information about verbal complements, the feature VCOMP is introduced.",

        "I will suggest a solution to the problem that is very simple: If it is the case that an embedded verb or verbal complex has to be LEx+ when verb and complement are combined locally and if it is the case that this does not hold if a nonlocal dependency is involved than the simplest solution is to view LEX not as a local feature.",
