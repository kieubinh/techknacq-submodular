        "The number of documents available on the network is increasing with the development of the computational infrastructure.",
        "Accordingly, information retrieval has become one of the most important research topics in natural language processing (NLP).",
        "In the digital network world, documents are usually distributed in either text file or image format, where the former is a sequence of character codes (e.g., ASCII) and the latter is a bitmap.",
        "Although only text files are machine-readable and convenient from the viewpoint of information retrieval, many documents are available as images alone.",
        "They are easily generated by scanning hard-copy documents which the real world is massively using.",
        "While most information retrieval systems have been designed for text files, there are some systems proposed for images.",
        "They convert images into text files using optical character recognition (OCR) to utilize existing NLP techniques.",
        "Even though state-of-the-art OCR creates noisy output with recognition errors (Rice, et al., 1995), prior work has shown that OCR output is satisfactory for retrieval purposes (Inner, et al., 1995; Mittendorf, et al., 1995; Myers and Mulgaonkar, 1995; Wenzel and Hoch, 1995).",
        "The inaccuracy of OCR can be largely mitigated.",
        "However, little attention has been paid to reducing the computational expense of OCR.",
        "OCR is a major bottleneck for information retrieval systems in terms of speed.",
        "For example, Myers and Mulgaonkar reported in their OCR-based information extraction system that the total processing time was dominated by character and word recognition processes (Myers and Mulgaonkar, 1995).",
        "This suggests an important question: \"how much NLP can be done without character recognition (Church, et a!., 1994)?\" As an alternative technique to OCR, there is word shape token processing which converts images into a shape-based representation.",
        "It recognizes coarse character shape classes (character shape codes) rather than character codes.",
        "Because the number of character shape codes is small and they are defined by simple graphical features, their recognition from images is inexpensive.",
        "Word shape token processing has been proven to be of use for European language identification (Nakayama and Spitz, 1993; Sibun and Spitz, 1994).",
        "Also, its feasibility for content characterization has been discussed with the use of controlled (noise-free) on-line data set (Nakayama, 1994; Nakayama 1995; Sibun and Farrar, 1994).",
        "However, no analysis has been done with real document images, which are usually degraded in quality.",
        "In addition, a comparative evaluation between the word shape token-based and the OCR-based approach is needed.",
        "We have developed a technique which automatically categorizes document images into predefined classes based on their content.",
        "It employs a vector space classifier drawn from many robust statistical techniques in information retrieval (see Salton, 1991).",
        "We show in this paper that our technique can categorize as accurately as the conventional OCR-based approach, while it can process much faster.",
        "In the next section, we describe the definition of character shape codes and word shape tokens, and their generation from document images.",
        "In section 3, we outline the automated categorization system which we developed.",
        "In section 4, with the use of a topic-tagged document image database, we show the word shape token-based approach is quite adequate for content-oriented categorization in comparison with a conventional OCR-based system.",
        "In section 5, we discuss the experimental results and future work.",
        "2 Character Shape Code and Word Shape Token A character shape code is a machine-readable code which represents a set of graphically similar characters.",
        "A word shape token is a sequence of one or more character shape codes which represents a word.",
        "Character shape codes are defined differently by the selection of graphical features.",
        "In this paper, we consider the number of connected components, vertical location, and deep concavity as graphical features to classify characters.",
        "First, we identify the positions of the text lines as shown in figure 1.",
        "Second, we identify the character cells, and count the number of connected components in each character cell.",
        "Third, we note their position with respect to the text lines.",
        "Finally, we identify the presence of a deep eastward/ southward concavity.",
        "In figure 1, vertical location classifies characters into three groups – {\"1\"} {\"g\"} {\"a\", \"n\", \"u\", \"e\"}; characters that occupy the space between the top and the baseline, characters that occupy the space between the x-height line and the bottom, and characters that occupy the space between the x-height line and the baseline, respectively.",
        "The last one is further classified by presence or absence of a deep eastward/southward concavity.",
        "Resultant groups are {\"a\", \"u\"} {\"e\"} {\"n\"}.",
        "The defined character classes and the members for the ASCII character set are shown in Table 1.",
        "Once classification has been performed, the resulting character shape codes are grouped by word boundary and used as word shape tokens for the downstream processing.",
        "Figure 2 gives an example of generated word shape token representation with its original document image."

        "The accuracy drop observed with the fifth generation photocopies was not due to the mapping ambiguity but was caused by recognition errors.",
        "Unlike OCR which attempts to correctly recognize each word using lexical information, word shape token generation is only faithful to the original image, Thus, it makes many errors with low quality images, whereas OCR indicates illegible characters.",

        "We feel the word shape token representation is sufficient for locating some suffixes with accuracy.",
        "For example, 1,651 words were with suffix \"-tion\" in the lexicon of 122,545 distinct word entries.",
        "We obtained a set of word shape tokens from them.",

        "Similarly, word shape tokens from all 8,077 words with suffix \"-ing\" mapped to only 20 words without the suffix2.",
        "Because all capital letters map to A (Table 1), it is difficult to identify words with only capital letters, which are sometimes important content-representing words (e.g., acronyms).",
