        "Recent advances in theoretical and practical aspects of feature and constraint-based formalisms for representing linguistic information have fostered research on the use of such formalisms in the design and implementation of computational lexicons (Briscoe et al., 1993).",
        "Case frame approach has been the representation of choice especially for languages with free constituent order, explicit case marking of noun phrases and embedded clauses filling nominal syntactic roles.",
        "The semantics of such syntactic role fillers are usually determined by their lexical, semantic and mor-phosyntactic properties, instead of position in the sentence.",
        "In this paper, we present an approach to building a constraint-based case frame lexicon for use in natural language processing in Turkish.",
        "A number of observations that we have made on Turkish have indicated that we have to go beyond the traditional transitive and intransitive distinction, and utilize a framework where verb valence is considered as the obligatory coexistence of an arbitrary subset of possible arguments along with the obligatory exclusion of certain others, relative to a verb sense.",
        "Additional morphosyntactic, lexical and semantic selectional constraints are utilized to map a given syntactic argument structure to a specific verb sense.",
        "In recent years, there have been several studies on constraint-based lexicons.",
        "Russell et al.",
        "(1993) propose an approach to multiple default inheritance for unification-based lexicon.",
        "In another study by Lascarides et al.",

        "In Turkish, (and possibly in many other languages) verbs often convey several meanings (some totally unrelated) when they are used with subjects, objects, oblique objects, adverbial adjuncts, with certain lexical, morphological, and semantic features, and co-occurrence restrictions.",
        "In addition to the usual sense variations due to selectional restrictions on verbal arguments, in most cases, the meaning conveyed by a case frame is idiomatic, with subtle constraints.",
        "For example, the Turkish verb ye (eat), when used with a direct object noun phrase whose head is:",
        "1. porn (money), with no case or possessive markings and a human subject, means to accept bribe, 2. porn (money), with a non-human subject, means to cost a lot, 3. porn (or any other NP whose head is ontologically IS-A money, e.g., dolar, mark, etc.)",
        "with obligatory accusative marking and optional possessive marking, means to spend money, 4. kafa (head) with obligatory accusative marking and no possessive marking, means to get mentally deranged, 5. hak (right) with optional accusative and possessive markings, means to be unfair,",
        "6. bas (head, cf. 4) (or any N1 whose head is ontologically IS-A human) with optional accusative and optional possessive marking (obligatory only with bas), means to waste or demote a person.",
        "On the other hand:",
        "1. if an ablative case-marked oblique object denoting an edible entity is present, then there should not be any direct object, and the verb means to eat a piece of (the edible (oblique) object), or 2. if the ablative case-marked oblique object does not denote something edible, but rather a container, then the sense maps to to eat out of, with the optional direct (edible) object denoting the object eaten.",
        "Clearly such usage has impact on thematic role assignments to various role fillers, and even on the syntactic behavior of the verb in question (Briscoe and Carroll, 1994).",
        "For instance, for the third and fourth cases above where the object has to be obligatorily case-marked accusative, a passive form would not be grammatical for the sense conveyed , although syntactically ye (eat) is a transitive verb.",
        "Sonic-Alines verbs require different combinations of arguments, or explicitly require that, certain arguments not be present.",
        "For instance, the verb sas requires different kinds of arguments depending on the sense, obligatorily excluding other arguments: I. an ablative case-marked oblique object and with no other object in the case frame sus means to deviate from,",
        "2. a dative case-marked oblique object and with no other object, sas means to be surprised at, 3. an accusative case-marked direct object with no other object, vis means to be confused about.",
        "As a final example, when the verb tut (catch/bold) is used with an obligatory drd person singular agreement and active voice, and the subject is a (nominalized) S with a verb form of future participle, then the sense conveyed by the top level case frame is to feel like doing the predication indicated by the subject S's case frame, with the agent being the subject of this embedded clause.",
        "As illustrated in these examples, verb sense idiomatic usage resolution has to be dealt with in a principled way and not by pattern matching (e.g., as in Tschichold (1995)), when the language has a free word order, where pattern matching approaches could fail.",
        "In this paper, we present a unification-based approach to a constraint-based case frame lexicon, in which one single mechanism deals with both problems uniformly.",
        "The essential function of our lexicon is to map bidirectionally between a case frame containing information that is syntactic, and a semantic frame which captures the predication denoted by the case frame along with information about who fills what, thematic role in that predication."
