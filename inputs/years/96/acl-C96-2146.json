        "ALT-J/E can translate several special Japanese constructions such as predicate idioms and function verb expressions (Oku, 1992).",

        "Therefore, they include almost of all linguistic phenomena that the systems have to process.",
        "In the standards, the double-subject construction is listed as one of the constructions that are difficult to process successfully.",
        "Many Japanese philologists have studied the double-subject construction because it is necessary to reveal the syntactic or semantic structure of this construction if we are to establish a syntactic or semantic theory for the Japanese language (ishigatni, 1977) (Kuno, 1973) (Mikami, 1960).",
        "However, there arc a few studies for processing this construction from the point of view of computational linguistics or engineering (Murata, 1990).",
