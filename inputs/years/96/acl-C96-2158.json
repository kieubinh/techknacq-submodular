        "It is by now widely agreed upon that the process of resolving anaphors in natural language text is supported by a variety of strategies employing different kinds of knowledge.",
        "The process of determining the set of possible antecedents is governed by morphosyntactic, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic restrictions.",
        "The same holds for preferences applied in the antecedent selection process: simple surface criteria are involved as well as more elaborate syntactic, semantic, or focusing heuristics.",
        "As a consequence, recent approaches to anaphor resolution apply a carefully selected blend of constraints arid preferences, thus constituting multi-strategy approaches ill the sense of Carbonell and Brown (Carbonell and Brown, 1988).",
        "There are, however, implementability limitations.",
        "At discourse level, determining the set of admissible antecedents requires a representation which is ordered according to pragmatic relations (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Webber, 1989).",
        "Although various theoretical frameworks have been suggested, the recognition of these relations in the case of unrestricted discourse is still beyond the state-of-the-art.",
        "Moreover, there are cases in which antecedent decisions can only be made on the grounds of domain knowledge and inferencing, and although there have been various attempts to integrate components of these kinds into anaphor resolution approaches, a satisfying solution to this problem is not available by now.",
        "As a consequence, current; anaphor resolution implementations rely on constraints and preference heuristics which employ information originating from morphosyntactic, syntactic, or shallow semantic analysis (cf. (Carter, 1987)).",
        "These approaches, however, perform remarkably well.",
        "An early case study revealed that a 'naive' algorithm for resolving nonreflexive pronouns, by relying merely on rnorphosyntactic, syntactic, and surface criteria, yields correct results for more than 80 percent of pronoun occurrences, arid that the incorporation of selectional constraints results in a gain of another 3.5 percent of accuracy (Hobbs, 1978).",
        "These results have been confirmed by recent work (Lappin and Leass, 1994).",
        "The latter approach is based on a more elaborate, theory-oriented, declarative formulation of the syntactic constraints, and handles reflexive pronouns too.",
        "It proved that the incorporation of statistically measured lexical preference patterns (a dynamic, domain specific substitute for the static encoding of selectional preferences) yields a gain of only 3 per cent, and a sole application of lexical preference patterns resulted in a performance below 35 per cent.",
        "Hence, there is strong evidence that syntactic restrictions in combination with surface based and syntactic preference criteria play the central role in realistic approaches to anaphor resolution.",
        "In this paper, an anaphor resolution algorithm is described which has been implemented as part of the KONTEXT text analysis system for the German language (Haenelt, 1994).",
        "The emphasis lies on the description of implementation techniques for syntactic constraints.",
        "Section 2 works out; strategies which are applied, focusing on the",
        "theoretical background from which the syntactic constraints emerge.",
        "Section 3 describes how these strategies are coined into an algorithm for the resolution of reflexives, nonreflexive pronouns, and definite common nouns, thereby elucidating details which have to be taken into account in an adequate implementation.",
        "In section 4, a theoretical evaluation is performed, and application results are given.",
        "Section 5 points out that the structural constraints may depend on circumstances which are not a matter of syntax alone, but rather necessitate semantic and pragmatic inferencing.",
        "As a consequence, limitations concerning the implementability show up, and the scope of syntactic constraints proves to be restricted."
