        "The determination of the contextual appropriateness of a reading of a lexically ambiguous sentence is commonly called lexical disambiguation.",
        "Lexical disambiguation presents a particular problem for any sort of natural language processing, but especially for machine translation, since the semantic grids of the source and the target may diverge in such a way that one has to disambiguate in cases where it is ,not required for applications of the source alone.'",
        "Resolving lexical ambiguities is a problematic task, since it involves different sources of linguistic and nonlinguistic information: information about the context of a sentence in a discourse, about the meanings of the words and about the world.",
        "'For the translation from German to English e.g. it is necessary to disambiguate 'Mir' (clock/watch), but not for knowledge retrieval or other natural language processing tasks based on German alone.",
        "Approaches to model the lexical disambiguation process formally differ as to the degree to which they consider the information of the various sources needed to disambiguate properly.",
        "We can distinguish two classes of approaches: \"surface-oriented\" approaches and \"inference-based\" approaches.",
        "Surface-oriented approaches rely on selectional restrictions (cf. e.g. McCord 1989) (sometimes supplied by an external type hierar-chy/ontology (e.g. Nirenburg 1989) or are statistical (e.g. Kameyama, Peters, and Schiitze 1993).",
        "Although quite useful for some purposes, the performance of surface-oriented approaches is inherently limited in that their context sensitivity is always locally bounded (see e.g. Kay, Gawron, and Norvig 1994 for details).",
        "Since we cannot assume fixed finite context boundaries within each lexical ambiguity can be locally resolved, inference-based approaches seem more promising for handling lexical disambiguation.",
        "Inference-based approaches assume that the language of a logic is used to represent the meaning of a discourse, that the same language is used to store our conceptual and world knowledge and that resolution is achieved on the basis of the underlying logic by special inferences.",
        "The most prominent inference pattern (which is also the center of the discussion here) is e.g. the proof of a contradiction from a given reading in a given context and our conceptual and world knowledge which allows us to rule out that reading.",
        "Although these approaches can handle the problem of disambiguating information arbitrarily far away (the whole context is available as a premise), without any further restrictions they run into tractability problems which exclude a practical application.",
        "Since we need as we will show below a representation language which is at least as expressive as the language of first-order predicate logic for an adequate representation of discourse meanings, an inconsistency test is not computable anymore if a classical (sound and as far as possible complete) calculus is used for the test: the underlying problem is simply undecidable.",
        "Although it may turn out that the disambiguation problem is in fact undecidable if world knowl980 edge is also used for disambiguating inferences, we assume, that resolution restricted to conceptual knowledge constitutes an important subproblem from a cognitive point of view, which is solvable in contrast to the general problem.",
        "That all known approaches winch are confined to conceptual knowledge nevertheless run into problems is due to an empirically false estimation: they do not take into account that humans are able to disambiguate even without a full understanding of the discourse.'",
        "Lexical disambiguation works even very well in most of those cases where the discourse is inconsistent or its consistency is not known, and the inconsistency test would either fail or not necessarily terminate.",
        "Thus, the kind of reasoning which is involved in lexical disambiguation has to be essentially incomplete.",
        "Since our conceptual knowledge, on the other hand, can be represented in a rather restricted representation language, it is possible to restrict; inferencing in an empirically adequate way which ensures decidability of the problem although a fully expressive language is used to represent discourse."

        "If the underlying logic of a resolver is known to be undecidable (e.g. the inference machine used in LILOG (Bollinger, Lorenz, and Pletat 1991)) the only chance to ensure termination is by stopping the computation after a limited amount of resources (inference length, computation time, etc.)",
        "is consumed.",
        "Since the termination behavior of such a system is without any further empirical evidence not in any way correlated with our cognitive capabilities and without any further formal evidence not in any way correlated with the behavior which we would expect if the disambiguation problem were nevertheless decidable, we have to rule out these approaches from a scientific point of view.",
        "The second class of approaches achieves tractability by restricted representation languages.",
        "These restrictions allow one to base retrieval on a tractable logic which is sound and complete.",
        "In order to support the distinction between terminological and assertional knowledge, most formalisms of this class provide two different (restricted) representation languages: the terminological language and the assertional language.",

        "Example (10) is, of course, just beyond the border of the permitted expressions, since it is in principle expressible but riot allowed, and much more problematic (e.g. for 'donkey' sentences) is certainly the fact that variables are not explicitly available in these representation languages.",
        "But it should indicate the lack in expressive power at least inasmuch as it is possible without a more general formal proof (which we cannot give here for lack of space).",
        "Since the correct disambiguating inferences cannot be performed anymore if the truth conditions of a discourse are boiled down in a way that allows to represent it (somehow) in such a restricted assertional language, approaches which model lexical disambiguation on the basis of these knowledge representation formalisms must fail.",
        "Since an extension of the expressive power of the assertional languages would lead immediately to our original tractability problem, we have to give up the implicit assumption that lexical disambiguation presupposes the consistency of the discourse, if we don't want to give up lexical disambiguation at all.",
