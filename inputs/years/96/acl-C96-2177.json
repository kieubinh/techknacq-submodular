        "The notion of MAT comprises approaches where - in contrast to MT - the human user keeps the initiative in translation.",
        "MAT ranges between intelligent text editors and workbenches aiming at user modelling and partial MT.",
        "A principal problem, however, is the support of domain knowledge since it affects the quality of the translated text.",
        "Moreover, the time spent for domain familiarization is estimated as 30-40% of the total translation time (KiWi90).",
        "This paper discusses an innovative approach to knowledge based MAT: a KB is systematically integrated in a framework providing linguistic as well as domain knowledge support.",
        "Linguistic support is assured by relevant resources: grammatical and lexical data.",
        "Domain explanations are generated from a KB of Conceptual Graphs (CGs) (Sow84).",
        "The system interface offers a standard dialog: while translating, the user highlights words/texts, chooses queries from menus and receives NL answers from where new requests can be started.",
        "The results reported here were achieved in the joint German-Bulgarian project DB-MAT2 (vHa91, vHAn94).",
        "Depending on the viewpoint, DB-MAT can be compared to various approaches and/or systems: (i) encoding of term's meaning: - to lexicons and termbanks (see 2.1) and knowledge based termbanks (see 2.2);",
        "(ii) generation of explanations allowing follow-up questions and clarifications - e.g. IDAS (see 2.3); (iii) NL generation from CGs (Bon96, AnBo96).",
        "Below we present related approaches and the DB-MAT paradigm.",
        "Our opinion about the costs and benefits of the knowledge based MAT is clearly stated."

        "Concept-oriented termbanks support a hierarchical skeleton of underlying concepts and thus the knowledge can be treated formally during its construction, use and updating.",
