        "However, these methods require many translation examples to realize a practical and high quality translation.",
        "The goal of our research is to design a computer system with the same capability of language and knowledge acquisition as human beings (Araki and Momouchi, 1994; Araki et al., 1995).",
        "In this paper, we propose a method of machine translation using inductive learning with genetic algorithms.",
        "The genetic algorithms (Goldberg, 1989) imitate the evolutionary process which repeats generational replacement to adapt to the environment.",
        "The purposes are to establish various high quality translation rules from only a small amount of data, and produce high quality translation results.",
        "The system is expected to continuously evolve to higher learning and translation capability.",
        "In this paper, we describe a method of machine translation using inductive learning with genetic algorithms, and show through the results of evaluation experiments that genetic algorithms are effective for the example-based machine translation."
