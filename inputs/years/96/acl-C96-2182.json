        "to compounds (on-line dictionary).",
        "While certain MWLs only occur in exactly one form, e.g. out of the blue or G:um Haaresbreite (`by a hair's breadth', lit.",
        "by hair's breadth), and can thus be easily recognised with simple pattern matching techniques, it is well-known (see e.g.",
        "Gross 1982, Brundage et al.",
        "1992, Nunberg et al.",
        "1994) that most MWLs cannot be treated like completely fixed patterns, since they may undergo some variation.",
        "However, only a subset of 'Part of this work was funded under LRE 62-080 by the EEC.",
        "the variations allowed by general rules is valid: outside that subset, the expression loses its special, idiomatic meaning, either reverting to its literal meaning or losing any significance altogether.",
        "In certain cases, MWLs can even contradict normal syntactic rules, as with by and large, or G:von Haus aus (`originally', lit.",
        "from house out), where general rules would require an article between the preposition and the noun.",
        "The identification of MWLs is essential for any natural language processing based on lexical information, ranging from intelligent dictionary lookup over concordancing or indexing to machine translation.",
        "Therefore, the restricted lexical and syntactic variability of MWLs and their idiosyncratic peculiarities need to be expressed in the computational lexicon in order to be able to recognize the full range of their occurrences.",
        "We propose to use local grammars for this, written as a special type of regular expressions (REs) in the finite-state formalism IDAREX which makes use of a two-level morphological lexicon.",

        "NLP treatments of MWLs in so-called high level grammar formalisms have for example been proposed in Abeille and Schabes (1989) in the framework of lexicalised TAGs, Erbach (1992) and Copestake (1994) in HPSG, Van der Linden (1993) in CG.",
        "These approaches to our knowledge cannot satisfactorily represent lexical variants, nor the restricted flexibility and modifiability of MWLs.",
        "Instead of using a high – level grammar formalism we describe ,MWLs with finite – state local grammars.",
        "Although finite – state techniques are known to be unable to represent all the dependencies found in natural language, they have the advantage of allowing a very efficient treatment of a great number of phenomena and the implementation of robust, large – scale NLP systems.",
        "However, the use of these techniques is usually hampered by the unwieldiness in notation that these techniques usually lead to.",
        "The presented approach overcomes this problem: instead of having to specify local grammars directly as finite state networks or as graphs (e.g. Maurel 1993, Roche 1993, and Silberztein 1993), IDAREX REs provide a convenient way to mix inflected and uninflected word forms, morphological features and complete word classes, thus greatly relieving lexicographers from the burden of explicitly listing all the possible forms.",
        "Furthermore, our formalism allows the use of a bigger set of operators such as contains ($) , not ( – ) , and (&), etc.",
        "This provides us with the possibility to express certain things in a very compact way.",
        "For example, in the definition of German verbs we exclude contracted forms of verbs and the pronoun es such as geht's (it goes') , we simply state \"any expression with the morphological feature +V, followed by anything that must not contain a letter (i.e. additional morphological features), and which does not contain the feature +es in any position\" define V %A-V \"$Letter & \"$%-Fes With macros, generalizations about patterns that can occur for a whole class of MWLs can be expressed.",
        "This compactness and flexibility are, as far as we know, specific to our approach.",
        "Encoding the local grammars as REs instead of encoding them directly as networks does of course not change the expressive power of the formalism, but it conveniently abstracts the handling of MWLs from the graph manipulation level, allowing to develop and employ devices that operate on string representations and map them to the underlying finite state networks.",
        "As we have shown above, this simplifies considerably the description of the different patterns of variation occuring in MWLs.",
        "Once the MWLs listed in the dictionary have been manually changed into their canonical base form, including possible lexical variants and modifiers and indicating morphologically flexible components and the scope of alternative components, the IDAREX REs describing all possible contexts in which the MWLs can occur can be produced automatically.",
        "For instance, the canonical forms for the examples from section 2 can be specified"
