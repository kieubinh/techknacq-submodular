        "Th.ese systems stand to gain from methods that preprocess such sentences so as to make them simpler.",
        "Consider, for example, the following sentence: (1) The embattled Major government survived a crucial vole on coal pits closure as its last-minute concessions curbed the extent of Tory revolt over an issue that generated unusual heat in the House of Commons and brought the miners to London streets.",
        "Such sentences are not uncommon in newswire texts.",

        "9, Julm, Bombay 400 049, India Tory revolt over the coal-mine issue.",
        "This issue generated unusual heal in the House of Commons.",
        "It also brought the miners to London streets.",
        "11 complex text can be made simpler, sentences become easier to process, both for programs and humans.",
        "We discuss a simplification process which identifies components of a sentence that may be separated out, and transforms each of these into free-standing simpler sentences.",
        "Clearly, sonic nuances of meaning from the original text may be lost in the simplification process.",
        "Simplification is therefore inappropriate for texts (such as legal documents) where it is important not to lose any nuance.",
        "However, one can conceive of several areas of natural language processing where such simplification would be of great use.",
        "This is especially true in domains such as machine translation, which commonly have a manual post-processing stage, where semantic and pragmatic repairs may be carried out if necessary.",
        "• Parsing: Syntactically complex sentences are likely to generate a large number of parses, and may cause parsers to fail altogether.",
        "'Resolving ambiguities in attachment of constituents is non-trivial.",
        "This ambiguity is reduced for simpler sentences since they involve fewer constituents.",
        "Thus simpler sentences lead to faster parsing and less parse ambiguity.",
        "Once the parses for the simpler sentences are obtained, the subparses can be assembled to form a full parse, or left as is, depending on the application.",
        "• Machine Translation (MT): As in the parsing case, simplification results in simpler sentential structures and reduced ambiguity.",
        "As argued in (Chandrasekar, 1.994), this could lead to improvements in the quality of machine translation.",
        "• Information Retrieval: lit systems usually retrieve large segments of texts of which only a part may be relevant.",
        "With simplified texts, it is possible to extract specific phrases or simple sentences of relevance in response to queries.",
        "• Summarization: With the overload of information that people face today, it would be very helpful to have text summarization tools that reduce large bodies of text to the salient minimum.",
        "Simplification can be used to weed out irrelevant text with greater precision, and thus aid in summarization.",
        "• Clarity of Text: Assembly/use/maintenance manuals must be clear and simple to follow.",
        "Aircraft companies use a Simplified English for maintenance manuals precisely for this reason (Wojcik et al., 1993).",
        "However, it is not easy to create text in such an artificially constrained language.",
        "Automatic (or semi-automatic) simplification could be used to ensure that texts adhere to standards.",
        "We view simplification as a two stage process.",
        "The first stage provides a structural representation for a sentence on which the second stage applies a sequence of rules to identify and extract the components that can be simplified.",
        "One could use a parser to obtain the complete structure of the sentence.",
        "If all the constituents of the sentence along with the dependency relations are given, simplification is straightforward.",
        "However, full parsing is slow and prone to failure, especially on complex sentences.",
        "To overcome the limitations of full parsers, researchers have adopted FSG based approaches to parsing (Abney, 1994; Hobbs et al., 1992; Grishman, 1995).",
        "These parsers are fast and reasonably robust; they produce sequences of noun and verb groups without any hierarchical structure.",

        "An alternative approach which is both fast and yields hierarchical structure is discussed in Section 4.",
