        "These constraints are illustrated in the source language corpora to be submitted to machine translation.",

        "These needs are illustrated in a human attested translation of the chosen source corpora.",

        "Both document writers and users are supposed to be familiar with this specification.",
        "As such, the ATA 100 specification defines the document production and use environment.",
        "In particular, the specification imposes a very strict way of structuring the text in terms of topical and discursive organisation, and also in terms of practical document production by providing a dedicated SGML DTD for the maintenance manuals (ATA 100 DTD).",
        "The relevance of ATA 100 in the writing and exploiting process of the document encouraged us to consider the corpus from a quite new point of view in the NLP domain: the pragmatic approach.",
        "The ATA 100 specification can indeed be considered as a sociolectal system or standard (i.e. a system that rules the communicative usage inside a restrained community of persons).",

        "The pragmatic study of the corpus resulted in the definition of 4 types of labels: the meta-textual indicators, the topical meta-utterances, the discursive meta-utterances and the illocutionary typed utterances (orders, definitions, etc.).",

        "Being enriched by pragmatic and morpho-syntactic annotations, it considerably helps the evaluator to clearly identify the phenomena well or badly handled by a machine translation system.",
        "Indeed, using the annotations, the evaluator can easily link the mistakes of a machine translation system with the concerned linguistic units.",
        "The presence of a reference annotated translation is also of great help for keeping the evaluator as impartial as possible (even if a reference human translation may not always be the best one).",
        "This is particularly true when dealing with terminology.",
        "Finally, using SGML for the building of the test set file allows one to perform targeted evaluations by giving extraction criteria such as the morpho-syntactic schemes or even the pragmatic labels: an evaluator can decide to select all the test units including the pragmatic METNORM label in order to carry out a specific evaluation of the MT system performances when translating the task and subtask titles of the Super Puma helicopter maintenance manual.",
        "As stated above, our initial aim in this corpora study was the building of a corpus-based annotated test set, to be used for the evaluation of MT systems.",
        "The results nevertheless seem interesting for some other purposes.",
        "Firstly, these results are potential contributions to the specification of dedicated NLP systems.",
        "In particular they allow one to suggest heuristics for the processing of linguistic phenomena which, in general, are known to be complex problems for NLP.",
        "One example, in the case of MT, is the translation of French determiners into English.",
        "Another example, in the case of automatic analysis, is the resolution of anaphora: more than 80% of the pronouns in our corpus refer to the object complement of the last sentence.",
        "On the long run, future MT systems could take advantage of the pragmatic information contained in the SGML tags of the source text, to drive both the analysis and the transfer phases.",
        "For example, a verbal form in the infinitive, when occurring in a procedural part of French text (identified as such via SGML tags) would be analysed as a sequence with injunctive value, and translated into English by a verbal form in the imperative.",
        "When occurring in a tittle, a similar infinitive verbal form could be translated by an \"ing\" verbal form."
