        "This paper elaborates on the design of a machine translation evaluation method that aims to determine to what degree the meaning of an original text is preserved in translation, without looking into the grammatical correctness of its constituent sentences.",
        "The basic idea is to have a human evaluator take the sentences of the translated text and, for each of these sentences, determine the semantic relationship that exists between it and the sentence immediately preceding it.",
        "In order to minimise evaluator dependence, relations between sentences are expressed in terms of the conjuncts that can connect them, rather than through explicit categories.",
        "For an n-sentence text this results in a list of n – 1 sentence-to-sentence relationships, which we call the text's connectivity profile.",
        "This can then be compared to the connectivity profile of the original text, and the degree of correspondence between the two would be a measure for the quality of the translation.",
        "A set of \"essential\" conjuncts was extracted for English and Japanese, and a computer interface was designed to support the task of inserting the most fitting conjuncts between sentence pairs.",
        "With these in place, several sets of experiments were performed."

        "Evaluation of MT results is generally tackled on a very detailed, linguistic-technical level.",
        "Typically, a test set of sentences is prepared each of which is carefully designed to ascertain whether the MT system can handle a certain grammatical phenomenon - e.g. (Isahara, 1995).",
        "methods may concentrate on word choice, consistency in terminology, PP attachment, dependency relations, or other specific grammatical or lexical aspects.",
        "While such evaluation methods are certainly necessary and useful for the MT developer, they do not necessarily give us a reliable indication of user satisfaction.",
        "Especially now that MT systems are becoming widely available on the home user market and coming within the casual user's reach, MT developers need to pay more attention to this aspect.",
        "Casual users might just not care all that much about grammatical correctness: as long as they can understand the output, they might be satisfied with the system.",
        "Moreover, such users are not likely to judge the system on a sentence-by-sentence basis: rather, they will be interested in the understandability of the text as a whole.",
        "The flurry of integrated WWW-browsers cum MT systems' to hit the (Japanese) market recently has added to the plausibility of this scenario.",
        "We conclude then that an MT evaluation method is called for which concentrates on whole texts rather than on single sentences, and which judges meaning and readability rather than grammar.",
        "In addition, we specify that evaluation results should be reproducible and evaluator-independent (to a reasonable degree at least), and quantifiable.",
        "These additional requirements are necessary to ensure that results obtained at different times and/or by different evaluators (preferably using different texts) are comparable.",
        "In (Su et al., 1992) an interesting alternative evaluation method is proposed, in which the discrepancy is measured between raw MT output and the post-edited result.",
        "This method does work on whole texts, and could conceivably be adapted to judge meaning and readability (by adequately instructing the post-editors); then again in \"browsing\" applications post-editing is not the norm, and it may be difficult to attain a good approximation of \"browsable\" MT output.",
        "In this paper, we try a different approach.",
        "'These allow you to read English WWW-pages in Japanese, preserving the original page layout."

      "text": [
        "To test whether the meaning of a translated text has come across, one could simply ask the evaluators questions about the translated text, or have them summarise it.",
        "Such methods however are either costly (for each new text a new set of questions will have to be devised) or hard to quantify objectively, or even both.",
        "The method we will adopt involves constructing a profile of both the original and the translated text in terms of some salient semantic or pragmatic property of its constituent sentences.",
        "These profiles can then be compared to give an indication of translation quality: if we assume that the original text's profile is \"perfect\", then the degree to which the profile of the translated text resembles the perfect profile will correspond (in theory at least) to the quality of the translation.",
        "This approach assumes that the number and order of sentences are invariant in translation; luckily, for MT systems, this is almost always true.",
        "As for the salient property to be used in the profile, we settled on meaning relations of single sentences with previous text: this property seemed to us to be both fairly discriminating and implementable.",
        "In summary, a profile will be an ordered list of meaning relations xi, i 2 ... n which describe the relation of sentence i with what came before.",
        "Moreover, the target of each relation is taken to be the previous sentence, i.e. sentence i-1 (see § 4 for further discussion)."

        "A set of sentence-to-sentence relation categories will then have to be designed and defined; but the wide variety of proposed methods and solutions (see (Hovy and Maier, 1993) for an overview) suggests that this is not an easy task.",
        "Indeed, the problem with categories and definitions is that the evaluator will always have to depend to a certain extent on his own personal understanding of these definitions; and the more categories there are, the greater the chance that their definitions will not always be clear and fixed in his mind.",
        "This naturally has a deleterious effect on the reliability and universality of evaluation results.",
        "We will get back to the design problem later, but with respect to the definition problem, our solution was to simply hide the definitions.",
        "We have sought to accomplish this by instructing the evaluator to link sentences linguistically; more specifically, we have opted to instruct the evaluator to choose a conjunct2 to be inserted between every pair of consecutive sentences.",
        "The conjuncts 2A subclass of the adverbs, cf. (Quirk et al., 1985) pg.",
        "631-.",
        "For languages that do not recognise this class, surrogates can be concocted: for Japanese, a mixture of conjunctions and conjoining adverbs.",
        "themselves may be divided into categories, but these can remain hidden from the evaluator.",

        "We also assume that the assignment of acceptable conjuncts is reader-independent to a large degree.",
        "We assume that conjuncts (which form a closed class) can be divided into a limited number of categories that are meaningful in terms of expressing the semantic relationship between sentences.",
        "Yet another assumption is that the meaning relationships between sentences of a text combine to form a characteristic feature (a profile) of that text, and that this profile needs to be preserved in translation.",
        "Moreover, the ease with which this profile can be discerned in the translated text is assumed to be related to the readability or understandability of the text as a whole."
