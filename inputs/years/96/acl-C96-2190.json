        "The resolution of prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity is a difficult problem in NLP.",

        "Traditional proposals are mainly based on knowledge-based techniques which heavily depend on empirical knowledge encoded in handcrafted rules and domain knowledge in knowledge base: they are therefore not scalable.",
        "Recent work has turned to corpus-based or statistical approaches (e.g. Hindle and Rooth 1993; Ratnaparkhi, Rey-nar and Roukos 1994, Brill and Resnik 1994, Collins and Brooks 1995).",
        "Unlike traditional proposals, corpus-based approaches need not to prepare a large amount of handcrafted rules, they have therefore the merit of being scalable or easy to transfer to new domains.",
        "However, corpus-based approaches stiffer from the notorious sparse-data problem: estimations based on low occurrence frequencies are very unreliable and often result in bad performances in disambiguation.",
        "To cope with this problem, Brill and Resnik (1994) use word classes from Word-Net noun hierarchy to cluster words into semantic classes.",
        "Collins and Brooks (1995) on the other hand use morphological analysis both on test and training data.",
        "Unfortunately, all these smoothing methods are not efficient enough to make a significant improvement on performance.",
        "Instead of using pure statistical approaches stated above, we propose a hybrid approach to attack PP attachment problem.",
        "We employ corpus-based likelihood analysis to choose most-likely attachment.",
        "Where the occurrence frequency is too low to make a reliable choice, we turn to use conceptual information from a machine-readable dictionary to to make decision on PP attachments.",
        "We use this disambiguation method to build a disambiguation module in PFTE system.1 In what follows we first outline the idea of using hybrid information to supply preferences for resolving ambiguous PP attachment.",
        "We then describe how this information is used in disambiguating PP attachment.",
        "We put the hybrid approach in an disambiguation algorithm.",
