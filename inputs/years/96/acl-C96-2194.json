        "One of the important requirements for developing practical natural language processing system is a morphological analyzer that can automatically assign the correct POS (part-of-speech) tagging to the correct word with time and space efficiency.",
        "For non-separated languages such as Japanese, Korea, Chinese and Thai, the more task in morphological analyzer is needed, i.e, segmenting an input sentence into the right words (Nobesawa et.al, 1994; Seung-Shik Kang et.al, 1994).",
        "However, there is another problematic aspect, called implicit spelling error, that should be solved in morphological processing level.",
        "The implicit spelling errors are spelling errors which make the other right meaningful wordsâ€ž This work attempts to provide a robust morphological analyzer by using a gradual refinement module for weeding out the many possible alternatives and/or the erroneous chains of words caused by those three non-trivial problems: word boundary ambiguity, POS tagging ambiguity and implicit spelling error.",
        "Many researchers have used a corpus based approach to POS tagging such as trigram model (Charniak, 1993); feature structure tagger (Kemp,1994), to word segmentation, such as D-bigram (Nobesawa et.al, 1994), to both POS tagging and word segmentation (Nagata, 1994) and to spelling error detection as well as correction (Araki et.al, 1994; Kawtrakul, et.al, 1995(b)).",
        "Eventhough a corpus based approach exhibits seemingly high average accuracy, it requires a large amount of training data and validation.",

        "Instead of using a corpus based approach, a new simple hybrid technique which incorporates heuristic, syntactic and semantic knowledge is proposed to Thai morphological analyzer.",

        "To implement this technique, a three-stage approach is adopted to the gradual refinement module : preference based pruning, syntactic based pruning and semantic based pruning.",

        "Our preliminary experiment shows that the proposed model can work with a time-efficiency and increase the accuracy of word boundary and tagging disambiguation as well as the implicit spelling error correction.",
