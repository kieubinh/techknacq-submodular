        "Predicative forms are complex to describe; it is indeed necessary to describe in detail their syntactic behavior, the different meanings they may convey, preferably at different levels of granularity (e.g. argument structure, thematic grids, conceptual representations (Jackendoff 90)), and the relations between syntactic forms and meaning(s) (Levin 93), (Williams 94).",
        "It is also important to hierarchically organize these predicative forms so that syntactic and semantic descriptions are minimal and coherent.",
        "Our work focusses on verbs and is primarily based on B. Levin's work (Levin 93) for English, where she shows that the syntactic behavior of verbs is in a large part predictable from some aspects of their semantics.",
        "By syntactic behavior, she means the way arguments are syntactically realized with respect to the predicate.",
        "This includes the description of the basic distribution of the arguments, the description of the other positions they may occupy (e.g. ergative and passive forms) and when they can be conjoined or deleted.",
        "These descriptions are called alternations.",
        "This work results in the creation of organized verb semantic classes, mainly based on their syntactic behavior (alternations may also include specific semantic restrictions).",
        "It is an extremely useful and detailed study of the syntactico-semantic relations between a predicate and its arguments.",
        "We show here how the alternation system can be reformulated in a more NLP-oriented way, and develop for French a set of syntactic descriptions, called contexts, which share many similarities with alternations, and propose principles that help defining their form and contents.",
        "Next, we show how verb semantic classes can be constructed in a systematic way and evaluate them w.r.t.",
        "WordNet-like classifications.",
        "The implicit semantic conveyed by contexts is also analysed.",
        "The work presented here is applied to French, but can be transposed to other languages."

        "We have reformulated Beth Levin's notion of alternation into a more declarative one: the notion of context.",
        "A context is a frame where the category and some additional syntactic is used to describe a precise form and position the arguments of a verb may have in a sentence.",
        "Verb classes are then formed from verbs having similar sets of contexts.",
        "Very briefly, compared to the alternation system, our approach avoids having to define a basic form from which alternations are produced and to have to explain what is the relation between a basic and an alternated form.",
        "Moreover, it avoids us to have to account for changes in meaning provo-qued by alternations (e.g. by the adjunction of a preposition).",
        "Defining contexts has led us to formulate a few principles:",
        "• contexts should be of general purpose, this means that: exceptional forms should be avoided, only non-ambiguous and easy-to-use forms are acceptable, and theory-neutral descriptions should be used.",
        "• contexts should minimally overlapp, • they roust only describe lexical properties; the scope of a context is usually a proposition • as less semantic data as possible should be used, otherwise the classification will also be based on semantic criteria, 1 1 2 7 • the exact level of granularity of a context should be defined by feedback and retro-evaluation on verbs, • consider generalizing two contexts into one, if their discriminatory power is low.",
        "These principles allow us to partly automate the determination those of contexts which can be associated with a given verb (for example by corpora inspection).",
        "However, there will always remain quite a lot of manual work to check and improve the results, in spite of some promising research in this direction (Dorr et al.",
        "95a).",
        "As shall be seen below, the context system (which is not really a new concept) provides us with a very powerful tool for specifying and organizing the syntax and the semantics of verbs.",
        "Our contribution at this level is the way a context is defined, at what level of generality, with what formal means, and the way contexts are used to form verb classes.",
        "From a methodological point of view, contexts for French have been defined from a transposition of some English alternations (about 1/3 of our contexts), from French syntactic descriptions, among which (Gross 75), from corpora and from our own intuitions of language.",
        "Context coverage has then been validated on corpora to ensure that we cover most of the syntactic behaviors of arguments w.r.t.",
        "predicates."

        "Contexts and the detailed criteria used to define them are presented in (Saint-Dizier 95).",

        "A verb accepts a certain context if it accepts all the distributions the context is composed of.",
        "A distribution is a list of syntactic constructions (NPs, PPs and sentences); this list is ordered and corresponds to the way these constructions are linearly realized in the surface form as arguments or modifiers.",
        "2.",
        "'extended': syntactic category distributions are expressed as a Type Feature Structure (written in Login (Ait-Kati and Nasr 86)).",
        "We have identified several types of constraints: • Local constraints on arguments or on the verb: thematic roles (including those defined in (Pugeault et al.",
        "94), from (Dowty 89, 91)), the verb subcategorization frame, the arity of the verb, and a few commonly-admitted selectional restrictions.",
        "• Introduction of syntactic forms: coordination of arguments, introduction of reflexive pronouns and of a few modifiers.",
        "• Relations between arguments: thematic grids, modifier-modifiee relation between arguments (e.g. noun complements), and expression of essential semantic relations: container-containee, and part-whole of various types.",
        "Our descriptions are more declarative than alternations, however, it is clear that this formalism allows us to introduce some forms of constraints between basis forms (via constraints on the verb) and the form being described.",
        "Similarly, the use of clusters of descriptions permits us to relate two forms.",
        "We have defined 70 contexts, including 'basic' contexts (corresponding to 'direct' realizations of argument structures) and non-basic ones.",
        "We have grouped the non-basic ones according to some similitudes into 17 subclasses.",
        "We have a total of 23 basic contexts (of general purpose) and 47 non-basic ones (there are 89 alternations in English).",
        "Non-basic contexts include the description of: middle reflexives, passives, inchoatives, place-subject inversion, introduction of the semi-auxiliary faire, support verbs with nominal-ization of the predicate (e.g. crier - pousser un cri), various forms of argument deletion, preposition change, reciproquals, body-part reformulations, means-instrument raising, reflexives, argument 'des-incorporation', perspective change, there insertion, etc.",
        "For example, we have the famous English spray/load alternation, which also exists in French, which is described as follows: context([dist(111, % context ID is 111 verb([]), 7. no constraint on verb phrases([ xp(syntax=>syn(cat=>n)), % distribution xp(syntax=>syn(cat=>p)), xp(syntax=>syn(cat=>n,"

        "Her classification method, based on a large number of linguistic analyses involving some subtle semantic criteria (e.g. intentionality), can only be carried out manually and is therefore not adapted to our approach.",

        "We get a large number of classes with just one element (about 77%), this is not surprising, however, since contexts can be combined in a large number of ways.",

        "With the same set of verb-senses, we have carried out a classification similar to the classification proposed in WordNet.",
        "Besides the main categories presented in (Fellbaum 93), we have added two classes: as-pectual verbs and verbs expressing causality.",
        "We have then subdivided these main categories according to different types of properties or constraints following as much as possible those defined in WordNet.",
        "In our current classification, we consider 198 hierarchically organized classification criteria, instances of the is-a (or troponymy) relation, the depth of the decomposition is 3 (Saint-Dizier 96).",

        "The best classes contain an average of 4 to 7 verbs, larger classes (above 10 elements) are often of a lower quality or may contain several subsets of semantically related verbs: in a large number of classes with more than 8 elements we found 2 or 3 subsets of classes of WN.",
        "These classes are often formed from a small number of contexts (1 to 3), which explains their low semantic relatedness rate.",
        "Globally, these results aren't very good.",
        "If we want to explore in more depth the cooperation between syntax and semantics, and if we want to be able to construct verb semantic classes on a rigourous basis, it is necessary to develop methods that improve the quality of VS classes (considering that syntactic criteria are the most 'rigourous' ones a priori).",
        "The first approach, which is the simplest, is to make the classification more flexible by allowing exceptions: a verb in a class may have one more or one less context than the norm of the class.",
        "This approach gives however very bad results, with an overlapp VS/WN rate below 35%.",
        "To improve that rate, exceptions should depend",
        "on the VS class, but this is extremely subjective and hard to carry out.",
        "The second type of solution consists in analyzing the implicit semantics conveyed by contexts and to form classes from sets of contexts, on the basis of their implicit semantics.",
        "Then all the verbs accepting exactly an a priori given set of contexts will belong to the same VS class, even if they accept many other contexts.",
        "Some contexts are quite general and are not related to precise semantic notions, while others convey clearly identifiable meaning components.",
