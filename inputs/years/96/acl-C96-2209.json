        "However, only a few NLP-driven systems have actually been implemented (Friedman and Johnson, 1992).",
        "For Dutch, a prototype covering a larger part of the Dutch grammar and medical vocabulary is under development.",
        "This paper focuses on a spin-off – c.q.",

        "A T/L is quite valuable for several kinds of corpus studies concerning the medical vocabulary (co-occurrence patterns, statistical data, ... ).",
        "For efficient sentence analysis in particular, it is necessary to disambiguate the results of morphological analysis before they can be passed on the parser.",
        "In the following sections, we will describe in detail the different knowledge bases (cf. section 2) and the implementation of the major data structures (cf. section 3).",
        "Each section is illustrated by an example or some implementation details.",
        "The subsequent section ( 4) is devoted to the evaluation.",

        "(cf. also (Ritchie et al., 1992, p.201)).",
        "The lexical database for Dutch was built using several resources: an existing electronic valency dictionary 2 and a list of words extracted from a medical corpus (cardiology patient discharge summaries).",
        "The already existing electronic dictionary and",
        "the newly coded entries were converted and merged into a common representation in a relational database (Dehaspe, 1993a).",

        "Currently, there are some 100.000 full forms in the lexical database (which is some 8000 non inflected forms).",
        "For the moment, the database contains for the major part simple wordforms.",
        "Complex wordforms nor idiomatic expressions are yet handled in a conclusive manner.",
        "However, since an exhaustive dictionary is an unrealistic assumption, an intelligent word recogniser tries to cope with all the unknown word forms (Spyns, 1994).",
        "The morphological recogniser tries to identify the unknown form by computing its potential linguistic characteristics (including its canonical form).",
        "For this purpose, a set of heuristics that combine morphological (inflection, derivation and compounding) as well as non morphological (lists of endstrings coupled to their syntactic category) knowledge.",
        "When these knowledge sources do not permit to identify the unknown forms, they are marked as guesses and receive the noun category.",
        "Actually, a difference is made between the regular full form database dictionary and a much smaller canonical form dictionary.",
        "The latter consist of automatically generated entries.",
        "Those entries are asserted as temporary canonical form lexicon entries and do not need to be calculated again by the recogniser part of the T/L when encountered a second time in the submitted text.",

        "E.g. if a simple form of the verb 'hebben' [have] appears, the auxiliary reading is kept only if a past participle is present in the context 4 .",

        "The position in the sentence uniquely identifies a word (and thus its corresponding (group of different) morphological reading(s)).",
