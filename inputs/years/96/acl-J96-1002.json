        "Intuitively, the principle is simple: model all that is known and assume nothing about that which is unknown.",
        "In other words, given a collection of facts, choose a model consistent with all the facts, but otherwise as uniform as possible.",
        "This is precisely the approach we took in selecting our model p at each step in the above example.",
        "The maximum entropy concept has a long history.",
        "Adopting the least complex hypothesis possible is embodied in Occam's razor (\"Nunquam ponenda est pluralitas sine necesitate.\") and even appears earlier, in the Bible and the writings of Herotodus (Jaynes 1990).",

        "As E. T. Jaynes, a more recent pioneer of maximum entropy, put it (Jaynes 1990): ... the fact that a certain probability distribution maximizes entropy subject to certain constraints representing our incomplete information, is the fundamental property which justifies use of that distribution for inference; it agrees with everything that is known, but carefully avoids assuming anything that is not known.",
