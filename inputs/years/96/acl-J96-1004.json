        "In Discourse 1, we find two types of temporal markers: verb tense and what we call adverbials of temporal location (ATL).",
        "An ATL is an adjunct, such as yesterday, until 10:50, or when it flew over Barcelona, that provides information about the temporal localization of an occurrence or its duration, or both at the same time.",
        "For verb tense, we distinguish different ways of indicating localization in the past.",
        "Three French verb tenses can be used: passe compose, imparfait, and plus-que-parfait; their closest equivalents in English are the simple past, past progressive, and past perfect.",
        "The passé compose il a survole 'it flew over' presents the occurrence as an event and localizes it in relation to the time of speech.",
        "With the plus-que-parfait it s'etait allume 'it had come on', the occurrence is also presented as an event, but localized in relation to a perspective point other than speech time.",
        "The imparfait le reacteur fonctionnait 'the engine was working' presents the occurrence as being in progress.",
        "For present and future tenses there are fewer options than for past tense, but more than one form is available for theses tenses as well.",
        "For ATLs, temporal localization can be achieved in many ways; for example, in relation to the time of speech (hier 'yesterday'), by designating an absolute temporal location (a 8h00 'at 8:00 A.M.'), or in relation to another fact (puis 'then', ace moment-ld 'at this moment', quand il a survole Barcelone 'when it flew over Barcelona').",
        "To this variety in the semantics of localization we must add the variety of syntactic forms.",
        "Localization can be expressed by an adverb (puis 'then'), a prepositional phrase (jusqu'd 10h50 'until 10:50'), a nominal phrase (le lendemain 'the day after') or a subordinate clause (quand il a survole Barcelone 'when it flew over Barcelona').",
        "No text generator has yet been developed to solve the problem of the expression of time.",
        "The ones that have tackled this problem have focused on the production of verb tenses, without solving the choice of temporal adverbs.",
        "The work presented in this paper addresses the problem of generating the elements that convey temporal localization in French, including both verbs and temporal adverbs.",
        "In a previous paper (Gagnon and Lapalme 1992), we proposed a method of integrating the expression of temporal concepts into the text-generation process.",
        "In particular, we showed how to produce different types of text in French from a single representation of events.",
        "Unfortunately, the method governing the planning process was too determined by temporal concepts, so it was difficult to link this planning process with other frameworks, such as the schema proposed by McKeown (1985) or Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann 1991; Hovy 1991).",
        "As we were not really successful in integrating the expression of time in French into the text-generation process, we decided to pursue our research with a different perspective.",
        "We designed a system covering many of the possibilities of expressing time in French, our hypothesis being that the achievement of this task would facilitate the design of a text-planning process.",
        "We believed it would be easier to organize the structure of the discourse with a better understanding of the way temporal information can be expressed by adverbs and verb tenses.",

        "To implement the production of ATLs and verb tenses, we have chosen Systemic Grammar (Halliday 1985; Berry 1975, 1976), which formulates the syntactic structure of a sentence as the result of a sequence of semantic choices.",

        "Gagnon and Lapalme From Conceptual Time to Linguistic Time to another localizer.",
        "In Figure 4, all occurrences are localized directly.",
        "Occurrence 04 is localized directly by another occurrence, whereas of and 02 are localized directly by a temporal constant.",
        "For S1 and S2, the values for LOC are simply constants ti and t2.",
        "The same temporal localization can usually be expressed in many ways, and we must also specify how these constants are worded.",

        "Thus, the value of LOC in the semantic representation determines the expression of the localization, giving rise to three main problems:",
        "• how to represent the temporal constants in the conceptual representation; • how to determine the link between these conceptual temporal constants and their semantic representation, which specifies how they are to be expressed in the text; and • how to implement the selection mechanism, which relies on pragmatic and stylistic information to choose between the many different ways of expressing the same temporal localization.",
        "In Gagnon and Bras (1994), we gave a solution to the first two problems but the last one still remains to be solved.",
        "Here, we discuss only the second problem: the semantic expression of localization.",
        "First, a few words about temporal context: usually, temporal localizers may be understood only in reference to some time in the context.",
        "For example, in on April 15th, it is assumed that it is clear which year this time is part of.",
        "Thus, we take for granted that all expressions of temporal localization are made in relation to such a contextual time.",
        "Let t, be a temporal constant, taken from the conceptual representation, which is to be used as a localizer in the semantic representation, and f ,cont the contextual time.",
        "The expression in the semantic representation is based on a term of the following form:",
        "The first argument is the identifier of the constant in the conceptual representation.",
        "The second argument is the type of the temporal localizer (day, month, year, etc.).",
        "Thus, tcont may be decomposed into times of type Type, of which t, is one.",
        "The last argument names the time referred to by the localizer t,.",
        "There is exactly one time in the \"real world\" that corresponds to the temporal constant t,.",
        "We call it objective time.",
        "We use the notation t7 to represent the objective time that corresponds to a localizer For example, the expression for the temporal localizer en avril 'in April', would be something like this (here t67 is the corresponding temporal constant in the conceptual representation): [t67, month, april] The naming april is not the syntactic word \"April\" but an internal keyword that helps distinguish between the time referred to and the other months of the contextual year.",
        "An important distinction is made between a temporal constant t, and a objective time t7.",
        "The constant t, pertains to the way a temporal location is expressed in the discourse, whereas t, can be considered the corresponding portion of time in the real world.",
        "More than one temporal constant may correspond to a single objective time.",
        "(Xth, if X<0) t7 is the Xth time of type T after (before, if X<0) time t7 t7 is a time period starting at time t; and ending at time q Suppose, for example, that the discourse contains two temporal constants, corresponding to yesterday and two days after Robert's departure.",
        "We can imagine a situation where both designate exactly the same day.",
        "But it is not possible for a single temporal constant to correspond to more than one objective time.",
        "If it were, it would mean that an ATL could be ambiguous.",
        "In our computational perspective, we accept some underspecified ATLs (not precisely specifying the temporal location), but not ambiguous ones.",
        "A triplet is the simplest expression of a temporal localization.",
        "Usually, expressing a temporal localization is more complex, because the temporal constant used as localizer cannot be rendered directly in relation to the contextual time.",
        "This is the case, for example, if the localizer is a day, and the contextual time a year, because there is no natural way of decomposing a year into days'.",
        "In these cases, we must express relations with some intermediate localizers, until we reach one that can be related to the contextual time.",
        "Let [ti,T,,Ni] be the localizer and [t 1,T 1, N j], [tk, Tk, Nk] be intermediates localizers.",
        "Many kinds of relations can be distinguished.",
        "They are listed in Table 1.",
        "Note that these relations can be combined recursively.",
        "This means that the triplets used as arguments may also be represented using a relation.",
        "We will show examples of this in the following discussion.",
        "Among the arguments of these relations, one pertains to the temporal localizer, and one (two, in the case of the relation extent) pertains to an intermediate localizer to which the temporal localizer is related.",
        "We call this last argument an anchor, since it represents a time to which the relation must be \"anchored\" in order to deduce the time of localization.",
        "We will now give a short discussion of the relations of Table 1.",
        "In the following examples, t10, designates the temporal constant corresponding to the localizer of the occurrence, and n and tref designate the time of speech and the reference time, respectively.",

        "The semantics of a more complex localizer like le matin du 3 avri11994 'on the morning of April 3rd 1994' is an example of using recursivity for the expression: inclinGt10c, moment-of-day, morning], inclinUt1, day, 3], inclinGt2, month, april], [t3, year, 1994]))) The second relation, incl, is required to deal with adverbials such as le jour of Paul est parti 'the day when Paul left', aujourd'hui 'today' and ce jour-la 'that day'.",
        "All of these refer to a day, but this day is not expressed in relation to a time that includes it.",
        "On the contrary, the other time is included in it: the time when Paul left in the first example, the time of speech in the second example, and the referent time associated with REF in the third one.",
        "Suppose that in the conceptual representation, 023 is the object representing the departure of Paul.",
        "These three examples could be represented, respectively, as: inclGti„, day, _], [023, -,",
        "where \"_\" is used for arguments whose values are not relevant or unknown.",
        "The relations begin and end represent the case where only one boundary of the localizer is known.",
        "This results in an ATL such as depuis le 3 avril 'since April 3rd' or jusqu'au 3 avril 'until April 3rd' where meaning is ambiguous.",
        "What do we mean exactly, when we write that t, begins at time tj?",
        "That the initial boundary of t, is included in tj or that the ending of tj \"meets\" the beginning of t1?",
        "If the answer is that tj includes the initial boundary of t,, what is the constraint on the duration of t,?",
        "It is clear that it must be shorter than tj.",
        "We do not have any answers to these crucial questions, and other similar ones.",
        "These are problems that pertain to the deep generation process, which is not the focus of this paper.",
        "We think that at the level of the semantic representation, this relation need not be further clarified, since it corresponds to the way time is expressed in the language.",
        "In fact, all our relations have this underspecified nature.",
        "For the relations before and after, the value of the temporal distance is given as a duration, using an expression of this form: duration(N, Type) The value of the duration is obtained by calculating the period corresponding to N periods of type Type.",
        "For example, the adverbial deux jours apres le depart de Paul 'two days after Paul's departure' would be represented as (023 represents the occurrence of Paul's departure): afteratioc, [023, _],duration(2, day)) If the temporal distance is not known (or irrelevent), it is indicated by indefinite.",

        " Now, let's suppose that the localizer ti is of type T. In some cases, a good way to express it is by giving its position relative to another time tj of the same type.",
        "For example, the ATL cinq jours plus tard 'five days later' is not used to mean \"at a time in the future, five days from the reference time,\" but rather \"the 5th day after the one which included the reference time.\" If the reference time is itself a day, the semantics of this ATL could be:",
        "(This takes for granted that the time tref is not bigger than a day.",
        "If tref were bigger than a day, it would not make any sense to express relative position by specifying the temporal distance in days.)",
        "Similarly, hier 'yesterday' would be expressed semantically as \"the day that is the first one before the day that includes the time of speech\": relpos(-1, [t1oc, day, _], incl (Pi, day, _], [n, -, _])) We have seen a way of expressing duration, by giving the length as a number of time units.",
        "But there is another way of expressing duration: by indicating the two boundaries of the period.",
        "By using this method, not only the duration of an occurrence is expressed, but so is its temporal location, at least partially.",
        "The relation extent is used to express this kind of duration.",
        "For example, the semantics of du 3 avril au 5 mai 'from April 3rd to May 5th' is formulated as: extent Gt 1„, , _], inclin ([t1, day, 3], [t2, month, april]), inclin ([t3, day, 5], [t4, month, may])) The semantics of du 3 au 10 avril 'from April 3 to 10' should represent the fact that the whole duration is included in the same month: inclin (extent ([t1oc, -, -], [t1, day, 3], [t2, day, 10]), [t3, month, april]) The relation extent is also used to represent adverbials like depuis trois jours 'for three days' and pendant trois jours a partir du 3 avril 'during three days starting from April 3rd'.",
        "These adverbials explicitly express one of the two boundaries.",
        "In the first example, it is either the time of speech or the reference time (the ATL means \"for three days until now\" or \"for three days until then\").",
        "In the second example, it is the time corresponding to April 3rd.",
        "The other boundary is indicated implicitly by giving a temporal distance from the anchor.",
        "The first example, supposing that the explicit boundary is speech time, would be represented as: extent([t10, , _],beforeGt1, -], [n, , _], duration (3, day)), [n, -]) This expresses a period whose ending is the time of speech and whose beginning must be calculated by finding the time that is three days before speech time.",
        "The second example would be represented as: extent ([t1„, „ _], inclin ([ti, day, 3], [t2, month, april]), after( [t3, [t1, duration (3, day))) Note that in both examples, the same temporal constant represents both the explicit boundary and the anchor of the relation after or before used to express the implicit boundary (n and t1, respectively).",

        "Note the extensive use of the combination property.",
        "Thus, to specify the localization of an occurrence, we can use another simultaneous object, or use a localizer that is expressed in relation to another localizer.",

        "Of course, not all the combinations may be expressed naturally in the language, but we are convinced that most of the ATLs can be expressed with this semantics.' The problem of representing temporal location has received a lot of attention in the past (Dowty 1979, 1982, 1986; Bach 1986; Verkuyl 1989; and Vlach 1993).",

        "Then, in Allen's model, the end of t7 could coincide with the beginning of t7 , could coincide with the end of or could be included in t. The main reason for using a different set of primitives is to represent as closely as possible the way temporal localization is dealt with in language.",

        "We argued for the use of a conceptual structure, a Discourse Representation Structure, combined with rhetorical principles and pragmatic information, and for its translation into a semantic structure that is easily realized syntactically.",
        "The deep generation process is hard to implement, mainly because of the difficulty in formalizing this information.",
        "Since we assume that the deep generation",
        "Gagnon and Lapalme From Conceptual Time to Linguistic Time process requires a good understanding of the syntactic mechanisms, we decided to focus on the surface generation process.",
        "The most innovative part of our work is the generation of adverbials of temporal location (ATLs).",
        "Our work departs from previous work in many aspects:",
        "• We cover a large variety of ATLs, much larger than in any previous generator.",
        "• We propose a clear semantics of localization reflecting the structure of possible ATLs.",
        "Our semantics is compatible with DRT, a theory that has shown its usefulness in dealing with localization in discourse analysis.",
        "• We propose an implemented method for producing the ATLs using this semantics.",
        "For verb tense, our system is less powerful, but considered in combination with our method for generating ATLs, we have a system that can generate a text with an account of localization that goes farther than any previous system.",
        "In particular, our system, programmed in Prolog, has many advantages compared to other Systemic Grammar interpreters, such as Nigel.",
        "The syntax of the grammar is easy to read because we implemented the selection mechanism as a set of Prolog rules, which are more natural than the decision trees used in Nigel.",
        "Pretexte's engine is small, thus easy to understand.",
        "In short, Pretexte is a generator that could, and probably should, be extended but nevertheless can be used with other grammars.",
        "At this moment, the implemented grammar contains about 70 systems and produces a text such as Discourse 1 in less than five seconds.",
        "Our approach still has to be tested in real applications; any comparison with Nigel must be made with care, since the size of our grammar is small.",
        "We are confident that it could be enlarged without too much difficulty, but this remains to be implemented experimentally.",
        "In this paper, we have shown how to generate the syntactic structures expressing temporal localization, starting from the semantic level.",
        "To justify the choices made in the formalization of the semantic representation, we thought it necessary to discuss the conceptual level.",
        "Our work is the first attempt to use DRT as a starting point for implementing a generation process.",
        "Since the deep generation process is not completely identified, we cannot at this moment state that the DRT is well-suited for generation.",
        "Still, we think that most of the issues associated with the whole process have been discussed.",
        "In the future, the grammar will be extended to cover more types of ATLs and VPs.",
        "For example, ATLs referring to multiple instants, such as tousles lundis 'every Monday', and VP forms expressing modality, such as conditional and subjunctive forms, would have to be covered.",
        "The problem of negation should also be considered.",
        "Other languages, such as English, differ significantly from French, in regard to the production of ATLs, so a cross-linguistic exploration should be done within our model.",
        "We think that the semantics developed, and the first systems of the grammar that directly reflect this semantics, would remain unchanged, since we specifically defined a formal representation abstracted from the syntactic form.",
        "The hardest task left to tackle is the deep generation process, to determine how one semantic representation is chosen from among those that can be built from a conceptual representation.",
        "To implement such a process, we will have to establish a method for constructing the semantic representation and for identifying the constraints on this mechanism.",
        " The problem of indirect speech should also be addressed because it has consequences on surface generation, where the selection mechanism of verb tenses must be adapted, and on deep generation, where the appropriate temporal markers must be found.",
        "Furthermore, this problem forces us to deal with the representation of possible (or potential) worlds."
