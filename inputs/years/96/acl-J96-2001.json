        "Given a form that is previously unseen in a sufficiently large training corpus, and that is morphologically n-ways ambiguous (serves n different lexical functions) what is the best estimator for the lexical prior probabilities for the various functions of the form?",
        "We argue that the best estimator is provided by computing the relative frequencies of the various functions among the hapax legomena – the forms that occur exactly once in a corpus; in particular, a hapax-based estimator is better than one based on the proportion of the various functions among words of all frequency ranges.",
        "As we shall argue, this is because when one computes an overall measure, one is including high frequency words, and high frequency words tend to have idiosyncratic properties that are not at all representative of the much larger mass of (productively formed) low-frequency words.",
        "This result has potential importance for various kinds of applications requiring lexical disambiguation, including, in particular, stochastic taggers.",
        "This is especially true when some initial hand-tagging of a corpus is required: for predicting lexical priors for very low frequency morphologically ambiguous types (most of which would not occur in any given corpus), one should concentrate on tagging a good representative sample of the hapax legomena, rather than extensively tagging words of all frequency ranges."

        "As a number of writers on morphology have noted (most recently and notably Beard [1995]), it is common to find that a particular affix or other morphological marker serves more than one function in a language.",
        "For example, in many morphologically complex languages it is often the case that several slots in a paradigm are filled with the same form; put in another way, it is common to find that a particular morphological form is in fact ambiguous between several distinct functions.",
        "This phenomenon – which in the domain of inflectional morphology is termed syncretism – can be illustrated by a Dutch example such as lopen 'walk', which can either be the infinitive form ('to walk') or the finite plural (present tense) form ('we, you, or they walk').",
        "In some cases, syncretism is completely systematic: for example the case cited in Dutch, where the en suffix can always function in the two ways cited; or in Latin, where the plural dative and ablative forms of nouns and adjectives are always identical, no matter what paradigm the noun belongs to.",
        "In other cases, a particular instance of syncretism may be displayed only in some paradigms: for example, Russian feminine nouns, such as /oshad\"horse' (Cyrillic .nonia,ab), have the same form for both the genitive singular",
        " – loshadi (Cyrillic .11omax4) – and the nominative plural, whereas masculine nouns typically distinguish these forms.",
        "In still other cases, the syncretism may be partial in that two forms may be identical at one level of representation – say, orthography but not another – say, pronunciation.",
        "For example the written form goroda in Russian (Cyrillic ropo,ita) may either be the nominative plural or the genitive singular of 'city'.",
        "In the genitive singular, the stress is on the first syllable (igioradA/), whereas in the nominative plural the stress resides on the final syllable UgarAd'an; note that the difference in stress results in very different vowel qualities for the two forms, as indicated in the phonetic transcriptions.",
        "Syncretism and related morphological ambiguities present a problem for many NL applications where lexical disambiguation is important; cases where the orthographic form is identical but the pronunciations of the various functions differ are particularly important for speech applications, such as text-to-speech, since appropriate word pronunciations must be computed from orthographic forms that under-specify the necessary information.",
        "Ideally one would like to build models that use contextual information to perform lexical disambiguation (Yarowsky 1992, 1994), but such models must be trained on specialized tagged corpora (either hand-generated or semi-automatically generated) and such training corpora are often not available, at least in the early phases of constructing a particular application.",
        "Lacking good contextual models, one is forced to fall back on estimates of the lexical prior probabilities for the various functions of a form.",
        "Following standard terminology, a lexical prior can be defined as follows: Imagine that a given form is n-ways ambiguous; the lexical prior probability of sense i of this form is simply the probability of sense i independent of the context in which the particular instantiation of the form occurs.",
        "Assuming one has a tagged corpus, one can usually get reasonable estimates of the lexical priors for the frequent forms (such as Dutch lopen 'walk') by simply counting the number of times the form occurs in each of its various functions and dividing by the total number of instances of the form (in any function).",
        "This yields the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) for the lexical prior probability.",
        "But for infrequent or unseen forms, it is less clear how to compute the estimate.",
        "Consider another Dutch example like aanlokken 'entice, appeal'.",
        "This form occurs only once, as an infinitive, in the Uit den Boogaart (henceforth UdB) corpus (Uit den Boogaart 1975); in other words it is a hapax legomenon (< Greek hapax 'once', legomenon 'said') in this corpus.",
        "Obviously the lexical prior probability of this form expressing the finite plural is not zero, the MLE is a poor estimate in such cases.",
        "When one considers forms that do not occur in the training corpus (e.g., bedraden `to wire') the situation is even worse.",
        "The problem, then, is to provide a more reasonable estimate of the relative probabilities of the various potential functions of such forms.'"

        "For a common form such as lopen 'walk' a reasonable estimate of the lexical prior probabilities is the MLE, computed over all occurrences of this form.",

        "estimate of the probability of the infinitive is 0.68.",

        "Note, however, that the application of this overall MLE presupposes that the relative frequencies of the various functions of a particular form are independent of the frequency of the form itself.",
        "For the Dutch example at hand, this presupposition predicts that if we were to classify en forms according to their frequency, and then for each frequency class thus defined, plot the relative frequency of infinitives and finite plurals, the regression line should have a slope of approximately zero."

        "To answer this question, note that the scatterplot in the bottom panel of Figure 2 reveals a downward curvature at the very left-hand side: even for the lowest-log-frequency classes, the likelihood of a word being a verb decreases with decreasing log-frequency.",
        "This suggests that for this particular example the hapax legomena alone should be used to estimate the probability that an unseen word is a noun or verb, rather than the hapax legomena in combination with other low-frequency classes (the words occurring twice, three times, etc.).",

        "As we have seen in the four examples discussed above, the MLE computed over hapax legomena yields a better prediction of lexical prior probabilities for unseen cases than does an MLE computed over the entire training corpus.",
        "We now have to consider why this result holds.",
        "As we shall see, the reasons are different from case to case, but nonetheless share a commonality: in all four cases, idiosyncratic lexical properties of high-frequency words dominate the statistical properties of the high-frequency ranges, thus making the overall MLE a less reliable predictor of the properties of the low-frequency and unseen cases.",
        "First let us discuss the final case, that of er ambiguity in Dutch, beginning with the derived and underived nouns.",
        "The hapax-based MLE estimate for derived nouns in er is somewhat higher than the overall MLE; for underived nouns, the hapax-based MLE is significantly lower – half – of the overall MLE.",
        "This can be explained by the observation that a good many of the underived nouns in er are high-frequency words such as moeder 'mother' and vader 'father'.",
        "Such words contribute to the overall proportional mass of the underived nouns, thus boosting the estimate of the overall MLE for this class.",
        "A similar argument holds for the derived and underived adjectives.",
        "Turning to proper names, we see that the hapax-based MLE is much larger than the overall MLE.",
        "Proper names differ from ordinary words in that there are relatively few",
        "proper names that are highly frequent, in comparison with words in general, but there are large numbers of types of names that occur rarely.",
        "Thus, we expect an imbalance of the kind we observe.",
        "Consider next the ambiguity in Dutch between en verb forms and en plural nouns.",
        "Ceteris paribus, plural nouns are less frequent than singular nouns; on the other hand, en for verbs serves both the function of marking plurality and of marking the infinitive.",
        "High-frequency verbs include some very common word forms, such as the auxiliaries hebben 'have', zullen 'will', kunnen 'can', and moeten 'must'.",
        "Thus, for the high-frequency ranges, the data is weighted heavily towards verbs.",
        "On the other hand, while both nouns and verbs are open classes, nouns are far more productive as a class than are verbs (Baayen and Lieber 1991), and this pattern becomes predominant in the low-frequency ranges: among low-frequency types, most tokens are nouns.",
        "Hence, for the low-frequency ranges, the data is weighted towards nouns.",
        "These two opposing forces conspire to yield a downward trend in the percentage of verbs as we proceed from the high to the low-frequency ranges.",
        "Next, consider the English past tense versus past participle ambiguity.",
        "One of the important functions of the past participle form is as an adjectival modifier or predicate; for example, the parked car.",
        "In this function the past participle has a passive meaning with transitive verbs, and a perfective meaning with unaccusative intransitive verbs; see Levin (1993, 86-88) for details.",
        "For reasons that are not clear to us, a predominant number of the high-frequency verbs cannot felicitously be used as prenominal adjectives.",
        "These verbs include unergative intransitives like walk, for which one would not expect to find the adjectival usage, given the above characterization; but they also include clear transitives like move, try, and ask, and unaccusative intransitives like appear, which are not generally felicitous in this usage.",
        "Consider: ?a moved car, ?a tried approach, ?an asked question, ?an appeared ad; but contrast: an oft-tried approach, a frequently asked question, a recently appeared ad, where an adverbial modifier renders the examples felicitous.'",
        "Among the low-frequency verbs, including accentuate, bottle and incense, the predominate types are those in which the past participle usage is preferred.",
        "What is clear from the plot in the top panel of Figure 2 is that the downward trend in the regression curve to the right of the plot is due to the lexical properties of a relatively small number of high-frequency verbs.",
        "For the greater part of the frequency range, there is a relatively stable proportion of participles to finite past forms.",
        "Thus, the hapax-based MLE yields an estimate that is uncontaminated by the lexical properties of individual high-frequency forms.",
        "Finally, consider the Dutch verb forms en that we started with.",
        "In Figure 1 the strong downward trend in the regression curve at the right of the figure is due in large measure to the inclusion of high-frequency auxiliary verbs, examples of which have already been given.",
        "These verbs, while possible in the infinitival form, occur predominantly in the finite form.",
        "Hence, a form such as hebben 'have' is much more likely to be a plural finite form than it is to be an infinitive.",
        "At the low end of the frequency spectrum, we find a great many verbs derived with separable particles, such as afzeggen 'cancel'; note that separable prefixation is the most productive verb-forming process in Dutch.",
        "In the infinitival form, the particle is always attached to 5 One reviewer has suggested that the infelicity of many adjectival passives relates to the fact that the action denoted by the base verb is not regarded as producing an enduring result that affects the object denoted by the (deep) internal argument: contrast a broken vase, where the vase is enduringly affected by the breaking, with ?a seen movie, where the movie is not affected.",
        "However, this cannot be the whole story since the object denoted by the internal argument of kill is presumably enduringly affected by the killing, yet ?a killed man seems about as odd as ?a seen movie.",
        "Baayen and Sproat Lexical Priors for Low-Frequency Forms the verb.",
        "However, in the finite forms in main clauses, the particle must be separated: for example, wij zeggen onze afspraak of 'we are cancelling our appointment'.",
        "These properties of Dutch separable verbs boost the likelihood of infinitival forms for the low-frequency ranges, but they also boost the likelihood of (higher-frequency) finite plural forms such as zeggen: since the separated finite plural form zeggen is identical to the finite plural of the underived verb zeggen 'say', any separated finite forms will accrue to the frequency of the generally much more common derivational base.",
        "What all of these cases share is that the statistical properties of the high-frequency ranges are dominated by lexical properties of particular sets of high-frequency words.",
        "This in turn biases the overall MLE and makes it a poor predictor of novel cases.",
        "For example, auxiliaries such as hebben 'have' are among the most common verbs in Dutch, but they have rather different syntactic, and hence morphological, properties from other verbs; these properties in turn contaminate the high-frequency ranges and thus the overall MLE.",
        "In contrast, words in the low-frequency ranges, and particularly hapaxes, are heavily populated with (necessarily non-idiosyncratic) neologisms derived via productive morphological processes (Baayen 1989; Baayen and Renouf 1996).",
        "Any lexical biases that are inherent in these morphological processes – for example, the fact that a low frequency Dutch word ending in en is more likely to be a noun than a verb – are well-estimated by the hapaxes.",
        "Now, for a sufficiently large training corpus, we can be very confident that an unseen complex word is non-idiosyncratic and formed via a productive morphological process, and this confidence increases as the corpus size increases (Baayen and Renouf 1996).",
        "Since the hapaxes of a particular morphological process mostly consist of non-idiosyncratic formations from that process, it makes sense that the distribution of a property among the hapaxes is the least contaminated estimate available for the distribution of that property among the unseen cases.",
        "The hapax-based MLE that we have proposed is not only observationally preferable to the overall MLE, it is also firmly grounded in probability theory.",
        "The probability of encountering an unseen word given that this word is a word in en is estimated by:",
        "where N1,N(-en) denotes the number of hapax legomena in en among the N(-en) tokens in en in the training sample; see Baayen (1989), Baayen and Lieber (1991), Good (1953), and Church and Gale (1991).",
        "Of course, this estimate is heavily influenced by the highest-frequency words in -en, as these words contribute many tokens to N(-en).",
        "In our example, high-frequency auxiliaries such as hebben cause the probability of sampling unseen types in en to be low – newly sampled tokens have a high probability of being an auxiliary rather than some previously unseen word.",
        "Interestingly, (1) can be used to derive an expression for the conditional probability that a word is, say, a noun, given that it is an unseen type in en (Baayen 1993):",
        "Note that the estimator exemplified in (1) has been applied twice: once (in the de-en, noun) =",
        "nominator) to the distribution of all en words; and once (in the numerator) to the distribution of the en nouns – after reclassifying all verbal tokens in en as representing one (very high-frequency) noun type in the frequency distribution.",
        "Similarly, the probability that an unseen word in en is a verb is given by",
        "Thus the proportion of verbal hapaxes in en that we have suggested as an adjusted MLE estimator on the basis of the curve shown in Figure 2 is in fact an estimate of the conditional probability that a word is a verb, given that it is an unseen type in -en.",
        "The results of the analyses presented in this paper are of potential importance in various applications that require lexical disambiguation and where an estimate of lexical priors is required.",
        "For high-frequency words, one can obtain fairly reliable estimates of the lexical priors by tagging a corpus that gives a good coverage to words of various ranges.",
        "For predicting the lexical priors for the much larger mass of very low-frequency types, most of which would not occur in any such corpus, the results we have presented suggest that one should concentrate on tagging a good representative sample of the hapaxes, rather than extensively tagging words of all frequency ranges."
