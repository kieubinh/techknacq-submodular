        "Our approach to machine learning of language combines psychological, linguistic, and logical concepts.",
        "We believe that the five central features of our approach – probabilistic association of words and meanings, grammatical and semantical form generalization, grammar computations, congruence of meaning, and dynamical assignment of denotational value to a word – are either new, or are new in their present combination.",
        "An overview of these concepts and related ones is given in Section 2.1.",
        "Two prior papers describing this approach, first presented at two conferences in 1991, are Suppes, Liang, and BOttner (1992) and Suppes, BOttner, and Liang (1995).",
        "Using the theory embodying the concepts just listed, we report on our machine learning program of corpora from ten natural languages.",
        "Following our earlier work, we use a robotic framework.",
        "The computer program based on the theory learns a natural language from examples, which are commands occurring in mechanical assembly tasks (e.g., Go to the screw, Pick up a nut, Put the black screw into the round hole).",
        "A major improvement here, in comparison to Suppes, BOttner, and Liang (1995), is that the association relation is generalized from a unique correspondence between words and the program's internal representation of their meaning to a many-to-one relation, which permits different words to be associated to the same internal representation.",
        "This change is particularly important for the purpose of capturing case variation in word forms in inflecting languages such as Russian or German.",
        "The robotic framework and the associated corpora we test our program on are certainly restricted, although we have implemented our learning program on Robot-world, a standard robot used in academic settings for development purposes.",
        "In the present paper, however, we have deliberately formulated the general learning axioms of our theory so they do not depend on the robotic framework.",
        "The axioms are meant to apply to many kinds of systematic language use, more or less in the sense of sub-languages, (see Kittredge and Lehrberger [19821).",
        "We are already deep into our next",
        "area of application, machine understanding of physics word problems, and we have not needed to change the general formulation of our theory to accommodate this quite different problem of language learning.",
        "In this paper, we first describe our theory of machine learning of natural language (Section 2), and then describe the corpora in ten languages that we used for experimental purposes (Section 3).",
        "The languages are: English, Dutch, German, French, Spanish, Catalan, Russian, Chinese, Korean, Japanese.",
        "In Section 4 we describe some empirical results, especially the comprehension grammars generated from learning the languages.",
        "Finally, in Section 5 we discuss related work and the most pressing unsolved problems."

        "Any learning program that is given the counterpart of the command Get the black screw in French Prends une vis noire, Russian Voz'mi chjornuj vint, or Japanese Kuroi nejikugi o tore finds itself confronted with at least the following problems: (i) to learn the meanings of words, (ii) to learn a grammar from a training set for each utterance to be comprehended, and (iii) to learn the semantic structure of each utterance.",
        "Our theoretical solution to these problems will become clear in what follows."

      "text": [
        "We give here an informal characterization of the key concepts used in our theory.",
        "Association.",
        "This is the key learning concept.",
        "We use the classical concept of association to establish the connection between unknown words in a language and their meaning.",
        "The principle of association goes back at least to Aristotle, and certainly was used extensively by eighteenth-century philosophers like Hume long before psychology had become an experimental science.",
        "The fundamental role of association as a basis for conditioning is thoroughly recognized in modern neuroscience and is essential to the experimental study of the neuronal activity of a variety of animals.",
        "For similar reasons, its role is just as central to the learning theory of neural networks, now rapidly developing in many different directions.",
        "We have not made explicit use of neural networks, but have worked out our theory of language learning at a higher level of abstraction.",
        "In our judgment, the difficulties we face need to be solved before a more detailed theory is developed.",
        "The choice of some level of abstraction is inevitable in all work of the present kind – a fact not always appreciated by interested bystander.",
        "Whatever the level of abstraction, there is one general issue about association that must be faced: is association probabilistic or deterministic?",
        "For us, the forming of associations is probabilistic rather than deterministic, which is a reflection of the complexity of the underlying process.",
        "Here, formally, association is a binary relation between commands, words, and grammatical forms, on the one hand, and their corresponding representations in the internal language of the program, on the other hand.",
        "All words in each of the ten languages of the experiment are completely unknown to the program at the beginning of learning.",
        "The internal language, defined in Section 2.3, is not learned, but given from the beginning.",
        "Working memory.",
        "The learning program has a short-term working memory for processing the command it is presented.",
        "The memory holds its content for the time period of a single trial.",
        "The first group of learning axioms describes the association computations that take place in working memory during the course of a trial.",
        "Long-term memory.",
        "This memory also can change from trial to trial, but it stores associations and grammatical forms that remain unchanged when they are correct for the application being considered.",
        "The way the state of long-term memory changes from trial to trial is described in Section 2.4.1, in the second set of learning axioms.",
        "Generalization.",
        "A distinct principle of generalization generates grammatical forms and their associated semantic forms.",
        "The methods used combine those of context-free grammars and model-theoretic semantics for formal languages.",
        "The concept of generalization is widely used in psychological theories of learning.",
        "The kind of generalization used here is restricted to the generation of grammatical forms and grammatical rules from concrete utterances.",
        "For example, the phrase the nut generalizes to the grammatical form the 0, where 0 is the category of objects.",
        "(More elaborate examples are considered later.)",
        "Memory trace.",
        "When a generalization of any of the several kinds we use is made, the particular word association on which it is based is stored with it in long-term memory, as the memory trace justifying the generalization.",
        "Denotational value.",
        "When a child learning a first language, or an older person learning a second language, first encounters utterances in that new language, nondenoting words are not marked in any uniform way.",
        "There is some evidence that various prosodic features are used in English and other languages to help the child, but in any case their denotational role must be learned.",
        "Here a separate learning procedure is introduced to compute dynamically the denotational value of each word, with the limit being 1 for having a denotation and 0 for being nondenoting.",
        "Denoting words such as nut refer to elements of our categories; good examples of nondenoting words are definite and indefinite articles.",
        "Intuitively, only denoting words should acquire associations to elements of the environment, including possible actions, as represented internally.",
        "Several mean learning curves for denotational value are presented in Section 4.",
        "Congruence.",
        "By using a concept of semantic congruence inspired by geometry, we simplify the grammars and at the same time permit direct comparisons across languages.",
        "The intuitive idea of such congruence is simple: two strings of a natural language are congruent when they have identical representations in the internal language.",
        "Various strong and weak senses of congruence can be used to get varying degrees of closeness of meaning.",
        "The idea is not to be caught in the search for a single concept of synonymy, just as in modern geometry we are not caught in a single concept of congruence.",
        "In affine geometry, for example, there is a weaker sense of congruence than in Euclidean geometry, but it is also easy to get a commonsense notion of congruence that is stronger than the Euclidean one, namely congruence that requires sameness of orientation.",
        "Our use of congruence of meaning in this article is restricted.",
        "In particular, we only analyze congruence of nondenoting words.",
        "Comprehension grammar.",
        "Most linguistic analysis is concerned with grammars detailed enough to produce natural utterances of the language being studied.",
        "A comprehension",
        " grammar, in contrast, as we characterize it here, can generate a superset of utterances.",
        "The rules are required only to lead to the correct semantic interpretation of an utterance of the language.",
        "Robots, like very young children, can easily have the capacity to understand language before they can produce it.",
        "Although it is difficult and subtle to collect accurate and anything-like-complete data on the comprehension grammar generated by very young children, the evidence is overwhelming that they comprehend much more than they can produce."

        "Second, at the other end of the comprehension process, so to speak, there is the problem of generating a semantic interpretation of a new utterance, but one that falls within the grammar and semantics already constructed by the learner.",

        "To test our system, we applied it to corpora of ten different languages.",
        "These languages are: English, Dutch, German, French, Spanish, Catalan, Russian, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese.",
        "The size of our corpora varied from 400 to 440 sentences.",
        "The corpora in the ten languages cover an almost identical set of internal structures.",
        "They could not be made completely identical for the following reason: an internal-language word that was translated by one word in one language, say r, might require two or more words (depending on context) in another language e. As a consequence, e might not be learnable from the same corpus of 400 sentences that suffice for language G. To arrive at a complete learning of all the words, we therefore either added sentences as, e.g. in Spanish, or removed sentences, as in Japanese.",
        "The most important variation requirement on the various corpora was that two words of a given language that were intended to correspond to two internal symbols must not always co-occur if the correct meaning were to be learned.",
        "For example, if nimm and Schraube only occurred in the single command Nimm die Schraube!",
        "there would be no assurance that the intended associations Schraube ,-- $screw and nimm – $get would ever be learned, no matter how many learning trials there were.",
        "We also want to note that in the Japanese case we deleted all the sentences translating $above as an internal symbol (ten sentences), because in Japanese above and on are expressed by the same word ue.",
        "Despite careful instruction of our translators, we are not sure whether the translations sound natural in all cases and would in fact be used in a robotic working environment.",
        "To check this, however, would go far beyond what can be done by standard translation methods and requires field studies of language use in a working environment.",
        "In cases of a lexical gap, we used very simple devices.",
        "For example, French has no single idiomatic word for the nonspatial meaning of the English adjective medium, so we used the circumlocutionary phrase de taille moyenne.",
        "In some cases we avoided technical language where a single word consists of two morphemes and expresses two internal denoting symbols.",
        "As might be expected, this occurs frequently in German.",
        "For example, Rundschraube expresses the idea of round screw that is the property round and the object screw.",
        "In the case of Catalan, we set in advance the denotational value for a few words as different from the initial value of 1.",
        "We did so because there were many nondenoting words, in our sense, and these nondenoting words uniformly co-occurred with certain action verbs, so that within our limited corpus the intuitively correct denotational value could be learned only with a probability less than one.",
        "We therefore set the initial denotational value for the words d and de at 0.05.",
        "To obtain a successful learning performance on a corpus, it is often useful to make some modifications in the corpus.",
        "In the final tests of a theory such changes are, of course, undesirable.",
        "The changes we did make are described below.",
        "The introduction of pick up created many problems because of the special nature of this verb and relation in English.",
        "In many languages the notion of picking something up is expressed by a single action verb with no additional preposition required.",
        "This created an important problem: individual words in the corpus of a given natural language sometimes denoted more than one internal symbol.",
        "Our solution (admittedly artificial but the only really artificial solution we had to adopt), was to split such words into two parts: French: ramasse into ra and masse Spanish: recoge into rec and oge Catalan: recull into re and cull Russian: podnimi into pod and nimi Korean: cip&ela into cip and &ela Japanese: toriagero into tori and agero This absence of isomorphism of the semantic categories of words across languages is not surprising, as has been observed in Bowerman (1996) and Choi and Bowerman (1991).",

        "Lexicon.",
        "In Table 3 we specify for each natural language the number of words learned.",
        "We count as different words different inflected forms of what, according to dictionary usage, is the same word.",
        "As might be expected, Russian has the largest number of internal symbols with more than one association, just because of its rich inflectional patterns.",
        "Learning.",
        "A natural question is whether or not the order of presentation of the sentences in the corpora was fixed in advance to facilitate learning.",
        "The answer is that the order was not fixed.",
        "For each language the sentences presented were chosen randomly without replacement from the corpus of approximately 400 sentences.",
        "Compared to most neural-net rates of learning, the learning was rapid.",
        "In each of the ten languages, one cycle through the entire corpus was sufficient to produce a comprehension grammar that was intuitively correct.",
        "In contrast, and somewhat paradoxically, even for a corpus of only 400 sentences, the standard mean learning curves, theoretically based on random sampling of sentences are computationally not feasible, as we proved in Suppes, Liang, and BOttner (1992).",
        "In this same earlier paper, based on some very large runs – in fact, mean learning curves computed from up to 10,000 sample paths – we conjectured that the mean learning rate for the kind of corpora we have studied is polynomically bound.",
        "The learning of the ten languages studied in this paper quite clearly supports the conjecture for our theoretical framework of learning.",
        "In Figures 1, 2, and 3 we show mean learning curves for the denotational value of words for English, Chinese and German.",
        "The averaging in this case is over the total number of denoting or nondenoting words in a given corpus.",
        "The number of nondenoting words in the three languages is 2, 8 and 10, respectively, as also shown in Table 3.",
        "As would be expected, for the three languages the rate of learning the denotational value of nondenoting words is inversely proportional to their number, an argument from pure frequency of occurrence in the corpora.",
        "This is not the whole story, as can be seen by comparing the Chinese and German mean curves, even though the number of nondenoting words is very close.",
        "Congruence classes.",
        "In general in order to compare the rules being used by languages, we consolidated across languages as much as possible.",

        "This has as a consequence that the grammatical rules were differentiated only by the order of occurrence of the semantic categories in the rule and not by the appearance of nondenoting words.",
        "In other words, two rules that have exactly the same semantic categories appearing in exactly the same order, independent of the appearance of nondenoting words, are treated as the same rule.",
        "(See Table 5).",
        "It is our feeling that this kind of congruence reduction is desirable in order to get a real semantic comparison of the comprehension grammars generated for different languages.",
        "The occurrence of e in Table 4 indicates that the language used the same grammatical rule as another language, but with no nondenoting word occurring.",
        "A consequence of what has just been said is that a particular grammatical rule with congruence notation may permit an instantiation in a given language of a grammatical form not instantiated in the corpus itself.",
        "For the purposes of comprehension as opposed to production, this does not lead to difficulties.",
        "There are a number of descriptive remarks to be made about Table 4.",
        "Congruence class -yi is made up of various forms of definite articles, including in the case of Russian, and Japanese, the null word 6, because these two languages do not standardly use a definite article.",
        "The same remark applies to class 72 for indefinite articles.",
        "In introducing classes 71 and 72 across languages we are admittedly introducing a coarse-grained but useful clustering of nondenoting words that function rather similarly in different languages.",
        "More refinements of congruence of meaning and use could lead to the division of -n, and also 72, into several smaller classes.",
        "The class -y3 is specific to French because several words are required to express the idea of medium as in medium screw, namely the phrase de taille moyenne.",
        "We recognize the resulting analysis is a distortion of the natural semantics of the French.",
        "The distortion arises from the English lexical bias, but not grammatical bias, built into our fixed set of denoting words in the internal language.",
        "Given that Chinese is not an inflected language, as German is, the number of nondenoting words in Table 4 is large.",
        "We cannot discuss in detail all of these particles.",
        "The particle ba occurs before noun phrases describing direct objects of actions.",
        "The particle zai occurs before noun phrases describing objects of relations.",
        "We note that",
        "But to put zai before a relation word is not correct Chinese.",
        "This superset causes no problem for comprehension, and the correct instances are when e is used rather than zai.",
        "Remarks very similar to those for zai apply to chao.",
        "The difference in their use reflects a semantic distinction we do not need for comprehension but would need for production.",
        "The particle zai is used mainly in connection with relations of position such as on and under.",
        "In contrast chao is used in connection with the direction of motion.",

        "In the next columns we list the languages in the following order: English, Dutch, German, French, Spanish, Catalan, Russian, Chinese, Korean, Japanese.",
        "To each internal production rule corresponds in general a set of language specific rules.",
        "In the case of Rules VII and XI the set is a unit set for the obvious reason that no variation can arise in our limited internal language.",
        "Clearly in a more general setting, in the case of Rule VII, for example, relations could have modifying properties.",
        "The most important contrast between the Indo-European and Asian languages is that in the Indo-European languages the imperative verb expressing action is usually at the beginning of an utterance, but in the Asian languages it is usually in final position.",
        "See, for example, the two rules derived from Rule II.",
        "The first is for the seven Indo-European languages and the second for the three Asian languages.",
        "Similar remarks hold for the three rules derived from Rule III.",
        "This well-known contrast between the two groups of languages leads to a more systematic question about the rules given in Table 5.",
        "Does the set of rules corresponding to each rule of the internal language exhaust the possible permutations of the order of the semantic categories?",
        "Surprisingly the answer is affirmative except for the set generated by Rule III, which has only three members rather than six.",
        "However, reflecting only on the three languages controlled as native speakers by the authors of this article, we can give simple examples within the vocabulary and conceptual framework of our various corpora exhibiting two of the missing permutations: A3 G 0",
