        "A classic problem in word frequency studies is, however, that these analytical expressions tend to overestimate the observed vocabulary size, irrespective of whether these expressions are nonparametric (Good 1953; Good and Toulmin 1956; Muller 1979; Brunet 1978) or parametric (Sichel 1986; Khmaladze and Chitashvili 1989; Chitashvili and Baayen 1993) in nature.",
        "Although the theoretical or expected vocabulary size E[V (N)] generally is of the same order of magnitude as the observed vocabulary size, the lack of precision one observes time and again casts serious doubt on the reliability of a number of measures in word frequency statistics.",
        "For instance, Baayen (1989, 1992) and Baayen and Renouf (1996) exploit the Good-Turing estimate for the probability of sampling unseen types (Good 1953) to develop measures for the degree of productivity of affixes, Baayen and Sproat (to appear) apply this Good-Turing estimate to obtain enhanced estimates of lexical priors for unseen words, and the Good-Turing estimates also play an important role for estimating population probabilities (Church and Gale 1991).",
