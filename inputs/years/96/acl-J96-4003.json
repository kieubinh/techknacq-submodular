        "A fundamental debate in the machine learning of language has been the role of prior knowledge in the learning process.",
        "Nativist models suggest that learning in a complex domain like natural language requires that the learning mechanism either have some previous knowledge about language, or some learning bias that helps direct the formation of correct generalizations.",
        "In linguistics, theories of such prior knowledge are referred to as Universal Grammar (UG); nativist linguistic models of learning assume, implicitly or explicitly, that some kind of prior knowledge that contributes to language learning is innate, a product of evolution.",
        "Despite sharing this assumption, nativist researchers disagree strongly about the exact constitution of this Universal Grammar.",
        "Many models, for example, assume that much of the prior knowledge that children bring to bear in learning language is not linguistic at all, but derives from constraints imposed by our general cognitive architecture.",
        "Others, such the influential Principles and Parameters model (Chomsky 1981), assert that what is innate is linguistic knowledge itself, and that the learning process consists mainly of searching for the values of a relatively small number of parameters.",
        "Such nativist models of phonological learning include, for example, Dresher and Kaye's (1990) model of the acquisition of stress-assignment rules, and Tesar and Smolensky's (1993) model of learning in Optimality Theory.",
        "Other scholars have argued that a purely nativist, parameterized learning algorithm is incapable of dealing with the noise, irregularity, and great variation of human language data, and that a more empiricist learning paradigm is possible.",
        "Such data-driven models include the stress acquisition models of Daelemans, Gillis, and Durieux (1994) (an application of Instance-based Learning [Aha, Kibler, and Albert 1991]) and Gupta and Touretzky (1994) (an application of Error Back-Propagation), as well as Elli-son's (1992) Minimum-Description-Length-based model of the acquisition of the basic concepts of syllabicity and the sonority hierarchy.",
        "In each of these cases a general, domain-independent learning rule (BP, IBL, MDL) is used to learn directly from the data.",
        "In this paper we suggest that an alternative to the purely nativist or purely empiricist learning paradigms is to represent the prior knowledge of language as a set of abstract learning biases, which guide an empirical inductive learning algorithm.",
        "Such biases are implicit, for example, in the work of Riley (1991) and Withgott and Chen (1993), who induced decision trees to predict the realization of a phone in its context.",
        "By initializing the decision-tree inducer with a set of phonological features, they essentially gave it a priori knowledge about the kind of phonological generalizations that the system might be expected to learn.",
        "Our idea is that abstract biases from the domain of phonology, whether innate (i.e., part of UG) or merely learned prior to the learning of rules, can be used to guide a domain-independent empirical induction algorithm.",
        "We test this idea by examining the machine learning of simple Sound Pattern of English (SPE)-style phonological rules (Chomsky and Halle 1968), beginning by representing phonological rules as finite-state transducers that accept underlying forms as input and generate surface forms as output.",
        "Johnson (1972) first observed that traditional phonological rewrite rules can be expressed as regular (finite-state) relations if one accepts the constraint that no rule may reapply directly to its own output.",
        "This means that finite-state transducers (FSTs) can be used to represent phonological rules, greatly simplifying the problem of parsing the output of phonological rules in order to obtain the underlying, lexical forms (Koskenniemi 1983; Karttunen 1993; Pulman and Hepple 1993; Bird 1995; Bird and Ellison 1994).",
        "The fact that the weaker generative capacity of FSTs makes them easier to",
        "learn than arbitrary context-sensitive rules has allowed the development of a number of learning algorithms including those for deterministic finite-state automata (FSAs) (Freund et al.",
        "1993), deterministic transducers (Oncina, Garcia, and Vidal 1993), as well as nondeterministic (stochastic) FSAs (Stolcke and Omohundro 1993; Stolcke and Omohundro 1994; Ron, Singer, and Tishby 1994).",
        "Like the empiricist models discussed above, these algorithms are all general-purpose; none include any domain knowledge about phonology, or indeed natural language; at most they include a bias toward simpler models (like the MDL-inspired algorithms of Ellison [1992]).",
        "Our experiments were based on the OSTIA (Oncina, Garcia, and Vidal 1993) algorithm, which learns general subsequential finite-state transducers (SFSTs; formally defined in Section 2).",
        "We presented pairs of underlying and surface forms to OSTIA, and examined the resulting transducers.",
        "Although OSTIA is capable of learning arbitrary SFSTs in the limit, large dictionaries of actual English pronunciations did not give enough samples to correctly induce phonological rules.",
        "We then augmented OSTIA with three kinds of learning biases, which are specific to natural language phonology, and are assumed explicitly or implicitly by every theory of phonology: faithfulness (underlying segments tend to be realized similarly on the surface), community (similar segments behave similarly), and context (phonological rules need access to variables in their context).",
        "These biases are so fundamental to generative phonology that they are left implicit in many theories.",
        "But explicitly modifying the OSTIA algorithm with these biases allowed it to learn more compact, accurate, and general transducers, and our implementation successfully learns a number of rules from English and German.",
        "The algorithm is also successful in learning the composition of multiple rules applied in series.",
        "The more difficult problem of decomposing the learned underlying/surface correspondences into simple, individual rules remains unsolved.",
        "Our transducer induction algorithm is not intended as a cognitive model of human phonological learning.",
        "First, for reasons of simplicity, we base our model on simple segmental SPE-style rules; it is not clear what the formal correspondence is of these rules to the more recent theoretical machinery of phonology (e.g., optimality constraints).",
        "Second, we assume that a cognitive model of automaton induction would be more stochastic and hence more robust than the OSTIA algorithm underlying our work.'",
        "Rather, our model is intended to suggest the kind of biases that may be added to empiricist induction models to build a learning model for phonological rules that is cognitively and computationally plausible.",
        "Furthermore, our model is not necessarily nativist; these biases may be innate, but they may also be the product of some other earlier learning algorithm, as the results of Ellison (1992) and Brown et al.",
        "(1992) suggest (see Section 5.2).",
        "So our results suggest that assuming in the system some very general and fundamental properties of phonological knowledge (whether innate or previously learned) and learning others empirically may provide a basis for future learning models.",
        "Ellison (1994), for example, has shown how to map the optimality constraints of Prince and Smolensky (1993) to finite-state automata; given this result, models of",
        "automaton induction enriched in the way we suggest may contribute to the current debate on optimality learning.",
        "This may obviate the need to build in every phonological constraint, as for example nativist models of OT learning suggest (Prince and Smolensky 1993; Tesar and Smolensky 1993; Tesar 1995).",
        "We hope in this way to begin to help assess the role of computational phonology in answering the general question of the necessity and nature of linguistic innateness in learning.",
        "The next sections (2 and 3) introduce the idea of representing phonological rules with transducers, and describe the OSTIA algorithm for inducing such transducers.",
        "Section 4 shows that the unaugmented OSTIA algorithm is unable to induce the correct transducer for the simple flapping rule of American English.",
        "Section 5 then describes each of the augmentations to OSTIA, based on the faithfulness, community, and context principles.",
        "We conclude with some observations about computational complexity and the inherent bias of the context-sensitive rewrite-rule formalism."

        "In addition, giving the model more training data does not seem to help it induce a smaller or better model; the best transducer was the one with the smallest number of training samples.",

        "The resulting decision trees describe the behavior of the machine at a given state in terms of the next input symbol by generalizing from the arcs leaving the state.",
        "Since we are generalizing over arcs at a given state of an induced transducer, rather than directly from the original training set of transductions, the input to the ID3 algorithm is limited to the number of phonemes, and is not proportional to the size of the original training set.",
        "We begin by briefly summarizing the decision-tree induction algorithm.",
        "A decision tree takes a set of properties that describe an object and outputs a decision about that object.",
        "It represents the process of making a decision as a rooted tree, in which each internal node represents a test of the value of a given property, and each leaf node represents a decision.",
        "A decision about an object is reached by descending the tree, at each node taking the branch indicated by the object's value for the property at that node.",
        "The decision is then read off from the leaf node reached.",
        "We will use decision trees to decide what actions and outputs a transducer should produce given certain phonological inputs.",
        "Thus the internal nodes of the tree will correspond to tests of the values of phonological features, while the leaf nodes will correspond to state transitions and outputs from the transducer.",
        "The ID3 algorithm is given a set of objects, each labeled with feature values and a decision, and builds a decision tree for a problem given.",
        "It does this by iteratively",
        "choosing the single feature that best splits the data, i.e., that is the information-theoretically best single predictor of the decision for the samples.",
        "A node is built for this feature, and examples are divided into subsets based on their values for it.",
        "These values are attached to the new node's children, and the algorithm is run again on the children's subsets, until each leaf node has a set of samples that are all of the same category.",
        "Thus for each state in a transducer, we gave the algorithm the set of arcs leaving the state (the samples), the phonological features of the next input symbol (the features), and the output/transition behaviors of the automaton (the decisions).",
        "Because we used binary phonological features, we obtained binary decision trees (although we could just as easily have used multivalued features).",
        "The alignment information previously calculated between input and output strings is used again in determining which arcs have the same behavior.",
        "Two arcs are considered to have the same behavior if the same phonological features have changed between the input segment and the output segment that corresponds to it, and if the preceding and following output segments of the two arcs are identical.",
        "The same 26 binary phonological features used in calculating edit distance were used to classify segments in the decision trees.",
        "It is worth noting that conflicts in the input to the ID3 algorithm (where the same path to a leaf covers examples that behave differently) are impossible: no two phonemes agree in every feature, and because our transducers are deterministic, there is at most one arc leaving a state labeled with a given input phoneme.",
        "Figure 15 shows a resulting decision tree that generalized the transducer in Figure 13 to avoid the problem of certain inputs \"falling off\" the transducer.",
        "We automatically induced this decision tree from the arcs leaving state 1 in the machine of Figure 13.",
        "The outcomes at the leaves of the decision tree specify the output of the next transition to be taken in terms of the input segment, as well as as the transition's destination state.",
        "We use square brackets to indicate which phonological features of the input segment are changed in the output; the empty brackets in Figure 15 simply indicate that the output segment is identical to the input segment.",
        "Note that if the underlying phone is a t ([-rhotic,-voice,-continuant,-high,+coronal]), the machine jumps to state 2.",
        "If the underlying phone is an r, the machine outputs r and goes to state 1.",
        "Otherwise, the machine outputs its input and moves to state 0.",
        "Because the decision tree specifies a state transition and an output string for every possible combination of phonological features, one can no longer \"fall off\" the machine, no matter what the next input segment is.",
        "Thus in a transducer built using the newly induced decision tree for state 1, such as the machine in Figure 18, the arc from state 1 to state 0 is taken on seeing any vowel, including the six vowels missing from the arc of the machine in Figure 13.",

        "Our final problem with the unaugmented OSTIA algorithm concerns phonological rules that are both very general and also contain rightward context effects.",
        "In these rules, the transducer must wait to see the right-hand context of a rule before emitting the rule's output, and the rule applies to a general enough set of phones that additional states are necessary to store information about the pending output.",
        "In such cases, a separate state is necessary for each phone to which the rule applies.",
        "Thus, because subsequential transducers are an inefficient model of these sorts of rules, representing them leads to an explosion in the number of states of the machine, and an inability to represent certain generalizations.",
        "One example of such state explosion is the German rule to devoice word-final stops:",
        "– sonorant [ –voiced ] I # – continuant",
        "In this case, a separate state must be created for each stop subject to devoicing, as in Figure 20.",
        "Upon seeing a voiced stop, the transducer jumps to the appropriate state, without emitting any output.",
        "If the end-of-word symbol follows, the corresponding unvoiced stop will be emitted.",
        "If any other symbol follows, however, the original",
        "Transducer for word-final stop devoicing.",
        "[] indicates that the input symbol is emitted with no features changed.",
        "voiced stop will be emitted, along with the current input symbol.",
        "In essence, the algorithm has learned three distinct rules:",
        "(10) b --- p / _ # (11) d --* t / _ # (12) g . – k / _ #",
        "Because of the inability to refer to previous input symbols, it is impossible to make a subsequential transducer that captures the generalization of the rule in (9).",
        "While the larger transducer of Figure 20 is accurate, the smaller transducer is desirable for a number of reasons.",
        "First, rules applying to larger classes of phones will lead to an even greater explosion in the number of states.",
        "Second, depending on the particular training data, this lack of generalization can cause the transducer to make mistakes on learning such rules.",
        "As mentioned in Section 4, smaller transducers significantly improve the general accuracy of the learning algorithm.",
        "We turn to the context principle for an intuition about how to solve this problem.",
        "The context principle suggests that phonological rules refer to variables in their context.",
        "We found that subsequential transducers tend to handle leftward context much better than rightward context.",
        "This is because a separate state is only necessary for each distinct context in which segments behave differently.",
        "The behavior of different phones within each context is represented by the different arcs, without making separate states necessary.",
        "Thus our transducers only needed to be modified to deal with rightward context.4 Our solution is to add a simple kind of memory to the model of transduction.",
        "The transducer keeps track of the input symbols seen so far.",
        "Just as the generalized arcs can now specify one of their output symbols as being the current input symbol with certain phonological features changed, they are now able to reference previous",
        "Word-final stop devoicing with variables.",
        "Variables are denoted by a number indicating the position of the input segment being referred to and a set of phonological features to change.",
        "Thus 0[1 simply denotes the current input segment, while –1[–voiced +tense] means the unvoiced, tense version of the previous input segment.",
        "–1[1 –0[1 indicates that the machine outputs a string consisting of the previous input segment followed by the current segment.",
        "input symbols.",
        "The transducer for word-final stop devoicing using variables is shown in Figure 21.",
        "It is important to note that while we are changing the model of transduction, we are not increasing its formal power.",
        "As long as the alphabet is of finite size, any machine using variables can be translated into a potentially much larger machine with separate states for each possible value the variables can take.",
        "When constructing the algorithm's original tree transducer, variables can be included in the output strings of the transducer's arcs.",
        "When performing a transduction, variables are interpreted as referring to a certain symbol in the input string with specific phonological features changed.",
        "The variables contain two pieces of information: an index of the input segment referenced by the variable relative to the current position in the index string, and a (possibly empty) list of phonological feature values to change in the input segment.",
        "After calculating alignment information for each input/output pair, all output symbols determined to have arisen from substitutions (that is, all output segments other than those arising from insertions) are rewritten in variable notation.",
        "The variable's index is the relative index of the corresponding input segment as calculated by the alignment; the features specified by the variable are only those that have changed from the input segment.",
        "Thus rewriting each output symbol in variable notation is done in constant time and adds nothing to the algorithm's computational complexity.",
        "When performing the state mergers of the OSTIA algorithm, two variables are considered to be the same symbol if they agree in both components: the index and list of phonological features.",
        "This allows arcs that previously had different output strings to merge, as for example in the arc from state 1 to state 0 of Figure 21, which is a generalization over the arcs into state 0 in Figure 20.",
        "We applied the modified algorithm with variables in the output strings to the problem of the German rule that devoices word-final stops.",
        "Our data set was constructed from the CELEX lexical database (Celex 1993), which contains pronunciations for 359,611 word forms – including various inflected forms of the same lexeme.",
        "For our experiments we used the CELEX pronunciations as the surface forms, and generated underlying forms by revoicing the (devoiced) final stop for the appropriate forms (those for which the word's orthography ends in a voiced stop).",
        "Although the segment set used was slightly different from that of the English data, the same set of 26 binary articulatory features was used.",
        "Results are shown in Table 8.",
        "Transducer induced for word-final stop devoicing.",
        "[] indicates that the input symbol is emitted with no features changed.",
        "Using the model of transduction augmented with variables, a machine with the minimum two states and perfect performance on test data was induced with 20,000 samples and greater.",
        "This machine is shown in Figure 22.",
        "The only difference between this transducer and the hand-drawn transducer of Figure 21 is that the arcs leaving state 1 go to state 0 rather than looping back to state 1.",
        "Thus the transducer will fail to perform devoicing when two voiced stops occur at the end of a word.",
        "As the corpus contains no such cases, no errors were produced.",
        "As we will discuss in Section 7, this is similar to what occurred in the machine induced for flapping.",
        "section were achieved with a slightly different method than those for the English data.",
        "The difference lies in the order in which state mergers are attempted, and can have significant effects in the results.",
        "We performed experiments using two versions of the algorithm, varying the order in which the algorithm tries to merge pairs of states.",
        "The mergers are performed in a nested loop over the states of the initial tree transducer.",
        "The ordering of states for this loop in the original OSTIA algorithm as described in Oncina, Garcia, and Vidal (1993) is the lexicographic ordering of the string of input symbols as one walks from the root of the tree to the state in question.",
        "This is the method used in the first column of results in Table 9.",
        "In the second column of results, the ordering of the states was simply the order of their creation as the sample transductions were read as input.",
        "This is also the method used in the results previously described for the various English rules.",
        "The correctness of the algorithm requires that the states be ordered such that state numbers always increase as one walks outward from the root of the tree.",
        "This still leaves a large space of permissible orderings, and, as can be seen from our results, the ordering chosen can have a significant effect on the algorithm's outcome.",
        "While",
        "neither method is consistently better in the German experiments, we found that lexicographic orderings performed more poorly than the input-based ordering of the input samples for the English experiments.'",
        "The lexicographic ordering of the original algorithm is not always optimal.",
        "Furthermore, results with lexicographic orderings vary with the ordering of segments used.",
        "The segment ordering used for the results in Table 9 grouped similar segments together, and performed better than a randomized segment ordering.",
        "Presumably this is because the ordering grouping similar segments together causes states reached on similar input symbols to be merged, which is both linguistically reasonable and necessary in order to generate the correct transducer.",
        "The underlying principle of the algorithm is to generalize by reducing the number of states in the transducer.",
        "Because the OSTIA algorithm tends to settle in local minima when merging states, the problem becomes one of searching the space of permissible orderings of state mergers.",
        "Some linguistically based heuristic for ordering states might produce more consistent results on different types of phonological rules, perhaps by reordering the remaining states as the initial states are merged."

        "We will discuss the complexity implication of each of our enhancements to the algorithm.",
        "The calculation of alignment information adds a preprocessing step to the algorithm that requires O(nm) time for the dynamic programming string-alignment algorithm.",
        "After the initial tree is constructed using the alignment information, the above-mentioned worst-case bound still applies for the process of merging states; it does not require that the initial tree be onward.",
        "Since this modification only alters the initial tree transducer, the behavior of the main state-merging loop of the OSTIA algorithm is essentially unchanged.",
        "In practice, we found the use of alignment information significantly sped up the algorithm by allowing states to collapse more quickly.",
        "In any case, the O(nm) complexity of the preprocessing step is subsumed by the O(nmk) term of OSTIA's complexity.",
        "5 The behavior of the input-based ordering depends on the ordering of the training set.",
        "We used a random ordering of our training set, but a corpus-based ordering would not be significantly different.",
        "While more frequent words tend to be seen earlier in a corpus, there is no reason to think that more frequent words provide better chances of successful state mergers.",
        "The induction of decision trees adds a new stage after the OSTIA algorithm completes.",
        "The number of nodes in each decision tree is bounded by 0(k), since there are at most k arcs out of a given state.",
        "Calculating information content of a given feature can be done in 0(k) time because k is an upper bound on the number of possible outcomes of the decision tree.",
        "Therefore, choosing the feature with the maximum information content can be done in 0(fk) time, where f is the number of features, and the entire decision tree can be learned in 0(fk2) time.",
        "Since there are at most n states, this stage of the algorithm is 0(nfk2).",
        "However, because k is relatively small and because decision trees are induced only after merging states down to a small number, decision-tree induction in fact takes only a fraction the time of any other step of computation.",
        "The process of pruning the trees, however, is very expensive, as the entire training set is verified after each pruning operation.",
        "Since each verification of the input is 0(nk), and there are 0(k) nodes at each of 0(n) states to attempt to prune, one iteration through the set of states attempting pruning at each state is therefore 0(n2k2).",
        "There are at most 0(nk) iterations through the states, since at least one node of one state's decision tree must be pruned in each iteration.",
        "Therefore, the entire pruning process is 0(n3k3).",
        "This is a rather pessimistic bound since pruning occurs after state merger, and there are generally far less than nk states left.",
        "In fact, adding input pairs makes finding the smallest possible automaton more likely, and reduces the number of states at which pruning is necessary.",
        "Nevertheless the verification of pruning operations dominates all other steps of computation.",
        "Once alignment information for each input/output pair has been computed, an output symbol can be rewritten in variable notation in constant time.",
        "Using variables can increase the size of the output alphabet, but none of the complexity calculations depend on this size.",
        "Therefore using variables is essentially free and contributes nothing to overall complexity.",
        "After adding all the steps together, we get O(n3(m + k) + nmk + nfk2 + n3k3) time.",
        "Thus, even using the expensive method of verifying the entire training set after each pruning operation, the entire algorithm is still polynomial.",
        "Furthermore, our additions have not worsened the complexity of the algorithm with respect to n, the total number of input string symbols.",
        "On a typical run on 10,000 German words with final stop devoicing applied using a SPARC 10, calculating alignment information, rewriting each output string in variable notation and building the initial tree transducer took 19 seconds, the state merging took 5 seconds, inducing the decision trees took under 1 second, and the pruning took 16 minutes and 1 second.",
        "When running on 50,000 words from the same data set, alignment, variable notation, and building the initial tree took 1 minute 37 seconds, the state merging took 4 minutes 44 seconds, inducing decision trees took 2 seconds and pruning decision trees took 2 hours, 9 minutes and 9 seconds."

        "which is the equivalent of the transducer learned from the training data.",

Johnson's algorithm sets up a system of constraint equations that C must satisfy, by considering both the positive contexts, i.e., all the contexts C, in which a b occurs on the surface, as well as all the negative contexts Cj in which an a occurs on the surface.",
        "The set of all positive and negative contexts will not generally determine a unique rule, but will determine a set of possible rules.",

        "For each segment, the system uses the version space algorithm to search for the proper statement of the context.",

        "Our goal in this paper has been to explore the role of prior knowledge in phonological learning.",
        "We showed that a domain-independent, empiricist induction algorithm, OSTIA, failed to induce minimal transducers even for very simple rules like flapping.",
        "But adding three domain-specific learning biases to OSTIA allowed it to successfully learn transducers implementing simple phonological rules of English and German: faithfulness (underlying segments tend to be realized similarly on the surface), community (similar segments behave similarly), and context (phonological rules need access to variables in their context).",
        "These biases are so fundamental to generative phonology that, although they are present in some respect in every phonological theory, they are left implicit in most.",
        "Furthermore, we have shown that some of the remaining errors in our augmented model are due to implicit biases in the traditional SPE-style rewrite system that are not similarly represented in the transducer formalism, suggesting that while transducers may be formally equivalent to rewrite rules, they may not have identical evaluation procedures.",
        "Because our biases were applied to the learning of very simple SPE-style rules, and to a nonprobabilistic theory of purely deterministic transducers, we do not expect that our model as implemented has any practical use as a phonological learning device.",
        "Indeed, because of the noise and nondeterminism inherent to linguistic data, we feel strongly that stochastic algorithms for language induction are much more likely to be a fruitful research direction (e.g., Kupiec 1992; Lucke 1993; Stolcke and Omohundro 1993, 1994; Ron, Singer, and Tishby 1994).",
        "But we believe that the biases we have relied on to improve the OSTIA algorithm may also prove useful when applied to such stochastic linguistic-rule induction algorithms.",
        "For example Wooters and Stolcke",
        "(1994) used the Stolcke and Omohundro model-merging algorithm to induce word-pronunciation HMMs for a speech recognition system.",
        "This algorithm has no domain knowledge about phonology, and so is unable to classify together similar phones, or generalize across phones that were missing in the input data.",
        "Adding phonological feature biases to such a model could improve its generalization performance just as it improved OSTIA.",
        "In summary, we believe that augmenting an empirical learning element with relatively abstract learning biases is a very fruitful ground for research between the often restated strict nativist and strict empiricist language learning paradigms."
