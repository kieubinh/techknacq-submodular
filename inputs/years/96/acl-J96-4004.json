        "The main feature is that there is no fixed, predetermined order of morphological, syntactic, and semantic analysis, since the control mechanism is a nondeterministic one.",

        "Our system further differs from APRIL in the following aspects: (i) APRIL begins with an arbitrary parse tree whereas our system begins with no parse structure; (ii) APRIL's plausibility measure is defined using statistics collected from a treebank of manually parsed English text while ours is derived from mutual information statistics and linguistic constraints; (iii) parse trees in APRIL are immediate-constituency type while ours are dependency-based.",
        "That is, nodes in our system are either characters, words, or chunks.",
        "There are no nonterminal nodes defined with grammatical categories.",

        "Furthermore, certain features of the system, namely, the stochastic selection of a codelet by relative urgencies, the use of the conceptual network as a top-down controller, the interactions between the conceptual network and the workspace, enable the system to dynamically decide on the number and the types of codelets to be generated.",
        "The real bottleneck when scaling-up is the acquisition of linguistic descriptions, as our current work has limited breadth and depth of coverage.",
        "Therefore, the current system has less practical value to people working on the word segmentation problem, where the main concern is to develop algorithms that work for large-scale text.",
        "However, the proposed model provides a useful architecture for us to study the root of what people do when they encounter unknown words in text.",
        "This issue of unknown-word resolution has been the single major problem in the segmentation of unrestricted text.",
        "Understanding how higher-level knowledge is brought to bear on this issue is essential to the design of an effective solution.",
        "Hence, our next goal is to apply the model to handle the unknown-word problem, including treatments of unknown compounds such as personal names, previously unseen place names, foreign names in transliteration, and company names."
