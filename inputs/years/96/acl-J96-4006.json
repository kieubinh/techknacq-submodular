        "A long-standing debate in the computational linguistic community is about the generality of lexical taxonomies.",
        "Many linguists (Nirenburg 1995; Hirst 1995) stress that taxonomies that are not language neutral, at least at the intermediate and high level, have little hope of success.",
        "On the other hand, lexicon builders who have experience of designing taxonomies for real applications claim that in sublanguages there exist very domain-dependent similarity relations.",
        "Given our experience and results, we are inclined to take the second position, but we are indeed sensitive to the theoretical motivations of the first.",
        "The problem is that the similarity relations suggested by the thematic structures of words' in sentences are highly domain dependent, and it is difficult, though perhaps not impossible, to find common invariants across sublanguages when this model of word similarity is adopted.",
        "On the other hand, conceptual, or compositional models of similarity are much more difficult to understand and formalize on a systematic basis, because of the difficulty of defining a commonly agreed upon set of semantic primitives into which words may be decomposed.",
        "It may be possible, however, and highly interesting, to integrate the results of a purely inductive method, such as the conceptual clustering system CIAULA (Basili, Pazienza, and Velardi 1993c, 1996a), and a hand-encoded, domain-general classification, such as, for example, WordNet.",
        "The purpose of one such experiment, which we describe in this paper, is to find some points of contact between psychologically motivated models, as WordNet, and data-driven models, as CIAULA.2"

        "The input observations (instances) for our concept-formation algorithm are verb observations in sentences, represented by their generalized thematic structures, acquired semiautomatically from corpora by ARIOSTO_LEX (Basili, Pazienza, and Velardi 1993a, 1993b, 1996b).",

        "The results of repeated experiments showed that CIAULA is able, upon an appropriate setting of the model parameters, to detect similarity relations in the thematic structure of verbs, and to provide a probabilistic and semantic description of the acquired clusters.",
        "We observed that, by tuning the model parameters to obtain clusters of \"very similar\" instances, a percentage varying between 30% and 60% of verbs (depending upon the number of input observations) belong to singletons, that is, are not \"similar enough\" to any other verb.",
        "If we relax these constraints, we obtain larger clusters and fewer singletons, but verbs in a cluster are less semantically close to each other.",

        "Rather, our purpose is to identify commonalities and discrepancies, and to investigate the possibility of profitably integrating the two approaches.",
        "One of the motivations for using WordNet is that, in WordNet, verb meaning is represented in terms of semantic relations, rather than semantic primitives (Miller and Fellbaum 1991).",

        " Let C be a cluster automatically derived by CIAULA (Basili et al.",

        "If gr(h,) is the number of incoming IS_A arcs for a supertype, that is the number of synsets of v, that point to h1, an intuitive algorithm would be to select as the best supertype for a cluster the one that maximizes gr(h,) values.",
        "Things, however, are more complex.",
        "First, we must apply some normalization in order to reduce the noise caused by the more ambiguous verbs.",
        "Second, we must balance the effect of verbs that have more than one synset pointing to the same hi.",
        "In fact, a supertype could gain evidence only because several senses of the same verb point to it.",

        "During a first experiment, we ran the tagging algorithm using unrestricted sets of verbs first clustered by CIAULA.",

        "In general, lists of words or phrases are used in place of a single label, so that the reader may have an idea of what is really meant.",
        "But the higher the node, the deeper the \"meaning\" behind a hyperonim, the harder is the human task of evaluating the appropriateness of a classification.",
        "Looking more in detail, the problem with misclassifications is twofold.",
        "In some cases, the problem is the overambiguity and the very fine-grained concept labels adopted in WordNet.",
        "Especially with large CIAULA clusters, the number of synsets becomes too large, and the algorithm does not gain enough evidence of any significantly promising pattern in the hierarchy.",
        "The second problem is the overspecificity of CIAULA.",

        "In a second set of experiments, we ran CIAULA on a more homogeneous set of verbs.",
