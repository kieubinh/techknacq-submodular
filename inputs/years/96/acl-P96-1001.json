        "It is well known that Higher-Order Unification (HOU) can be used to construct the semantics of Natural Language: (Dalrymple et al., 1991) - henceforth, DSP - show that it allows a treatment of VP-Ellipsis which successfully captures the interaction of VPE with quantification and nominal anaphora; (Pulman, 1995; Gardent and Kohlhase, 1996) use HOU to model the interpretation of focus and its interaction with focus sensitive operators, adverbial quantifiers and second occurrence expressions; (Gardent et al., 1996) shows that HOU yields a simple but precise treatment of corrections; Finally, (Pinkal, 1995) uses linear HOU to reconstruct underspecified semantic representations.",
        "However, it is also well known that the HOU approach to NL semantics systematically over-generates and that some general theory of the interface between the interpretation process and other sources of linguistic information is needed in order to avoid this.",
        "In their treatment of VP-ellipsis, DSP introduce an informal restriction to avoid over-generation: the Primary Occurrence Restriction (P OR).",
        "Although this restriction is intuitive and linguistically well-motivated, it does not provide a general theoretical framework for extra-semantic constraints.",
        "In this paper, we argue that Higher-Order Coloured Unification (HOCU, (cf. sections 3,6), a restricted form of HOU developed independently for theorem proving, provides the needed general framework.",
        "We start out by showing that the HOCU approach allows for a precise and intuitive modeling of DSP's Primary Occurrence Restriction (cf. section 3.1).",
        "We then show that the POR can be extended to capture linguistic restrictions on other phenomena (focus, second occurrence expressions and adverbial quantification) provided that the notion of primary occurrence is suitably adjusted (cf. section 4).",
        "Obviously a treatment of the interplay of these phenomena and their related notion of primary occurrence is only feasible given a precise and well-understood theoretical framework.",
        "We illustrate this by an example in section 4.4.",
        "Finally, we illustrate the generality of the HOCU framework by using it to encode a completely different constraint, namely Kratzer's binding principle (cf. section 5)."

        "The basic idea underlying the use of HOU for NL semantics is very simple: the typed A-calculus is used as a semantic representation language while semantically underspecified elements (e.g. anaphors and ellipses) are represented by free variables whose value is determined by solving higher-order equations.",

        "For first order logic, this problem is decidable and the set of solutions can be represented by a single most general unifier.",
        "For the typed A-calculus, the problem is undecidable, but there is an algorithm which - given a solvable equation - will enumerate a complete set of solutions for this equation (Huet, 1975).",
        "Note that in (1), unification yields a linguistically valid solution (1d) but also an invalid one: (le).",
        "To remedy this shortcoming, DSP propose an informal restriction, the Primary Occurrence Restriction: Given a labeling of occurrences as either primary or secondary, the POR excludes of the set of linguistically valid solutions, any solution which contains a primary occurrence.",
        "Here, a primary occurrence is an occurrence that is directly associated with a source parallel element.",
        "Neither the notion of direct association, nor that of parallelism is given a formal definition; but given an intuitive understanding of these notions, a source parallel element is an element of the source (i.e. antecedent) clause which has a parallel counterpart in the target (i.e. elliptic or anaphoric) clause.",
        "To see how this works, consider example (1) again.",
        "In this case, dan is taken to be a primary occurrence because it represents a source parallel element which is neither anaphoric nor controlled i.e. it is directly associated with a source parallel element.",
        "Given this, equation (lc) becomes (2a) with solutions (2b) and (2c) (primary occurrences are underlined).",
        "Since (2c) contains a primary occurrence, it is ruled out by the POR and is thus excluded from the set of linguistically valid solutions.",

        "As DSP themselves note, a general theory for the POR is called for.",
        "Second, their method is a generate-and-test method: all logically valid solutions are generated before those solutions that violate the POR and are linguistically invalid are eliminated.",
        "While this is sufficient for a theoretical analysis, for actual computation it would be preferable never to produce these solutions in the first place.",

        "Thus we have all the known theoretical results, such as the fact that /3n-reduction always terminates producing unique normal forms and that On-equality can be tested by reducing to normal form and comparing for syntactic equality.",

        "In contrast to this, higher-order unification tests for satisfiability by finding a substitution o that makes a given equation M = N valid (cr(M) =on a-(N)), even if the original equation is not (M Ofin N).",

        "Fortunately, in our case we are not interested in general unification, but we can use the fact that our formulae belong to very restricted syntactic subclasses, for which much better results are known.",
        "In particular, the fact that free variables only occur on the left hand side of our equations reduces the problem of finding solutions to higher-order matching, of which decidability has been proven for the subclass of third-order formulae (Dowek, 1992) and is conjectured for the general case.",
