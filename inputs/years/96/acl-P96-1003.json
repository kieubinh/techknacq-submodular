        "The document collections involved in IR are often gigabytes of unrestricted natural-language text.",
        "A user's query may be expressed in a controlled language (e.g., a boolean expression of keywords) or, more desirably, a natural language, such as English.",
        "A typical IR system works as follows.",
        "The documents to be retrieved are processed to extract indexing terms or content carriers, which are usually",

        "The indexing terms provide a description of the document's content.",
        "Weights are often assigned to terms to indicate how well they describe the document.",
        "A (natural-language) query is processed in a similar way to extract query terms.",
        "Query terms are then matched against the indexing terms of a document to determine the relevance of each document to the query.",
        "The ultimate goal of an IR system is to increase both precision, the proportion of retrieved documents that are relevant, as well as recall, the proportion of relevant document that are retrieved.",
        "However, the real challenge is to understand and represent appropriately the content of a document and query, so that the relevance decision can be made efficiently, without degrading precision and recall.",
        "A typical solution to the problem of making relevance decisions efficient is to require exact matching of indexing terms and query terms, with an evaluation of the 'hits' based on a scoring metric.",
        "Thus, for instance, in vector-space models of relevance ranking, both the indexing terms of a document and the query terms are treated as vectors (with individual term weights) and the similarity between the two vectors is given by a cosine-distance measure, essentially the angle between any two vectors.2"

        "One can regard almost any IR system as performing an NLP task: text is 'parsed' for terms and terms are used to express 'meaning' – to capture document content.",
        "Clearly, most traditional IR systems do not attempt to find structure in the natural-language text in the 'parsing' process; they merely extract word-like strings to use in indexing.",
        "Ideally, however, extracted structure would directly reflect the encoded linguistic relations among terms-captuing the conceptual content of the text better than simple word-strings.",
        "There are several prerequisites for effective NLP in an IR application, including the following.",
        "1.",
        "Ability to process large amounts of text",
        "The amount of text in the databases accessed by modem IR systems is typically measured in gigabytes.",
        "This requires that the NLP used must be extraordinarily efficient in both its time and space requirements.",
        "It would be impractical to use a parser with the speed of one or two sentences per second.",
        "2.",
        "Ability to process unrestricted text The text database for an IR task is generally unrestricted natural-language text possibly encompassing many different domains and topics.",
        "A parser must be able to manage the many kinds of problems one sees in natural-language corpora, including the processing of unknown words, proper names, and unrecognized structures.",
        "Often more is required, as when spelling, transcription, or OCR errors occur.",
        "Thus, the NLP used must be especially robust.",
        "3.",
        "Need for shallow understanding While the large amount of unrestricted text makes NLP more difficult for IR, the fact that a deep and complete understanding of the text may not be necessary for IR makes NLP for IR relatively easier than other NLP tasks such as machine translation.",
        "The goal of an IR system is essentially to classify documents (as relevant or irrelevant) vis-a-vis a query.",
        "Thus, it may suffice to have a shallow and partial representation of the content of documents.",

        "And a few systems, such as CLARIT – which uses simplex noun phrases, attested subphrases, and contained words as index terms – and New York University's TREC system5 – which uses \"head-modifier pairs\" derived from identified noun phrases – have demonstrated the practicality and effectiveness of thorough NLP in IR tasks.",

        "We can see, then, that it is desirable to distinguish – and, if possible, extract – two kinds of phrases: those that behave as lexical atoms and those that reflect more general linguistic relations.",
        "Lexical atoms help us by obviating the possibility of extraneous word matches that have nothing to do with true relevance.",
        "We do not want \"hot\" or \"dog\" to match on \"hot dog\".",
        "In essence, we want to eliminate the effect of the independence assumption at the word level by creating new words – the lexical atoms – in which the individual word dependencies are explicit (structural).",
        "More general phrases help us by adding detail.",
        "Indeed, all possible phrases (or paraphrases) of actual content in a document are potentially valuable in indexing.",
        "In practice, of course, the indexing term space has to be limited, so it is necessary to select a subset of phrases for indexing.",
        "Short phrases (often nominal compounds) are preferred over long complex phrases, because short phrases have better chances for matching short phrases in queries and will still match longer phrases owing to the short phrases they have in common.",
        "Using only short phrases also helps solve the phrase normalization problem of matching syntactically different long phrases (when they share similar meaning).6 Thus, lexical atoms and small nominal compounds should make good indexing phrases.",
        "While the CLARIT system does index at the level of phrases and subphrases, it does not currently index on lexical atoms or on the small compounds that can be derived from complex NPs, in particular, reflecting cross-simplex NP dependency relations.",

        "There are about 3-million simplex NPs in the corpus and about 1.5-million complex NPs.",

        "Queries were processed by the PES and normal CLAM NLP modules, respectively, to generate query terms, which were then used for CLARIT retrieval.",

        "Recall improves slightly (about 1%), as shown in Table 1.",
        "While the actual improvement is not significant for the run of fifty queries, the increase in absolute numbers of relevant documents returned indicates that the small compounds supported better matches in some cases.",
        "Interpolated precision improves significantly, as shown in Table 2.",
        "The general improvement in precision indicates that small compounds provide more accurate (and effective) indexing terms than full NPs.",
        "Precision improves at various returned-document levels, as well, as shown in Table 3.",
        "Initial precision, in particular, improves significantly.",
        "This \"Note that the CLARIT process used as a baseline does not reflect optimum CLARIT performance, e.g., as obtained in actual TREC evaluations, since we did not use a variety of standard CLARIT techniques that significantly improve performance, such as automatic query expansion, distractor space generation, subterm indexing, or differential query-term weighting.",
        "Cf. (Evans et al., 1996) for details.",
        "11(Harman, 1993) suggests that the PES could be used to support other IR enhancements, such as automatic feedback of the top-returned documents to expand the initial query for a second retrieval step.\"",
        "The PES, which was not optimized for processing, required approximately 3.5 hours per 20- megabyte subset of AP89 on a 133-MHz DEC alpha processor.13 Most processing time (more than 2 of every 3.5 hours) was spent on simplex NP parsing.",
        "Such speed might be acceptable in some, smaller-scale IR applications, but it is considerably slower than the baseline speed of CLARIT noun-phrase identification (viz., 200 megabytes per hour on a 100-MIPS processor).",

        "The notion of association-based parsing dates at least from (Marcus, 1980) and has been explored again recently by a number of researchers.14 The method we have developed differs from previous work in that it uses linguistic heuristics and locality scoring along with corpus statistics to generate phrase associations.",
        "The experiment contrasting the PES with baseline processing in a commercial IR system demonstrates a direct, positive effect of the use of lexical atoms, subphrases, and other pharase associations across simplex NPs.",
        "We believe the use of NP-substructure analysis can lead to more effective information management, including more precise IR, text summarization, and concept clustering.",
        "Our future work will explore such applications of the techniques we have described in this paper."
