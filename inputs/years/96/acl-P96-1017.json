        "We focus here on the coordination of syntagmatic categories (as opposite of lexical categories).",
        "More precisely, we account for cases of non constituent coordination (4), of Right Node Raising (5) but not for cases of Gapping.",
        "Our approach which is independent of any framework, is easily and precisely encoded in the formalism of Head Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) (Pollard and Sag, 1994), which is based on the notion of head and makes available the feature sharing mechanism we need.",

        "Two structures are available in case of Conjunction Reductions.",
        "One structure corresponds to a coordination of sentences with a gap of the verb after et, the other one consists in taking the coordinate parallel sequence of constituents as only one structure.",

        "against insurmountable obstacles, chiefly with the problem of applying transformation in reverse, in the analysis process (Schachter, 1973).",
        "A direct approach has been proposed at once by Sag & al.",

        "Whatever the nature of subcategorization information may be, syntactical in GPSG, hybrid in HPSG, functional in LFG, two categories are compatible if they subsume a \"common denominator\", in this case a common partial structure.",
        "Technically, the compatibility is checked by computing a \"generalization\" of categories and imposing the generalization comprises all features expected in the given context.",
        "For example, the context in (6), that is, the verb etre (to be), expects a predicative argument and both categories NP and AP are just predicative categories.",
        "(6) II est le pere de Marie et fier de l'etre.",
        "(He is Mary's father and proud of it.)",
        "However, this solution cannot be applied generally because all coordinations have not such \"natural\" intersection (see (2)).",

        "When the lexical head requires several complements (to ask somebody something), the requirement is said multiple or n-requirement.",
