        "In statistical speech recognition(Bahl et al., 1983), it is necessary to build a language model(LM) for assigning probabilities to hypothesized sentences.",
        "The LM is usually built by collecting statistics of words over a large set of text data.",
        "While doing so is straightforward for English, it is not trivial to collect statistics for Chinese words since word boundaries are not marked in written Chinese text.",
        "Chinese is a morphosyllabic language (DeFrancis, 1984) in that almost all Chinese characters represent a single syllable and most Chinese characters are also morphemes.",
        "Since a word can be multi-syllabic, it is generally non-trivial to segment a Chinese sentence into words(Wu and Tseng, 1993).",
        "Since segmentation is a fundamental problem in Chinese information processing, there is a large literature to deal with the problem.",
        "Recent work includes (Sproat et al., 1994) and (Wang et al., 1992).",
        "In this paper, we adopt a statistical approach to segment Chinese text based on an LM because of its autonomous nature and its capability to handle unseen words.",
        "As far as speech recognition is concerned, what is needed is a model to assign a probability to a string of characters.",
        "One may argue that we could bypass the segmentation problem by building a character-based LM.",
        "However, we have a strong belief that a word-based LM would be better than a character-based' one.",
        "In addition to speech recognition, the use of word based models would have value in information retrieval and other language processing applications.",
        "If word boundaries are given, all established techniques can be exploited to construct an LM (Jelinek et al., 1992) just as is done for English.",
        "Therefore, segmentation is a key issue in building the Chinese LM.",
        "In this paper, we propose a segmentation algorithm based on an LM.",
        "Since building an LM itself needs word boundaries, this is a chicken-and-egg problem.",
        "To get out of this, we propose an iterative procedure that alternates between the segmentation of Chinese text and the construction of the LM.",
        "Our preliminary experiments show that the iterative procedure is able to improve the segmentation accuracy and more importantly, it can detect unseen words automatically.",
        "In section 2, the Viterbi-like segmentation algorithm based on a LM is described.",
        "Then in section section:iter-proc we discuss the alternating procedure of segmentation and building Chinese LMs.",
        "We test the segmentation algorithm and the alternating procedure and the results are reported in sec",
        "tion 4.",
        "Finally, the work is summarized in section 5.",
        "2 segmentation based on LM In this section, we assume there is a word-based Chinese LM at our disposal so that we are able to compute the probability of a sentence (with word boundaries).",
        "We use a Viterbi-like segmentation algorithm based on the LM to segment texts.",
        "Denote a sentence S by GIG • Cn - 1 Cn where each Ci (1 <i < n } is a Chinese character.",
        "To segment a sentence into words is to group these characters into words, i.e.",
        "to trace back to find the segmentation points.",
        "Therefore, it's necessary to record the segmentation points in (10).",
        "Let p(k) be the index of the last character in the preceding word.",
        "Then",
        "that is, Cp(k)+1 • • • Ck comprises the last word of the optimal segmentation up to the kth character.",
        "A typical example of a six-character sentence is shown in table 1.",
        "Since p(6) = 4, we know the last word in the optimal segmentation is C5C6.",
        "Since p(4) = 3, the second last word is C4.",
        "So on and so forth.",
        "The optimal segmentation for this sentence is (C1)(C2C3)(C4)(C5C6) .",
        "where xk is the index of the last character in kth word wk, i,e wk = Cxk_i +1 • • • Cxk (k = 1,2, • .,m), and of course, xo = 0, 5m = n. Note that a segmentation of the sentence S can be uniquely represented by an integer sequence xi, • ,S, so we will denote a segmentation by its corresponding integer sequence thereafter.",
        "Let",
        "be the set of all possible segmentations of sentence S. Suppose a word-based LM is given, then for a segmentation g(S) = (xi • • • xm) E G(S), we can assign a score to g(S) by",
        "where wi = C.,_1+1 • • • Cx3(.i = 1,2, • • , m), and hi is understood as the history words wi • • • wi_i.",
        "In this paper the trigram model(Jelinek et al., 1992) is used and therefore hi = Among all possible segmentations, we pick the one g* with the highest score as our result.",
        "That is,",
        "Note the score depends on segmentation g and this is emphasized by the subscript in (9).",
        "The optimal segmentation g* can be obtained by dynamic programming.",
        "With a slight abuse of notation, let L(k) be the max accumulated score for the first k characters.",
        "L(k) is defined for k = 1, 2, • • • , n with L(1) = 0 and L(g*) = L(n).",
        "Given {L(i) : 1 < i < k – 1}, L(k) can be computed recursively as follows:",
        "where hi is the history words ended with the character C. At the end of the recursion, we need",
        "The searches in (10) and (11) are in general time-consuming.",
        "Since long words are very rare in Chinese(94% words are with three or less characters (Wu and Tseng, 1993)), it won't hurt at all to limit the search space in (10) and (11) by putting an upper bound(say, 10) to the length of the exploring word, i.e, impose the constraint i > maxl, k – d in (10) and (11), where d is the upper bound of Chinese word length.",
        "This will speed the dynamic programming significantly for long sentences.",
        "It is worth of pointing out that the algorithm in (10) and (11) could pick an unseen word(i.e, a word not included in the vocabulary on which the LM is built on) in the optimal segmentation provided LM assigns proper probabilities to unseen words.",
        "This is the beauty of the algorithm that it is able to handle unseen words automatically."

        "We can make a few remarks about the result in table 2.",
        "First of all, it is interesting to note that the agreement of segmentations among human subjects is roughly at the same level of that between human subjects and machine.",
        "This confirms what reported in (Sproat et al., 1994).",
        "The major disagreement for human subjects comes from compound words, phrases and suffices.",
        "Since we don't give any specific instructions to human subjects, one of them tends to group consistently phrases as words because he was implicitly using semantics as his segmentation criterion.",
        "For example, he segments the sentence 3 dao4 jial 1i2 chil dun4 fan4(see table 3) as two words dao4 jial 1i2(go home) and chil dun4 fan4(have a meal) because the two \"words\" are clearly two semantic units.",

        "Chinese has very limited morphology (Spencer, 1991) in that most grammatical concepts are conveyed by separate words and not by morphological processes.",
        "The limited morphology includes some ending morphemes to represent tenses of verbs, and this is another source of disagreement.",
        "For example, for the partial sentence zuo4 wan2 le, where le functions as labeling the verb zuo4 wan2 as \"perfect\" tense, some subjects tend to segment it as two words zuo4 wan2/ le while the other treat it as one single word.",
        "Second, the agreement of each of the subjects with either the original, trigram, or unigram segmentation is quite high (see columns 2, 6, and 7 in Table 2) and appears to be specific to the subject.",
        "Third, it seems puzzling that the trigram LM agrees with the original segmentation better than a unigram model, but gives a worse result when compared with manual segmentations.",
        "However, since the LMs are trained using the presegmented data, the trigram model tends to keep the original segmentation because it takes the preceding two words into account while the unigram model is less restricted to deviate from the original segmentation.",
        "In other words, if trained with \"cleanly\" segmented data, a trigram model is more likely to produce a better segmentation since it tends to preserve the nature of training data."
