        "With the explosive growth of the World-Wide Web (WWW) as information source, it has become routine for Internet users to access textual data written in foreign languages.",
        "In Japan, for example, a dozen or so inexpensive MT tools have recently been put on the market to help PC users understand English text in WWW home pages.",
        "The MT techniques employed in the tools, however, are fairly conventional.",
        "For reasons of affordability, their designers appear to have made no attempt to tackle the well-known problems in MT, such as how to ensure the learnabil-ity of correct translations and facilitate customization.",
        "As a result, users are forced to see the same kinds of translation errors over and over again, except they in cases where they involve merely adding a missing word or compound to a user dictionary, or specifying one of several word-to-word translations as a correct choice.",
        "There are several alternative approaches that might eventually liberate us from this limitation on the usability of MT systems: Unification-based grammar formalisms and lexical-semantics formalisms (see LFG (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982), HPSG (Pollard and Sag, 1987), and Generative Lexicon (Pustejovsky, 1991), for example) have been proposed to facilitate computationally precise description of natural-language syntax and semantics.",
        "It is possible that, with the descriptive power of these grammars and lexicons, individual usages of words and phrases may be defined specifically enough to give correct translations.",
        "Practical implementation of MT systems based on these formalisms, on the other hand, would not be possible without much more efficient parsing and disambiguation algorithms for these formalisms and a method for building a lexicon that is easy even for novices to use.",
        "Corpus-based or example-based MT (Sato and Nagao, 1990; Sumita and Iida, 1991) and statistical MT (Brown et al., 1993) systems provide the easiest customizability, since users have only to supply a collection of source and target sentence pairs (a bilingual corpus).",
        "Two open questions, however, have yet to be satisfactorily answered before we can confidently build commercial MT systems based on these approaches:",
        "• Can the system be used for various domains without showing severe degradation of translation accuracy?",
        "• What is the minimum number of examples (or training data) required to achieve reasonable MT quality for a new domain?",
        "TAG-based MT (Abeille, Schabes, and Joshi, 1990)1 and pattern-based translation (Maruyama, 1993) share many important properties for successful implementation in practical MT systems, namely: • The existence of a polynomial-time parsing algorithm • A capability for describing a larger domain of locality (Schabes, Abeille, and Joshi, 1988) • Synchronization (Shieber and Schabes, 1990) of the source and target language structures",
        "ing algorithm for TAGs has 0(1%76)2 worst case time complexity (Vijay-Shanker, 1987), and that the \"patterns\" in Maruyama's approach are merely context-free grammar (CFG) rules.",
        "Thus, it has been a challenge to find a framework in which we can enjoy both a grammar formalism with better descriptive power than CFG and more efficient parsing/generation algorithms than those of TAGs.3 In this paper, we will show that there exists a class of \"pattern-based\" grammars that is weakly equivalent to CFG (thus allowing the CFG parsing algorithms to be used for our grammars), but that it facilitates description of the domain of locality.",
        "Furthermore, we will show that our framework can be extended to incorporate example-based MT and a powerful learning mechanism."

        "are given the same index \":i\".",
        "Linked nonterminal must be derived from a sequence of synchronized pairs.",
        "Thus, the first NP (NP:1) in the source rule corresponds to the second NP (NP:1) in the target rule, the Vs in both rules correspond to each other, and the second NP (NP:3) in the source rule corresponds to the first NP (NP:3) in the target rule.",
        "The source and target rules are called CFG skeleton of the pattern.",
        "The notion of a syntactic head is similar to that used in unification grammars, although the heads in our patterns are simply encoded as character strings rather than as complex feature structures.",
        "A head is typically introduced' in preter-minal rules such as leave – 4 V V 4 partir where two verbs, \"leave\" and \"partir,\" are associated with the heads of the nonterminal symbol V. This is equivalently expressed as leave:1 – 4 V:1 V:1 4 partir:1 which is physically implemented as an entry of an English-French lexicon.",
        "A set T of translation patterns is said to accept an input s if there is a derivation sequence Q for s using the source CFG skeletons of T, and every head constraint associated with the CFG skeletons in Q is satisfied.",
        "Similarly, T is said to translate s if there is a synchronized derivation sequence Q for s such that T accepts s, and every head and link constraint associated with the source and target CFG skeletons in Q is satisfied.",
        "The derivation Q then produces a translation t as the resulting sequence of terminal symbols included in the target CFG skeletons in Q.",

        "L(GT) C L(T) can be proven, with mathematical induction, from the fact that every valid derivation sequence of GT satisfies head constraints of corresponding rules in T. Proposition 1 Let a CFG G be a set of source CFG skeletons in T. Then, L(T) C L(G).",
        "Since a valid derivation sequence in T is always a valid derivation sequence in G, the proof is immediate.",
        "Similarly, we have Proposition 2 Let a CFG H be a subset of source CFG skeletons in T such tha i a source CFG skeleton k is in H iff k has no head constraints associated with it.",
        "Then, L(H) C L(T).",
        "Theorem 2 shows that the syntactic coverage of T is, in general, only computable by T itself, even though T is merely a CFL.",
        "This may pose a serious problem when a grammar writer wishes to know if there is a specific expression that is only acceptable by using at least one pattern with head constraints, for which the answer is \"no\" iff L(G) = L(T).",
        "One way to trivialize this problem is to let T include a pattern with a pair of pure CFG rules for every pattern with head constraints, which guarantees that L(H) = L(T) = L(G).",
        "In this case, we know that the coverage of \"default\" patterns is always identical to L(T).",
        "Although our \"patterns\" have no more theoretical descriptive power than CFG, they can provide considerably better descriptions of the domain of locality than ordinary CFG rules.",
        "For example, be:V:1 year:NP:2 old --+ VP:1 VP:1 avoir:V:1 an:NP:2 can handle such NP pairs as \"one year\" and \"un an,\" and \"more than two years\" and \"plus que deux ans,\" which would have to be covered by a large number of plain CFG rules.",
        "TAGs, on the other hand, are known to be \"mildly context-sensitive\" grammars, and they can capture a broader range of syntactic dependencies, such as cross-serial dependencies.",
        "The computational complexity of parsing for TAGs, however, is 0(iGin6), which is far greater than that of CFG parsing.",
        "Moreover, defining a new STAG rule is not as easy for the users as just adding an entry into a dictionary, because each STAG rule has to be specified as a pair of tree structures.",
        "Our patterns, on the other hand, concentrate on specifying linear ordering of source and target constituents, and can be written by the users as easily as9 7Head constraints are trivially satisfied or violated in preterminal rules.",
        "Hence, we assume, without loss of generality, that no head constraint is given in preterminal rules.",
        "We also assume that \"X – > w\" implies \"X:1 w:1\".",

        "Some assumptions about patterns should be re-examined when we extend the definition of patterns.",
        "The notion of head constraints may have to be extended into one of a set membership constraint if we need to handle coordinated structures (Kaplan and Maxwell III, 1988).",
        "Some light-verb phrases cannot be correctly translated without \"exchanging\" several feature values between the verb and its object.",
        "A similar problem has been found in be-verb phrases.",
        "Grammar acquisition and corpus integration are fundamental issues, but automation of these processes (Watanabe, 1993) is still not complete.",
        "Development of an efficient translation algorithm, not just an efficient parsing algorithm, will make a significant contribution to research on synchronized grammars, including STAGs and our PCFGs."
