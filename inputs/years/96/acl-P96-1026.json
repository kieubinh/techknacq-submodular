        "Our work addresses the generation of software manuals in French and English, starting from a semantic model of the task to be documented (Paris et al., 1995).",
        "Our prime concern is to be able to exercise control over the mapping from the task model to the generated text.",
        "We set out to establish whether the task model alone is sufficient to control the linguistic output of a text generation system, or whether additional control is required.",
        "In this event, an obvious source to explore is the communicative purpose of the author, which is not necessarily constant throughout a manual.",
        "Indeed, in a typical software manual, it is possible to distinguish at least three sections, each with a different purpose: a tutorial containing exercises for new users, a series of step-by-step instructions for the major tasks to be accomplished, and a ready-reference summary of the commands.",
        "We need, therefore, to characterise the linguistic expressions of the different elements of the task model, and to establish whether these expressions are sensitive or not to their context, that is, the functional section in which they appear.",
        "This paper presents the results of an analysis we conducted to this end on a corpus of software instructions in French."

        "1.",
        "Collect the texts and note their situational characteristics.",
        "We consider two such character",
        "istics: task structure and communicative purpose.",

        "Identify the range of linguistic features to be included in the analysis; 3.",
        "Code the corpus in terms of the selected features; 4.",
        "Compute the frequency count of each linguistic feature; 5.",
        "Identify co-occurrences between linguistic features and the situational characteristics under consideration.",
        "We first carried out a classical sublanguage analysis on our corpus as a whole, without differentiating between any of the situational characteristics (Hartley and Paris, 1995).",
        "This initial description was necessary to give us a clear statement of the linguistic potential required of our text generator, to which we could relate any restrictions on language imposed by situational variables.",
        "Thus we can account for language restrictions by appealing to general discourse principles, in keeping with the recommendations of (Kittredge, 1995) and (Biber, 1995) for the definition of sublanguages.",
        "We then correlated task elements with grammatical features.",
        "Finally, where linguistic realisation was under-determined by task structure alone, we established whether the communicative purpose provided more discriminating control over the linguistic resources available."

      "text": [
        "Our analysis was carried out within the framework of Systemic-Functional Linguistics (sFL) (Halliday, 1978; Halliday, 1985) which views language as a resource for the creation of meaning.",
        "SFL stratifies meaning into context and language.",
        "The strata of the linguistic resources are organised into networks of choices, each choice resulting in a different meaning realised (i.e., expressed) by appropriate structures.",
        "The emphasis is on paradigmatic choices, as opposed to syntagmatic structures.",
        "Choices made in",
        "each stratum constrain the choices available in the stratum beneath.",
        "Context thus constrains language.",
        "This framework was chosen for several reasons.",
        "First, the organisation of linguistic resources according to this principle is well-suited to natural language generation, where the starting point is necessarily a communicative goal, and the task is to find the most appropriate expression for the intended meaning (Matthiessen and Bateman, 1991).",
        "Second, a functional perspective offers an advantage for multilingual text generation, because of its ability to achieve a level of linguistic description which holds across languages more effectively than do structurally-based accounts.",
        "The approach has been shown capable of supporting the sharing of linguistic resources between languages as structurally distinct as English and Japanese (Bateman et al., 1991a; Bateman et al., 1991b).",
        "It is therefore reasonable to expect that at least the same degree of commonality of description is achievable between English and French within this framework.",
        "Finally, KPML (Bateman, 1994), the tactical generator we employ, is based on SFL, and it is thus appropriate for us to characterise the corpus in terms immediately applicable to our generator."

        "The analysis was conducted on the French version of the Macintosh MacWrite manual (Kaehler, 1983).",
        "The manual is derived from an English source by a process of adaptive translation (Sager, 1993), i.e., one which localises the text to the expectations of the target readership.",
        "The fact that the translation is adaptive rather than literal gives us confidence in using this manual for our analysis.'",
        "Furthermore, we know that Macintosh documentation undergoes thorough local quality control.",
        "It certainly conforms to the principles of good documentation established by current research on technical documentation and on the needs of end-users, e.g., (Carroll, 1994; Hammond, 1994), in that it supplies clear and concise information for the task at hand.",
        "Finally, we have been assured by French users of the software that they consider this particular manual to be well written and to bear no unnatural trace of its origins.",
        "Technical manuals within a specific domain constitute a sublanguage, e.g., (Kittredge, 1982; Sager et al., 1980).",
        "An important defining property of a sublanguage is that of closure, both lexical and syntactic.",
        "Lexical closure has been demonstrated by, for example, (Kittredge, 1987), who shows that after as few as the first 2000 words of a sublanguage text, the number of new word types increases little if at all.",
        "Other work, e.g., (Biber, 1988; Biber, 1989) and (Grishman and Kittredge, 1986) illustrates the property of syntactic closure, which means that generally available constructions just do not occur in this or that sublanguage.",
        "In the light of these results, we considered a corpus of 15000 words to be adequate for our purposes, at least for an initial analysis.",
        "The MacWrite manual is organised into three chapters, corresponding to the three different sections identified earlier: a tutorial, a series of step-by-step instructions for the major word-processing tasks, and a ready-reference summary of the commands.",
        "We omitted the tutorial because the generation of such text is not our concern, retaining the other two chapters which provide the user with generic instructions for performing relevant tasks, and descriptions of the commands available within MacWrite.",
        "The overlap in information between the two chapters offers opportunities to observe differences in the linguistic expressions of the same task structure elements in different contexts.",
        "1We would have preferred to use a manual which originated in French to exclude all possibility of interference from a source language, but this proved impossible.",
        "Surprisingly, it appears that large French companies often have their documents authored in English by francophones and subsequently translated into French.",
        "One large French software house that we contacted does author its documentation in French, but had registered considerable customer dissatisfaction with its quality.",

        "Each unit is taken to be the expression of a single task element.",
        "Our definition of the task elements is based on the concepts and relations commonly chosen to represent a task structure (a goal and its associated plan), e.g., (Fikes and Nilsson, 1971; Sacerdoti, 1977), and on related research, e.g., (Kosseim and Lapalme, 1994).",
        "Our generator produces instructions from an underlying semantic knowledge base which uses this representation (Paris et al., 1995).",
        "To generate an instruction for performing a task is to chose some task elements to be expressed and linearise them so that they form a coherent set for a given goal the user might have.",
        "We distinguish the following elements, and provide examples of them in Figure 1:2 goals: actions that users will adopt as goals and which motivate the use of a plan.",
        "functions: actions that represent the functionality of an interface object (such as a menu item).",
        "A",
        "function is closely related to a goal, in that it is also an action that the user may want to perform.",
        "However, the function is accessed through the interface object, and not through a plan.",
        "constraints and preconditions: states which must hold before a plan can be employed successfully.",
        "The domain model distinguishes constraints (states which cannot be achieved through planning) and preconditions (states which can be achieved through planning).",
        "We do not make this distinction in the linguistic analysis and regroup these related task structure elements under one label.",
        "We decided to proceed in this way to determine at first how constraints in general are expressed.",
        "Moreover, it is not always clear from the text which type of constraint is expressed.",
        "Drawing too fine distinctions in the corpus analysis at this point, in the absence of a test for assigning a unit to one of these constraint types, would have rendered the results of the analysis more subjective and thus less reliable.",
        "results: states which arise as planned or unplanned effects of carrying out a plan.",

        "We examined the correlations between lexico-grammatical realisations and task elements and communicative purpose.",
        "The results are best expressed using tables generated by WAG: given any system, WAG splits the codings into a number of sets, one for each feature in that system.",
        "Percentages and means are computed, and the sets are compared statistically, using the standard T-test.",
        "WAG displays the results with an indicator of how statistically significant a value is compared to the combined means in the other sets.",
        "The counts were all done using the local mean, that is, the feature count is divided by the total number of codings which select that feature's system.",
        "Full definitions of the features can be found in (Halliday, 1985; Bateman et al., 1990).",
        "In some cases, the type of task element is on its own sufficient to determine, or at least strongly constrain, its linguistic realisation.",
        "The limited space available here allows us to provide only a small number of examples, shown in Figure 2.",
        "We see that the use of modals is excluded in the expression of function, result and constraint, whereas goal and sub-step do admit modals.",
        "As far as the polarity system is concerned, negation is effectively ruled out for function, goal and substep.",
        "Finally, with respect to the mood system, only substep can be realised through imperatives.",
        "In other cases, however, we observe a diversity of realisations.",
        "We highlight here three cases: modality in goal, polarity in constraint, and mood in substep.",
        "In such cases, we must appeal to another source of control over the apparently available choices.",
        "We have looked to the construct of genre (Martin, 1992) to provide this additional control, on two grounds: (1) since genres are distinguished by their communicative purposes, we can view each of the functional sections already identified as a distinct genre; (2) genre is presented as controlling text structure and realisation.",
        "In Martin's view, genre is defined as a staged, goal-oriented social process realised through register, the context of situation, which in turn is realised in language to achieve the goals of a text.",
        "Genre is responsible for the selection of a text structure in terms of task elements.",
        "As part of the realisation process, generic choices preselect a register associated with particular elements of text structure, which in turn preselect lexico-grammatical features.",
        "The coding of our text in terms genre and task elements thus allows us to establish the role played by genre in the realisations of the task elements.",
        "It will also allow us to determine the text structures appropriate in each genre, a study we are currently undertaking.",
        "This is consistent with other accounts of text structure for text generation in technical domains, e.g., (McKeown, 1985; Paris, 1993; Kittredge et al., 1991).",
        "For those cases where the realisation remains under-determined by the task element type, we conducted a finer-grained analysis, by overlaying a genre partition on the undifferentiated data.",
        "We distinguished earlier two genres with which we are concerned: ready-reference and step-by-step.",
        "In the manual analysed, we recognised two more specific communicative purposes in the step-by-step section: to enable the reader to perform a task, and to increase the reader's knowledge about the task, the way to achieve it, or the properties of the system as a whole.",
        "Because of their distinct communicative purposes, we again feel justified in calling these genres.",
        "We label them respectively procedure and elaboration.",
        "The intention that the reader should recognise the differences in function of each section is underscored by the use of distinctive typographical devices, such as fonts and lay-out.'",
        "The first step at this stage of the analysis was to establish whether there was an effective overlap in task elements among the three genres under consideration.",
        "The results of this step is shown in Figure 3.",
        "Sub-step and goal are found in all three genres, while constraint, result and function occur in both ready-reference and elaboration but are absent from procedure.",
        "The next step was to undertake a comparative",
        "analysis of the lexico-grammatical features found in the three genres.",
        "This analysis indicated that the language employed in these different sections of the text varies greatly.",
        "We summarise here the two genres that are strongly contrasted: procedure and ready-reference.",
        "Elaboration shares features with both of these.",
        "procedure: The top-level goal of the user is expressed as a nominalisation.",
        "Actions to be achieved by the reader are almost exclusively realised by imperatives, directly addressing the reader.",
        "These actions are mostly material directed actions, and there are no causatives.",
        "Few modals are employed, and, when they are, it is to express obligation impersonally.",
        "The polarity of processes is always positive.",
        "Procedure employs mostly independent clauses, and, when clause complexes are used, the conjunctions are mostly purpose (linking a user goal and an action) and alternative (linking two user actions or two goals).",
        "ready-reference: In this genre, all task elements are always realised through clauses.",
        "The declarative mood predominates, with few imperatives addressing the reader.",
        "Virtually all the causatives occur here.",
        "On the dimension of modality, the emphasis is on personal possibility, rather than obligation, and on inclination.",
        "We find in this genre most of the verbal processes, entirely absent from procedure.",
        "Ready-reference is more weighted than procedure towards dependent clauses, and is particularly marked by the presence of temporal conjunctions.",
        "The analysis so far demonstrates that genre, like task structure, provides some measure of control over the linguistic resources but that neither of these alone is sufficient to drive a generation system.",
        "The final step was therefore to look at the realisations of the task elements differentiated by genre, in cases where the realisation was not strongly determined by the task element.",
        "We refer the reader back to Figure 2, and the under-constrained cases of modality in goal, polarity in constraint, and mood in substep.",
        "Figure 4 shows the realisations the task element goal with respect to the modal system, which brings into sharp relief the absence of modality from procedure.",
        "Figure 5 presents the realisations by genre of the polarity system for constraint.",
        "We observe that only positive polarity occurs in ready-reference.",
        "Finally, we note from Figure 6 that the realisation of sub-steps is heavily loaded in favour of imperatives in procedure.",
        "These figures show that genre does indeed provide useful additional control over the expression of task elements, which can be exploited by a text generation system.",
        "Neither task structure nor genre alone is sufficient to provide this control, but, taken together, they offer a real prospect of adequate control over the output of a text generator."
