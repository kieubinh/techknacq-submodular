        "In this paper I show how starting from a definite clause characterization of filtering derived automatically from a logic grammar using Magic compilation, filter optimizations can be performed in a processor independent and logically clean fashion.",

        "More specifically, 'magic generation' falls prey to non-termination in the face of head recursion, i.e., the generation analog of left recursion in parsing.",
        "This necessitates a dynamic processing strategy, i.e., memoization, extended with an abstraction function like, e.g., restriction (Shieber, 1985), to weaken filtering and a subsumption check to discard redundant results.",
        "It is shown that for a large class of grammars the subsumption check which often influences processing efficiency rather dramatically can be eliminated through fine-tuning of the magic predicates derived for a particular grammar after applying an abstraction function in an off-line fashion.",

        "Given an off-line optimization of the order in which the right-hand side categories in the rules of a logic grammar are processed (Minnen et al., 1996) the resulting processing behavior can be considered a generalization of the head corner generation approach (Shieber et al., 1990): Without the need to rely on notions such as semantic head and chain rule, a head corner behavior can be mimicked in a strict bottom-up fashion."
