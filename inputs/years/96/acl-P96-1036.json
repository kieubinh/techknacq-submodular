        "The centering model has evolved as a methodology for the description and explanation of the local coherence of discourse (Grosz et al., 1983; 1995), with focus on pronominal and nominal anaphora.",
        "Though several cross-linguistic studies have been carried out (cf. the enumeration in Grosz et al.",
        "(1995)), an almost canonical scheme for the ordering on the forward-looking centers has emerged, one that reflects well-known regularities of fixed word order languages such as English.",
        "With the exception of Walker et al.",
        "(1990; 1994) for Japanese, Turan (1995) for Turkish, Ram-bow (1993) for German and Cote (1996) for English, only grammatical roles are considered and the (partial) ordering in Table 1' is taken for granted.",
        "'Table 1 contains the most explicit ordering of grammatical roles we are aware of and has been taken from Brennan et al.",
        "(1987).",
        "Often, the distinction between complements and adjuncts is collapsed into the category \"others\" (c.f., e.g., Grosz et al.",
        "(1995)).",
        "Our work on the resolution of anaphora (Strube & Hahn, 1995; Hahn & Strube, 1996) and textual ellipsis (Hahn et al., 1996), however, is based on German, a free word order language, in which grammatical role information is far less predictive for the organization of centers.",
        "Rather, for establishing proper referential relations, the functional information structure of the utterances becomes crucial (different perspectives on functional analysis are brought forward in Dana (1974b) and Dahl (1974)).",
        "We share the notion of functional information structure as developed by Dana (1974a).",
        "He distinguishes between two crucial dichotomies, viz, given information vs. new information (constituting the information structure of utterances) on the one hand, and theme vs. rheme on the other (constituting the thematic structure of utterances; cf. Halliday & Hasan (1976, pp.325-6)).",
        "Dana refers to a definition given by Halliday (1967) to avoid the confusion likely to arise in the use of these terms: \"[...] while given means what you were talking about (or what I was talking about before), theme means what!",
        "am talking about (now) [...]\" Halliday (1967, p.212).",
        "Dana concludes that the distinction between given information and theme is justified, while the distinction between new information and rheme is not.",
        "Thus, we arrive at a trichotomy between given information, theme and rheme (the latter being equivalent to new information).",
        "We here subscribe to these considerations, too, and will return in Section 3 to these notions in order to rephrase them more explicitly by using the terminology of the centering model.",
        "In this paper, we intend to make two contributions to the centering approach.",
        "The first one, the introduction of functional notions of information structure in the centering model, is methodological in nature.",
        "The second one concerns an empirical issue in that we demonstrate how a functional model of centering can successfully be applied to the analysis of several forms of anaphoric text phenomena.",
        "At the methodological level, we develop arguments that (at least for free word order languages) grammatical role indicators should be replaced by functional",
        "role patterns to more adequately account for the ordering of discourse entities in center lists.",
        "In Section 3 we elaborate on the particular information structure criteria underlying a function-based center ordering.",
        "We also make a second, even more general methodological claim for which we have gathered some preliminary, though still not conclusive evidence.",
        "Based on a re-evaluation of empirical arguments discussed in the literature on centering, we stipulate that exchanging grammatical by functional criteria is also a reasonable strategy for fixed word order languages.",
        "Grammatical role constraints can indeed be rephrased by functional ones, which is simply due to the fact that grammatical roles and the information structure patterns, as we define them, coincide in these kinds of languages.",
        "Hence, the proposal we make seems more general than the ones currently under discussion in that, given a functional framework, fixed and free word order languages can be accounted for by the same ordering principles.",
        "As a consequence, we argue against Walker et al.'",
        "s (1994, p.227) stipulation, which assumes that the Cf ranking is the only parameter of the centering theory which is language-dependent.",
        "Instead, we claim that functional centering constraints for the C1 ranking are possibly universal.",
        "The second major contribution of this paper is related to the unified treatment of specific text phenomena.",
        "It consists of an equally balanced treatment of intersentential (pro)nominal anaphora and textual ellipsis (also called functional or partial anaphora).",
        "The latter phenomenon (cf. the examples given in the next section), in particular, is usually only sketchily dealt with in the centering literature, e.g., by asserting that the entity in question \"is realized but not directly realized\" (Grosz et al., 1995, p.217).",
        "Furthermore, the distinction between those two kinds of realization is generally delegated to the underlying semantic theory.",
        "We will develop arguments how to locate elliptical discourse entities and resolve textual ellipsis properly at the center level.",
        "The ordering constraints we supply account for all of the above mentioned types of anaphora in a precise way, including (pro)nominal anaphora (Strube & Hahn, 1995; Hahn & Strube, 1996).",
        "This claim will be validated by a substantial body of empirical data (cf.",

        "Thus, it complements the phenomenon of nominal anaphora, where an anaphoric expression is related to its antecedent in terms of conceptual generalization (as, e.g., \"Rechner\" (computer) in (1c) refers to \"316LT\" in (la) mediated by the textual ellipsis in (lb)).",

        "First, we examine the error data for anaphora resolution for the five cases.",
        "All approaches have 99 errors in common.",
        "These are due to underspecifica-tions at different levels, e.g., the failure to account for prepositional anaphors (16), plural anaphors (8), anaphors which refer to a member of a set (14), sentence anaphors (21), and anaphors which refer to the global focus (12).",
        "Only 6 errors of the functional approach are directly caused by an inappropriate ordering of the C1, while the naive approach leads to 10 errors and the canonical to 7.",
        "When the antecedent of an elliptical expression is ranked above the elliptical expression itself the error rate of these two augmented approaches increases to 12 and 9, respectively.",
        "We now turn to the distribution of transition types for the different approaches.",
        "The centering model assumes a preference order among these transitions, e.g., CONTINUE ranks above RETAIN and RETAIN ranks above SHIFT.",
        "This preference order reflects the presumed inference load put on the hearer or speaker to coherently decode or encode a discourse.",
        "Since the functional approach generates a larger amount of CONTINUE transitions, we interpret this as a first rough indication that this approach provides for more efficient processing than its competitors.",
        "But this reasoning is not entirely conclusive.",
        "Counting single occurrences of transition types, in general, does not reveal the entire validity of the center lists.",
        "Instead, considering adjacent transition pairs gives a more reliable picture, since depending on the text sort considered (e.g., technical vs. news magazine vs. literary texts) certain sequences of transition types may be entirely plausible, though they include transitions which, when viewed in isolation, seem to imply considerable inferencing load (cf. Table 8).",
        "For instance, a CONTINUE transition which follows a CONTINUE transition is a sequence which requires the lowest processing costs.",
        "But a CONTINUE transition which follows a RETAIN transition implies higher processing costs than a SMOOTH-SHIFT transition following a RETAIN transition.",
        "This is due to the fact that a RETAIN transition ideally predicts a SMOOTH-SHIFT in the following utterance.",
        "In this case the SMOOTH-SHIFT is the \"least effort\" transition, because only the first element of the Cf of the preceding utterance has to be checked to perform the SMOOTH-SHIFT transition, while in the case of CONTINUE at least one more check has to be performed.",
        "Hence, we claim that no one particular centering transition is preferred over another.",
        "Instead, we postulate that some centering transition pairs are preferred over others.",
        "Following this",
        "line of argumentation, we here propose to classify all occurrences of centering transition pairs with respect to the costs they imply.",
        "The cost-based evaluation of different Cf orderings refers to evaluation criteria which form an intrinsic part of the centering mode16.",
        "Transition pairs hold for two immediately successive utterances.",
        "We distinguish between two types of transition pairs, cheap ones and expensive ones.",
        "We call a transition pair cheap if the backward-looking center of the current utterance is correctly predicted by the preferred center of the immediately preceding utterance, i.e., Cb(Ui) Cp(Ui_i), i = 2 ... n. Transition pairs are called expensive if the backward-looking center of the current utterance is not correctly predicted by the preferred center of the immediately preceding utterance, i.e., Cb(Ui) Cp(Ui-1) 2 ... n. Table 9 contains a detailed synopsis of cheap and expensive transition pairs.",
        "In particular, chains of the RETAIN transition in passages where the Cb does not change (passages with constant theme) show that the canonical ordering constraints for theforward-looking centers are not appropriate.",
        "The numbers of centering transition pairs generated by the different approaches are shown in Table 10.",

        "The results for the latter approaches become only slightly more positive with the modification of ranking the antecedent of a textual ellipsis above the elliptical expression, but they do not compare to the results of the functional approach.",

        "They consider the role of expressive means in Japanese to indicate topic status and the speaker's perspective, thus introducing functional notions, viz. TOPIC and EMPATHY, into the discussion.",
        "German, the object language we deal with, is also a free word order language like Japanese (possibly even more constrained).",
        "Our basic revision of the ordering scheme completely abandons grammatical role information and replaces it with entirely functional notions reflecting the information structure of the utterances in the discourse.",

        "His proposal concerning the centering analysis of German (already referred to as the \"naive\" approach; cf.",
        "Section 4) is limited, however, to the German middlefield and, hence, incomplete.",
        "A common topic of criticism relating to focusing approaches to anaphora resolution has been the diversity of data structures they require, which are likely to hide the underlying linguistic regularities.",
        "Focusing algorithms prefer the discourse element already in focus for anaphora resolution, thus considering context-'boundedness, too.",
        "But the items of the focus lists are either ordered by thematic roles (Sidner,",
        "1983) or grammatical roles (Sun i & McCoy, 1994; Dahl & Ball, 1990)).",
        "Dahl & Ball (1990) improve the focusing mechanism by simplifying its data structures and, thus, their proposal is more closely related to the centering model than any other focusing mechanism.",
        "But their approach still relies upon grammatical information for the ordering of the centering list, while we use only the functional information structure as the guiding principle."

        "We also augmented the ordering criteria of the forward-looking center such that it accounts not only for (pro)nominal but also for functional anaphora (textual ellipsis), an issue that, so far, has only been sketchily dealt with in the centering framework.",
        "The extensions we propose have been validated by the empirical analysis of real-world expository texts of considerable length.",
