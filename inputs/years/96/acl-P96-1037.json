        "Efficient human – computer dialogue requires immediate utterance-by-utterance accommodation to the needs of the interaction.",
        "The participants must continuously focus all concerns on the goals of the task and avoid extraneous paths.",
        "This means that the dialogue initiative should always pass immediately to the participant who is best able to handle the current task.",
        "An agent is said to have dialogue initiative over a mutual goal when that agent controls how that goal will be solved by the collaborators.",
        "In the implemented voice dialogue system \"The Circuit Fix-it Shop\" (Smith et al., 1992; Smith and Hipp, 1995), the dialogue fragment given in Figure 1 occurs between a human user and a computer collaborator.",
        "Utterances 2 and 4 indicate that the computer is directing the search for the missing wire in the faulty circuit.",
        "However, in Utterance 5 the user takes the initiative and suggests a different wire than has been proposed by the computer.",
        "In this paper we will present a theory explaining how initiative changes between participants and how computational agents can evaluate who should be in control of solving a goal.",
        "is in control and the other agent is passive (the master-slave assumption).",
        "For instance, in the LADDER system (Hendrix et al., 1978) the user has the initiative while the computer is passive.",
        "In contrast, the VODIS system (Young and Proctor, 1989) has the computer taking the initiative while the user is passive.",
        "Some dialogue systems (like GUS (Bobrow et al., 1977)) allow for a more mixed-initiative interaction; however, the places where the user can take the initiative are limited and defined a priori.",
        "The dialogue model of Smith (1995) allows for either the computer or the user to assume degrees of initiative; however, Smith presents no algorithm for the computer to change initiative during a dialogue.",
        "Our model of mixed-initiative dialogue allows either participant to be in control of the dialogue at any point in time.",
        "(1978) the structure of a dialog mirrors the structure of the underlying task).",
        "Unlike previous research in dialogue initiative, however, we attach an initiative level to each goal in the task tree.",
        "Thus an agent may have initiative over one goal but not another.",
        "As goals get pushed and popped from the problem-solving stack, initiative changes accordingly.",
        "Thus many initiative changes are done implicitly based on which goal is being solved."

      "text": [
        "In our model of dialogue, initiative levels for each goal are defined during the interaction based on 1) explicit and implicit initiative-changing utterances and 2) competency evaluation.",
        "Explicit and Implicit Initiative-Changing Utterances Several researchers (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988; Walker and Whittaker, 1990) have noted that dialogue control can be exchanged through overt cues in the discourse.",
        "Our model concentrates on two specific dialogue cues: questions and answers.",
        "When an agent A1 asks another agent A2 to satisfy a goal G, agent A2 gains initiative over goal G and all subgoals of G until agent A2 passes control of one of those subgoals back to agent A.1.",
        "A similar initiative-setting mechanism is fired if agent A1 announces that it cannot satisfy goal G. When a goal has been answered (satisfied) the problem-solving stack is popped.",
        "The initiative will now belong to whomever the initiative is for the goal on top of the stack.1.",
        "In the following human-computer dialogue gathered by Smith and Hipp (Smith and Hipp, 1995), How do I fix this circuit?",
        "What is the LED displaying?",
        "Nothing.",
        "What is the switch at?",
        "Where is the switch?",
        "In the lower left corner.",
        "The switch is down.",
        "Put the switch up.",
        "all initiative changes can be accounted for by explicit initiative-changing utterances or by popping of the problem-solving stack due to goal resolution as illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "Competency Evaluation for Initiative Setting How does an agent decide whether to ask its collaborator for help?",
        "An obvious approach is to ask for help when the agent is unable to satisfy a goal on its own.",
        "This approach is the basic mechanism for several dialogue systems (Young et al., 1989; Smith 'Since each participant is carrying out initiative evaluation independently, there may be conflicts on who should be in control.",
        "Numerous researchers have studied how negotiation may be used to resolve these conflicts (Guinn, 1994; Guinn, 1993a; Lambert and Car-berry, 1992; McRoy, 1993; Sidner, 1993) and Hipp, 1995; Guinn, 1994).",
        "An additional approach is to ask the collaborator for help if it is believed that the collaborator has a better chance of solving the goal (or solving it more efficiently).",
        "Such an evaluation requires knowledge of the collaborating agent's capabilities as well as an understanding of the agent's own capabilities.",
        "Our methodology for evaluating competency involves a probabilistic examination of the search space of the problem domain.",
        "In the process of solving a goal, there may be many branches that can be taken in an attempt to prove a goal.",
        "Rather than selecting a branch at random, intelligent behavior involves evaluating (by some criteria) each possible branch that may lead toward the solution of a goal to determine which branch is more likely to lead to a solution.",
        "In this evaluation, certain important factors are examined to weight various branches.",
        "For example, during a medical exam, a patient may complain of dizziness, nausea, fever, headache, and itchy feet.",
        "The doctor may know of thousands of possible diseases, conditions, allergies, etc.",
        "To narrow the search, the doctor will try to find a pathology that accounts for these symptoms.",
        "There may be some diseases that account for all 5 symptoms, others that might account for 4 out of the 5 symptoms, and so on.",
        "In this manner, the practitioner sorts and prunes his list of possible pathologies.",
        "Competency evaluation will be based on how likely an agent's branch will be successful (based on a weighted factor analysis) and how likely the collaborator's branch will be successful (based on a weighted factor analysis and a probabilistic model of the collaborator's knowledge).",
        "In Section 3 we will sketch out how this calculation is made, present several mode selection schemes based on this factor analysis, and show the results of analytical evaluation of these schemes.",
        "In Section 4 we will present the methodology and results of using these schemes in a simulated dialogue environment."
