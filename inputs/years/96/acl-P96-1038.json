Further, it is not the case that text-alone seg-menters simply chose to place fewer boundaries in the discourse; if this were so, then we would expect a high percentage of SCONT consensus labels where no SBEGs or SFs were identified.",
        "Instead, we find that the number of consensus SCONTs was significantly higher for text-and-speech labelings than for text-alone (p<.001, x=49.1, df=1).",

        "Comparisons of inter-labeler reliability, that is, the reproducibility of a coding scheme given multiple labelers, provide another perspective on the segmentation data.",
        "How best to measure inter-labeler reliability for discourse segmentation tasks, especially for hierarchical segmentation, is an open research question (Passonneau and Litman, to appear; Car-letta, 1995; Flammia and Zue, 1995; Rotondo, 1984; Swerts, 1995).",

        "Recent discourse annotation studies (Isard and Carletta, 1995; Flammia and Zue, 1995) have measured reliability using the K coefficient, which factors out chance agreement taking the expected distribution of categories into account.",

        "This task, which represented about 8% of the data for both speaking styles, was chosen because it was midway in planning complexity and in length among all the tasks.",
        "Using these distributions, we calculated tz coefficients for each pair of labelers in each condition for the remaining eight tasks in our corpus.",

        "The average K scores for group T segmenters indicate weak inter-labeler reliability.",
        "In contrast, average i scores for group S are .8 or better, indicating a high degree of inter-labeler reliability.",
        "Thus, application of this somewhat stricter reliability metric confirms that the availability of speech critically influences how listeners perceive discourse structure.",
        "The calculation of reliability for SBEG versus non-SBEG labeling in effect tests the similarity of linearized segmentations and does not speak to the issue of how similar the labelings are in terms of hierarchical structure.",
        "Flammia has proposed a method for generalizing the use of the K coefficient for hierarchical segmentation that gives an upper-bound estimate on inter-labeler agreement.5 We applied this metric to our segmentation data, calculating weighted averages for pairwise n scores averaged for each task.",
        "Results for each condition, together with the lowest and highest average n scores over the tasks, are presented in Table 3.",
        "Once again, averaged scores of .7 or better for text-and-speech labelings, for both speaking styles, indicate markedly higher inter-labeler reliability than do scores for text-alone labelings, which averaged .51 and .53."
