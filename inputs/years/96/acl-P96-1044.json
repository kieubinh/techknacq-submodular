        "• The length of the description of a word is a measure of its linguistic plausibility, and can serve as a buffer against learning unnatural coincidences.",
        "• Coincidences like scratching her nose do not exclude desired structure, since they are further broken down into components that they inherit properties from.",
        "• Structure is shared: the words blackbird and blackberry can share the common substructure associated with black, such as its sound and meaning.",
        "As a consequence, data is pooled for estimation, and representations are compact.",
        "• Common irregular forms are compiled out.",
        "For example, if went is represented in terms of go (presumably to save the cost of unnecessarily reproducing syntactic and semantic properties) the complex sound change need only be represented once, not every time went is used.",
        "• Since parameters (words) have compact representations, they are cheap from a description length standpoint, and many can be included in the lexicon.",
        "This allows learning algorithms to fit detailed statistical properties of the data.",
        "This coding scheme is very similar to that found in popular dictionary-based compression schemes like LZ78 (Ziv and Lempel, 1978).",
        "It is capable of compressing a sequence of identical characters of length n to size 0(log n).",
        "However, in contrast to compression schemes like LZ78 that use deterministic rules to add parameters to the dictionary (and do not arrive at linguistically plausible parameters), it is possible to perform more sophisticated searches in this representation.",
