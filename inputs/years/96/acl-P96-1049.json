        "In traditional computational phonology/morphology systems such as two-level phonology (Koskenniemi, 1983), grammars that generate surface forms are invertible, allowing parsing back into underlying forms.",
        "In a derivational framework, the grammar converts underlying forms to surface outputs via transformations; the input and output share the same space (Figure la).",
        "In the one-level version of OT that most computational methods use, the space is populated with candidate outputs 'Some of the computational work in OT confusingly uses the term \"parsing\" to refer to generation.",

        "created by a generator function GEN operating on input strings.",
        "The search narrows in on an optimal output (Figure lb) using evaluation constraints in a process called EvAL; successively smaller boundaries are cut out by the constraints until only one candidate remains.",
        "It is easy to see why the derivational method can be run backward: it just retraces derivational links in the graph.",
        "It is not obvious, though, how the input can be found from the search space in OT."

        "Ellison (1994) provides a paradigm for converting Optimality Theory constraints into Finite State Transducers.",
        "He requires that EVAL constraints output binary marks when ranking candidates and be describable as a regular language; the output of GEN must also be describable by a regular language.",
        "As Ellison points out, most constraints can be reformulated to be binary.",
        "He is able to build FST representations for the constraints that he considers, showing them to be regular.",
        "For the Tagalog example, GEN will output the regular language shown in Figure 3 for the first three candidates (umgradwet, gumradwet, and grumadwet).2 Each candidate consists of segments associated with a syllable structure position and a morpheme structure marker.3 We now consider the ALIGN-PREFIX constraint, restricting the prefix to occur as early in the word as possible.",
        "This is encoded as an FST that writes marks on an output \"Harmony Masks\" tape.",
        "A \"1\" is written for any word (W) morphological material that precedes prefix (P) material, and a \"0\" is written for any other segment.",
        "The regular language generated by this FST (Figure 4) has a very simple structure.",
        "Any Ws before Ps on the Morpheme Structure tape get a harmony violation mark.",
        "Taking the product of this language with the optimal candidate scores the candidate (Figure 5).",
        "The harmony marks include two non-harmonic marks (i.e. \"1\"s); in the OT tableau in Figure 2, we see that ALIGN also gives two marks to the optimal candidate.",
        "We can encode a similar FST for NoCoDA.",
        "This FST examines the syllable structure tape to give harmony marks (Figure 6) â€“ codas (Cs) get a harmony violation mark, onsets (0) and nuclei (N) are unmarked.",
        "As in the OT tableau, the winning candidate (Figure 7) violates No CODA twice.",
        "Once the OT constraints are represented as FSTs, combining all of the EVAL constraints into one transducer is a straightforward product.",
        "Ellison augments the product procedure so that harmony marks are concatenated by the resulting transducer.",
        "We have used two different types of harmony marks in the ALIGN-PREFIX and NoCoDA FSTs, representing the ranking of the two rules as suggested by McCarthy and Prince.",
        "The higher-ranked NoCoak constraint outputs \"2\" marks while ALIGN-PREFIX outputs \"1\" marks.4 Harmonic comparisons between the candidates will consider the candidates with the smallest number of \"2\" marks first, followed by the smallest number of \"1\" marks.",
        "Marks are not added together, rather, the count of each type of mark is the deciding factor in evaluation.",
        "The output of GEN and the constraints of EVAL are combined into a single transducer by taking the product of all of the FSTs.",
        "For the Tagalog example, the output rankings for the candidates are shown in Figure 8.",

        "Ellison's FSTs transform output candidates to harmony marks; even so, the inversion of these FSTs are useless.",
        "The crucial point is that GEN hides the surface-form-to-candidate mapping; in Ellison's system the EVAL portion of the system only combines with the output of GEN, so the mapping is lost.",

        "This will be a critical move for the OT-FST paradigm.",
        "In two-level OT, GEN generates all strings; faithfulness constraints in EVAL minimize the inserted and deleted material between underlying and candidate surface forms.",
        "By specifically modeling the faithfulness constraints, we now allow the FST to have access to the input-output correspondences crucial for searching for underlying forms.",
        "The remaining question, however, is whether faithfulness constraints can be modeled by regular grammars.",
        "Several formulations of two-level OT faithfulness constraints are discussed by McCarthy and Prince (1994) and Orgun (1994).",
        "To illustrate the flavor of these constraints and how they might be regular-izable, we consider two constraints, CORR and MATCH (named for their similarity to Orgun's constraints).",
        "For our Tagalog example, we add two tapes for the underlying word and prefix forms (Figure 10).",
        "The CORR constraint requires that for every element in the surface phoneme string there is a segment in the underlying word or prefix, and vice versa.",
        "MATCH constrains the surface string phoneme to match6 those in the word and prefix, and vice versa (Figure 11).",
        "Using these constraints, the OT-FSTs should be able to generate and parse in the Tagalog example.",
        "The additional computational complexity for implementing this type of system may be quite large; the search space for determining unknown strings at parse time will make for a slow implementation unless suitable heuristics are found for searching over each type of string.",
        "Systems of this type are likely to become even more complex as more information such as moraic structure is added.",
        "We envision that these heuristics will be based on the harmony mark scoring of the FST, but the exact nature of this is left to future work."
