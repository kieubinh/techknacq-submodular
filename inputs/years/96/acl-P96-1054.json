        "The basic hypothesis of this study is that the degree of transitivity associated with a clause indicates the level of importance of a clause in a narrative text.",
        "For this assumption to form the basis of a practical implementation, transitivity must be objectively defined and the definition must be able to be processed automatically.",
        "The notion of transitivity clearly has many implications for text processing, in particular information retrieval and automatic summarising, because it can be used to grade information in a document according to importance.",
        "In an information retrieval context, it means that a transitivity index could influence a decision about the relevance of a document to a query.",
        "In automatic summarising, it means that less important information could be sieved according to transitivity, leaving only the most important information to form the basis of a summary.",
        "News discourse was chosen because it is narrative based and therefore broadly applicable to the notion of transitivity.",
        "There has also been extensive research in the structural characteristics of this text type (Duszak, 1995) (Kay and Aylett, 1994) (Bell, 1991).",
        "However, the study poses a challenge in the sense that the notion of transitivity has previously been exemplified with relatively simple sentences presenting action sequences.",
        "A central question is how well the concept can be transferred to a domain which, although narrative based, diverges into commentary and analysis.",
        "Transitivity is usually considered to be a property of an entire clause (Hopper and Thompson, 1980).",
        "It is, broadly, the notion that an activity is transferred from an agent to a patient.",
        "It is therefore inherently linked with a clause containing two participants in which an action is highly effective.",
        "The concept of transitivity has been defined in terms of the following parameters:",
        "Each component of transitivity contributes to the overall effectiveness or 'intensity' with which an action is transferred from one participant to another.",
        "A.",
        "There must be at least two participants for an action to be transferred.",
        "B.",
        "Transferable actions can be contrasted with nontransferable states, e.g. he pushed her; he thought about her.",
        "C. An action is either wholly or partially completed according to whether it is telic or atelic, e.g.",
        "I played the piano; I am playing the piano.",
        "D. Punctual actions have no transitional phase between start and end point, having a greater effect",
        "on their patients, e.g. he kicked the door; he opened the door.",
        "E. An action is more effective if it is volitional, e.g. he bought the present; he forgot the present.",
        "F. An affirmative action has greater transitivity than a negative action, e.g. he called the boy; he didn't call the boy.",
        "G. An action which is realis (occurring in the real world) is more effective than an action which is irrealis (occurring in a non-real contingency world), e.g. they attacked the enemy; they might attack the enemy.",
        "H. Participants high in agency transfer an action more effectively than participants low in agency, e.g. he shocked me; the price shocked me.",
        "I.",
        "A patient is wholly or partially affected, e.g.",
        "I washed the dishes; I washed some of the dishes.",
        "J. Individuation refers to the distinctiveness of the object from the agent and of the object from its own background.",
        "The following properties contribute to the individuation of an object.",
        "Based on these components, clauses can be classified as more or less transitive.",
        "In English, as a whole, transitivity is indicated by a cluster of features associated with a clause.",
        "The concept of foreground and background information is based on the idea that in narrative discourse some parts are more essential than others.",
        "Certain sections of a narrative are crucially linked with the temporal sequence of events which form the backbone of a text.",
        "This material is normally foregrounded.",
        "In contrast, the contextual information relating to characters and environment is backgrounded."

        "The proposal for this study is to code matching query/document terms for the transitivity value of the clause in which they occur, as a starting point for producing comparative term weights based on linguistic features.",
        "Terms which are less central to a discourse will, on this basis, be given lower scores because they occur in low transitivity clauses.",
        "The net result will be to produce a document ranking order which more closely represents the importance of the documents to a user.",

        "The processor identifies the transitivity features associated with each matching clause and produces a ranked output of documents based on the weights assigned to each clause in which the search terms occur.",

        "All terms are treated as equal so that discrimination between documents is based purely on accumulative transitivity scores.",
        "The performance of the ranking technique is evaluated according to two precision measures: the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (rho) and the CRE (Coefficient of Ranking Effectiveness) (Noreault et al.",
        ", 1977).",

        "Summaries will be analysed and assessed by volunteers for coverage, in terms of the original text, and comprehensibility as a separate text.",
        "The summaries will be compared against summaries of the same texts compiled by the syntactic technique mentioned previously and also against summaries consisting of the first paragraph of each news article.",
