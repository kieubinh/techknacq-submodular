        "Computer Aided Instruction (CAI) systems are important and effective tools, especially for teaching foreign languages.",
        "Many students of Japanese as a foreign language are aware of the Computer Assisted TEchnical Reading System (CATERS) that provides helpful information for reading texts in science and technology fields (Kano and Yamamoto, 1995).",
        "One of the difficulties in learning Japanese lies in recognizing dependency relations in Japanese sentences.",
        "This is because the language allows relatively free word orders.",
        "Take an example from a leading newspaper: tz.v, 0)3.",
        "*:rsZ91 t.11/14 tz.V, We would like to expect a prompt study of the causes, based on a national investigation To understand this sentence it is necessary to know that MM4: (investigation) modifies Llt.",
        ": (based) but not 11A41- (expect); t 'Jo (based) modifies 'AM (study) but not W, (cause).",
        "CATERS is useful because it provides such information through several user-friendly functions.",
        "As effective as it is for foreign students, however, the texts in CATERS are fixed and the dependency structure of every sentence in them is all hand-coded.",
        "This inability to handle new text poses a serious problem in its general applicability and extensibility.",
        "This paper describes a method for selecting the right or most probable structure for a Japanese sentence among multiple probable structures generated by Restricted Dependency Grammar (RDG) (Fuku-moto, 1992).",
        "If this method works, then its results will be quite valuable for facilitating the development of new texts for CAI systems like CATERS."

        "As pointed out earlier, the dependency relation of elements in Japanese sentences are fairly complicated due to relatively free word orders.",
        "RDG is designed to determine dependency relations among words and phrases in sentences.",
        "To do so, it classifies the phrases according to grammatical categories and syntactic attributes.",
        "However, it fails to reject semantically unacceptable dependency structures.",
        "The inevitable consequence is that RDG often produces multiple parses even for a simple sentence.",
        "Kurohashi and Nagao (1993) try to determine the dependency relations of a sentence by means of using sample sentences.",
        "When the sentence is structurally ambiguous, they determine its structure by comparing it to structurally similar patterns taken from a manually generated set of examples and calculating similarity values.",
        "Our method, on the contrary, uses a statistical approach to select the most probable structure or parse of a given sentence.",
        "It takes as input dependency structures generated by RDG for a sentence, finds all of modifier-particle-modificant relations, calculates their mutual information and chooses the structure for which the product of the mutual information of its relations is the highest.",
        "In order to calculate the mutual information for any modifier-particle-modificant pattern, we use the Conceptual Dictionaryl (CD) to build a taxonomic hierarchy of the modifiers which occur 'The Co-occurrence Dictionary and Conceptual Dictionary used in the process are part of a set of machine readable Japanese dictionaries compiled by the Japan Electronic Dictionary Research Institute (EDR, 1993).",
        "The Conceptual Dictionary is a set of graphs consisting of 400,000 concepts and a number of taxonomic as well as functional relations between them.",
        "The Co-occurrence Dictionary consist of a list of 1,100,000 dependency relations (modifier, particle and modificant) taken from a corpus.",
        "Each entry includes syntactic information, concept identifiers (a numerical code) and the number of occurrences in the corpus.",
        "with the particle-modificant sub-pattern in the Co-occurrence Dictionary (COD).",
        "The mutual information for any pattern is the maximum mutual information between the sub-pattern and the concepts in the taxonomic hierarchy which generalize the modifier in the pattern.",
        "Resnik and Hearst (1993) use a similar approach to calculate preferences for prepositional phrase attachment.",
        "While they use data on word groups, our method directly uses word co-occurrence data to estimate the preferences using the CD to identify the most adequate grouping for each relation.",
        "While Kurohashi and Nagao compare the sentence with a single sample of patterns, we use all occurrences of the pattern in COD to calculate the mutual information.",
        "Our approach automatically extracts the occurrences from the dictionary as well as builds the taxonomic hierarchy.",
        "Unlike Kurohashi and Nagao (1993), which uses only verb and adjective patterns, we cover all dependency relations."

        "We also build a taxonomic hierarchy for the modifier that appears with the particle-modificant in the sentence.",
        "Then comparing these two taxonomic hierarchies (one for the modifiers in the COD, one for the modifiers in the sentence), we look for the concept identifier common to both hierarchies that has the highest mutual information.",
