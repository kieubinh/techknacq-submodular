        "One of the fundamental issues concerning corpus-based NLP is that we can never expect to know from the training data all the necessary quantitative information for the words that might occur in the test data if the vocabulary is large enough to cope with a real world domain.",
        "In view of the effectiveness of class-based n-gram language models against the data sparseness problem (Kneser and Ney 1993, Ueberla 1995), it is expected that classes of words are also useful for NLP tasks in such a way that statistics on classes are used whenever statistics on individual words are unavailable or unreliable.",
        "An ideal type of clusters for NLP is the one which guarantees mutual substitutability, in terms of both syntactic and semantic soundness, among words in the same class (Harris 1951, Brill and Marcus 1992).",
        "Take, for example, the following sentences.",
        "(a) He went to the house by car.",
        "(b) He went to the apartment by bus.",
        "(c) He went to the ?",
        "by ?",
        ".",
        "(d) He went to the house by the sea.",
        "Suppose that we want to parse sentences using a statistical parser and that sentences (a) and (b) appeared in the training and test data, respectively.",
        "Since (a) is in the training data, we know that the prepositional phrase by car is attached to the main verb went, not to the noun phrase the house.",
        "Sentence (b) is quite similar to (a) in meaning, and identical to (a) in sentence structure.",
        "Now if the words apartment and bus are unknown to the parsing system",
        "(i.e. never occurred in the training data), then sentence (b) must look to the system very much like (c), and it will be very hard for the parsing system to tell the difference in sentence structure between (c) and (d).",
        "However, if the system has access to a predefined set of classes of words, and if car and bus are in the same class, and house and apartment are in another class, it will not be hard for the system to detect the similarity between (a) and (b) and assign the correct sentence structure to (b) without confusing it with (d).",
        "The same argument holds for an example-based machine translation system.",
        "In that case, an appropriate translation of (b) is expected to be derived with an example translation of (a) if the system has an access to the classes of words.",
        "Therefore, it is desirable that we build clustering of the vocabulary in terms of mutual substitutability.",
        "Furthermore, clustering is much more useful if the clusters are of variable granularity.",
        "Suppose, for example, that we have two sets of clusters, one is finer than the other, and that word-1 and word-2 are in different finer classes.",
        "With finer clusters alone, the amount of information on the association of the two words that the system can obtain from the clusters is minimal.",
        "However, if the system has a capability of falling back and checking if they belong to the same coarser class, and if that is the case, then the system can take advantage of the class information for the two words.",
        "When we extend this notion of two-level word clustering to many levels, we will have a tree representation of all the words in the vocabulary in which the root node represents the whole vocabulary and a leaf node represents a word in the vocabulary.",
        "Also, any set of nodes in the tree constitutes a partition (or clustering) of the vocabulary if there exists one and only one node in the set along the path from the root node to each leaf node.",
        "In the following sections, we will first describe a method of creating a binary tree representation of the vocabulary and present results of evaluating and comparing the quality of the clusters obtained from texts of very different sizes.",
        "Then we will extend the paradigm of clustering from word-based clustering to compound-based clustering.",
        "In the above examples we looked only at the mutual substitutability of words; however, a lot of information can also be gained if we look at the substitutability of word compounds for either other word compounds or single words.",
        "We will introduce the notion of compound-classes, propose a method for constructing them, and present results of our approach."

        "We used plain texts from two years (1987 and 1988) of Wall Street Journal Corpus to create compound clusters.",
        "The total volume amounts to about 40 MW of text.",
        "The word-classes used in this experiment are taken from the result of MI clustering with the 50MW text followed by five rounds of reshuffling.",
        "The quality of the compound clusters depends on the threshold *TH* in equation 3.",
        "We used *TH*=3 following \"a very rough rule of thumb\" used for word-based mutual information in (Church and Hanks, 1990).",
        "Out of the 40MW text, 7621 distinct class chains and 287,656 distinct multiword compounds are extracted.",
        "To construct a new vocabulary, we selected the words and tokens whose frequency in the reduced text is more than four.",
        "The size of the new vocabulary is 60589 and it contains 4685 class chain tokens.",
        "Some of the compound-classes that were obtained are shown in Figure 7.",
        "The compounds are listed in descending order of frequency in each class, and the lists are truncated at an arbitrary point.",
        "Compound-class-171 consists of names with title many of which are politicians' names.",
        "Compound-class-179 contains multiword company names.",
        "Compound-class-221 consists of multiword compound nouns from several specific semantic domains including money, surgery and natural environment, but most of the frequent compounds are money-related terms.",
        "Compound-class-256 is worth special attention in the sense that although single words and multiword compounds are mixed almost evenly, most of the single words are abbreviations of organizations, mostly public organizations, and the multiword compounds also almost exclusively represent public organizations.",
        "Another point to note here is that the pattern of case is not uniform in this list.",
        "Although both \"Defense Department\" and \"British government\" represent political organizations, the former consists of only capitalized words and the latter doesn't. In order to measure the performance of this compound clustering method, a consistency check is performed for one class.",
        "The objective is to check what proportion of the identified members of the class actually deserves to be included in the class.",
        "Because this kind of judgement is very difficult in general, we must choose a class whose membership is quite clear to identify.",
        "By this criterion we chose compound-class-179 because it is quite easy to decide if some compound is a correct company name or not.",
        "From the 40MW text, we randomly chose 3000 occurrences of multiword compounds which are members of compound-class-179.",
        "By manual analysis, it was found that 133 identified compounds were wrong.",
        "The precision is therefore 95.6 %.",
        "Most of the errors are due to the truncation of correct company names.",
        "For example, from the string \"North American Philips Corp.\", only \"Philips Corp.\" was extracted.",
        "Although \"Philips Corp.\" is itself a correct company name, we treated this instance as an error because our judgement was occurrence-based.",
        "There was only one instance where a compound irrelevant to company names was extracted (a person name).",
        "For a control experiment which we will describe shortly, all the incorrect compounds are corrected by hand and a standard file is created which contains all the correct 2999 occurrences of company names.",
        "One merit of the current approach is that the identification of a compound-class is carried out in time linear with the text size.",
        "Therefore, by associating a word with its word-class as a feature in the lexicon, and by storing class chain patterns and their membership to compound classes, we can carry out a real time identification of the compound-classes without actually storing the compounds in the lexicon.",
        "As a control experiment to the above experiment, we conducted word-based compound extraction and compared the result with the above result.",
        "Instead of mutual information of adjacent classes, mutual information of adjacent words are calculated for all the bigrams in the text.",
        "Then using various MI threshold values, words are chained in a similar way as described in Section 4.1, and compounds are identified.",
        "We then evaluated how many of the occurrences of company names in the standard file are identified in the word-based compound extraction experiment.",
        "We varied the MI threshold values from 1.0 to 6.0 with a step of 0.5, but the precision of the word-based approach with respect to the standard file was always below 50 %.",
        "The main reason of the superiority of the class-based approach against the word-based one is associated with the data sparseness problem.",
        "Most of the previously proposed methods to extract compounds or to measure word association using mutual information (MI) either ignore or penalize items with low co-occurrence counts (Church and Hanks 1990, Su, Wu and Chang 1994), because MI becomes unstable when the co-occurrence counts are very small.",
        "Take for example a class chain \"WC129_WC246\" discussed above.",
        "Figure 8 shows some examples of compounds matching the pattern \"WC129_WC246\" in the 40MW text.",
        "Each column shows, from left to right, word-based MI for the word bigram (WORD-1,WORD-2), co-occurrence frequency of the word bigram, the first word, the second word, class-based MI for the class bigram (CLASS-1, CLASS-2), co-occurrence frequency of the class bigram, the word-class of WORD-1, and the word-class of WORD-2.",
        "Note that the numbers for class-based entries are",
        "the same for all the compounds because we collected compounds with the same class chain.",
        "Although all the compounds are compounds of a first name and a family name, the word-based MI varies considerably.",
        "This is because frequencies of first names and family names vary considerably while frequencies of pairs of first names and family names in the list are very small.",
        "For example, \"John\" and \"Jackson\" are very common first and second names, but the name \"John Jackson\" appeared only once in the text.",
        "Therefore the word-based MI becomes very small.",
        "On the other hand, because \"Takako\" and \"Doi\" were very rare names in WSJ news articles in 1987 and 1988, the MI becomes very high even though \"Takako Doi\" appeared only once in the text.",
        "In contrast, the class-based MI is very stable because the co-occurrence frequency of the two classes is as high as 52087.",
        "When we examined frequencies of all the compounds in the text that match \"WC129_WC246\", it turned out that more than 80 % of the compounds appeared less than five times in the text.",
        "This shows how the data sparseness problem is critical for the purpose of compound extraction."

        "It is shown that by using statistics on classes instead of on words, the data sparseness problem is avoided and the reliability of mutual information is increased.",
