        "Word sense disambiguation is a crucial task in many NLP applications, such as machine translation [1], parsing [14, 16] and text retrieval [10, 23].",
        "Given the growing utilization of machine readable texts, word sense disambiguation techniques have been variously used in corpus-based approaches [1, 3, 5, 12, 18, 20, 21, 24].",
        "Unlike rule-based approaches, corpus-based approaches release us from the task of generalizing observed phenomena in order to disambiguate word senses.",
        "Our system is based on such an approach, or more precisely it is based on an example-based approach [5].",
        "Since this approach requires a certain number of examples of disambiguated verbs, we have to carry out this task manually, that is, we disambiguate verbs appearing in a corpus prior to their use by the system.",
        "A preliminary experiment on ten Japanese verbs showed that the system needed on average about one hundred examples for each verb in order to achieve 82% of accuracy in disambiguating verb senses.",
        "In order to build an operational system, the following problems have to be taken into account:",
        "1.",
        "Since there are about one thousand basic verbs in Japanese, a considerable overhead is associated with manual word sense disambiguation.",
        "2.",
        "Given human resource limitations, it is not reasonable to manually analyze large corpora as they can provide virtually infinite input.",
        "3.",
        "Given the fact that example-based natural language systems, including our system, search",
        "the example-database (database, hereafter) for the most similar examples with regard to the input, the computational cost becomes prohibitive if one works with a very large database size [11].",
        "All these problems suggest a different approach, namely to select a small number of optimally informative examples from a given corpora.",
        "Hereafter we will call these examples \"samples.\" Our method, based on the utility maximization principle, decides on which examples should be included in the database.",
        "This decision procedure is usually called selective sampling.",
        "Selective sampling directly addresses the first two problems mentioned above.",
        "The overall control flow of systems based on selective sampling can be depicted as in figure 1, where \"system\" refers to dedicated NLP applications.",
        "The sampling process basically cycles between the execution and the training phases.",
        "During the execution phase, the system generates an interpretation for each example, in terms of parts-of-speech, text categories or word senses.",
        "During the training phase, the system selects samples for training from the previously produced outputs.",

        "This method selects samples based on the training utility factor of the examples, i.e. the informativity of the data with respect to future training.",
        "However, as all these methods are implemented for statistics-based models, there is a need to explore how to formalize and map these concepts into the example-based approach.",
        "With respect to problem 3, a possible solution would be the generalization of redundant examples [8, 19].",
        "However, such an approach implies a significant overhead for the manual training of each example prior to the generalization.",
        "This shortcoming is precisely what our approach allows to avoid: reducing both the overhead as well as the size of the database.",

        "Figure 2 shows a fragment of the entry associated with the Japanese verb torn.",
        "As with most words, the verb torn has multiple senses, a sample of which are \"to take/steal,\" \"to attain,\" \"to subscribe\" and \"to reserve.\" The database specifies the case frame(s) associated with each verb sense.",
        "In Japanese, a complement of a verb consists of a noun phrase (case filler) and its case marker suffix, for example ga (nominative) or o (accusative).",
        "The database lists several case filler examples for each case.",
        "The task of the system is \"to interpret\" the verbs occurring in the input text, i.e. to choose one sense from among a set of candidates.",
        "All verb senses we use are defined in \"IPAL\" [7], a machine readable dictionary.",
        "IPAL also contains example case fillers as shown in figure 2.",
        "Given an input, in our case a simple sentence, the system identifies the verb sense on the basis of the scored similarity between the input and the examples given for each verb sense.",
        "Let us take as an example the sentence below:",
        "In this example, one may consider hisho (\"secretary\") and shindaisha (\"sleeping car\") to be semantically similar to joshu (\"assistant\") and hikOki (\"airplane\") respectively, and since both collocate with the \"to reserve\" sense of torn one could infer that torn may be interpreted as \"to reserve.\" The similarity between two different case fillers is estimated according to the length of the path between them in a thesaurus.",
        "Our current experiments are based around the Japanese word thesaurus Bunruigoihyo [17].",
        "Figure 3 shows a fragment of Bunruigoihyo including some of the nouns in both figure 2 and the example sentence above, with each word corresponding to a leaf in the structure of the thesaurus.",
        "As with most thesauri, the length of the path between two terms in Bunruigoihyo is expected to reflect their relative similarity.",
        "In",
        "table 1, we show our measure of similarity, based on the length of the path between two terms, as proposed by Kurohashi et al. [12].",
        "Furthermore, since the restrictions imposed by the case fillers in choosing the verb sense are not equally selective, we consider a weighted case contribution to the disambiguation (CCD) of the verb senses.",
        "This CCD factor is taken into account when computing the score of a verb's sense.",
        "Consider again the case of toru in figure 2.",
        "Since the semantic range of nouns collocating with the verb in the nominative does not seem to have a strong delinearization in a semantic sense (in figure 2, the nominative of each verb sense displays the same general concept, i.e. animate), it would be difficult, or even risky, to properly interpret the verb sense based on the similarity in the nominative.",
        "In contrast, since the ranges are diverse in the accusative, it would be feasible to rely more strongly on the similarity here.",
        "This argument can be illustrated as in figure 4, in which the symbols \"1\" and \"2\" denote example case fillers of different case frames, and an input sentence includes two case fillers denoted by \"x\" and \"y.\"",
        "The figure shows the distribution of example case fillers for the respective case frames, denoted in a semantic space.",
        "The semantic similarity between two given case fillers is represented by the physical distance between two symbols.",
        "In the nominative, since \"x\" happens to be much closer to a \"2\" than any \"1,\" \"x\" may be estimated to belong to the range of \"2\"s, although \"x\" actually belongs to both sets of \"1\"s and \"2\"s. In the accusative, however, \"y\" would be properly estimated to belong to the set of \"1\"s due to the mutual independence of the two accusative case filler sets, even though examples did not fully cover each of the ranges of \"1\"s and \"2\"s. Note that this difference would be critical if example data were sparse.",
        "•We will explain the method used to compute CCD later in this section.",
        "To illustrate the overall algorithm, we will consider an abstract specification of both input and the datatbase (see figure 5).",
        "Let the input be {nci-mci, nc2-mc2, nc3-mc3, v}, where nci denotes the case filler for the case ci, and mci denotes the case marker for ci.",
        "The interpretation candidates for v are derived from the database as Si, s2 and s3.",
        "The database contains also a set &s ,c of case filler examples for each case cl of each sense 8, (\" – \" indicates that the corresponding case is not allowed).",
        "During the verb sense disambiguation process, the system discards first those candidates whose case frame does not fit the input.",
        "In the case of figure 5, 83 is discarded because the case frame of v (s3) does not subcategorize for the case In the next step the system computes the score of the remaining candidates and chooses as the most plausible interpretation the one with the highest score.",
        "The score of an interpretation is computed by considering the weighted average of the similarity degrees of the input complements with respect to each of the example case fillers (in the corresponding case) listed in the database for the sense under evaluation.",
        "Formally, this is expressed by equation (1), where S(s) is the score of the sense s of the input verb, and S/M(nc,es,c) is the maximum similarity degree between the input complement nc and the corresponding complements in the database example Es,c (equation (2)).",
        "In equation (2), sim stands for the similarity degree between nc and an example case filler e as given by table 1.",
        "CCD(c) expresses the weight factor of the case c contribution to the (current) verb sense disambiguation.",
        "Intuitively preference should be given to cases displaying case fillers which are classified in semantic categories of greater independence.",
        "Let v be a verb with n senses (Si, 52, , sn) and let Esi,c be the set of example case fillers for the case c, associated with the sense s1.",
        "Then, c's contribution to v's sense disambiguation, CCD(c), is likely to be higher if the example case filler sets { esi,c I i 1, ... ,n} share less elements.",
        "The notion of sharing is defined based on the similarity as in equation (3).",
        "{X} U {Y} = {X} if sim(X, Y) >= 9 (3)",

        "The experiments showed that our method, which is based on the notion of training utility, has reduced the overhead for the training of the system, as well as the size of the database.",
        "As pointed out in section 1, the generalization of examples [8, 19] is another method for reducing the size of the database.",
        "Whether coupling these two methods would increase overall effectivity is an empirical matter requiring further exploration.",
        "Future work will include more sophisticated methods for verb sense disambiguation and methods of acquiring seeds, the acquisition of which is currently based on an existing dictionary.",
        "We will also build an experimental database for natural language processing using our example sampling method."
