        "Turing's formula [Good 1953] and Zipf's law [Zipf 1935] indicate how population frequencies in general tend to behave.",
        "Turing's formula estimates locally what the frequency count of a species that occurred r times in a sample really would have been, had the sample accurately reflected the underlying population distribution.",
        "Zipf's law prescribes the asymptotic behavior of the relative frequencies of species as a function of their rank The ranking scheme in question orders the species by frequency, with the most common species ranked first.",
        "The reason that these formulas are of interest in computational linguistics is that they can be used to improve probability estimates from relative frequencies, and to predict the frequencies of unseen phenomena, e.g., the frequency of previously unseen words encountered in running text.",
        "Due to limitations in the amount of available training data, the so-called sparse-data problem, estimating probabilities directly from observed relative frequencies may not always be very accurate.",
        "For this reason, Turing's formula, in the incarnation of Katz's back-off scheme [Katz 1987], has become a standard technique for improving parameter estimates for probabilistic language models used by speech recognizers.",
        "A more theoretical treatment of Turing's formula itself can be found in [Nadas 1985].",
        "Zipf's law is commonly regarded as an empirically accurate description of a wide variety of (linguistic) phenomena, but too general to be of any direct use.",
        "For a bit of historic controversy on Zipf's law, we refer to [Simon 1955], [Mandelbrot 1959], and subsequent articles in Information and Control.",
        "The model presented there for the stochastic source generating the various Zipfian distributions is however linguistically highly dubious: a version of the monkey-with-typewriter scenario.",
        "The remainder if this article is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we induce a recurrence equation from Turing's local reestimation formula and from this derive the asymptotic behavior of the relative frequency as a function of rank, using a continuum approximation.",
        "The resulting probability distribution is then examined, and we rederive the recurrence equation from it.",
        "In Section 3, we start with the asymptotic behavior stipulated by Zipf's law, and derive a recurrence equation similar to that associated with Turing's formula, and from this",
        "induce a corresponding reestimation formula.",
        "We then rederive the Zipfian asymptote from the established recurrence equation.",
        "In Section 4, similar techniques are used to establish the asymptotic behavior inherent in a general class of recurrence equations, parameterized by a real-valued parameter, and then to rederive the recurrence equations from their asymptotes.",
        "The convergence region of this parameter for the cumulative of the frequency function, as rank approaches infinity, is also investigated.",
        "In Section 5, we summarize the results, discuss how they might be used practically, and compare them with related work."

        "While the latter relates the rank and relative frequency as asymptotically inversely proportional, the former states that the frequency declines exponentially with rank This means that while Zipf's law implies a finite total population, Turing's formula yields a proper probability distribution also for infinite populations.",
        "In fact, it is tempting to interpret Turing's formula as smoothing the relative-frequency estimates towards a geometric distribution.",
        "This could potentially be used to improve sparse-data estimates by assuming a geometric distribution (tail), and introducing a ranking based on direct frequency counts, frequency counts when backing off to more general conditionings, order of appearance in the training data, or, to break any remaining ties, lexicographical order.",
        "Conversely, a local reestimation formula in the vein of Turing's formula was derived from Zipf's law.",
