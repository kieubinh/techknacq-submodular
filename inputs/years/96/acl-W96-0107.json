        "All of the pairs are extracted from a parallel corpus of a specific domain.",

        "Kumano & Hirakawa stand on a different setting from the other works in that they assume ordinary bilingual dictionary and use non-parallel (non-aligned) corpora.",
        "Their target is to find correspondences not only of word level but of noun phrases and unknown words.",

        "In their work of aligning of parallel texts, Kay & ROscheisen used the Dice coefficient as the word similarity for insuring sentence level correspondence [Kay & ROscheisen 93].",
        "Kitamura & Matsumoto use the same measure to calculate word similarity in their work of extraction of translation patterns.",
        "The similarity measure is used as the basis of their structural matching of parallel sentences so as to extract structural translation patterns.",
        "In texts of expertise a number of word sequence correspondences, not word-word correspondences, are abundant especially in the form of noun compounds or of fixed phrases, which are keys for better performance.",
        "Though the method proposed in this paper deals only with consecutive sequences of words and is intended to provide a better base for the structural matching that follows, the results themselves show very useful and informative translation patterns for the domain.",
        "Our method extends the usage of the Dice coefficient in two ways: It deals not only with correspondence between the words but with correspondence between word-sequences, and it modifies the formula measure so that more plausible corresponding pairs are identified earlier."
