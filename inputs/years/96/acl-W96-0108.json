        "Word errors present problems for various text or speech-based applications such as optical character recognition (OCR) and voice-input computer interfaces.",
        "In particular, though current OCR technology is quite refined and robust, sources such as old books, poor-quality (nth-generation) photocopies, and faxes can still be difficult to process and may cause many OCR errors.",
        "For OCR to be truly useful in a wide range of applications, such as office automation and information retrieval systems, OCR reliability must be improved.",
        "A method for the automatic correction of OCR errors would be clearly beneficial.",
        "Essentially, there are two types of word errors: non-word errors and real-word errors.",
        "A non-word error occurs when a word in a source text is interpreted (under OCR) as a string that does not correspond to any valid word in a given word list or dictionary.",
        "A real-word error occurs when a source-text word is interpreted as a string that actually does occur in the dictionary, but is not identical with the source-text word.",
        "For example, if the source text \"John found the man\" is rendered as \"John fornd he man\" by an OCR device, then \"fornd\" is a non-word error and \"he\" is a real-word error.",
        "In general, non-word errors will never correspond to any dictionary entries and",
        "will include wildly incorrect strings (such as \"#--&&\") as well as misrecognized alphanumeric sequences (such as \"BN234\" for \"8N234\").",
        "However, some non-word errors might become real-word errors if the size of the word list or dictionary increases.",
        "(For example, the word \"rue!\" might count as a non-word error for the source-text word \"rut\" if a small dictionary is used for reference, but count as a real-word error if an unabridged dictionary is used.)",
        "While non-word errors might be corrected without considering the context in which the error occurs, a real-word error can only be corrected by taking context into account.",
        "The problems of word-error detection and correction have been studied for several decades.",
        "A good survey in this area can be found in [Kukich 1992].",
        "Most traditional word-correction techniques concentrate on non-word error correction and do not consider the context in which the error appears.",
        "Recently, statistical language models (SLMs) and feature-based methods have been used for context-sensitive spelling-error correction.",
        "For example, Atwell and Elliittm [1987] have used a part-of-speech (POS) tagging method to detect the real-word errors in text.",
        "Mays and colleagues [1991] have exploited word trigrams to detect and correct both the non-word and real-word errors that were artificially generated from 100 sentences.",
        "Church and Gale [1991] have used a Bayesian classifier method to improve the performance for non-word error correction.",
        "Golding [1995] has applied a hybrid Bayesian method for real-word error correction and Golding and Schabes [1996] have combined a POS trigram and Bayesian methods for the same purpose.",
        "The goal of the work described here is to investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of SLM-based methods applied to the problem of OCR error correction.",
        "Since POS-based methods are not effective in distinguishing among candidates with the same POS tags and since methods based on word-trigram models involve extensive training data and require that huge word-trigram tables be available at run time, we used a word-bigram SLM as the first step in our investigation.",
        "In this paper, we describe a system that uses a word-bigram SLM technique to correct OCR errors.",
        "The system takes advantage of information from multiple sources, including letter n-grams, character confusion probabilities, and word bigram probabilities, to effect context-based word error correction.",
        "It can correct non-word as well as real-word errors.",

        "The word-bigram probability, pr(wi I wi_1), can be estimated by a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE):",

        "In the second feedback pass, for example, the system introduced 141 new errors by changing correct lexicon words into other lexicon words.",
        "On the other hand, the system properly corrected 684 real errors-32.1% of all the real errors.",
        "The corrected OCR text, therefore, has 543 fewer real-word errors than the original OCR text.",
        "Certain types of errors in the source or OCR-output text present systematic problems for our approach, highlighting the limitations of the system.",
        "In particular, because the process is based on the structural definition of a word (viz., a character sequence 'between white space') – not a morphological one – any errors that obscure word boundaries will defy correction.",
        "For example, run-on errors (e.g., \"of the\" /\"ofthe\") and split-word errors (\"training\" Ptrain ng\") cannot be corrected.",
        "In addition, the use of a vector-space querying to find candidate lexical entries – including our special approach to word decomposition and scoring – can present problems when processing some OCR errors, especially short strings.",
        "For example, if \"both\" (in the source) is rendered as \"hotn\" (in the OCR text), it is not possible for the system to generate \"both\" as one of the high-ranked candidates – they share only one feature, the bigram \"ot\" – despite the fact that the conditional probability pr( \"hotnTboth\") might be high.",
        "Finally, the system suffers from the common limitation of word bigram or trigram models in that it cannot capture discourse properties of context, such as topic and tense, which are sometimes required to select the correct word."
