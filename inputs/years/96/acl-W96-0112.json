        "Structural disambiguation is still a central problem in natural language processing.",
        "To completely resolve ambiguities.",
        "we would need to construct a human-like language understanding system (c.f.",
        "(Altmann and Steedman, 1988; Johnson-Laird, 1983)).",
        "The construction of such a system is extremely difficult, however, and we need to adopt a more realistic approach.",
        "In psycholinguistics, a number of principles have been proposed which attempt to modelize the human disambiguation process.",
        "The Lexical Preference Rule (LPR) (Ford et al., 1982), the Right Association Principle (RAP) (Kimball, 1973), and the Attach Low and Parallel Principle (ALPP, an extension of RAP) (Hobbs and Bear, 1990) have been proposed, and it is thought that we might resolve ambiguities quite satisfactorily if we could implement these principles sufficiently (Hobbs and Bear, 1990; Whit-temore et al., 1990).",
        "Methods of implementing these principles have also been proposed (e.g., (Shieber, 1983; Wermter, 1989; Wilks et al., 1985)).",
        "An alternative approach is to view language as a stochastic phenomenon, particularly from the viewpoint of information theory and statistics.",
        "If we could properly define a probability modell and calculate the likelihood value of each interpretation using the model, we might also resolve ambiguities quite well.",
        "There have been a number of methods proposed to perform structural disambiguation using probability models, many of which have proved to be quite effective (Alshawi and Carter, 1995; Black et al., 1992; Briscoe and Carroll, 1993; Chang et al., 1992; Collins and Brooks, 1995; Fujisaki, 1989; Hindle and Rooth, 1991; Hindle and Rooth, 1993; Jelinek et al., 1990: Magerman and Marcus, 1991; Magerman, 1995; Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994; Resnik, 1993; Su and Chang, 1988).",
        "Although each of the disambiguation methods proposed to date has its merits, none resolves the disambiguation problem completely satisfactorily.",
        "We feel that it is necessary to devise a new method that unifies the above two approaches, i.e., to implement psycholinguistic principles of disambiguation on the basis of a probabilistic methodology.",
        "Most psycholinguistic principles have representation of a probability distribution is called a 'probability model,' or simplely a 'model.'",
        "been developed on the basis of a vast data base of actual observations, and thus a method based on them is expected to achieve good disambiguation results.",
        "Probabilistic methods of implementing these principles have the merit of being able to handle noisy data, as well as being able to employ a principled methodology for acquiring the knowledge necessary for disambiguation.",
        "LPR, RAP and ALPP are known to be effective for disambiguation, and these are the ones whose implementation we consider in the present paper.",
        "Thus our problem involves the following three subproblems: (a) resolving structural ambiguities based on LPR in terms of probabilistic representations, (b) resolving structural ambiguities based on RAP and ALPP in terms of probabilistic representations, and (c) combining the two.",
        "For subproblem (a), we have devised a new method, based on LPR, which has some good properties not shared by the methods proposed so far (Alshawi and Carter, 1995; Chang et al., 1992; Collins and Brooks, 1995; Hindle and Rooth, 1991; Ratnaparkhi et al.. 1994; Resnik, 1993).",
        "In (Li and Abe, 1995), we have described this method in detail.",
        "In the present paper, we mainly describe our solutions to subproblems (b) and (c).",
        "For subproblem (b), we point out that the notion of the 'length' of a syntactic category 2 is important, and propose to use a 'length probability' to perform structural disambiguation.",
        "For subproblem (c), we propose to adopt the `back-off' method, i.e., to make use first of a lexical likelihood based on LPR, and then a syntactic likelihood based on RAP and ALPP.",

        "Kimball has proposed the Right Association Principle (RAP) (Kimball, 1973), which states that (in English) a phrase on the right should be attached to the nearest phrase on the left if possible.",
        "Hobbs & Bear have generalized RAP to the Attach Low and Parallel Principle (ALPP) (Hobbs and Bear, 1990).",
        "ALPP states that a phrase on the right should be attached to the nearest phrase on the left if possible, and that phrases should be attached to a phrase in parallel if possible.",
        "(When we refer to ALPP, we ordinarily mean just the part concerning attachments in parallel. )",
        "Ford et al.",
        "have proposed the Lexical Preference Rule (LPR) which states that an interpretation is to be preferred whose case frame assumes more semantically consistent values (Ford et al., 1982).",
        "Classically, lexical preference is realized by checking consistencies between 'semantic features' of slots and those of slot values, namely the `selectional restrictions' (Katz and Fodor, 1963).",
        "The realization of lexical preference in terms of selectional restrictions has some disadvantages, however.",
        "Interpretations obtained in an analysis cannot, for example, be ranked in their preferential order.",
        "Thus one cannot adopt a strategy of retaining the N most plausible interpretations in an analysis, which is the most widely accepted practice at present.",
        "In fact it is more appropriate to treat the lexical preference as a kind of score representing the association between slots and their values.",
        "In the present paper, we refer to this kind of score as 'lexical preference.'",
        "For the same reason, we also treat 'syntactic preference' as a kind of score.",
        "LPR is a lexical semantic principle, while RAP and ALPP are syntactic ones, and in psycholinguistics it is commonly claimed that LPR overrides RAP and ALPP (Hobbs and Bear, 1990).",
        "Let us consider some examples of LPR and RAP in this regard.",
        "For the sentence I ate ice cream with a spoon, (1) there are two interpretations; one is 'I ate ice cream using a spoon' and the other ate ice cream and a spoon.'",
        "In this sentence, a human speaker would certainly assume the former interpretation over",
        "the latter.",
        "From the psycholinguistic perspective, this can be explained in the following way: the former interpretation has a stronger lexical preference than the latter, and thus is to be preferred according to LPR.",
        "Moreover.",
        "since LPR overrides RAP, the preference is solely determined by LPR.",
        "For the sentence John phoned a man in Chicago, (2) there are two interpretations; one is 'John phoned a man who is in Chicago' and the other 'John, while in Chicago, phoned a man.'",
        "In this sentence, a human speaker would probably assume the former interpretation over the latter.",
        "The two interpretations have an equal lexical preference value, and thus the preference of the two cannot be determined by LPR.",
        "After LPR fails to work, the former interpretation is to be preferred according to RAP, because 'a man' is closer to 'in Chicago' than 'phone' in the sentence.",
        "LPR implies that (in natural language) one should communicate as relevantly as possible, while RAP and ALPP implies that one should communicate as efficiently as possible.",
        "Although the phenomena governed by these principles vary from language to language, the principles themselves, we think, are language independent, and thus can be regarded as fundamental principles of human communication.",
        "According to Whittemore et al.",
        "and Hobbs & Bear, nearly all of the ambiguities can be resolved by first applying LPR and then RAP and ALPP (Hobbs and Bear, 1990; Whittemore et al., 1990).",
        "These observations motivate us strongly to implement these principles for disambiguation purposes.",
        "While there are also other principles proposed in the literature, including the Minimal Attachment Principle (Frazier and Fodor, 1979), they are generally either not highly functional or are covered by the above three principles in any case (Hobbs and Bear, 1990; Whittemore et al., 1990).",
        "The necessity of developing a disambiguation method with learning ability has recently come to be widely recognized.",
        "The realization of such a method would make it possible to (a) save the cost of defining knowledge by hand (b) do away with the subjectivity inherent in human definition (c) make it easier to adapt a natural language analysis system to a new domain.",
        "We think that a probabilistic approach is especially attractive because it is able to employ a principled methodology for acquiring the knowledge necessary for disambiguation.",

        "ties and coordinate structure ambiguities.",
        "These two kinds of ambiguities are typical, and other ambiguities can be resolved in the same way (Hobbs and Bear, 1990).",
        "We first defined 12 CFG rules as our grammar to be used by a parser which calculates a preference for each partial interpretation, and always retains the N most preferable partial interpretations7.",
        "We have not yet actually constructed such a parser, however, and use a parser called 'SAX,' previously developed by Matsumoto & Sugimura (Matsumoto and Sugimura, 1986), which calculates a preference for each interpretation after it obtains each interpretation.",
        "We then trained the parameters of probability models.",
        "We extracted 181, 250 case frames from the WSJ (Wall Street Journal) bracketed corpus of the Penn Tree Bank (Marcus et al., 1993).",
        "We used these data to estimate three-word probabilities and two-word probabilities.",
        "Furthermore, we extracted 963 sentences from the WSJ tagged corpus of the Penn Tree Bank.",
        "We used SAX to analyze the sentences and selected the correct syntactic trees by hand.",
        "We then employed the Maximum Likelihood Estimator to estimate length probabilities using the selected syntactic trees, e.g., if CFG rule NP NP, PP is applied x times, and among the attachments obtained by applying this rule, xi of them have the lengths of 2 and 3, then the length probability P(2, 3I(NP NP, PP)) is estimated as a .",
        "It is known, in statistics, that the number of samples required for accurate estimation of a probabilistic model is roughly proportional to the number of parameters in the target model, and thus the data used for training length probabilities were nearly sufficient.",
        "Figure 3 plots the estimated length probabilities versus the lengths, for two CFG rules.",
        "The result indicates that there are more attachments attached to nearby phrases than are attached to distant ones in the training data.",
        "Moreover, the length probabilities for CFG rule VP – + VP, PP and those for CFG rule NP – 4 NP, PP show different distribution patterns, suggesting that syntactic preference is a function of a CFG rule.",
        "We then extracted 249 sentences from a part of the tagged WSJ corpus which was not used in training as our test data and analyzed the sentences.",
        "When analizing a sentence, we rank the obtained interpretations as follows: if",
        "where h and 12 denote any two interpretations.",
        "P1e,30 denotes the lexical likelihood value of an interpretation calculated as the geometric mean of three-word probabilities, P/„2() the lexical likelihood value of an interpretation calculated as the geometric mean of two-word probabilities, and P8yn0 the syntactic likelihood value of an interpretation.",
        "The average number of interpretations obtained in the analysis of a sentence was 2.4.",
        "The number 1 accuracy obtained was 89.2% (Table 1 represents this result as `Lex3+Lex2-1-Syn'), where the number n accuracy is defined as the fraction of the test sentences whose preferred interpretation is successfully ranked in the first n candidates.",
        "We feel that this result is very encouraging.",
        "Table 2 shows the breakdown of the result, in which `Lex3' stands for the proportion determined by using lexical likelihood Pi„3, `Lex2' by using lexical likelihood 2P/„2, and Syn' by using syntactic likelihood Psyn.",

        "Furthermore, `Lex3,' `Lex2,' and `Syn' formed 47.0%, 43.4%, and 9.6% of the disambiguation results, respectively.",
        "We further examined the types of mistakes made by our method.",
        "First, there were some mistakes by 'Syn.'",
        "For example, in Rain washes the fertilizers off the land, (25)",
        "there are two interpretations.",
        "The lexical likelihood values P1er3 of the two interpretations were calculated as 0, and the lexical likelihood values P1„2 of the two interpretations were calculated as 0, as well.",
        "The interpretations were ranked by the syntactic likelihood Psvn, and the interpretation of attaching the 'off' phrase to 'fertilizer' was mistakenly preferred.",
        "We also found some mistakes by `Lex2; For example, in The parents reclaimed the child under the circumstances, (26) there are two interpretations.",
        "The lexical likelihood values Piex3 of the two interpretations were calculated as 0.",
        "The lexical likelihood value P/„2 of the interpretation of attaching 'under' phrase to 'child' was higher than that of attaching it to 'reclaimed,' as there were many expressions like 'a child under five' observed in the training data.",
        "And thus the former interpretation was mistakenly preferred.",
        "It is obvious that these kinds of mistakes could be avoided if more data were available.",
        "We conclude that the most effective way of improving disambiguation results is to increase data for training lexical preference.",
        "We further checked the disambiguation decisions made by 'Syn.",
        "when `Lex3' and `Lex2' fail to work, and found that all of the prepositional phrases in these sentences were attached to nearby phrases by `Syn,' indicating that using syntactic likelihood can help to achieve a functioning of RAP.",
        "One may argue that we could obtain the same number 1 accuracy if we were to employ a deterministic approach in implementing RAP.",
        "As we pointed out earlier, however, if we are to obtain the N most preferred interpretations, we need to use syntactic likelihood.",
        "To verify that the syntactic likelihood is indeed useful, we conducted the following additional experiment.",
        "We ranked the interpretations of each of the 249 test sentences using only syntactic likelihood.",
        "We also selected the interpretation with phrases always attached to nearby phrases as the most preferred ones, and randomly selected interpretations from what remain as the nth most preferred ones.",

        "We expect the effect of the use of the syntactic likelihood to become more significant when longer sentences are used in future analyses.",

        "We employed the Maximum Likelihood Estimator to estimate the parameters of PCFG (we did not use the so-called 'inside-outside algorithm' (Jelinek et al., 1990; Lan i and Young, 1990)), making use of the same training data as those used for the length probability model.",
