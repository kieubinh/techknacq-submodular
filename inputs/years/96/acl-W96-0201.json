        "There is no guarantee that this will never happen with SIMR.",
        "However, there is evidence that it is extremely unlikely.",
        "First, SIMR can wander off the right track only if there is an alternative (wrong) track.",
        "The noise reduction heuristics mentioned in Section 3.5 ensure that very few points of correspondence can be generated away from the TBM trace.",
        "Those points that are generated are extremely unlikely to be sufficiently linear and to have the proper slope to fool the chain recognition heuristic.",

        "It rarely got lost with a fixed chain size of 6 and never with a fixed chain size of 7 or more.",
        "The optimal fixed chain size with respect to the RMS error metric was 9 when the translation lexicon was used, and 8 when it was not.",
        "The chances of 8 or 9 false points of correspondence satisfying the maximum point dispersal, maximum angle deviation, and maximum point ambiguity level thresholds are negligible.",
        "Finally, if SIMR does get lost, the resulting bitext map will contain telltale discontinuities.",
        "Such discontinuities can be automatically detected with high reliability (Melamed 1996).",

      "text": [
        "SIMR has no idea that words are often used to make sentences.",
        "It just outputs a series of corresponding token positions, leaving users free to draw their own conclusions about how the texts' larger units correspond.",
        "However, many existing translators' tools and machine translation strategies are based on aligned sentences.",
        "What can SIMR do for them?",
        "There are several papers in the literature about bitext alignment.",
        "The algorithms that seem to work best rely on the high correlation between the lengths of corresponding sentences (Brown et al.",
        "1991, Gale & Church 1991).",
        "However, these algorithms can fumble in bitext sections that contain many sentences of very similar length, like this vote record:",
        "The only way to ensure a correct alignment in such regions is to look at the words.",
        "For this reason, Chen (1993) adds a statistical translation model to the Brown et al.",
        "alignment algorithm, and Wu (1994) adds a translation lexicon to the Gale Sz Church alignment algorithm.",
        "A set of points of correspondence leads to alignment more directly than a translation model or a translation lexicon, because points of correspondence are a relation between token instances, not between token types.",
        "Moreover, a set of correspondence points, supplemented with sentence boundary information, expresses sentence correspondence, which is a richer representation than sentence alignment.",
        "Figure 9 illustrates how sentence boundaries form a grid over the bitext space3.",
        "Each cell in the grid represents the intersection of two sentences, one from each component text.",
        "A point of correspondence inside cell (X,y) indicates that some token in sentence X corresponds with some token in sentence y; i.e. sentences X and y correspond.",
        "Thus, Figure 9 indicates that sentence e corresponds with sentences G and H. In contrast to a correspondence relation, \"an alignment is a segmentation of the two texts such that the nth segment of one text is the translation of the nth segment of the other.\" (Simard et al.",
        "1992) For example, given the token correspondences in Figure 9, the segment (G, H) should be aligned with the segment (e, f).",
        "If sentences (X1, , Xn,) align with sentences (Y1, • • • , , then ((X1, .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ",X0), (yi,..., yn)) is an aligned block.",
        "In geometric terms, aligned blocks are rectangular regions of the bitext space, such that the sides of the rectangles coincide with sentence boundaries, and such that no two rectangles overlap either vertically or horizontally.",
        "The aligned blocks in Figure 9 are outlined with solid lines.",
        "SIMR's initial output has more expressive power than the alignment that can be derived from it.",
        "One illustration of this difference is that sentence correspondence can express inversions, but sentence alignment cannot.",
        "Inversions occur surprisingly often in real bitexts, even for sentence-size text units.",
        "Figure 9 provides another illustration.",
        "If, instead of the point in cell (H,e), there was a point in cell (G,f), the correct alignment for that region would still be ((G, (e, f)).",
        "If there were points of correspondence in both (H,e) and (G,f), the correct alignment would still be the same.",
        "Yet, the three cases are clearly different.",
        "If a lexicographer wanted to see a word in sentence G in its bilingual context, it would be useful to know whether sentence f is relevant.",
        "Converting from sentence correspondence to sentence alignment is of dubious practical value.",
        "Nevertheless, in order to facilitate comparison of the geometric approach with other alignment algorithms, I have designed the Geometric Sentence Alignment (GSA) algorithm to reduce",
        "sets of correspondence points to alignments.",
        "The algorithm's first step is to perform a transitive closure over the input correspondence relation.",
        "For instance, if the input contains (G,e), (H,e), and (H,f), then GSA adds the pairing (G,f).",
        "Next, GSA forces all segments to be contiguous: If sentence Y corresponds with sentences x and z, but not y, the pairing (Y,y) is added.",
        "In geometric terms, these two operations arrange all cells that contain points of correspondence into non-overlapping rectangles, while adding as few cells as possible.",
        "The result is an alignment relation.",
        "A complete set of TPCs, together with appropriate boundary information, guarantees a perfect alignment.",
        "Alas, the points of correspondence postulated by SIMR are neither complete nor noise-free.",
        "Fortunately, the noise in SIMR's output causes alignment errors in very predictable ways.",
        "GSA employs a couple of backing-off heuristics to eliminate most of the errors.",
        "SIMR makes errors of omission and errors of commission.",
        "Typical errors of commission are stray points of correspondence like the one in cell (H, e) in Figure 9.",
        "This point indicates that (G, H) and (e, 1) should form a 2x2 aligned block, whereas the lengths of the component sentences suggest that a pair of lx1 blocks is more likely.",
        "In a separate development bitext, I have found that SIMR is usually wrong in these cases.",
        "To combat such errors, GSA realigns any aligned block that is not lxl, using the Gale & Church length-based alignment algorithm (Gale & Church 1991, Simard 1995).",
        "Whenever the component sentence lengths suggest a more fine-grained alignment, SIMR's output is not trusted.",
        "Typical errors of omission are illustrated in Figure 9 by the complete absence of correspondence points between sentences (B, C, D) and (b, c).",
        "This block of sentences is sandwiched between aligned blocks.",
        "It is highly likely that at",
        "least some of these sentences are mutual translations, despite SIMR's failure to find any points of correspondence between them.",
        "Therefore, GSA treats all empty blocks just like aligned blocks.",
        "If an empty block is not lxl, GSA realigns it using a length-based algorithm, just like it would realign any other many-to-many aligned block.",
        "The most difficult problem occurs when an error of omission occurs next to an error of commission, like in blocks (0, (h)) and ((J, K), (i)).",
        "If the point in cell (J,i) should really be in cell (J,h), realignment inside the erroneous blocks would not solve the problem.",
        "A naive solution is to merge these blocks and then to realign them using a length-based method.",
        "Unfortunately, this kind of alignment pattern, i.e. Oxl followed by 2x1, is surprisingly often correct.",
        "Length-based methods assign very low probabilities to such pattern sequences and usually get them wrong.",
        "Therefore, GSA also considers the confidence level with which the length-based alignment algorithm reports its realignment.",
        "If this confidence level is sufficiently high, GSA accepts the length-based re-alignment; otherwise, the alignment indicated by SIMR's points of correspondence is retained.",
        "The minimum confidence at which GSA trusts the length-based realignment is a GSA parameter, which has been optimized on a separate development bitext.",
        "Due to the paucity of development resources at my disposal, GSA's backing-off heuristics are somewhat ad hoc.",
        "Even so, GSA performs at least as well as other alignment algorithms, and usually better.",
        "Table 2 compares SIMR's accuracy on the \"easy\" and \"hard\" reference bitexts with the accuracy of two other alignment algorithms, as reported by Simard et al.",
        "(1992).",
        "The error metric counts one error for each aligned block in the reference alignment that is missing from the test alignment.",
        "The hard constraints correspond to paragraph boundaries.",
        "More important than GSA's current performance is GSA's potential performance.",
        "With a bigger development bitext, more effective backing-off heuristics can be developed.",
        "More precise input would also make a big difference: GSA's performance will improve whenever SIMR's performance improves.",
        "Although GSA sometimes backs off to a quadratic-time alignment algorithm, in practice its running time is linear in the number of input sentences.",
        "The points of correspondence in SIMR's output are sufficiently dense and precise that GSA backs off only for very small aligned blocks.",
        "When the translation lexicon was used in SIMR's matching predicate, the largest aligned block that needed to be realigned in the \"easy\" and \"hard\" test bitexts was 5x5.",
        "Without the translation lexicon, the largest realigned block was 7x7.",
        "So, GSA's running time is 0(kn), where n is the number of input sentences and k is a small constant proportional to the size of the largest realigned block.",
        "Admittedly, GSA is only useful when a good bitext map is available.",
        "In such cases, there are three reasons to favor GSA over other options for alignment: One, it is simply more accurate.",
        "Two, its running time is linear in the number of sentences, faster than dynamic programming methods.",
        "Therefore, three, it is not necessary to manually segment the component texts into smaller units before input to GSA.",
        "GSA works almost as well without such \"hard constraints.\" Hard constraints are necessary for alignment algorithms that use dynamic programming, in order to maintain an acceptable running time on longer bitexts(Gale & Church 1991, Simard et al.",
        "1992).",
        "SIMR produced bitext maps for 200 megabytes of the Canadian Hansards.",
        "GSA converted these maps into alignments.",
        "The Linguistic Data Consortium plans to publish both the maps and the alignments in the near future."

        "The Smooth Injective Map Recognizer (SIMR) has five advantages over previous bitext mapping algorithms.",
        "First, it lowers average errors by more than a factor of 4.",
        "Second, it avoids very large errors, improving robustness to a level that enables new commercial-quality applications.",
        "Third, it does not require large amounts of computer memory to run.",
        "Fourth, it accepts non-monotonic segments to account for inversions and word order differences.",

        "There are many possible extensions to this work.",
        "One interesting observation is that aligned sentences can be used to induce translation lexicons, and translation lexicons are an important information source for bitext mapping and alignment (Kay & ROscheisen 1993, Chen 1993).",
        "I plan to explore an interactive loop between SIMR, GSA and my algorithm for inducing translation lexicons (Melamed 1995).",

        "The only technique for mapping between more disparate languages that has been rigorously evaluated (Wu 1994) relies on length correlations sprinkled with some lexical information.",
        "From this point of view, Wu's technique is similar to the one used by Simard et al.",
        "(1992).",
        "So, I am eager to see whether the geometric approach will compare as favorably to Wu's results on English and Chinese as it has to Simard et al.'s results on English and French."
