        "Chinese NLP is still greatly impeded by the relative scarcity of resources that have already become commonplace for English and other European languages.",
        "A strategy we are pursuing is the use of automatic methods to aid in the acquisition of such resources (4, 5, 6).",
        "However, we are also selectively engineering certain resources by hand, for both comparison and applications purposes.",
        "One such tool that we have been developing is a general-purpose bracketer for unrestricted Chinese text.",
        "In this paper we describe an approach to parsing that has evolved as a result of the problems we have encountered in making the transition from English to Chinese processing.",
        "We have found that the primary obstacle has been the syntactic flexibility of Chinese, coupled with an absence of explicit marking by morphological inflections.",
        "In particular, compounding is extremely flexible in Chinese, allowing both verb and noun constituents to be arbitrarily mixed.",
        "This creates extraordinary difficulties for grammar writers, since robust rules for such compound forms tend to also accept many undesirable forms.",
        "This creates too many possible parses per sentence.",
        "We employ probabilistic grammars, so that it is possible to choose the Viterbi (most probable) parse, but probabilities alone do not compensate sufficiently for the inadequacy of structural constraints.",
        "There are two usual routes: either (I) keep the context-free basis but introduce finer-grained categories, or (2) move to context-sensitive grammars.",
        "The former strategy includes feature-based grammars with weak unification.",
        "One disadvantage of this approach is that some features can become obscure and cumbersome.",
        "Moreover, the expressive power remains restricted to that of a CFG, so certain constraints simply cannot be expressed.",
        "Thus, many systems opt for some variety of context-sensitive grammar.",
        "However, it is easy for parsing complexity in such systems to become impractical.",
        "We describe an approach that is not quite context-free, but still admits acceptably fast Earley-style parsing.",
        "A benefit of this approach is that the form of rules is natural and simple to write.",
        "We have found this approach to be very effective for constraining the types of ambiguities that arise from the compounding flexibility in Chinese.",
        "In the remainder of this paper, we first describe our grammar framework in Sections 2 – 4.",
        "The parsing strategy is then described in Section 5, followed by current experimental results in Section 6.",
        "We have made two extensions to the form of standard context-free grammars:",
        "1.",
        "Right-hand-side contexts 2.",
        "Nonterminal functions",
        "We would like to note at the outset that from the formal language standpoint, the complications introduced by the form of our production rules have so far hindered theoretical analyses of the formal expressiveness characteristics of this grammar.",
        "Because of the nature of the constraints, it is unclear how the expressiveness relates to, for example, the more powerful unification-based grammars that are widespread for English.",
        "At the same time, however, we will show that the natural format of the rules has greatly facilitated the writing of robust large grammars.",
        "Also, an efficient Earley-style parser can be constructed as discussed below for grammars of this form.",
        "For our applications, we therefore feel the effectiveness of the grammar form compensates for the theoretical complications.",
        "We now describe the extensions, but first define some notation used throughout the paper.",
        "A traditional coniexi-free grammar (CFG) is a four-tuple G = (N, E, P, S), where N is a finite set of nonterminal symbols, E is a finite set of terminal symbols such that N n = 0, p is a finite set of productions and S E N is a special designated start symbol.",
        "Productions in P are denoted by symbol Pr, 1 < r < I P1, and have the form Dr Zr,1Zr,2 • • • Zr,r, 0 0, where Dr E N and Zr,i E N U E, 1 < j < 'Tr • Right-hand-side contexts We introduce right-hand-side contexts to improve rule applicability decisions for complex compounding phenomena.",
        "The difficulty that ordinary CFGs have with complex compounding phenomena can be seen from the following example grammar fragment:",

        "NP – Nom 4.",
        "NP RelPh NP 5.",
        "NP NP NP",
        "Here, RelPh is a relative phrase, Nom is a nominalization (similar to a gerund), vn is lexical verb category requiring an NP argument, and (Yg(de) is a genitive particle.",

        "(1) a. Iota tat oig Mff b. jingwUchii tigOng de daft' c. police provide – answer",
        "d. the answer provided by police can be parsed either by",
        "However the latter parse is not linguistically meaningful, and is rather an artifact of the overly general noun compounding rule 5.",
        "The problem is that it becomes quite cumbersome in a pure CFG to specify accurately which types of noun phrases are permitted to compound, and this usually leads to excessive proliferation of features and/or nonterminal categories.",
        "Instead, the approach described here augments the CFG rules with a restricted set of contextual applicability conditions.",
        "A production in our extended formalism may have = left and/or right context, and is denoted as {L}Zr,1Zr,2",
        "• • Zr,„{R}, where L, R E",
        "(N U E)* and the left context condition L and the right context condition R are of a form described below.",
        "These context conditions help cut the parser's search space by eliminating many possible parse trees, increasing both parsing speed and accuracy.",
        "Though ambiguities remain, the smaller number of parses per sentence makes it more likely that most-probable parsing can pick out the correct parse."
