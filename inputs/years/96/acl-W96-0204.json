        "Currently, the field is predominated by the use of n-grams, in particular bi-grams and trigrams.",
        "One advantage of this type of model is that only the text itself is needed to create the model.",
        "In the case where what is being modeled is written text in a style for which millions of words of text are available, such as the WSJ corpus, this kind of modeling is effective.",
        "However, this is rarely the case since the ultimate goal of speech recognition is to model extemporaneous spoken language.",
        "The interesting problem in language modeling is how to bring generalizations above the level of the words themselves to the text.",
        "One approach is to annotate text, either by hand or semi-automatically, to bring additional information to the text.",
        "Another is to develop algorithms that use rules or heuristics that operate over the corpus, again bringing additional information.",
        "It is this additional information that can help create generalizations over the text and contribute to a model which can go beyond the training corpus.",
        "In this paper, we describe annotations to the Switchboard corpus which add part of speech and dysfluency markings and our latest work using those annotations to create a level of generalization on top of the annotation to capture the structure of conversational speech.",

      "text": [
        "The Switchboard corpus (Godfrey, et al.",
        "1992) consists of 2 million words of conversational English collected over the phone by having strangers chat with one another about 70 different topics ranging from pets and family life to education and gun control.",
        "Each conversation is about five minutes long and the transcription includes information on background noises and where conversants overlapped (talked over one another).",
        "Conversational speech is particularly difficult for speech recognizers, since not only is the speech often very quick and \"sloppy\" (e.g. with \"mgonna\" for \"I am going to\"), but it is also very dysfluent, with many fillers, such as \"uh\" and \"you know\", and many restarts, such as \"I, uh, well, I went, I went away last summer\".",
        "It has been surmised that it is the dysfluencies that make the language modeling particularly difficult, but no studies have been able to conclusively show that that is true or explain the problems sufficiently.",
        "In fact, at the 1995 Language Modeling Workshop at Johns Hopkins they showed that sentences with dysfluencies do not perform any worse in recognition word error rates than sentences without dysfluencies; they have a slightly lower error rate.",
        "Whether this has to do with the overall sentence length or if different kinds of dysfluencies correlate differently with error rate still needs to be explored.",
        "Stolcke and Shriberg (1996) have begun work in this area.",
        "In particular, they show that some results are different depending on whether the data was segmented linguistically rather than acoustically (see §3).",
        "The Switchboard annotation effort had four parts: part of speech annotation, \"sentence\" boundaries, dysfluencies, and bracketing.",
        "Part of speech and bracketing were done in the UPenn treebank style (and all annotation was done at Upenn by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC).",
        "The dysfluency and sentence boundary annotation stylebook was begun at BBN by the authors of this paper and completed at UPenn by Ann Taylor.",
        "We elaborate on these later two types of annotation in Section Two.",
        "The main target audience for this annotation was the 1995 Language Modeling Workshop at Johns Hopkins, which brought together researchers with diverse backgrounds to tackle the problem of language modeling for conversational speech.",
        "Some of the work we report on in this paper was begun at the workshop.",
        "The annotation notation was based on the work of Elizabeth Shriberg (1994).",
        "We used her work as a starting point for several reasons.",
        "First, her notation was quite comprehensive, covering all (and more) of the phenomena we were interested in annotating.",
        "Second, she had done much of her work on the Switchboard corpus, annotating 40,000 words, so we knew that most, if not all, the idiosyncrasies of that corpus would be dealt with.",
        "Third, others can more readily build on the extensive analysis in Shriberg's thesis if the annotations are not gratuitously different."

        "The ultimate goal of this work is to improve the performance of a speech recognizer.",
        "In the process we hope to gain a better understanding of the structure of conversational speech and how styles of speech differ.",
        "Annotating data is an enormously expensive task, so before we select what information to annotate, we need to think about what use we can make of that information.",
        "In the case of dysfluency annotation, the sheer number of dysfluencies in conversational speech, plus the fact that dysfluencies do not occur at all in written speech and thus cannot be modeled using that source, are indicators that this annotation can contribute to our language modeling work.",
        "Some other questions about the structure of conversational speech that can be addressed with annotated data are as follows:",
        "• Are dysfluencies more likely to occur in some places in the sentence than others?",
        "• Do dysfluencies carry some useful information?",
        "• What is the notion of a sentence or segment in conversational speech?",
        "• Is conversational structure different from formal written structure and if it is, can we exploit that difference in our language models?",
        "The most innovative part of this paper is the use of the information structure of conversational utterances to develop targeted language models for different parts of a sentence.",
        "According to many theories of discourse in linguistics (e.g. Clark and Haviland, 1977, or Haliday and Hasan, 1976), sentences have an \"information structure\" in addition to the syntactic structure that distinguishes between given information, which is already shared by the conversational participants, either from shared knowledge or information contained earlier in the dialog, and new information that the speaker is conveying to the hearer.",
        "In the unmarked case (e.g. sentences not marked with emphatic stress or cleft sentences, which are rare in conversational speech), given information tends to occur in the beginning of a sentence where the topic is established, whereas new information tends to occur at the end, the comment on the topic.",
        "This work is currently in the data analysis phase, where we are developing heuristics to divide a sentence into its given and new parts, which roughly correspond to the parts of a sentence before and after the verb.",
        "While this simple heuristic is far from the complex notion of given and new in the linguistic literature, it has on main advantage: it can be computed automatically given sentence boundaries, part of speech information, and dysfluency information.",
        "If the simple notion pans out and we can show a significant improvement in recognition performance, we may want to move to a more complex notion and hand annotate it in the corpus.",
        "However, many ideas which are",
        "intuitively appealing are difficult to incorporate in a language model or do not appear to make a difference in overall performance.",
        "that participants often interrupt and talk over one another, so even separating turns is not so simple.",
        "Within a turn a participant may ramble on and on, making the utterance too long for a speech recognizer to handle.",
        "In our work so far, our analysis of the vocabulary and its distribution in these two parts of the sentence shows a significant difference.",
        "We are currently building language models from the two parts and determining ways of integrating them that takes advantage of this difference.",
        "The next step will be modeling conversations and incorporating those models into a speech recognizer.",
        "We discuss the dysfluency annotation of Switchboard in detail in Section 2.",
        "In Section 3, we describe work on linguistic vs. acoustic segmentation and its effect on the language model.",
        "In Section 4, we describe the given/new distinction as we have implemented it and our analysis of the Switchboard corpus.",
        "Finally, in Section 5, we describe a model of conversational speech that takes advantage of the given/new distinction and how it can be used in a speech recognition system."

        "There were three major kinds of annotations done as part of the dysfluency annotation of Switchboard: sentence boundaries, restarts, and non-sentence elements.",
        "The assumption underlying the dysfluency annotation was that when it was complete, sentences could be separated, restarts \"folded\", and non-sentential elements removed and the result would be a reasonably grammatical sentence (that is, grammatical for conversational speech, not necessarily compliant with your third grade English teacher), though some may not be \"complete\" in that they may be replies or acknowledgments and some may be interrupted by either the speaker herself or the other conversant and never completed.",
        "As mentioned earlier, much of the choice of what to annotate and details of the notation are based on the work of Shriberg (1994).",
