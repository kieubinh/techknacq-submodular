        "However, several languages such as Japanese, Chinese and Thai do not put spaces between words and so in these languages word segmentation, word frequency counting, and new word extraction remain unsolved problems in computational linguistics.",
        "Most Japanese NLP applications require word segmentation as a first stage because there are phonological units and semantic units whose pronunciation and/or meaning is not trivially derivable from the pronunciation and/or meaning of the individual characters.",
        "It is well known that the accuracy of word segmentation greatly depends on the coverage of the dictionary, in other words, the Out-Of-Vocabulary (00V) rate of the target texts.",
        "Our goal is to provide a method to automatically extract new words from Japanese texts.",
        "This method should adapt the dictionary of the word segmenter to new domains and applications.",
        "It should also maintain the dictionary by collecting new words in the target domain.",
        "The application of the word segmenter is described elsewhere (Nagata, 1996).",
        "The approach we take is as follows: First, we design a statistical language model that can assign a reasonable word probability to an arbitrary substring in the input sentence, whether or not it is truly a word.",
        "Second, we devised a method to obtain the expected word N-gram count in the target texts, using an N-best word segmentation algorithm (Nagata, 1994).",

        "The problem of Japanese word segmentation is that people often can not agree on a single word segmentation.",
        "Therefore, the reported performance could be greatly underestimated.",
        "Most of the new words extracted by the system are acceptable as a word (at least for us), and may not necessarily be a wrong word entry.",
        "On the other hand, most of the new words not extracted by the system can be divided into shorter words that are registered in the dictionary.",
        "For example, in the first sentence of Figure 8, 9 • 3, a ('data communication') is regarded as one word in corpus segmentation and counted as an unknown word in the test sentence.",
        "However, the system segmented it into - ('data') and -2/ a si ('communication'), both of which are found in the dictionary.",
        "In the second sentence of Figure 8, the system extracted /NJ- q7!.e, ('Duke of Hanover') as a new word, while this word is divided into iN - )77 ('Hanover') and !t.`.. ('Duke') in corpus segmentation.",
        "Most of extraction errors are of this category.",
        "There are three types of obvious extraction errors.",
        "The first type is the truncation of long words.",
        "Some transliterated Western-origin words exceed the predefined maximum length for unknown word.",
        "The third sentence of Figure 8 is an example of this type.",
        "In Japanese, 'illustration' is transliterated into 9 characters 4 I - 3 which exceeds the maximum unknown word length of 8 characters in our system.",
        "Since 4 A Is (the transliteration of 'illust', which also means illustration in Japanese) is registered in the dictionary, a (the transliteration of 'ration') is incorrectly extracted as a new word.",
        "The second type is the fragmentation of numerals.",
        "Since we did not use any tokenizers, numerals tend to be divided arbitrarily.",
        "In the second sentence in Figure 8, the system divided \"1676\" into \"16\" and \"76\".",
        "In fact, it may output \"1\" and \"676\", \"16\" \"7\" and \"6\", or whatever.",
        "The third type is the concatenation of noun(s) and particle.",
        "In other words, the system sometimes erroneously recognizes a noun phrase as a word.",
        "For example, the Japanese counterparts of \"A of B\", \"A and B\", and \"A, B\" are recognized as a word.",
        "This may be because the probability of one long unknown word can be higher than the product of the probabilities of two short unknown (or infrequent) words and one known word.",
        "The fourth sentence of Figure 8 is an example of this type of error.",

        "As for reestimation, Table 3 shows no significant improvements in the new word extraction accuracy.",

        "This is because most un",

        "An ideal example to confirm that reesti'nation works well would have an unknown word appearing more than twice in the test sentences, and it is trivial to extract the word in one appearance, while it is difficult in the others, because of, for example, successive unknown words.",

        "Word frequencies were estimated by the Viterbi reestimation (a reestimation procedure using the best analysis) from an unsegmented corpus of 20 million words.",
        "Initial estimates of the word frequencies were derived from the frequencies in the corpus of the strings of hanzi making up each word in the lexicon whether or not each string is actually an instance of the word in question.",

        "They combined Viterbi reestirnation using the word unigram model with a post filter called the \"Two-Class Classifier\", which is a linear discrimination function to decide whether the string is actually a word or not based on features derived from the character N-gram in a large unsegmented corpus.",
        "The system's performance is compared with a word list derived from two on-line Chinese dictionaries (21141 words).",
        "The reported recall and precision values were 56.88% and 77.37% for two character words, and 6.12% and 85.97% for three character words, respectively.",
        "For Japanese, (Nagao and Mori, 1994) proposed a method of computing an arbitrary length character N-gram, and showed that the character N-gram statistics obtained from a large corpus includes information useful for word extraction.",
        "However, they did not report any evaluation of their word extraction method.",
        "(Teller and Batchelder, 1994) proposed a very naive probabilistic word segmentation method for Japanese, based on character type information and hiragana bigrarn frequencies.",
        "They claimed 98% word segmentation accuracy, while we claim 94.7%.",
        "However, their evaluation method is very optimistic, and completely different from ours.",
        "They count an error only when the system segmentation violates morpheme boundaries.",
        "In other words, they count an error only when the system segmentation is not acceptable to human judgement, while we count an error whenever the system segmentation does not exactly match the corpus segmentation, even if it is inconsistent.",
        "We used the word bigram model for word segmentation, and expected word frequency for unknown word extraction.",
        "We compared the results with a segmented Japanese corpus, and reported 43.7% recall and 52.3% precision for 1000 sentences whose out-of-vocabulary rate is 2.1%.",
        "It is impossible to compare our results with (Chang et al., 1995), because the experiment conditions are completely different in terms of language (Chinese vs. Japanese), the size of seed segmented corpus, the size of target unsegmented corpus and its out-of-vocabulary rate, the size of initial word list, and the type of reference data",
        "(on-line dictionary vs. segmented corpus).",
        "Our idea of filtering erroneous word hypothesis by expected word frequency is simple and straightforward.",
        "The major contribution of this paper is that we present a more accurate method for estimating word frequencies in an unsegmented corpus, even if it includes unknown words.",
        "This is achieved by introducing an explicit statistical model of unknown words, and by using an N-best word segmentation algorithm (Nagata, 1994) as an approximation of the generalized Forward-Backward algorithm.",
        "In English taggers, (Weischedel et al., 1993) proposed a statistical model to estimate word output probability p(wslti) for an unknown word from spelling information such as inflectional endings, derivational endings, hyphenation, and capitalization.",
        "Our word model can be thought of a generalization of their statistical model.",
        "One potential benefit of our statistical model and segmentation algorithm is that they are completely independent of the target language and its writing system.",
