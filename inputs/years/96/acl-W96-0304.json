        "ETS is currently working on natural language understanding systems which could be used for computer-assisted scoring of short-answer free-responses (see Kaplan and Bennett (1994) and Burstein and Kaplan (1995)).'",
        "The overall goal of our current research is to develop a scoring system that can handle short-answer free-response items.",
        "Such a scoring system has to be able to identify the relevant content of a response and assign it to an appropriate content category.",
        "Another consideration in the development of a scoring system is that the data sets that are available to us are relatively small.",
        "and the responses in these data sets lack lexico-syntactic patterning.",
        "The items which we work with are either experimental, or have been administered as paper-and-pencil exams.",
        "In the former case, there is a limited subject pool, and in the latter case, we rely on what has been put into electronic form.",
        "The response sets typically range from 300-700 responses which we have to use for training and testing.",
        "This is quite a different scenario from natural language understanding systems which can be designed using large corpora from full text sources, such as the AP News and the Wall Street Journal.",
        "This paper discusses a case study that examined how lexical semantic techniques could be used to build scoring systems, based on small data sets.",

        "In this paper, concepts are superordinate terms which contain one or more subordinate, metonymic terms.",

        "In previous research, we used a concept-based approach similar to the one described in this study.",
        "The difference between the previous system and our current prototype is that in the previous system, concepts were not represented with regard to structure, and the lexicon was domain-independent.",
        "The underspecification of concept-structure relationships, and the lack of a domain-specific lexicon degraded the performance of that system (Kaplan and Bennett (1994).",
        "A second lexically-based, statistical approach performed poorly for the same reasons described above.",
        "The second approach looked at similarity measures between responses based on lexical overlap.",
        "Again, structure was not considered, and the lexicon was domain-independent which contributed to the system's poor performance (Burstein and Kaplan (1995)).",
        "Any system we build must have the ability to analyze the concept-structure patterning in a response, so that response content can be recognized for scoring purposes.",
        "Given our small data set, our assumption was that a lexical semantic approach which employed domain-specific language and concept grammars with concept-structure patterns would facilitate reliable scoring.",
        "Our hypothesis is that this type of representation would denote the content of a response based on its lexical meanings and their relationship to the syntactic structure of the response.",
        "It would appear that Jackendoff's (1983) Lexical Conceptual Structure (LCS) representation may be applicable to our problem.",
