        "Treatment of lexical ambiguity such as WSD has been found useful in many NLP applications, including information retrieval (McRoy 1992; Krovetz and Croft 1992) and machine translation (Brown et al. 1991; Dagan et al. 1991; Dagan and Itai 1994).",
        "Recently, various approaches (Dolan 1994; Luk 1995; Yarowsky 1992; Dagan et al. 1991 ;Dagan and Itai 1994) to word sense division have been used in WSD research.",
        "Directly using dictionary senses as the sense division has several advantages.",
        "First, sense distinction according to a dictionary is readily available from MRDs such as the LDOCE (Longman 1992).",
        "Second, indicative words and concepts for each sense are directly available in numbered definitions and examples.",
        "Lesk (1986) demonstated that dictionary entries can be used to generate signatures of senses for WSD.",
        "However, using MRD as the knowledge source for sense division and disambiguation encounters certain problems.",
        "Dolan (1994) observed that sense division in MRD is frequently too fine for the purpose of WSD.",
        "A WSD system based on dictionary senses faces an unnecessary and difficult \"forced-choices.\" Most researchers resorted to human intervention to identify and group closely related senses.",
        "This paper describes a heuristic algorithm capable of automatically assigning a label to each of the senses in a machine readable dictionary (MRD) for the purpose of acquiring a computational-semantic lexicon for treatment of lexical ambiguity.",
        "Including these labels in the MRD-based lexical database offers several positive effects.",
        "The labels can be used as a coarser sense division so unnecessarily fine sense distinction can be avoided in word sense disambiguation (WSD).",
        "The algorithm is based primarily on simple word matching between an MRD definition sentence and word lists of an LLOCE (McArthur 1992) topic.",
        "We begin by giving the details of material used, including the characteristics of definition sentences in LDOCE and the organization of words in LLOCE.",
        "Next, the algorithm for labeling LDOCE senses is described.",
        "An illustrative example demonstrates the effectiveness of the algorithm.",

        "No simple method can solve the general problem of WSD for unrestricted text.",
        "We will show that this labeling task is made simpler for several reasons.",
        "For example, consider the definition sentences for the first 5 senses of \"bank\" in LDOCE:",
        "First of all, only simple words are used in the definitions.",
        "Furthermore, the text generation schemes are rather regular.",
        "The scheme that lexicographers used in generating the definitions above is similar to the DEFINITION scheme described in McKeown (1985).",
        "A DEFINITION scheme begins with a genus term (that is, conceptual parent or ancestor of the sense), followed by the so-called differentia that consists of words semantically related to the sense to provide specifics about the sense.",
        "Those relations between the sense and its defining words are reflected in semantic clusters that are termed categorical, functional, and situational clusters in McRoy (1992).",
        "Moreover, those relations have been shown to be very effective knowledge sources for WSD (McRoy 1992) and interpretation of noun sequences (Vanderwende 1994).",
        "For instance, land, earth, mass, slope, and sand are the genus terms that are categorically related to bank.",
        "On the other hand, words in the differentia such as river, lake, field, garden bend, Mali, race-track, and harbour are situationally related to bank through the Location relation.",
        "Other keywords such as road, and racetrack are related functionally to bank through the PartOf relation.",

        "As discussed in Section 4, the senses sharing the same label (or cross-referencing labels) are frequently associated through various linguistic relations.",
