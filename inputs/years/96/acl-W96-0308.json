        "In this paper we present three types of arguments for a pragmatics-based approach to treating the phenomenon of lexical polysemy (lexical sense extension) and rebut three types of arguments that have been used against pragmatics-based approaches.",
        "In particular, we argue that what have been claimed to be rules of lexical sense extension operating on lexical items are instead to be accounted for by a process of reference transfer by which the referents of lexical items (and phrases) can be used to refer to related things, as governed by pragmatic rules of conversation and contextual knowledge.",
        "By contextual knowledge we include that information provided by the surrounding language, by the salient facts about the non-linguistic context and by the general knowledge about the world that can be presumed to be shared by the participants in the conversation.' We except morphological rules, which apply to lexical items, but we argue that these rules are more productive and the semantics less precise than that suggested by the lexical rule approach, which often treat a single morphological process as a number of rules, subdivided according to the semantic category of the base or derived item.",
        "The structure of the paper is as follows.",
        "Section 2 provides some background material on lexical rules and their hypothesized grammatical status and contrasts this with our approach to such phenomena.",
        "Section 3 presents arguments against the lexical nature of sense extensions rules and for their status as reference transfer rules.",
        "These arguments show that the domain of polysemous usage is not lexical items, but rather their referents.",
        "Section 4 examines the arguments made for their lexical status, which we find wanting.",
        "We argue that it is indeed possible to separate semantic from morphological phenomena, that blocking or preemption can be explained pragmatically, and that, barring syntactic and cultural differences, the range of polysemous usage is not language specific.",
        "Section 5 provides a conclusion."

        "As the field of NLP has matured, the nature of the problem of sense disambiguation for lexical items has become clearer (Copestake & Briscoe, 1991; Levin, 1993; Nirenburg 1996; Pustejovsky & Bergler, 1992;",
        "Saint-Dizier & Viegas, 1995; to name just a few).",
        "First, the wide variety of different uses to which a single lexical item can be put has been better described.",
        "Second, the semantic relatedness of these uses is more thoroughly understood.",
        "For example, the lexical item newspaper can be used to refer to a physical published object, a particular edition, a newspaper company, an editorial staff, an article in the newspaper, or a reporter for the newspaper.",
        "While this represents a wide variety of different ontological entities (people, physical objects, conceptual objects, corporations), it is clear that all of these entities are related to each other by the process of creating, producing, selling, buying and reading newspapers.",
        "Finally, the same set of uses can be found not just for newspaper but for other words referring to similar congeries of relationships: journal, newsletten The New York Times, tabloid and so on.",
        "One computational approach to dealing with this multiplicity of senses is through the use of lexical rules.",
        "Within this class would fall the Lexical Implication Rules (LIRs) of Ostler and Atkins (1991), the lexical rules of Copestake and Briscoe (1991), the Generative Lexicon of Pustejovsky (1995), and the ellipsis recovery procedures of Viegas and Nirenburg (1995).",
        "In all these approaches, derived senses are not listed in the lexicon, bit are generated on the basis of rules that operate on a class of lexical items defined by a conjunction of semantic and syntactic/lexical information (e.g. LIRs) or on the basis of patterns in the semantic structure of the lexical item itself (Pustejovsky, Copestake and Briscoe).1 In this paper, we take issue not with the computational claims of this approach (i.e., that it allows easier acquisition of lexical items or more effective disambiguation in context), but rather with its linguistic claims about the status of lexical rules within a formal description of a language.",
        "It is our position that the wide variety of uses that any one lexical item may have is not a result of formal mechanisms within the grammar of the language, but rather follow from general knowledge about the things to which the lexical item is used to refer.",
        "Knowing how a lexical item may be used, then, is not so much a matter of knowing the language, but of knowing the subject matter under discussion and the cultural conventions of the discussants.",
        "In this respect, our approach aligns with that of Hobbs et al.",
        "(1987) and of Nunberg (1978) in regarding the process as one which is pragmatic and inferential in nature rather than lexical and semantic.",
        "We cannot propose here a complete computationally tractable solution.",
        "It is likely that use of lexical rules will continue to be valuable in the construction of lexica and within NLP systems.",
        "However, it is not difficult to show how these senses might be derived, nor how they might then be selected in context.",
        "The difficulty is, of course, limiting this process to a computationally tractable level.",
        "However, as indicated above, our critique is of the linguistic claims, not the computational ones.",
        "This position stems from our basic views about the nature of language.",
        "We distinguish the rules of language which include the syntactic, phonological, and morphological regularities within which language users operate, the interface conventions of meaning which relate the elements of the language system (lexical items, morphological patterns and syntactic structures) with something outside the system (e.g., use pineapple to refer to pineapples), and the language-independent rules of inference, principles of communication, and world-knowledge which make up the background against which linguistic utterances are interpreted.2",
        "Whatever the specific status of the conventions of meaning, we expect them to be vague, minimal, and idiosyncratic.",
        "It is these very qualities that make it unlikely, in our opinion, that these interface conventions actually function as part of the rules of language.",
        "We do not expect these interface conventions to be robust, universal, or specific enough to sustain the complex structure of semantic features required by most lexical rules.",
        "This is not to say that there is no reference to semantic information in any of the rules of the language.",
        "For example, the plural morpheme indicates that whatever is referred to is both countable and that there is more than one.",
        "For the most part, though, these are basic distinctions that reflect gross semantic properties and are only partially correlated with independently verifiable semantics, rather than features that distinguish small classes of lexical items, directly related to external semantic categories.",
        "This position is not, however, that which lies behind the concept of lexical rule.",
        "Ostler and Atkins state, for example: \"We contend that they [Lexical Implication Rules] are bona fide rules in the formal grammar of languages involved; it is wrong to see them as mere reflections, quasi-systematic effects of applying the formal structure of a language in a real-world context.\"",
        "(Ostler & Atkins 1991:76).",
        "Copestake and Briscoe state, \"We argue that such processes [of morphological derivation and metonymic and metaphoric sense extension] must be treated as, in part, 'linguistic,'.... Our account constrasts with that of, say, Hobbs et al.",
        "(1987) who posit an underspecified and impoverished lexical semantic representation which is enriched through an open-ended process of abductive or deductive reasoning with world (or domain) knowledge\" (Copestake & Briscoe, 1991:88).",
        "Pustejovsky is somewhat more careful in his claims about the grammatical nature of the generative lexicon, and at the same time, somewhat more ambivalent.",
        "On the one hand, he states that \"grammatical distinctions are a useful metric in evaluating competing semantic theories\" (1995:6) which may imply that semantics, and specifically lexical semantics, is grammatical in nature.",
        "On the other, he states that \"the semantics of natural language should be the image of nonlinguistic conceptual organizing principles, whatever their structure\" (1995:6) implying that semantics, and specifically lexical semantics, is extragrammatical in nature.",
        "Or again, in stating that \"the representation of lexical semantics, therefore, should be seen as just one of many levels in a richer characterization of contextual structure,\" (1996:7) he appears to be stating that lexical semantics is extragrammatical.",
        "At the same time, he appears to be stating that lexical semantics is grammatical in suggesting that \"lexical items... have a richer typed semantic representation than conventionally assumed; semantic operations of lexically-determined type changing (e.g., type coercions) operate under well-defined constraints.",
        "Different subclasses of polymorphic operations are well-defined, each with independent properties and conditions on their applications.\"",
        "(1995:57).",
        "Although not exactly lexical rules, his lexical conceptual paradigms (lcp's) (1996:72) function similarly.1",
        "2.",
        "It may be plausible as well to distinguish yet another variety of convention: conventions of use.",
        "In this category would fall generalizations such as speakers of Australian English often use the term 'Good day' as an introductory greeting or speakers of German preferentially use a dative-subject construction with experiencer verbs to indicate sensations of heat or cold.",
        "Those who regard all these rules and conventions as equivalent in type will not be persuaded by all our arguments here.",
        "But for them, there is only one system of knowledge, which contains both linguistic and world knowledge.",
        "They do not distinguish between types of knowledge, and so the claim that certain knowledge is of a particular subtype (lexical or ontological) has no significance.",
        "Common to all these approaches, however, is the claim that lexical rules are necessary because of a crucial interaction between grammatical and semantic behavior that can only be accounted for by positing such combined syntactic/semantic rules.",
        "In contrast, we suggest that there is no need for such rules in a description of the grammar of English, or, indeed, any natural language.",
        "Specifically, we propose that while syntactic and morphological features and rules will indeed be part of the grammar and part of one's knowledge of the language, the polysemic use of lexical items is entirely separate from the morphological or syntactic rules that may generate the forms and structures which are to be interpreted.",
        "To use a concrete example, the lexical item, Bach is known to be generally used by speakers of English to refer to the composer, Johann Sebastian Bach.",
        "Bach is known to be a composer and composers are known to compose music.",
        "Therefore, the lexical item Bach can be taken to refer to Bach's music, given the relevant context: I was listening to some Bach last night.",
        "This approach has been computationally implemented on a small scale in the Metallel program (Iverson and Helmreich, 1992), a reworking of the meta5 program (Fass, 1988).",

        "This utterance exploits a conventional metaphor for talking about beliefs, i.e., the mind (head) as (physical) container and ideas as the (physical) objects contained, and extends that in a novel way to describe intense mental activity (possibly either creative or chaotic).1 To arrive at an interpretation of were bouncing around, one must both know about objects bouncing around inside containers (i.e., the usual sense of bounce around) and about the mental process of integrating new ideas into a consistent world view and infer (possibly) that what is being described is a situation in which the ideas are not getting integrated.",

        "These are most directly presented in Ostler and Atkins (1991).",
        "In Pustejovsky (1995), most of the argumentation is directed towards the opposite position to the one taken here, namely that the lexicon consists of an exhaustive listing of all senses.",
        "There appear to be three main arguments for lexical rules: (1) the existence of apparently idiosyncratic and therefore language specific phonological and morphological constraints on lexical extensions; (2) the phenomenon of blocking or preemption (both morphological and semantic); (3) the language specific nature of lexical extensions.",
        "We examine each of these arguments in turn below.",
        "In each case, we present in general (and often in specific), how we would account for the data and argue against its use to support lexical rules."

      "heading": "4.1 Lexically specific constraints",
      "text": [
        "The first argument is that in order to account accurately for the data of sense extension, it is necessary to propose rules which are statable only in terms of a combination of phonological, morphological, and syntactic constraints on lexical items, on the one hand, and specific semantic constraints on the meaning of those items, on the other hand.",
        "As indicated above, we are not arguing against morphological lexical rules, as long as they are accompanied by what we have termed minimal semantics.",
        "Thus, in cases where lexical morphological rules are proposed with complex semantic constraints, our approach is to argue for a more general and unconstrained application of the morphological derivation, while arguing that the semantics are more general, with the more specific readings being determined by contextual information.",
        "For example, Copestake and Briscoe (1991) discusses primarily the grinding rule, which creates a mass noun denoting substance out of a count noun.",
        "With their unification-based approach, they claim to account for the more specific meat reading with edible animals (a specialized subrule) as well as the less specific substance readings.",
        "Ostler and Atkins propose four different LIRs, all of which change count nouns into mass nouns (Tree--Wood; Animal – Fur; Animal--Meat: Food Item – Mass).",
        "Our claim in general is that it is possible to distinguish the phonological and morphological constraints that exist within the language from the semantic rules that govern their interpretation.",
        "For example, instead of suggesting that there are several lexical rules that relate a count noun sense to a mass noun sense, we assume there is a general morphological rule that turns count nouns into mass nouns, with a semantic rule",
        "that indicates no more than that whatever the mass noun refers to, it is some sort of substance related to the interpretation of the count noun.",
        "As a result, the rule proposed by Cope stake and Briscoe to cover grinding, along with its accompanying specialized meat and fur/skin rules (That coat is rabbit/Those boots are alligator), and the more general pulverizing rule (There was rabbit all over the road), as well as the additional LIRs proposed by Ostler and Atkins can be replaced by a single morphological rule' with a minimal semantic correlate.",
        "The specialization occurs because of specific world knowledge about the referent of the noun itself (people eat eggs, many animals have edible flesh, the skin/fur of some animals can be used to make clothing or accessories, trees have woody trunks), what is the subject of discussion (clothing, cuisine, roadkill, lumbering) and what specifically is being predicated of the referent (it is being eaten, worn, used for construction, splattered over the road).",
        "Note that this approach accounts for creative uses as well as conventional.",
        "Though badgers and moles are not marked (+edible) in this culture, one can enthymemically attribute that feature to them in Chinese culture, accounting for the acceptability and understandability of mole as foodstuff as in (36).",

        "(LOB corpus via Briscoe and Copestake, 1991:97) Ostler and Atkins point to the exceptions to the food--substance rule such as pea, bean, and lentil (that is, it is not usual to say, Have some more pea).",
        "They claim this is a semantic class, namely, pulses, which defines a class of lexical exceptions.",
        "We suggest that it is rather that the speaker's view of the referents of these items that accounts for this exception.",
        "They are small, and a normal portion usually includes more than one.Thus, even when mashed up, a small portion of peas would contain more than one pea.",
        "We note a similar exception to the animal--meat and hunting plural rules, where things that are small and normally eaten more than one to a portion are not normally referred to by a mass term.",
        "Thus, (37) is fine, while (38) and (39) are questionable.",
        "(31) They are out after lobster.",
        "(37) They are out after lobster./Have some more lobster.",
        "(38) They are out after clam./Have some more clam (39) They are out after oyster./Have some more oyster.",
        "In addition, other materials (not pulses) resist being viewed as substances in eating situations, such as minnows, sardines, and oats, which are also small and generally eaten more than one to a portion.",
        "Another claimed example of intricate relationships between phonological, morphological, and semantic data is that of adjectives of nationality being used to refer to people of that nationality.",
        "That is, certain adjectives of nationality, such as French, British, Welsh, can be used as plural mass nouns denoting the people of that country: the French, the British, the Welsh.",

        "Thus, it is possible to talk in general about the Dutch, but not about the German.",
        "Here again, it seems that this LIR is part of a larger morphological process in English whereby adjectives can function as mass plural nouns denoting that set as in The poor you will always have with you, The rich are usually powerful, and so on.",
        "It appears that some adjectives which are themselves already derived from nouns fail to permit this re-nominalization.",

        "For example, the nouns referring to dances can be regularly used as verbs referring to dancing that dance resulting in \"to waltz\" from \"the waltz\" and so on.",

        "This phenomenon clearly exists.",
        "It is our claim, however, that the preferred analysis would be to view the process as fully productive, and the blocking is due to the pragmatics of referring.",
        "From Grice's (1975) principle of Be perspicuous, a speaker should use a word which is conventionally used to refer to what they wish to refer to unless they wish to make some specific effect, as in (40), where the use of cow to refer to beef is likely to draw attention to the animal origin of the meat.",

        "For example, the unavailability in English of counterparts to the Ancient Greek examples cited in Ostler and Atkins seems to depend on the nonexistence of a rule allowing modified pronouns in English.",
        "Certainly the temporal adjectives listed (e.g., nocturnal) can produce adverbial interpretations as in (42) which can be paraphrased as (43).",
        "(42) A nocturnal visitor appeared at the door.",
        "(43) A visitor appeared at the door during the night.",
        "Second, apparent differences in sense extensions may be due to a usage preference for a different manner of referring to the object.",
        "Thus, the data in Na (19xx) appears to show a preference for certain kinds of construction that differ from those typically used in English.",

        "In our explanation, we note again that this sense extension is part of a much larger syntactic process by which any temporal noun phrase can be used alone adverbially, as in (47)--(49).",

        "(48) We go there every Tuesday.",
        "(49) We'll travel Christmas Eve, and arrive Christmas Day.",
