        "This work belongs to a family of research efforts, called microtheories and aimed at describing the static meaning of all lexical categories in several languages in the framework of the MikroKosmos project on computational semantics.",
        "The latter also involves other static microtheories describing world knowledge and syntax-semantics mapping as well as dynamic microtheories connected with the actual process of text analysis.",
        "This paper deals with the microtheory of adjectival semantics in one specific aspect, namely, the optimization and facilitation of the lexical entries for deverbal adjectives with the help of lexical rules deriving such entries from those of the corresponding verbs.",
        "Deverbal adjectives turn out to be the largest single subclass in the adjective lexical category.",
        "Unlike scalar and relative adjectives, which are anchored in property and object concepts, respectively, in the underlying ontology, deverbal adjectives are based on process concepts.",
        "While acquisition with lexical rules is necessary, universal and efficient for the class of deverbal adjectives, our research shows that, often in spite of the strong appearance to the contrary, such acquisition is neither fully automatic nor cost-free.",
        "The work was based on the set of over 6,000 English and about 1,500 Spanish adjectives obtained from task-oriented corpora.",
        "The findings are largely language-independent, and only English examples are used throughout the paper."

        "The general topic of this paper is the information about adjectival meaning which should be included in a computational lexicon.",
        "Having addressed this general topic elsewhere (Raskin and Nirenburg 1995), we focus here on a more specific topic of the meaning of deverbal adjectives and, even more specifically, on the lexical rules used to derive the meanings of such adjectives from those of the corresponding verbs.",
        "An extensive literature review in Raskin and Nirenburg (1995: 3-20) has demonstrated a focus on a number of issues that the non-computational linguistics of adjectives has deemed important.",
        "These include adjective taxonomies, usually on the basis of more or less consistent external criteria, the dichotomy between predicating and non-predicating adjectives and the related dichotomy between qualitative and relative adjectives, the order of adjectives modifying the same noun, the degrees of comparison and scalability, and the substantivization of adjectives.",
        "We have shown also (Raskin and Nirenburg 1995: 24-27) that computational lexicography and computational semantics impose totally different parameters of relevance on these issues.",
        "We discovered that developing adjective semantics for an application modifies many popular views on the subject.",
        "It becomes clear, for instance, that",
        "• many adjectives do not modify semantically the nouns that they modify syntactically; • adjectival (attributive) meanings may be delivered by other parts of speech, and thus the se",
        "mantics of adjectives only partially reflects their possible syntactic distinctions; • the major distinction among adjectives is scalar vs. non-scalar; • the attributive/predicative distinction, dominating the current scholarship on the adjective, has virtually no semantic significance, thus essentially crushing any hope to derive meaning from deep syntactic analysis; • there is a significant gap in our knowledge about relations between truly relative adjectives (as well as nominal modifiers in English) and the nouns they modify; • the typology of scales for gradables emerges as the dominant issue in adjective semantics and lexicography.",
        "Most importantly for this paper, the crucial taxonomic criterion for each adjective is its anchoring in the underlying ontology.",
        "Whether such an anchor is a property, object, or process concept defines the adjective as truly scalar, relative (denominal), or deverbal, respectively.",
        "The existing literature on adjectives also shows a predictable scarcity of systematic semantic analyses or lexicographic descriptions of adjectives.",
        "The quantifier adjectives, being the closest natural language comes to formal logic, have been privileged in this respect--see, for instance, Jackendoff (1983), McCawley (1988: 594-630), Chierchia and McConnell-Ginet (1990: 406-430), Frawley (1992: 464-480).",
        "The second luckiest category is adjectives of measure, especially spatial and, to a lesser degree, temporal, which are also seen as being more logically structured (see Bierwisch 1967, 1989, Greimas 1966, Teller 1969, Zhurinskiy 1971, Dowty 1972, Siegel 1976: 107-149 and 1979, Spang-Hanssen 1990, Spejewski 1995, and others).",
        "Obviously, the semantic analysis of adjectives shares many problems with the semantic analysis of anything in natural language.",
        "One specific problem, noted by very few scholars, is what Marx (1983--see also Marx 1977 and Szalay and Deese 1978) refers to as the \"plasticity\" of adjectival meaning, namely that the same adjective can emphasize a different property of a noun in a different context.",
        "Lahav (1989), working loosely in the Keenan and Faltz (1985) paradigm, presents the same property as the non-compositionality of adjectives.",
        "If, he argues, red birds, red houses, and red books mean all different kinds of redness--and they do--how can one derive the meaning of an Adj N combination from the meaning of the adjective and the noun?",
        "In other words, each noun, he believes, influences the meaning of the adjective.",
        "Katz (1972: 752), analyzing the meaning of good, is virtually the only author to have come up with a specific, even if definitely not complete account of how this works.",
        "Certain classes of nouns, he asserts, offer specific properties for good to work on:",
        "This situation, in which semantic analyses and lexicographic descriptions of adjectives (and other categories) are rare, is bound to change rapidly.",
        "As computational semantics moves to large-scale systems serving non-toy domains, the need for large lexicons with entries of all lexical categories in them is becoming increasingly acute, and the attention of computational semanticists and lexicographers is turning more towards such previously neglected or avoided categories as the adjectives.",
        "Recently, there have appeared some first indications of this attention – see, for instance, Smadja (1991), Beckwith et al.",
        "(1991), Bouillon and Viegas (1994), Justeson and Katz (1991, 1995), Pustejovsky (1995: 20-23).",

        "TMRs are realized in a frame-based language, where frame names typically refer to instances of ontological concepts and slots are usually filled with values of properties of those concepts.",
        "An ontology is, thus, a necessary prerequisite for building a TMR language.",
        "\"An ontology for NLP purposes is a body of knowledge about the world (or a domain) that a) is a repository of primitive symbols used in meaning representation; b) organizes these symbols in a tangled subsumption hierarchy; and c) further interconnects these symbols using a rich system of semantic and discourse-pragmatic relations defined among the concepts\" (Mahesh and Nirenburg 1995: 1).",

        "The contribution that the adjective makes to the construction of a semantic dependency structure (TMR) typically consists of inserting its meaning (a property-value pair) as a slot in a frame representing the meaning of the noun which this adjective syntactically modifies.",
        "Thus, in big house, big will assign a high value as the filler of the property slot SIZE of the frame for the meaning of house (see also Raskin and Nirenburg 1996).",
        "(1) is a partial lexical entry for big, with just two of the 13 lexical zones represented:",
        "SIZE is an ontological concept of the SCALAR-PHYSICAL-OBJECT-ATTRIBUTE-PROPERTY type, with the term 'scalar' used here, as it is customarily, primarily in the sense of `gradable.'",
        "Big is, of course, a typical gradable adjective, and as such, has a numerical scale associated with it the microtheory.",
        "Each numerical scale can be measured in actual measuring units, such as linear-size in feet, yards, or millimeters, or time in seconds.",
        "But often natural language expressions do not refer to absolute magnitudes but rather to abstract relative ones, as in the case of big.",
        "We assume a 0 to 1 numerical range for such abstract scales.",
        "For abstract references to size, the fillers in English can be: (2) minuscule medium-size enormo igantic 1 Big will, then, get something like a '>0.75' value on the SIZE scale (1).",
        "These values are a crucial part of the lexical mapping (LEx-MAP) included in the semantics (sEm-sTRuc) \"zone\" of a scalar-adjective lexical entry.",
        "2• Equally crucial is the syntactic-semantic mapping between the syntactic-structure (sYN-sTRuc) and SEM-STRUC zones with the help of special variables.",
        "In the former, there are two subcategori-zation patterns, marked 1 and 2, listed in SYN-STRUC of (1).",
        "The former pattern corresponds to the attributive use of the adjective: the noun it modifies is assigned the variable $varl, and the adjective itself the variable $var0 in the modifier position.",
        "The latter pattern presents the noun, bound to $var 1, in the subject position and the adjective in the predicative position.",
        "In the SEM-STRUC zone, instead of variables which are bound to syntactic elements, the meanings of the elements re2 Similar values are assigned to any scale based on a property concept.",
        "It should be noted, however, that numerical values like these correspond to the feature of gradability, which extends beyond scalarity: all scalar adjectives are gradable but not all gradable adjectives are true scalars.",
        "The two features are typically confused in the literature.",
        "This is why we distinguish here between true scalars, i.e., those adjectives whose meanings are based on a scale that is a property concept in the ontology, and all the other adjectives which are gradable and may be also loosely referred to as \"scalars.\" Thus, many denominal and deverbal adjectives, in fact, most adjectives, can form a comparative or superlative degree form with the help of more or most__, respectively, e.g., more medical (3ii), more aeronautical (4), more employable (6), more abusive (9-10).",
        "All of these adjectives are, therefore, gradable.",
        "Now, none of them is anchored in a scale-type property concept, however, which makes them all, technically, non-scalars but, in more practical and customary terms, non-true scalars.",
        "ferred to by these variables (and marked by a caret, `^') are used.",
        "That is, A$varl reads as \"the meaning of the element to which the variable $varl is bound.\" Among the constraints listed in the SEM-STRUC zone of an entry, are selectional restrictions (the noun must be a physical object) and relaxation information, which is used for treatment of unexpected (\"ill-formed\") input during processing.",
        "Thus, an entry like (1) should be read as follows:",
        "• first, the entry is the specification of a single sense, while the superentry is the set of such entries; • the second line assigns a sense number to the entry; • next, the adjective is assigned to its lexical category; • the first subcategorization pattern in the SYN-STRUC zone describes the Adj-N construction; the second subcategorization pattern describes the N-Copula-Adj construction; • the LEX-MAP part of the SEM-STRUC zone defines the lexical semantics of the adjective by assigning it to the class of SIZE adjectives, that is, anchoring it in the ontological property-type concept SIZE and stating that it is applicable to physical objects and that its meaning is a high-value range on the SIZE scale/property.",
        "In the case of continuous scales, like SIZE, the acquisition of all the adjectives served by this scale is greatly facilitated and expedited after the first one of them gets a lexical entry: each new adjective needs only, an appropriate range assigned to it, and the rest of the information in the semantic zone of the entry, as indeed in all the other zones as well, remains the same.",
