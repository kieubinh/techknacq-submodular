        "One motivation for this paper is the lack of descriptions of input-specifications for sentence generators.",
        "I have been asked at various times to fill this gap.",
        "Perhaps a better motivation is the need to argue for a more abstract level of input.",
        "Many of the available sentence generators require specification of syntactic information within the input specification.",
        "This means that any text-planner which uses this system as its realisation module needs to concern itself with these fiddling details.",
        "One of the aims in the WAG system has been to lift the abstractness of sentence specification to a semantic level.",
        "This paper discusses this representation.",
        "The WAG Sentence Generation System is one component of the Workbench for Analysis and Generation (WAG), a system which offers various tools for developing Systemic resources (grammars, semantics, lexicons, etc.",
        "), maintaining these resources (lexical acquisition tools, network graphers, hypertext browsers, etc.",
        "), and processing (sentence analysis – O'Donnell 1993, 1994; sentence generation O'Donnell 1995b; knowledge representation – O'Donnell 1994; corpus tagging and exploration – O'Donnell 1995a).",
        "The Sentence Generation component of this system generates single sentences from a semantic input.",
        "This semantic input could be supplied by a human user.",
        "Alternatively, the semantic input can be generated as the output of a multi-sentential text generation system, allowing such a system to use the WAG system as its realisation component.",
        "The sentence generator can thus be treated a black-box unit.",
        "Taking this approach, the designer of the multi-sentential generation system can focus on multi-sentential concerns without worrying about sentential issues.",
        "WAG improves on earlier sentence generators in various ways.",
        "Firstly, it provides a more abstract level of input than many other systems (Mumble: McDonald 1980; Meteer et al.",
        "1987; FUF: Elhadad 1991), as will be demonstrated throughout this paper.",
        "The abstractness improves even over the nearest comparable system, Penman (Mann 1983; Mann & Matthiessen 1985), in its treatment of textual information (see below).",
        "Other sentence generators, while working from abstract semantic specifications, do not represent a generalised realiser, but are somewhat domain specific in implementation, e.g., Proteus (Davey",
        "cett 86 Tucker 1990) requires the user to make decisions throughout the generation process.",

        "The participant roles do not need to be included in every sentence-specification, but may be in some, for the following reasons:",
        "• Pronominalisation: If the filler of the Speaker or Hearer role happens to play some role in the ideational specification, then an appropriate pronoun will be used in the generated string (e.g., 'I', you').",
        "• Voice Selection: If the spoken output mode is used, WAG will select a voice of the same gender as the speaker entity.",
        "• User Modelling: In theory, the Speaker and Hearer fields are available for user-modelling purposes (cf. Paris 1993): lexico-grammatical choices can be constrained by reference to attributes specified in the Speaker and Hearer roles.2 This has not, however, been done at present: while the implementation is set up to handle this tailoring, the resources have not yet been appropriately constrained.",
        "WAG's semantic input improves over that of Penman in regards to the relationship between the speech-act and the proposition.",
        "In Penman, the ideational specification is central: a semantic specification is basically an ideational specification, with the speech-act added as an additional (and optional) field.",
        "This approach is taken because Penman was designed with monologic text in mind, so the need for varied speech-acts is not well integrated.3",

        "), or action (commands, permission, etc.).",
        "A move with features (:and elicit negotiate-action) would be realised as a request for action (e.g., Will you go now?",

        "By providing a more abstract form of representation, text-planners using WAG need less knowledge of grammatical forms, and can spend more of their efforts dealing with issues of text-planning.",
        "I say 'less' here because, although WAG has extended the level at which surface forms can be specified semantically, there are still gaps.",
        "To allow for this, WAG allows input specifications to directly constrain the surface generation, either by directly specifying the grammatical feature(s) a given unit must have, or alternatively, specifying grammatical defaults: grammatical features which will be preferred if there is a choice.",
