        "Patent law guidelines impose rather rigid con-straiats on the structural composition of the text of the informationally central and legally crucial part of a patent disclosure, the claim.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates a rather simple claim text (claims can be over a page long).",
        "The claim must consist of a single, albeit possibly very complex, sentence with a well-specified conceptual, syntactic and stylistic/rhetorical structure.",
        "For instance, if the invention is an apparatus it must be described in a static state, without reference to its operation.",
        "A cassette for holding excess lengths of light waveguides in a splice area comprising a cover part and a pot-shaped bottom part having a bottom disk and a rim extending perpendicular to said bottom disk, said cover and bottom parts are superimposed to enclose jointly an area forming a magazine for excess lengths of waveguides, said cover part being rotatable in said bottom part.",
        "two guide slots formed in said cover part, said slots being approximately radially directed, guide members disposed on said cover part, a splice holder mounted on said cover part to form a rotatable splice holder.",
        "As can be seen from the figure, composing claims can be a difficult task even for a patent expert, let alone an inventor who is typically an engineer and not a technical writer.",
        "Note that the difficulty of the task is not constrained to syntax and style.",
        "A claim must be composed so as to make patent infringement difficult.",
        "We have developed a system which helps an inventor to compose patent claims.",
        "The system has an interactive and an automatic components.",
        "Knowledge about the invention is elicited from the inventor interactively.",
        "Most of text planning and realization is carried out automatically.",
        "Superficially, the architecture of our system conforms to the standard emerged in natural language generation (NLG) (as expressed, for instance in Reiter, 1994) in that it includes the stages of content specification, text planning and surface generation (realization).",
        "However, there are some important differences.",
        "Unlike the typical content specification modules (e.g., Kukich, 1983; Kit-tredge et al.",
        "1986), our system relies on an authoring workstation environment equipped with a knowledge elicitation scenario for joint human-computer content specification (see Sheremetyeva et al., submitted 1996, for the details of the knowledge elicitation scenario).",
        "Lexical selection and some other text planning tasks are interleaved with the process of content specification.",
        "The latter results in the production of a \"draft\" claim.",
        "This draft, while not yet an English text, is a list of proposition-level structures (\"templates\") specifying the proposition head and case role values filled by POS-tagged word strings.",
        "The draft is then submitted to an automatic text planner which outputs an hierarchical structure of templates which is ordered according to rhetorical and stylistic requirements.",
        "This process resembles revision-oriented generation (Meteer, 1991, Robin, 1994, Gabriel, 1988, Inui et al., 1992).",
        "Using the set of distinctions by Robin, our approach is content-preserving (no extra content is added) and performs revisions on a shallow representation.",
        "The realization stage linearizes the plan and takes care of the ellipsis, conjoined structures, punctuation and morphological forms.",
        "The architecture of the system is illustrated in Figure 2.",
        "In what follows we describe each stage of our system in turn and illustrate it with a single example of generating the claim of Figure 1."

        "of the content to be conveyed.",
        "Once a predicate is selected, the system proceeds requesting information about the values of the case roles of this predicate.",
        "The values of these case roles are supplied by the user.1 This division of labor makes our system immediately practical, because it need not rely on a very large lexicon of terminological terms in the subject area.",
        "The internal lexicon of the system must include only a detailed specification of predicative words (mostly, verbs) and some closed-class items, such as prepositions and conjunctions.",
        "The following considerations guided our lexicon work.",
        "The patent sublanguage is a union of a legal sublanguage and a sublanguage of the domain of the invention.",

        "Therefore, its technological sublanguage is that of machines and mechanisms.",
        "The sublanguage for such a system has two crucial peculiarities.",
        "First, the number of senses for each lexeme is, on average, much smaller than in language as a whole.",
        "This is a property of any sublanguage.",
        "The second peculiarity seems inherent only to the legal sublanguage.",
        "So as best to protect the rights of the inventor, it is desirable to use lexical units whose meanings are as broad as possible (see, e.g., Lawson, 1983) without making untrue statements about the invention.",
        "Therefore, at the lexical selection stage of the generation of a patent claim the system must be able to choose that member of the synonym set of candidates whose meaning is the broadest.",

        "ally used the words with broadest senses.",
        "These frequencies are marked in the system's dictionary only for verbs and take the form of the verb's rank in its semantic class.",
        "For example, if the synonym set for lexical selection is as follows: engage, hold, attach, lock, join, clamp, fasten, the system will present this list to the user in the descending order of frequencies, with the idea that the user would prefer to select the first applicable word on the list.",
        "Verb entries in the system's lexicon consist of a number of zones as follows:",
        "• Zone 1 lists all morphological forms of the verb in which it is expected to occur in patent texts.",
        "The most frequent form is marked.",
        "• Zone 2 contains the verb's semantic class label.",
        "The classes defined for claims about apparatuses include: meronymy, spatial, connection, change-state, change-location, apply-force, purpose and others.",
        "• Zone 3 lists the verb's frequency rank in the list of all the verbs belonging to its semantic class.",
        "It is necessary to motivate the order of verb realization in the text at the generation stage.",
        "• Zone 4 contains the correspondence between the verb's case frame labels and their ranks.",
        "• Zone 5 contains a frequency-ordered list of linearized cooccurrences of the verb with a particular subset of case roles.",
        "Thus, in Figure 4 the linearization pattern (1 * 2 4) (where 1, 2 and 4 are case role ranks and \"*\" shows the position of the predicate) will match, for example, the following phrase from an actual claim: (1: the splice holder) is mounted (2: on the cover part) (4: to form a rotatable splice holder).",
        "The output of the content specification stage (and input into the generation stage) consists of a list of filled templates in which the templates with the title of the invention in their subject slot are marked.",
        "A subset of the templates created for our example is given in Figure 7.",
        "The set of templates can be considered a draft text of the patent claim.",
        "If an English version is generated directly, it will produce a list of individual sentences describing the invention.",
        "In fact, our system performs this kind of generation for the purposes of allowing the user to check the draft before it is submitted to the claim generation stage (in this way it is guaranteed that the list of templates contains all the required information).",
        "However, we do not use this list of simple sentences in our generation (or revision).",
