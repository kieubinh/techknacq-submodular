        "Though the field of natural language generation has progressed towards composing complex texts, the evaluation of natural language generation systems has remained at the discussion stage (May90; MM91).",
        "Two broad methods have been identified for evaluating natural language generation systems: glass box and black box evaluation (MM91).",
        "The glass box method is concerned with examining the internal working of individual components in a system, while the latter looks at the behaviour of the input and output to the generation systems.",
        "The difficulty of the glass box method is the lack of a clear division between components in generation systems.",
        "Even if the black box method is adopted, however, it is difficult to determine what is the appropriate input for generation and to be objective in evaluating the output text.",
        "In this paper, we aim to investigate the quality of anaphors generated by the referring expression component in our Chinese natural language generation system.",
        "The referring expression component lies between the text planner and the linguistic realisation component in the system, as shown in Fig. 1.",
        "On accepting an input goal from the user, the system invokes the text planner which uses the operators in the plan library to build up a plan which is a hierarchical discourse structure to satisfy the input goal.",
        "After the text planning is finished, the decision of anaphoric forms and descriptions is then made by traversing the plan tree.",
        "As is discussed in (YM95; Yeh95), the algorithm of the referring expression component first determines an appropriate form for an anaphor to be generated.",
        "Suppose that the referring expression components we wish to compare all adopt the above basic algorithm.",
        "Then the essential character",
        "istic to distinguish them from each other becomes the rules used in the components and how these rules are implemented.",
        "If all of these referring expression components are embedded in the same Chinese natural language generation system, as in Fig. 1, for example, then, given an input to the system, anaphors in the resulting texts can be characterised by the rules used in the referring expression component and their implementation.",
        "By adopting this approach, we need not worry about the problems of either of the evaluation methods stated above, except the objective evaluation of output text.",
        "Since there is no machine that can read the generated texts and give an impartial judgement about them, we rely on the opinions of human readers who are native speakers of Chinese to investigate the quality of the generated anaphors.",
        "This is an easier task than assessing the quality of whole texts.",
        "To compensate for possible bias among the individual readers, we sent the output texts to a group of readers for viewing and took the average of their outcomes as the measurement.",
        "In brief, each object system in our evaluation work is thought of as having the same individual components, including control and knowledge bases (which are discussed in full in (Yeh95) but",
        "cannot be presented here for reasons of space), except that the anaphor generation rules used in the referring expression components are different to each other.",
        "In the existing literature, we cannot find other work on the generation of Chinese referring expressions (or indeed on the full evaluation of anaphor generation for any other language), which means that we have no real working systems to compare with.",
        "In practice, we employ our Chinese natural language generation system described in (Yeh95) as the backbone of the evaluation work because it is easy for us to control and maintain.",
        "What we have to do for each generation system is simply to insert the corresponding generation rule."

        "The anaphor generation rule we obtained in our previous studies (YM94; YM95; Yeh95) is shown in Fig. 2, where the internal nodes represent constraints and the terminal nodes are the decisions of using a zero (Z), pronominal (P), or nominal (N) form.",
        "The locality constraint checks whether the anaphor in question occurs either in the immediately previous utterance or at a long distance.",
        "The second constraint determines whether an anaphor occurs in a position violating syntactic constraints on zero anaphors.",
        "We adopted the concept of discourse segment structure in (GS86) to build up the constraint at segment beginning.",
        "It checks whether an anaphor is at the beginning of a discourse segment.",
        "The salience constraint says that both the positions of an anaphor and its antecedent are the topics of their respective utterances.",
        "The animacy constraint checks whether the anaphor in question is animate.",
        "Then the following rule is used if a nominal form is decided on.",
        "If a nominal anaphor, n, is at the beginning of a \"sentence\" 2, or is the first mention of the referent in a \"sentence,\" then a full description is preferred; otherwise, if n is within a \"sentence\" or has been mentioned previously in the same \"sentence\" without distracting elements, then a reduced description is preferred; otherwise a full description is preferred.",
        "The constraints in the anaphor generation rule were established by consulting relevant linguistic studies (YM94; YM95; Yeh95).",
        "Consequently, subsets of constraints in the above rule can be thought of as possible rules, if not complete, for the generation of anaphors in Chinese.",

        "The average matching rates for all test texts are 72, 74 and 76%.",
        "This average matching rate, however, is lower than the matching rates, about 92%, we obtained in the empirical studies described pre",
        "viously (YM94; Yeh95).",
        "The problem is partly because the test texts used in the former comparison are human-created, while the test texts used here are machine-generated.",
        "The grammatical structures of the machine-created texts are simplified; they are not as sophisticated as human texts.",
        "In the evaluation work, when the speakers were asked to decide their preferences for anaphors in the machine-generated texts, they may find less complete information shown in the test texts than what they are used to in creating their own texts and hence it may be difficult for them to make their own decisions.",
        "In the empirical study, the human-created texts perhaps provided more sufficient information for the hypothetical machine to decide on an appropriate anaphoric form.",
        "A more important reason why the matching rates are lower than before could be that in some circumstances there may be more than one acceptable solution and the speakers may not always choose the same one as the machine This hypothesis can be investigated by looking at the extent to which the speakers agree among themselves.",
        "To see how the speakers agree among themselves, we further made a comparison between the speakers' annotations,",
        "compare i's with the rest of speakers' annotations and note down the average number of the matches The comparison result is shown in Table 2.",
        "For each speaker, the number for each test text is the average number of matches with the other eleven speakers.",
        "For example, Speaker 1 receives, on average, 8 matches for Text 2.",
        "At the end of the table are the average numbers for the speakers' agreement among themselves.",
        "The figures in the table show that the speakers do not achieve an agreement among themselves for the use of anaphors in this test.",
        "These figures are further supported by the kappa statistic, a standard measure of agreement between a set of judges (SC88).",
        "The overall kappa value for all speakers is about 0.41, whereas a value of 0.8 or over would normally be required for good evidence of agreement.",
        "The measure of agreement gets worse if only the zero/ pronoun/ nominal distinction is considered or if zero and non-zero pronouns are lumped together.",
        "Only two speakers agree with one another with a kappa value of more than 0.7 (none with a value of greater",
        "than 0.8).",
        "The speakers as a whole agreed with kappa greater than 0.7 on 30 out of the 80 anaphors, with complete agreement only 14 times.",
        "To get an overall agreement of greater than 0.8 would require reducing the set of speakers from 12 to a carefully selected 3.",
        "As shown in Fig. 4, the anaphors in Text 1 form a \"topic chain\" 4 within a single \"sentence\".",
        "These anaphors are all zeroed according to the conditions of locality and syntactic constraints in the three test rules.",
        "All three systems produce the same result for Text 1 and, hence, unsurprisingly all three systems have the same matching rate, 90%, as shown in Table 1.",
        "Text 2 similarly contains a single \"sentence\" but has three topic shifts in addition to \"topic chains\" within the \"sentence\" as shown in Fig. 4.",
        "Since no discourse segment boundaries occur within the \"sentence\", the discourse segment boundary constraint in TR2 has no effect on this test text, which means that both TR/ and TR2 produce the same output.",
        "However, there are three topic shifts within the \"sentence\", namely, clauses 5 and 6, 8 and 9, and 10 and 11, as shown in Fig. 4.",
        "The shifts would make the rule containing the salience constraint, TRY, obtain different output from those without this constraint, TR/ and TR2 obtain the same matching rate, 70%.",
        "TRY obtains higher matching rates than the other two, 79%, which shows the effectiveness of the salience constraint in it.",
        "We then examine another middle-sized test text, Text 3, which is broken into three \"sentences,\" as shown in Fig. 4.",
        "The beginning of a \"sentence\" is the beginning of a discourse segment in our implementation (Yeh95).",
        "Furthermore, there are three topic shifts occurring in Text 3, i.e., clauses 8 and 9, 10 and 11, and 11 and 12.",
        "The constraint of discourse segment beginnings in TR2 and TRY and the salience constraint in TRY would therefore have some effects on the output texts.",
        "The matching rates, as shown in Table 1, increase from 62 to 66% for TR2, which shows that the constraint on 4A \"topic chain\" is a situation where a referent is referred to in the first clause, and then several more clauses follow talking about the same referent, namely, the top;c. discourse segment beginnings in TR2 is effective.",
        "TRY obtains 65% matching rate, on average, which is 1% lower than its predecessor TR.",
        "However, this decrease of average matching rate does not deny the effectiveness of the salience constraint in TRY.",
        "TR2's text differs from TR3's in the three topic shifts: TR2 generates zero anaphors for these shifts, while TRY generates full descriptions.",
        "The speakers varied greatly in choosing anaphoric forms for these topic shifts: among twelve speakers, four chose all full descriptions, three used all zero anaphors, and the other five chose zero, pronominal and nominal anaphors.",
        "Thus, four among the twelve speakers completely agree with TRY, while three agree with TR2.",
        "This shows that the salience constraint in TRY is still effective.",
        "Then we examine the more complicated texts, Texts 4 and 5.",
        "As shown in Table 1, the increases of matching rates show the effectiveness of the constraint of discourse segment beginning in TR2.",
        "Again, the average matching rates of TR3 are sightly lower than TR2 for these two texts.",
        "However, similar to the situation in Text 3, the speakers have varied agreement on the choice of anaphors for the topic shiftings in these two texts.",
        "For Text 4, three and one speaker completely agree with TR2 and TRY, respectively.",
        "As for Text 5, two speakers completely agree with TR2, while the others partly agree with TR2 and TRY.",
        "The above discussions show that the salience constraint in TRY is sometimes effective in getting small improvements in the output texts.",
        "This shows the difference of concepts of salience used between the speakers and TRY.",
        "In brief, the more sophisticated constraints a rule contains, the better it performs.",
        "Both TR2 and TRY perform better than TR/.",
        "TRY performs better than TR2 for texts with simple discourse segment structure.",
        "For the texts having complicated discourse segment structures, TR2 is slightly better than TRY on average matching rates.",
        "Adding the results of the rules to those of the speakers leads to a slight decrease in kappa for TR/ but progressively better (though only from 0.41 to 0.43) values for kappa for TR2 and TRY.",
        "This indicates that the better rules",
        "seem to disagree with the speakers no more than the speakers disagree among themselves.",
        "There art, 9 anaphors where the kappa score including TR3 is less than that for the speakers alone (in many other cases, the results being better).",
