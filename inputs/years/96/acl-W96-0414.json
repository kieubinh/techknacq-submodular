        "Many of these contributions are concerned with multilingual generation, which is often presented as an alternative to Machine Translation.",
        "The multilingual generation approach stipulates that technical documents, such as maintenance manuals, can be generated automatically in several",
        "languages from knowledge bases used in design processes or constructed for the purpose of automatic documentation production.",
        "GhostWriter is a bilingual generation system under development at Dassault Aviation and British Aerospace.",
        "Our objective in this project is to show how French and English maintenance procedures can be generated from an abstract representation of underlying action plans expressed in a formalism inspired by AT planning models.",
        "The role of the text generator is to propose bilingual drafts of procedural texts intended to be integrated in maintenance manuals, and to perform rephrasing operations which may be requested by the technical author, for example grouping maintenance instructions at surface level or changing the specificity level of an instruction.",
        "The design of a multilingual generation system, needless to say, requires a precise analysis of the linguistic means used by each language to express the same conceptual content.",
        "The aim of this paper is to describe the main verbal differences observed in a bilingual corpus of procedural texts and to analyse their impacts on the lexicalisation mechanisms of the sentence generation system GLOSE [4] used in GhostWriter.",
        "The structure of this paper is as follows.",
        "I give in section 2 an overview of GLOSE.",
        "Then, I discuss briefly in the next section the corpus analysis and its role in the design of the multilingual generation system.",
        "Sections 4 and 5 focus on specific types of lexical differences and the related lexicalisation mechanisms.",
        "Finally, the conclusion will describe some lexical divergences which may require the introduction of language-specific semantic representations."

        "This linguistic theory offers many potentialities for multilingual applications.",
        "In computational linguistics, it has been primarily used as a theoretical basis for language generation models (e.g. [2, 1, 16]).",
        "Recently, some works in the fields of machine translation and computational lexicography (e.g. [8], [9]) take advantage of lexicographic descriptive concepts offered by MTT, in particular the well-known notion of lexical function.",
        "In accordance with the stratified framework of MTT, the target representation of the lexicalisation process of CLOSE is a Deep Syntactic representation – mainly a dependency tree, whose nodes are labeled with full lexeine.s and lexical functions.",
        "The relations between nodes represent deep syntactic relations which are defined as abstractions over superficial syntactic relations.",
        "The dependency tree is enriched with communicative biparti-tions such as Theme/Rheme and Given/New.",
        "We will ignore these communicative constraints in this paper because they are of minor importance for the linguistic phenomena considered here.",
        "Lexical functions are used to represent syntactico-semantic relations between lexemes, such as synonymy, hyperonymy, and various types of collocational relations.",
        "CLOSE is composed of two MT-models2, one for each of the two languages considered in our domain.",
        "It should be mentioned that only the grammatical realisation3 component of CLOSE can be considered as an implementation of \"pure\" MT-models, since we do not use at the lexicalisation phase mTT-style semantic networks which represent in this theory a linguistically motivated semantic level, independent of the conceptual level.",
        "The integration of such semantic representations in a multilingual environment raises several theoretical and practical problems which will be the object of future investigations.",
        "We should note that these prob",
        "lems are studied by several NLG researchers (eg, [10, 11, 13]).",

        "The corpus is composed of about thirty bilingual pairs of extended procedural texts extracted from aircraft maintenance manuals.",
        "Our contrastive analysis concentrates on verbal expressions.",
        "Verbal differences between French and English instructions can be classified along three interrelated dimensions: (1) lexical – French and English versions diverge because of differences in the lexical resources available in both languages – (2) syntactic – equivalent verbs exist but the two versions cannot rely on similar syntactic constructions – , and (3) stylistic – lexically and syntactically equivalent versions may be obtained but one of them would be stylistically incorrect.",
        "We should stress that, when designing the lexicalisation component of a multilingual generation system, one should be careful in deciding how much importance should be given to such a contrastive analysis.",
        "In the corpus, bilingual sentences expressing the same content may differ significantly, even though closely related and acceptable versions can be obtained.",
        "Hence, in such cases, it is difficult to know if the author(s) had good reasons to make the English and French versions so different and if the differences should be respected in the automatic generation process.",

        "This lexical class encloses semantir.ally poor items like do, carry out in English and effectuer, proceder in French, which are combined with predicative nouns to form complex predicates.",
        "For example, in sentence (1F), the operator verb proceder takes as its direct object the predicative noun remplissage which, in some way, denotes the action to be performed:",
        "Operator verb constructions have already been studied from a machine translation perspective [5].",
        "Such constructions raise an interesting problem for MT because they cannot be translated in a purely compositional manner.",
        "For example, a compositional English translation of the sentence \"John a pose une question a Mary\" would lead to the incorrect sentence \"John put a question to Mary\", whereas the correct (or the more closely related) translation would be \"John asked Mary a question\".",
        "To make the appropriate translation, an MT system should be able to identify in the initial sentence the semi-idiomatic expression poser une question and consequently build a sentence based on the equivalent English expression ask a question.",
        "Besides, the equivalent expression in the target language does not always exist, which means that even more complex correspondences should be found.",
        "The literal translation associated to sentence (1F) illustrates this point.",
        "We can hardly get an acceptable English translation if we want to preserve the structure of the French instruction.",
        "The English equivalent of (1F) found in the corpus is based on the verb fi// which takes as direct object the translation of the argument of the predicative noun remplissage in (1F):",

        "French and English instructions often diverge on this aspect.",
        "Operator verbs are exceedingly common in the French versions.",
        "We have found many pairs of bilingual instructions where the French instruction is based on an operator verb construction and the English instruction on a simple verb.",
        "Here are some excerpts which illustrate this regularity:",
        "It is important to note that, in many cases, these French instructions can be paraphrased by sentences based on simple verbs.",
        "For example, sentence (2F) can be paraphrased by the sentence based on the verb purger, directly related to the predicative noun used in (2F):",
        "((2F') is the closest translation of the English version (2E)) This remark holds for all the examples given above.",
        "The choice of operator verbs is often a consequence of technical writers'stylistic preferences.",
        "However, as shown by the literal translations, stylistically inadequate sentences would result if this preference were equally applied for English.",
        "Simplified English and Rationalised French suggest to restrict the use of operator verbs, assuming that verbs that directly show the actions make maintenance instructions clearer.",
        "However, operator verbs cannot always be avoided, even in English.",

        "(5E) Gain access to reqr compartment.",

        "The sentence generator should be able to generate multilingual pairs of instructions similar to the excerpts (2), (3) and (4), by selecting an operator verb construction for one element of the pair and a 'simple verb construction' for the other element.",
        "For this kind of differences, the French and English lexicalisations rely on the same basic mechanisms.",
        "However, the way these basic mechanisms are combined is language-specific.",
        "Let us look more closely at the pair (1)4 and at the lexicalisation process required to produce such sentences.",
        "Surface realisation starts with the following input representation:",
        "This structure represents an imperative illocutionary act.",
        "Its propositional content is an action of type fill which has two arguments Agent and Patient.",

        "potential correspondences between this input representation and the deep syntactic representations required to derive sentences (1E), (1F'), and (1F) after grammatical realisation.",

Several remarks should he made about these rules: • To link predicative lexemes to their dependents (i.e. realisations of arguments), correspondences between conceptual roles and deep syntactic relations (I, II, ..., IV) are specified in the lexical entry of each verb and predicative noun.",
        "Hence, a conceptual-lexeme mapping structure indicates not only which lexeme(s) can be used to express a concept but also how the roles of the concept should be realised in terms of deep syntactic relations.",

        "In the procedures we have analysed, only the Operi function seems to be relevant.",

        "However, this correspondence is not given as such in the lexicon.",
        "It appears more natural to consider that the lexical realisation performed by rule r2 relies primarily on a correspondence between the predicate P and the predicative noun.",
        "It should also be mentioned that such basic correspondences can also be exploited to generate similar phrases in other types of constructions.",
        "For example, the correspondence fill rernplissage, used by the rule r2 when generating the sentence (1F) can also be used to construct the notninalisation le remplissage de l'accumulateur in the declarative sentence:",

        "(Lit.",
        "'The replenish of the accumulator should cause the warning light to come on on the hydraulic panel.')",
        "• The lexicalisation of arguments involves other mechanisms, which concern in particular the construction of referring expressions [3].",
        "• An appropriate generation of multilingual instructions in accordance with these lexical differences can be achieved by assigning priorities to these rules.",
        "In English, ri should be priv",
        "ileged and r2 applied only if r1 fails.",
        "For example, this last case would occur when generating sentence (5E)6. r1 would fail because the lexicon does not contain a mapping structure relating the atomic predicate gain_access and a simple verb.",
        "In French, it is, however, difficult to assign absolute priorities in the same way, since we can find both types of constructions in similar contexts.",
        "If stylistic preferences observed in the corpus have to be reflected in the automatically generated texts, a reasonable solution would he to select indifferently one of these rules.",

        "The generation of such sentences relies on rules r1 and r2.",
        "However, in the English version, it is the combination of the predicate lock and the argument Instrument which is mapped to the main verb lockwire.",

        "To be consistent with the lexical preferences observed in the corpus, this rule should have the highest priority.",
        "The incorporated argument does not always hold the same semantic role.",
        "For example, it can be the instrument as in the verbs lockwire, energise and pressurise or a locative argument as in the verb jack up.",
        "It should also be mentioned that such incorporations are not restricted to arguments.",

        "We have focused in this paper on some frequent lexical differences between French and English instructions.",
        "We have also proposed a specification of lexicalisation mechanisms, without introducing distinct semantic representations for French and English lexicalisations.",
        "We do not claim however that distinct representations can always be avoided.",
        "Our corpus reveals the existence of deeper differences (though less frequent) which call for language-specific representations.",
        "For example, we have found several instructions where aspectual values are conveyed explicitly in French but not in English.",
        "Another interesting case concerns agentivity values assigned to the operator in the instructions.",

        "is presented as the causer of an action.",
        "It seems that the generation of such a bilingual pair requires language-specific semantic inputs built on distinct event categories.",
        "Interestingly, we have noticed that controlled languages will not, in most cases, allow these deeper differences to appear.",
        "One of the pair is often rejected by the corresponding controlled language.",
        "For example, (13E) does not comply with Simplified English, which would encourage the use of the more direct form: Decrease the hydraulic pressure.",
        "This last sentence is closer to (13F) and we can reasonably suppose that these two sentences can be generated from the same input."
