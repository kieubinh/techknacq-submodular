        "Levin states that the alternation applies to a class of 'fill verbs', which are many more than the four given by Jackendoff, and her alternation is not exactly the one we need here, since it also involves a causative form – deriving this, however, is in our framework a separate step.",
        "What we need here is a mixture of Jackendoff's and Levin's insights: Several of Levin's fill verbs can be both transitive and intransitive; and some of the intransitive readings denote 'to become Xed'.",
        "Among these verbs are fill, flood, soak, encrust, or saturate: The kitchen flooded with water means the same as The kitchen became flooded with water.",
        "For this subgroup of the fill verbs we define an extension rule that derives from a STATE reading a RESULTATIVE one.",

        "Accordingly, we split the alternation in two, which only differ in the DXT component, reflecting the difference in Aktionsart.",
        "The alternation adds a CAUSER to the denotation, makes the former : actor the new :actee, and accordingly changes the overall UM-type from NONDIRECTED-ACTION to DIRECTED-ACTION, because there is now an ACTEE present.",
        "The first rule derives, for example, Tom moved the cat from The cat moved, and the second Tom closed the door from The door closed.",
        "Locative extensions Example: (a) Sally sprayed the wall with paint./ (b) Sally sprayed paint onto the wall.",
        "We have mentioned the locative extension above; its characteristic is that configuration (a) of the verb conveys that something is performed in a 'complete' or 'holistic' manner, whereas configuration (b) lacks this facet of meaning.",
        "Levin points out that this alternation has received much attention in linguistics research and notes that, in spite of the efforts, a satisfactory definition of the 'holistic'-facet has not been found.",
        "Jackendoff, in his treatment of the alternation, suggests encoding the 'holistic' feature in a primitive: the",
        "function ONd is a derivative of ON and means that something 'distributively' covers a surface, e.g., the paint covers all of the wall.",
        "Introducing a primitive, though, amounts to conceding that no explanation in terms that are already known can be given.",
        "We cannot solve the question of `holisticness', either, but we want to point to the fact that the two verb configurations correlate with a change in Aktionsart: Sally sprayed paint onto the wall is clurative (she can do it for two hours), whereas Sally sprayed the wall with paint is transformative (she can do it in two hours).",
        "That observation leads us to propose that the example is best analyzed as involving a mere ACTIVITY in the with configuration, and an additional TRANSITION in the onto configuration.",
        "Hence, we assign two different SitSpecs for the sentences, one ACTIVITY and one EVENT, as shown in figure 3.",
        "The crucial point now is that the first SitSpec is fully embedded in the second; this is in correspondence with the truth conditions: If Sally has sprayed the wall with paint, then she also has sprayed paint onto the wall.",
        "To generalize the correspondence to an extension rule, we need to assume in the domain model a concept like COMPLETION-STATE, which is to subsume all those STATES in the domain model that have \"extreme\" values: an empty bucket, a fully loaded truck, and so forth.",
        "The exact interpretation of COMPLETION-STATE is the open question that Levin [1993] referred to, and that Jackendoff treated with his d subscript.",
        "We do think, though, that an abstract STATE in the domain model, which subsumes a range of the concrete STATES, is preferrable to introducing a primitive on the linguistic level (unless the primitive is relevant for other linguistic phenomena as well).",
        "The following alternation rule applies to durative verb readings that denote ACTIVITIES of something being moved to somewhere, and extends them to also cover the POST-STATE, which must be subsumed by COMPLETION-STATE.",
        "In this way, it derives reading (a) from (b) in the spray example, and analogously for the other verbs undergoing the alternation, e.g.: Tom",
        "loaded hay onto the wagon / Tom loaded the wagon with hay; Jill stuffed the feathers into the cushion / Jill stuffed the cushion with the feathers.",
        "The PSemSpec is modified as follows: The former :destination (wall) becomes the new : actee, whereas the former : actee (paint) now fills the role < : inclusive >, and is optional there, because Jill stuffed the cushion is also well-formed.",
        "Most of this rule covers two kinds of locative alternation, which Levin distinguishes: the 'spray/load' alternation and the 'clear (transitive)' alternation.",
        "The latter applies only to the verbs clear, clean, drain, empty and can be seen as the 'semantic inverse' of the spray/load alternation, because one group of verbs denotes activities of placing something somewhere, and the other describes activities of removing something from somewhere; but both have the same 'holistic' effect in one of the verb configurations.",
        "For example, the rule derives Tom drained the container of the water From Tom drained the water from the container.2 Thus, the rule for the clear",
        "alternation is the same as the one shown above, with three exceptions: the keyword replacing :actee is not <: inclusive> but <: of-matter>, the DESTINATION in the denotation is a SOURCE, and correspondingly, the keyword :destination is :source.",
