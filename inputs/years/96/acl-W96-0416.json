      "text": [
        "Within the last ten years there has been a upsurge of interest in hypertext as a medium for on-line access to written documents.",
        "As a central objective of Natural Language Generation (NLG) is on-line creation of written document,, it is hardly surprising that a number of generation systems have been developed which use hypertext as their interface.",
        "Conventional hypertext is static, in the sense that – even though each reader may sample different parts of it – once a hyper-document has been constructed by its authors, its content and form do not change.",
        "However, applying NLG to hypertext allows the possibility of dynamic hypertext, where the document is created as demanded by the user.",
        "This approach allows the hypertext pages seen by the user to be customised in relation to the browsing context.",
        "In some cases, customisation is only in relation to content – the page brings together information from various on-line sources, but presents it in a single standard way.",
        "Other systems, using more advanced NLG techniques, allow the text to be customised in terms of both content and presentation form, being sensitive to such factors as the user model (characteristics of the user), the discourse history (a record of information presented so far), and the system's goals (what the system means to achieve).",
        "Amongst the latter systems, the degree of flexibility supported by the text generation component varies considerably.",
        "In some systems (such as StrathTutor [Kibby and Mayes 1988]) and Trellis [Stotts and Furuta 1989]), the hypertext pages are hand-crafted in advance, but the way they are linked together varies from session to session depending on the interests of the user.",
        "In other systems, the hypertext pages themselves are generated at runtime, as well as the links between them.",
        "In many current systems, a mixture of these two methods is employed.",
        "Clearly, there are many different ways of introducing flexibility into a hypertext system.",
        "Our concern in this paper is to outline the most important of these, indicating which have al",
        "ready been explored, and which others deserve 2 A sample domain: Museum closer attention within the NLG community.",
        "A number of hypertext systems incorporating NLG technology have already been developed.",
        "In this paper, we will make reference to the five systems listed below.",
        "ALFRESCO [Carenini et al.",
        "1993]: provides an interface to a videodisc of Italian frescoes and monuments.",
        "It supports natural language input and output, and generated text contains hypertext links into an existing static hypertext.",
        "IDAS [Reiter at al.",
        "1995, Reiter et al.",
        "1992]: delivers simple technical documentation online via a hypertext interface.",
        "MIGRAINE [Buchanan et al.",
        "1995]: generates information and reactive explanations for a patient, based on their medical record.",
        "PEBA-II [Dale and Milosavljevic 1996, Milosavljevic et al.",
        "1996]: interfaces with a zoological database.",
        "Delivers either a description of a single user-selected animal, or a comparison between two user-selected animals.",
        "PIGLIT [Binsted et al.",
        "1994 allows a patient to interface to their medical records, and receive personalised explanation.",
        "In addition to these systems, we will introduce our own prototype system ILEX-0, which is being developed specifically to examine issues arising in the domain of dynamic hypertext.",
        "The system is designed to simulate the interaction of a museum tour guide and a browsing visitor; this interaction is described in more detail in Section 2.",
        "In Section 3, the browsing task provides the context for a general discussion of the factors which influence the ability of a hypertext system to function dynamically, and in the light of this discussion, some observations about existing dynamic hypertext systems.",
        "Section 4 then iraws some conclusions concerning the real potential of dynamic hypertext.",
        "guided tours A central attraction of the hypertext interface is its suitability for the task of information browsing.",
        "By following hyperlinks, the information seeker (i.e. the user) can easily navigate to new areas of interest.",
        "At the same time, for the reasons already mentioned, there are advantages in being able to provide the information requested by the user in a dynamic fashion.",
        "If we look for an analogy in the real world to the kind of interface we are aiming for, an interesting candidate is the dialogue between a museum tour guide and a browsing visitor.",
        "The ILEX (Intelligent Labelling Explorer) project has been set up to study this domain, and to reproduce some of its distinctive features in a hypertext system.",
        "To achieve this goal, our system must: Support mixed initiative dialogue There is a degree of 'dialogic' interaction between the tour-guide and the visitor.",
        "While there are quite restricted directions that the conversation can take, each party can take the initiative in pursuing a direction.",
        "Be interesting The visitor is free to ask about whichever objects take his fancy; if an object does not hold his interest, he will move on to another, or finish.",
        "Be informative The system has all the information, and has the goal of getting across some basic messages about the content of the gallery.",
        "Clearly, the system needs to alter its descriptions in the light of the objects the visitor has already heard about, and to have some idea about what the visitor might find interesting.",
        "This is an increase in functionality compared to existing static museum hypertexts, for instance as created in the UK by the Hunterian Museum and the National Gallery.",
        "Our point of departure has been to gather transcripts of real guided tours, in collaboration with the National Museums of Scotland.",
        "We ran two 'Curator-of-Oz' interviews, where a curator of the modern jewellery gallery was",

        "ILEX-0 is still far from generating discourse of the sophistication shown by a real museum curator.",
        "But it should be clear that any hypertext system designed to simulate such discourse must make use of a dynamic generation component of some sort.",
        "In the following section.",
        "we consider the kinds of flexibility which this component should ideally provide.",
        "3 Parameters of flexibility in hypertext generation We indicated in Section 1.1 that an NLG system can exploit a number of techniques to generate hypertext.",
        "In this section we will attempt to isolate a number of parameters which affect the flexibility of the resulting dynamic hypertext.",
        "Although obviously such a short table cannot do justice to the detailed contributions of these systems, Figure 3 summarises our understanding of how the above six systems vary in terms of the parameters, which are discussed in the following sections.",
        "In each case, we assume that the parameter influences the quality of the text, and we ask whether NLG needs to investigate the parameter in greater detail in order to produce good hypertext applications."

      "text": [
        "A fundamental factor influencing generator flexibility is the form of representation of the information to be expressed.",
        "At one extreme, the information can actually be stored as text, in which case there is no scope at all for flexibility of expression; this is essentially the scenario for 'canned' text.",
        "Scope for contextual variability is introduced by establishing an independent format for information storage, and a flexible mapping algorithm from this to surface text.",
        "The linguistic sophistication required of the system obviously depends on the level of representation chosen.",
        "In fact, the 'degree of cannedness' of a system's output is on a sliding scale.",
        "A static hypertext is made up entirely of canned text.",
        "In a slightly more flexible system, individual sentences or paragraphs may be canned, while their organisation and inclusion is constrained by some theory of discourse.",
        "(For instance, a system could store canned sentences organised in terms of an RST tree; the generator could then use the RST information to select and linearly organise the canned segments.)",
        "More flexible still, a system could use canned text only at the phrasal level, for example in a template-based sentence generation system.",
        "or in a phrasal lexicon.",
        "Finally, a system could dispense with canned text altogether, and use full NLG technology.",
        "ALFRESCO uses general generation methods for the first screen produced, but canned representations for the other nodes accessible by hyperlinks.",
        "Most of the systems discussed in this paper use canned text in some places though also being able to generate variable text.",
        "IDAS uses a number of intermediate forms that mix canned text with standard knowledge representations.",
        "Concern with the appropriate degree of cannedness for NLG systems is of course not limited to hypertext generation.",
        "It is currently the focus for much debate in all areas of NLG, especially where the development of practical applications is an issue (see e.g. [Reiter et al.",
        "1995]).",
        "But as the dimensions of flexibility we are interested in depend on this issue, it is important to discuss it.",
        "ILEX-0 represents information at two distinct levels on the cannedness scale.",
        "For fine-grained detail, the system uses a database made available by the museum, containing entries for the 120 or so jewellery items in the Modern Jewellery exhibit.",
        "These entries have been parsed in and represented in a KB-accessible form, as shown in Figure 4.",
        "The generation of sentences based on this information is currently effected via a simple template-based mechanism.",
        "Secondly, the transcriptions of the curator tours have been hand-processed to extract canned stories about individual jewellery items, the designers of the items, and",
        "more often, classes of jewellery (e.g. jewellery made in a particular style).",
        "Figure 5 shows one example.",
        "However, given the limitations of current NLG systems, if it is feasible canning offers the most reliable way of ensuring high-quality text output.",
        "And, since it is much easier to enter information in the form of text than using a complicated knowledge representation formalism, canning also facilitates the authoring task.",
        "But of course, canning fails to support genuine flexibility.",
        "In the ILEX-0 system, we have sought to allay this problem by including in the canned text various types of annotation which allow a certain amount of local customisation.",
        "Below are two possible annotations, only the first of which is presently included in ILEX-0:",
        "• Conditionalisation: Parts of the text",
        "can be conditionalised, indicating that the text is to appear only if the condition is met, e.g. \"They used the very best designers to design jewels for them.",
        "<cond Designer=KING01> Jessie King was one of their best designers.",
        "</cond>\" This allows canned text to include comments about particular entities if they are relevant at that point in the discourse.",
        "• Reference: Entities which are defined in the knowledge-base can be replaced with an annotation, which allows the generator to choose a referential expression appropriate for the context of generation, e.g,",
        "\"C:ref KING01) was one of their best designers\".",
        "Further types of annotation will be added as the ILEX system develops.",
        "We plan to explore whether, for some applications, the medium of 'annotated text' can be a useful compromise between canned text and full NLG."

        "This paper has discussed several of the parameters of variation in dynamic hypertext systems.",
        "All of these parameters are associated with kinds of flexibility which seem to be desirable in the exploitation of the dynamic hypertext concept, but they are not necessarily independent or all useful together.",
        "Indeed, flexibility is not without cost; for instance, canned text can offer fluency which the most advanced NLG systems today have yet to reach.",
        "Some of the parameters are relatively well-understood, and the state-of-the-art in NLG is sufficient to allow us to manipulate them effectively in dynamic hypertext systems.",
        "However, other parameters – particularly those involving user freedom and system goals – require further investigation.",
        "The domain we have been investigating raises the particular challenge of mixed initiative dialogue: the visitor is in control of macro-level content selection, but the system selects lower-level content, with the twin goals of satisfying the visitor's curiosity, and of conveying key information.",
        "In a sense, meeting the challenge subverts the very idea of hypertext as we know it.",
        "In conventional hypertext, the author selects content and connectivity, and then retires; the user is free to sample the hyper-document however they wish.",
        "Because of the author's disappearance, the effectiveness of the sampling is crucial: authors strive to place links and important content in all the right places, but some users still feel that they have to sample exhaustively every node of the hypertext.",
        "Nonetheless, hypertext is attractive because users value their freedom to sample as they choose.",
        "In a system which opportunistically both satisfies user curiosity and its own informational goals, we can provide an ersatz author.",
        "However the user samples, they will always end up with the important content.",
        "In a sense, the users' freedom is an illusion: they cannot fail.",
        "When fishing on an ordinary river, an angler casts their line, and occasionally, if they do it well enough, and wait long enough, they catch a fish.",
        "We are proposing a new kind of river, in which an angler can cast their line haphazardly, and still pull out a perfect fish, time after time."
