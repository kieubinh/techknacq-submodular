        "In this paper, we outline some strategies for comparison which we use in PEBA-II, a hypertext generation system which produces encyclopdia descriptions of entities as World Wide Web (www) documents, based on an underlying taxonomic knowledge base.",
        "PEBA-II is part of a larger research programme built around the idea of an intelligent on-line encyclopdia, where the descriptions produced by the system vary for different users and at different times.",
        "Our work is grounded in the domain of animal descriptions, although similar issues arise in many other domains.",
        "Comparisons are widespread within existing encyclopdia descriptions.",
        "In particular, when describing a new concept to a user, a comparison may be made with reference to other known concepts or ideas, enabling the hearer to more easily process and understand the new material (see [Milosavljevic 1996]).",
        "So, for example, in the context of animal descriptions, if the user knows about the porcupine and requests a description of the echidna, then we might describe the echidna by highlighting both its similarities to and differences from the porcupine.",
        "Clearly this requires us to make use of some notion of a user model, and in a way that is distinct from previous work in user-modelling in text generation.",
        "Our aim is to produce texts which introduce new concepts by reference to existing knowledge the user is assumed to have, thus employing the user model to greater advantage; past research (see, in particular, [Paris 1987]) has concentrated on avoiding the production of texts which repeat what the user already knows.",
        "By making use of a discourse model, we can also generate comparisons that take account of entities that have been mentioned in the previous discourse.",
        "This is particularly important in the context of the dynamic construction of hypertext documents from an underlying representation: by employing text generation techniques, we can produce context-dependent descriptions which vary depending on the information which has already been presented to the user, thus overcoming some of the limitations of hypertext documents which have been constructed simply by breaking an existing linear text into",
        "pieces.",
        "As has been noted by others (see, for example, [Reiter et al. 19921 and [Moore 1989]), the dynamic generation of hypertext also permits the user to effectively drive the text generation system, alleviating from the system some of the responsibility of reasoning about what to present to the user.",
        "In Section 2, we provide an overview of the PEBA-II system; in Section 3, we provide a definition of comparison and identify three types of comparison on the basis of a corpus analysis; and in Section 4 we describe how the corresponding discourse strategies are implemented in PEBA-II.",
        "Section 5 ends the paper by pointing to some future research directions."

        "The plan library consists of discourse plans which are used by the text planning component.",

        "These discourse plans are similar in spirit but rather different in content to the similarly-named schemas used by McKeown [1985], with a number of the differences arising from the fact that we are generating hypertext pages.",

        "In such cases we will refer to the first entity as the FOCUSED ENTITY, and to the second entity as the POTENTIAL CONFUSOR.",

        "There are a number of interesting research issues here: • How is a comparator entity selected?",
        "For example, a very appropriate comparator for the echidna is the porcupine, but the two entities are not closely related within the Linnaean taxonomy of animal classes.",
        "The reason for the choice of comparator entity here lies in the fact that both",

        "For example, if a user who is not familiar with sheep requests a description of the sheep and the system describes the sheep by informing the user of its similarities with the goat and not their differences, then the user could be led to believe that the two animals are more similar than they are in reality.",
        "The text shown above very carefully describes both similarities and differences for only the most salient features which clearly distinguish the animals.",

        "The geographical location of the user can also play an important role: for example, in the texts that we have examined, squirrels are often used as comparators; but Australians are not necessarily familiar with the features of squirrels, and some North Americans might only know of the existence of black squirrels."
