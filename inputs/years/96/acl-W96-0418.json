        "Task independent computational dialogue modelling (see e.g., [5, 10, 35]) seldom makes contact with natural language generation (exceptions being, e.g., [7, 9, 22]), and much less so with speech generation/synthesis.",
        "Conversely, speech synthesis, being predominantly concerned with rendering text to speech, rarely considers actual full scale generation.",
        "In this article we introduce an approach under development in a joint collaborative project between the Technical Universities of Darmstadt and Budapest ('SPEAK!')",
        "that combines the dialogue modelling paradigm with NL generation and speech synthesis in an information retrieval system.",
        "The novelty of the approach pursued lies in the move away from text-to-speech and concept-to-speech generation towards communicative-context-to-speech generation (see Section 2) and the integration of dialogue representation, NL generation, and speech synthesis.",

        "In Section 4 we first apply an bottom-up approach; we will determine the kinds of knowledge the generator needs to make intonational choices, and based on this we develop a stratified model with three strata: grammar, semantics, and extralinguistic context.",
        "Second we apply a top-down approach; we determine how this knowledge can be obtained from the dialogue model and dialogue history, i.e., from the extralinguistic context, and thereby verify the applicability of our overall model.",

        "In this section we give a survey of existing speech generation systems for German, arguing that their syntax-based approach does not suffice to generate \"natural\" speech in dialogue systems.",
        "In information-seeking dialogues that use spoken language for interaction, intonation is often the only means to distinguish between different dialogue acts, thus making the selection of the appropriate intonation crucial to the success of the information-seeking process (see e.g., [26] for English).",
        "To illustrate this point, imagine an information-seeking dialogue where the user wants to know a specific train connection.",
        "At some point in the interaction, the system produces a sentence like Sie fahren um drei Uhr von Darmstadt nach",
        "Heidelberg (\"You travel at three o'clock from Darmstadt to Heidelberg.\").",
        "There are several interpretations of this utterance, the most obvious being that the system presents some kind of information to the reader.",
        "However, the same sentence – employing a different intonation – could be past of a clarification dialogue, where the system wants to reassure that it got the user's request right.",
        "In this case, the user would be expected to react, i.e., either confirm or rebuke this statement.",
        "Only by means of intonation can the user interpret the system's expectation correctly and react accordingly.",
        "Even though current speech synthesizers can support sophisticated variation of intonation, no existing text-to-speech or concept-to-speech system for German is available that provides the semantic or pragmatic guidance necessary for selecting intonations appropriately.",
        "The major shortcoming is that traditional text-to-speech systems (e.g., [16, 18, 23]) and concept-to-speech systems [6] alike use purely syntactic information in order to control prosodic features.",
        "Moreover, with text-to-speech systems, where the syntactic structure has to be reconstructed from the written text by means of a syntactic analysis, the resulting data is seldom complete nor unambiguous.",
        "Concept-to-speech systems avoid the latter problem by generating spoken output from a pre-linguistic conceptual structure.",
        "Yet, most of the current implementations of the concept-to-speech approach use the conceptual representation only to avoid syntactic ambiguities with the assignment of intonational features still based on the written text (see [6]).",
        "A common feature of all these systems is that they are often too expressive in that too many words are stressed, mainly due to the lack of discourse information, for instance on focus domain or the given/new distinction.",
        "A number of discourse-model based speech generation systems have been proposed that address exactly this problem, for example NewSpeak [17, 26].",
        "However, the problem with these systems is that they still start from a given text, and are hence restricted to those kinds of discourse information that can be reconstructed from that text.",
        "Moreover, since they assume a one-to-one mapping between syntactic structure and intonational features, they cannot account for those phenomena frequent to our domain, where the same syntactic structure can be realized with differing intonations (see example above).",
        "Assuming that intonation is more than the mere reflection of the surface linguistic form (see [14, 30, 19, 24]), and further, that intonation is selected to express particular communicative goals and intentions, an effective control of intonation requires synthesizing from meanings rather than word sequences as the discussed systems do.",
        "This fact is acknowledged by [1], whose SYNPHONICS system' is based on the assumption that prosodic fea-'The SYNPHONICS system ([1]) covers the incremen",
        "tures have a function independent of syntax.",
        "[1] replace the idea of syntax-dependent prosody – which is implicit to all the approaches discussed so far – with the notion of the linguistic function of prosodic features including intonation.",
        "Thus, this approach allows prosodic features to be controlled by various factors other than syntax, e.g., by the information structure such as focus-background or topic-comment structure.",
        "However, the function of intonation is still restricted to what is called grammatical function, more specifically the textual function of intonation, without considering aspects like communicative goals and speaker's attitude, i.e., the interpersonal function of intonation ([14]).2 Yet, in the context of generating speech in information-seeking dialogues where intonational features are often the only means to signal a dialogue act, these aspects have to be taken into account.",
        "Furthermore, in a dialogue situation as given in our approach, it is not sufficient to look at isolated sentences; instead one has to look at the utterance in its context, as part of a larger interaction.",
        "Intonation is not only used to mark sentence-internal information structures, but additionally it can be employed in the management of the communicative demands of interaction partners.",
        "Therefore, we also have to consider the function of intonation with respect to the whole conversational interaction, taking into account the discourse (dialogue) history (see also [7]).",
        "Intonation as realization of in-teractional features thus draws on discourse and user model as the source of constraints.",
        "An approach to speech generation that starts from communication context and maps this to intonational features is the only approach that provides the intonational control needed in dialogue systems to produce speech that human hearers would find acceptable."

        "The systemic-functional framework provides us with representational means for describing available choices and for mapping (even though indirectly) communicative goals to intonational features.",

        "Further, we show how competent choices at the semantic stratum guide the selection of features in the MOOD and KEY systems, which finally result in the assignment of a tone.",
        "We base our derivation of mappings between the strata on the following sample dialogue and its COR analysis\" from the domain of giving out train information.",
        "In the following, we will discuss the different system utterances one by one.",
        "This discussion is summarized in Table 1 .",
        "anything at all, the system must know where the user wants to travel.",
        "Unless the user volunteers the destination, it must request this information from her.12 The user did not say where she wanted to travel, hence the system initiated the exchange, this is represented by the following path through the NEGOTIATIONha network: [negotiation:negotiating:exchanging/initiating].",
        "In terms of speech function, we realize this request as a question ([demanding/information]).",
        "Other possible realizations of a request would be command, offer and statement, though none of them applies in the given context.",
        "The scenario itself excludes the command and the statement option, since the system is in need for information.",
        "Finally, since the system is incapable of handing over, say, a ticket, this request cannot be realized as an offer (\"Let me give you a ticket to your destination\").",
        "Knowing that we have to realize a question, we have three MOOD options available: [declarative], [yes/noquestion], and [wh-question].",
        "Keeping in mind that we want our system to be user friendly, we do not want it to realize this request as a yes/no question (\"Do you want to go to Heidelberg?\"), or a statement (\"You want to travel to Heidelberg?\"), since it would then exhaustively have to search through its knowledge base in order to find the right destination to include in its utterance.",
        "Hence we conclude that requests that are not in response to a user utterance should be realized as a wh-question.",
        "In terms of KEY, we do not want our system to be overly [involved] in the conversation or [surprised] by the fact that it has to request some information and there is nothing to [clarify], hence the only accessible KEY feature is [neutral-involvement], which implies that utterance B) – an initiating, neutral, wh-question – should be realized as tone 1.",
        "Responding requests Utterance D) is a request in response to the destination that the user informed.",
        "In terms of semantic choices it is [initiating] a new embedded exchange, while it is [responding to] a user move in the embedding exchange.",
        "The speech function is question since the system wants to initiate a response.",
        "We suggest that the linguistic realization of this question depends on how confident the system is about what the user informed, hence in order to choose appropriate MOOD and KEY features, we argue that we need access to an additional resource – a confidence measure.\" For the current example, we suggest the following alternatives:",
        "If the system is confident that it has understood what the user said, it would ask only to confirm what it believes to know, hence it would choose a declarative with tone 2 ([answering:positive/answering-toguestion:strong]).",
        "If the confidence is somewhat lower, there are two ways of realizing a yes/no-question: tone 2a ([interrogative:yes/no-type:informationseeking:unmarked:neutral-assessment]) or tone 2 ([interrogative:yes/no:request]).",
        "Finally, if the system has not at all understood what the user said, it could indicate this by using a clarifying wh-question with tone 4 ([interrogative:wh-type:wh-tonic:clarifying]).",
        "Utterance F) is also in response to a user inform, but what makes this situation different from the response above is that here, there is a mismatch between what the user wanted and what the system can offer (User wanted 3 o'clock, while system can only offer 14.52).",
        "Hence the system must offer the user an alternative and the linguistic form of this utterance might differ with the \"closeness\" of the alternative to the original demand.",
        "If the alternative is reasonably close (In our example, there is a time difference of 8 minutes, which, for this scenario, might be considered a good alternative), we find it appropriate to generate a yes/no-question with tone 2b Ginterrogative:yes/no-type:informationseeking:unmarked:strong-assessmentp.",
        "The lack of good alternatives, however, might condition a wh-question (\"What is your next preferred departure time?\" ) with tone 1 ([interrogative:wh-type:whnontonic:neutral-involvement]).",
        "Inform The system answers the user's question, i.e., it is [giving/information], and hence the speech function is statement.",
        "Statements of this type do not need any particular intonational marking, since at this point they are expected, hence we choose the features [declarative:stating:neutral:nonemphatic:noncontrastive], i.e., tone la.",
        "E.g., (\"Eine einfache Fahrt kostet 6DM\" (=\"The ticket costs 6DM.\" ).",

        "This is additional information that the system volunteers the user, which often take the form of a polite command, e.g., \"Bitte warten Sie.\" (= \"Please wait.\").",
        "Linguistically; commands are realized as imperatives and hence tone 1.",
        "Request in Withdraw A request in the context of any of the unexpected dialogue moves (e.g., withdraw-request) mostly serves as confirmation question similar to the responding requests in inform that we discussed above.",
        "This is, however, an unexpected move on the part of the user, hence we suggest that these requests, again mapping to question on the speech functional level, are realized as yes/no-question (as opposed to declarative with tone 2, see above) i.e., \"Do you want to quit?\" vs. \"You want to quit?\".",
        "Which tone one chooses for this type of question depends on how involved one wants the system to appear.",
        "Tone 4a indicates neutral involvement, while tone 4b signals strong involvement.",
        "The partial structure of this type of requests is as follows:",
        "Offer In an information retrieval system, the system often offers the user a list of alternatives from which she has to choose one.",
        "If we consider the appearance of a list on the screen a metaphor for actually handing over an object, this situation corresponds to [demanding/goods & services], i.e., the speech function is command, hence we suggest that offers are realized as imperatives with tone 1.",
        "E.g., \"Bitte wahlen Sie ems.\" (=\"Please choose one.\") Summary The above discussion is summarized in Table 1 .",
        "Further, from the data that we have collected so far we observe: • The dialogue move guides the selection of speech function, e.g., request corresponds to speech function question, whereas offer maps to command.",
        "• The dialogue history, or context, guides the selection of semantic choices, i.e., pure initiating moves (e.g., request) correspond to [exchanging/initiating], while responding initiating moves (e.g., inform(request)) correspond to [exchanging/responding] in a first grammar traversal and [exchanging/initiating] in a second.",
        "• Choices in MOOD and KEY systems can often not be made unless we have access to additional knowledge sources as, for instance, a confidence measure.",

        "• We can only make predictions about complete clauses, hence the grammar prevents the generation of utterances with ellipses.",

        "In this article we have developed a model for guiding the selection of intonation in a system supporting human-machine interaction in retrieval dialogues with spoken output.",
        "We have concentrated on the choice of tone as a major signal of interpersonal semantic features, such as speech acts and speaker's attitudes.",
        "To express these appropriately is crucial especially in human-machine dialogue, since they contribute to the success of the interaction in a major way.",
        "As a starting point we have taken two existing systems – the COR dialogue model and the KOMET-PENMAN generation system.",
        "On this basis, we have determined a number of factors that contribute to the selection of appropriate tones, such as speech function, speaker's attitudes and hearer's expectations, and types of dialogue moves in context.",
        "Finally, we have proposed a stratified model that includes all of the relevant kinds of information to guide the selection of tone.",
        "Even though our dialogue model was originally not designed for language, we have shown that this relatively simple model provides useful information for intonation selection.",
        "A linguistically based discourse model would be able to provide more information, but in the context of an interactive conversational system in which there are practical limits on how long it can take to produce a response, we believe that a full fledged discourse analysis system would be too slow.",

        "• accounting for the textual meaning of intonation encoded in information structure and thematic",
        "Also, the method we have applied here to develop our model has been solely qualitative.",
        "For a proper validation we need to analyse larger quantities of dialogue in order to have an empirically sound foundation.",
        "The same is true for the classification of intonation which was developed by Pheby in the late sixties.",
        "Here, the collaborative work with speech synthesis will provide us with empirical data that can then be used to refine the classification."
