        "Natural language generation has been traditionally divided into three successive tasks: (1) content determination, (2) content organization, and (3) linguistic realization.",
        "The goal of a reusable realization component is to encapsulate the domain-independent part of this third task.",
        "The input to such component should thus be as high-level as possible without hindering portability.",
        "Independent efforts to define such an input have crystalized around a skeletal, partially lexicalized thematic tree specifying the semantic roles, open-class lexical items and top-level syntactic category of each constituents.",
        "An example SURGE input with the corresponding sentence is given in Fig. 1.",
        "The task of the realization component is to map such skeletal tree onto a natural language sentence.",
        "It involves the following sub-tasks:",

        "when adding the same (dative-move yes) feature to an input similar to fi except that the possessed role is filled by ((cat pers-pro)) (for personal pro noun) to avoid the generation of (S3) * \"She hands the editor it\".",

        "SURGE is implemented in the special-purpose programming language FUF [1] and it is distributed as a package with a FUF interpreter.",
        "This interpreter has two components: (1) the functional unifier that fleshes out the input skeletal tree with syntactic features from the grammar.",
        "and (2) the linearizer that inflects each word at the bottom of the fleshed out tree and print them out following the linear precedence constraints indicated in the tree.",
        "F U F is an extension of the original functional unification formalism put forward by Kay [5].",
        "It is based on two powerful concepts: encoding knowledge in recursive sets of attribute value pairs called Functional Descriptions (FD) and uniformly manipulating these FDs through the operation of unification.",
        "Both the input and the output of a FUF program are FDs, while the program itself is a meta-FD called a Functional Grammar (FG).",
        "An FG is an FD with disjunctions and control annotations.",
        "Control annotations are used in FUF for two distinct purposes: (1) to control recursion on lino 0 uistic constituents: the tree of the input FD is fleshed out in top-down fashion by reunifying each of its sub-constituent with the FG.",
        "and (2) to reduce backtracking when processing disjunctions.",
        "SURGE represents our own synthesis, within a single working system and computational framework, of the descriptive work of several (non-computational) lin",
        "guists.",
        "We took inspiration principally from [4] for the overall organization of the grammar and the core of the clause and nominal sub-grammars; [3] for the semantic aspects of the clause; [7] for the treatment of long-distance dependencies; and [8] for the many linguistic phenomena not mentioned in other works, yet encountered in many generation application domains.",
        "Since many of these sources belong to the systemic linguistic school.",
        "SURGE is mostly a functional unification implementation of systemic grammar.",
        "In particular, the type of FD that it accepts as input specifies a \"process\" in the systemic sense: it can be an event or a relation.",
        "The hierarchy of general process types defining the thematic structure of a clause (and the associated semantic class of its main verb) in the current implementation is compact and able to cover many clause structures.",
        "Yet, the argument structure and/or semantics of many English verbs do not fit neatly in any element of this hierarchy [6].",
        "To overcome this difficulty.",
        "SURGE also includes lexical processes inspired by lexical-ist grammars such as the Meaning-Text Theory and HPSG [7].",
        "A lexical process is a shallower and less semantic form of input, where the sub-categorization constraints and the mapping from the thematic roles to the oblique roles [7] are already specified (instead of being automatically computed by the grammar as is the case for general process types).",
        "The use of specific lexical processes to complement general process types is an example of the type of theory integration that we were forced to carry out during the development of SURGE.",
        "In the current state of linguistic research, such an heterogeneous approach is the best practical strategy to provide broad coverage."

        "For example, generating the sentence James buys the book\" involves successively accessing the sub-grammars for the clause, the vcrb group, the nominal group (twice) and the determiner sequence.",
        "Each sub-grammar is then divided into a set of systems (in the systemic sense), each one encapsulating an orthogonal set of decisions, constraints and features.",

        "Nominals are an extremely versatile syntactic category, and except for limited cases, no linguistic semantic classification of nominals has been provided.",
        "Consequently, while for clauses input can be provided in thematic form, for nominals it must be provided directly in terms of syntactic roles.",
