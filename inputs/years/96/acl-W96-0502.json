        "SPLAT also contains a sentence bank, a user-extensible collection of sentence plans annotated in various ways.",

        "As natural language generation systems become more complex and sophisticated, the mode of input to these systems is becoming correspondingly more difficult to specify and manage.",
        "Currently, sentence plans must be created by experts who are very knowledgeable about both linguistic theory and the characteristics of the particular generation system.",
        "In order to facilitate the growth of natural language generation research, systems should be able to handle more complex input, but at the same time should be more accessible to non-experts.",
        "To accomplish these goals requires a facility that aids the user in creating and maintaining the desired input specifications in a principled and convenient way.",
        "Such a facility, should have both theoretical knowledge of the allowable form and content of the input specifications, and the practical ability to ensure that only syntactically correct specifications are entered.",
        "Ideally, it should also maintain a library of sample input specifications so that the user need not reconstruct existing specifications, but can construct new ones from an existing set.",
        "As well, such a facility should provide access to a range of resources, such as grammars and other linguistic resources that can aid the user in input development.",
        "SPLAT is a first attempt to provide such a facility for the Penman generation system in the form of an authoring tool for Sentence Plan Language (SPL).",

        "The Penman generation system [Penman, 1989] is one of the most comprehensive natural language generation systems in the world.",
        "It contains a very large systemic functional grammar of English, the Nigel grammar, and an extensive semantic ontology, the upper model.",
        "Input to the Penman system is defined by the Sentence Plan Language [Penman, 1991] and given in the form of SPL plans.",
        "The system processes the SPL input by querying different knowledge resources, including the Nigel grammar, the upper model, and a domain model, eventually producing a realization of the SPL plan in the form of an English sentence.",
        "Each SPL plan contains one or more head concepts from the upper model and a variable that enables the plan to be referred to by other SPL plans.",
        "The head concept can",
        "be modified by a number of keywords, signalling the underlying grammar to generate different sentence 'patterns.",
        "For example, one common type of keyword is a relation, whose value may be another SPL plan, or a reference to such a plan."

      "heading": "2.2 Why using SPL is hard",
      "text": [
        "One of the major difficulties in learning to use Penman has been acquiring the expertise to construct SPL plans.",
        "The vast number of possible keywords and values, coupled with the absence of any facility for storing and searching these items, made the task of building SPL plans very frustrating for the novice Penman user.",
        "In contrast, the experienced SPL developer would often draw on knowledge of previously constructed SPL plans in order to recycle bits of partial SPL plans, but had no convenient way to store and access this information.",
        "Various resources, the upper model, for instance, play an essential role in providing knowledge to guide the development of the SPL plan, but were virtually inaccessible to all but the Penman expert.",
        "Support for managing the construction of SPL plans and accessing the necessary resources in a systematic and user-friendly manner was almost completely lacking."

        "SPLAT allows the user to create SPL plans in a supportive on-line environment: a graphical, menu-driven interface provides guidance on the allowable structure of SPL plans and access to the various Penman resources, such as the upper model and the generator itself.",
        "As well, SPLAT provides an extensible bank of representative sentences and their SPL structures, from which the user can create new sentence plans.",

        "SPLAT draws on some aspects of modelling theory in helping the user build SPL plans, specifically, by giving examples of SP L plan templates and prefabricated SPL plans.",
        "The templates supply most of the format specific to a particular kind of SPL plan, thus reducing the need for the user to memorize SPL-plan syntax.",
        "This feature also helps reduce the possibility of syntactic errors in plan building.",
        "In addition, having a template display the allowable components of a particular type of SPL plan guides the user in exploring the Penman system and in learning how the different parts of an SPL plan interact.",
        "Previously constructed SPL plans provide models that may be modified or incorporated into the new plan.",
        "This extensible example set, the sentence bank, provides positive examples of how to construct SPL-plan templates.",

      "text": [
        "The Penman upper model, a classification of various semantic concepts, has traditionally been divided into three disjoint concept hierarchies, a high-level split between the major semantic abstractions of English: processes, objects, and qualities.",
        "Processes can be thought of as verbs and other relational concepts, objects as nouns, and qualities as modifiers of processes and objects, i.e., adverbs and adjectives.",
        "However, early in the construction of sPLAT, it was noted that processes should be divided into two categories, those which modify the ideational content of a sentence and those which dictate the textual structure of a sentence.",
        "The former category describes most of the process hierarchy (i.e., verbs and most relations), whereas the latter describes the logical and rhetorical relations.",
        "Adding this category to SPLAT takes the upper model closer to the semantic classification described by [Matthiessen, 1991], with textual functions being separated from ideational functions."

        "The user need only fill in appropriate values on the selected template.",
        "As well, for processes, the template is not a static structure, but changes for each type of process according to its roles, which are retrieved from the underlying knowledge base.",
        "For example, the template for a verbal process will display the roles relevant to this type of process: sayer, addressee, and saying.",
        "For each kind of template, SPLAT provides most of the roles necessary to construct this type of SPL plan.",
        "Each template also provides a facility to add keywords and values that are not present on the form.",
        "The template also gives the user access to a number of different tools and resources, including the actual SPL that gets constructed, and the generator's output from the constructed SPL.",

        "To determine which sentence plan to use, the user searches the sentence bank with a pattern indicating the desired settings ISPLAT uses KPML [Bateman, 1995] version 0.8 or later to retrieve these values, as the KPML generator can easily return the full structure output of a sentence, whereas this information is much harder to retrieve from the standard Penman generator.",
