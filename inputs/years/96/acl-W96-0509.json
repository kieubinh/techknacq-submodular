        "Consider some possible ways in which S (the Speaker) may ask H (the Hearer) to bring her an ironing board that is located in the basement:",
        "(la) Bring me the ironing board in the basement.",
        "(lb) Bring me the ironing board from the basement.",
        "(lc) Go down to the basement and bring me the ironing board.",
        "Arguably, only in (la) is the location G of the ironing board (the basement) included in the NP whose head is ironing board.'",
        "In (lb), G is a modifier to the verb, from the basement.",
        "In (lc), G is just an expectation, derived from knowledge about performing a bring action, and from the relation between the two actions – go Di Eugenio and Penstein Rose were partially supported by Carnegie Mellon Faculty Development Fund # 1-13709.",
        "'In the appropriate context, (la) could also be interpreted as asking H to bring the ironing board into the basement, where S is (or will be, at the time H executes the action).",
        "We currently neglect this possibility.",
        "down to the basement is a substep in the plan that achieves bring S the ironing board.",
        "In these examples, the referring expression in the NP is not sufficient to uniquely identify the intended referent, but it is its linguistic context that adds other necessary constraints.",
        "This is the reason why we call these referring expressions distributed.",
        "To our knowledge, while many researchers have worked on generating referring expressions, e.g. [Appelt, 1985], [Kronfeld, 1990], [Dale, 1992], [Pattabhiraman and Cer-cone, 1990],2 distributed referring expressions have not been addressed yet.",
        "Note that the whole linguistic context must be taken into account while generating (lc): this is shown by the redundant and infelicitous",
        "(2) Go down to the basement and bring me the ironing board in the basement.",
        "Besides planning knowledge about the action that a certain verb denotes, lexical knowledge about that verb also comes into play.",
        "Consider",
        "the contrast between (1c), (3a) and (3b):",
        "(3a) Go down to the basement and take the ironing board uiith you (3b) Go down to the basement and put the ironing board away",
        "Arguably the same abstract plan – that we'll refer to as Fetch – may achieve bring x to y, take x to y and put x (away) into y: namely, go to where x is, get hold of it, and take it to y.",
        "However, these verbs differ from a lexical semantics point of view, and different expectations are generated in the three cases.",
        "In (1c) H expects the ironing board to be in the basement: the expectation is strong enough that even if a second ironing board is either in sight or salient in the discourse when S utters (1c).",
        "H won't ground3 the referent of the NP the ironing board to the one in sight (although he may presumably ask \"Isn't that the one you need?\"",
        ").",
        "In (3a), the NP the ironing board must refer in the current context, by being either visible or salient in the discourse.",
        "(31)) is yet a different case: H will either ground the NP the ironing board to the salient one, if there is one, otherwise he will delay such grounding until he is in the basement.",
        "In this paper, we describe our first steps toward generating such referring expressions.",
        "The implementation and experimentation are currently underway.",
        "2 Towards a solution Our solution is based on the integration of a principled discourse planner, LONGBOW [Young and Moore, 1994; Young et al., 1994], with a formalism that represents both lexical semantic knowledge about verbs and planning knowledge about the actions that the verbs denote [Di Eugenio, 1993: Di Eugenio and Webber, 1996].",
        "LONGBOW is an extension to partial-order causal link (POCL) planners, in which a plan 3 Note the difference between referring and grounding: an NP refers in the discourse, but it is grounded to an entity in the world.",
        "is represented as a set of partially-ordered steps connected by causal links.",
        "LONGBOW extends POCL planners by introducing action decomposition.",
        "The representation of a plan operator is divided into an action operator, that captures preconditions and effects, and a possibly empty set of decomposition operators: each decomposition operator represents a single layer expansion of a composite step, that provides a partial specification for the subplan thai achieves the parent step's effects given its preconditions.",
        "Representation Formalism.",
        "Di Eugenio's system is able to interpret examples such as (1c): it infers the relation between the actions in the two conjuncts' and the expectations under which the relation holds.",
        "Di Eugenio's system is crucially based on a formalism composed of two KBs.",
        "The first, the action taxonomy, stores lexical semantic knowledge about verbs – the semantic primitives are derived from Conceptual Structures [Jackendoff, 1990]; the second, the plan library, contains recipes [Pollack, 1986], i.e. common sense planning knowledge about the actions that the verbs in the action taxonomy refer to.",
        "Both are implemented in CLASSIC [Brachman et al., 1991], a description logic based system: the terms defined in the action taxonomy are used in the recipes in the plan library.",
        "Among the defined recipes is Fetch.",
        "Advantages of the two systems.",
        "First, LONGBOW keeps clear track of dependencies among steps by means of causal links.",
        "If stepi establishes an effect which is a precondition p2,i for step, a causal link is created between stepi and step2.",
        "If a third step step3 has a precondition p3,i which is identical to and if no intervening step has undone p2,i,5 then another causal link will be established between stepi and step3, thus keeping clear track of dependencies among steps.",
        "This clarity can be exploited e.g., to avoid generating the redundant 'Di Eugenio's algorithm actually works on purpose clauses, rather than on purposive conjunctions.",
        "'LONGBOW, being based on UCPOP, is able to resolve such threats when they arise.",
        "(2), as discussed below.",
        "Second.",
        "LONGBOW allows to distinguish between intLnded and.",
        "side effects: an effect is intended if it plays a causal role in a plan [Young and Moore, 1994].",
        "This is very important from a discourse planning point of view: first, the intentions of the speaker have been widely recognized as fundamental in both discourse interpretation and production [Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Moore and Pollack, 1993].",
        "Second, if H reveals that an intended effect of previous discourse was not achieved, S should try to achieve that effect again; this is not the case for side effects.",
        "Third, Di Eugenio's KR system allows expressing subtle lexical distinctions as the ones underlying bring and take.",
        "It also maintains a well specified connection between lexical definitions and the pertinent planning knowledge.",
        "Finally, there is a natural mapping of Di Eu-genio's recipe representation to LONGBOW's, which facilitates their integration."
