        "In this paper, I will be exploring techniques for automatically summarising texts, concentrating on selecting the content of the summary from a parsed (semantic) representation of the original text.",
        "Summarization is a particularly nice application for natural language generation because the original text can serve as the knowledge base for generating the summary.",
        "In addition, we only need to develop a lexicon limited to the words and senses in the original text (as long as we use the same words in the same context as the original text).",
        "This simplifies the generation task somewhat.",
        "However, summarization is not a trivial task.",
        "We must first analyze the original text using a robust grammar that can produce a reliable semantic interpretation of the text.",
        "To simplify this investigation, I will not tackle the many problems of NL analysis, but will use already parsed texts from the TAG Tree Bank (UPenn, 1995).",
        "I use a pen l script to convert the syntactic structures in this parsed corpus into a list of logical forms that roughly indicate the predicate-argument structure of each clause in the text.'",
        "We can generate a summary by choosing a subset of this list of LFs.",
        "However, choosing the right subset is not easy.",
        "The problem is how to judge which clauses are important.",
        "Sophisticated discourse analysis is needed in order to interpret the intentional and rhetorical structure of the original text and then prune it in the appropriate ways.",
        "IA parser which directly produces the pred-arg structure is probably preferable to this method.",
        "Note that the parser probably would not have to resolve all syntactic ambiguities in the the summarization task, because we can preserve the same ambiguities in the summary, or delete some of the problem phrases such as PPs in the summary anyway.",
        "However, discourse analysis is a hard task that requires an immense amount of world knowledge (Sparck-Jones, 1993).",
        "I investigate ways to generate a summary without full interpretation of the original text.",
        "I use Centering Theory to roughly segment the text, as described in the next section.",
        "Then, as described in section 3, a set of pruning rules based on centers and discourse relations are used to select the content of the summary.",
        "First, those segments that are about the most frequent centers of attention are selected, and then these segments are pruned by recognizing non-critical elaborations among the propositions.",
        "Another heuristic used is to select restatements among the propositions for the summary, since restatement is a good indicator of important information.",
        "The proposed summarization heuristics are tested out on a sample text in section 4; an implementation to test out these heuristics is in progress."

        "Centering Theory (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein, 1995) is a computational model of local discourse coherence which relates each utterance to the previous and the following utterances by keeping track of the center of attention.",
        "The most salient entity, the center of attention, at a particular utterance is called the backward looking center (Cb).",
        "The Cb is defined as the highest thematically ranked element in the previous utterance that also occurs in the current utterance.",
        "If there is a pronoun in the sentence, it is preferred to be Cb.",
        "Centering Theory can be used to segment a discourse by noting whether the same center of attention, Cb, is preserved from one ut",
        "terance to another.",
        "Basically, we can either CONTINUE to talk about the same entity or SHIFT to a new center.",
        "A SHIFT indicates the start of a new discourse segment.2 In the method that I am proposing, the original text is first divided into segments according to Centering Theory.",
        "Then, as described in the following sections, the segments which are about the most frequent Cb(s) in the text are selected for the summary, and then the discourse relations of elaboration and restatement are used to further prune and select information for the summary."

        "After the text has been segmented, we need to decide which of the discourse segments are important for the summary.",
        "The most prevalent discourse topic will play a big role in the summary.",
        "Thus, the most frequent Cb can be used to select the important segments in the text.",
        "I propose the following heuristic: Heuristic 1: Select those segments that are about the most frequent Cb in the text3 for the summary.",
        "Picking the most frequent Cb gives better results than simply picking the most frequent words or references as the most important topics in the text.",
        "For example, in the sample text (see Section 4) about a new electronic surveillance method being tried on prisoners that will allow them to be under house-arrest, \"wristband\" occurs just as frequently as \"surveillance/supervision\", however \"surveillance/supervision\" is a more frequent Cb than \"wristband\", and this reflects the fact that it is a more central topic in the text."

        "The heuristic used is: Heuristic 3: Select repeated or semantically synonymous LFs (i.e. predicate-argument relations) in the original text for the summary.",
        "One way to find restatements in the text is to simply search for repeated phrases.",
        "However, most good authors restate phrases rather simply repeating them.",
        "That is why I propose we search for repeated LFs rather than repeated words or phrases.",

        "Their semantic representations contain the propositions call(computer,prisoner) and plug-in(prisoner), after anaphora resolution and inferences such as that call(cornputer,prisoner) is equivalent to make (a computerized call,to a former prisoner's home).",
        "Notice that a simple trigram would not recognize \"that person answers by plugging in\" in (2)b as a restatement of the \"prisoner plugs in\".",
