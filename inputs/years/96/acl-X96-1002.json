        "The TIPSTER Program began in June 1989 just after the conclusion of the second Message Understanding Conference (MUC-2).",
        "The concept which the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) put forward at that time was based on the promising results of that conference and on the belief that the technologies being demonstrated at MUC for the automated handling of large volumes of text would be of great benefit to a variety of Government agencies.",
        "Following a series of meetings, agreement was reached for sharing the planning, funding, and execution of the program.",
        "Several major concepts were also outlined and accepted as central to TIPSTER's progress.",
        "Initially two phases were planned: two years of research and development into advanced algorithms, followed by two years of development of prototype/demonstration systems.",
        "Within these two phases, there would be separate focus on detection (retrieval and routing) and on extraction (understanding).",
        "Portability with regard to domain and language would be emphasized; evaluation of complete systems would be encouraged and scheduled periodically; and, as part of the baseline for these evaluations, the Government would develop a large corpora for the training and testing of corpus-based techniques as well as for system development and evaluation.",
        "Proposals were solicited in June of 1990, and eventually three contractors were selected to investigate different approaches to detection and another three were selected for extraction research."

        "The two language technologies which ARPA initially hoped to advance through the TIPSTER Program were Document Detection and Information Extraction.",
        "Document Detection includes both routing, which involves running static queries against a stream of new data, and retrieval, which involves running ad hoc queries against archival data.",
        "Prior to TIPSTER, most analysts faced with fmding essential information from large volumes of data used search systems based on Boolean keywords.",
        "These systems had been developed more than a decade earlier and typically had the following characteristics:",
        "• the user loses an unknown quantity of useful information because the system is unable to retrieve many of the relevant documents (= low recall); • the user must read a very large number of irrelevant documents which the system mistakenly retrieved (= low precision); • the user must scan the entire list of retrieved documents because a good document is just as likely to be at the end of the list as at the beginning (= no ranking or prioritization); • the user must generate by hand all variant spellings or alternate word choices because there are no built-in rules for adding variants; • the user has to understand how the system works and the syntax of queries in order to use the system (= hand built queries).",
        "Information Extraction is a technology in which pre-specified types of information are located within free text, extracted, and placed within a database.",
        "Notwithstanding prior ARPA and commercial support for the development of information extraction technology and MUC's positive impact, information extraction had been applied to the database update task as largely a manual procedure.",
        "This procedure was costly in terms of labor commitment and the training required and there was wide variance in the accuracy and consistency of the database content.",
        "The techniques typically only worked for English, and were difficult to port to new domains or even to extend within the current domains.",
        "Although a few automated information extraction systems had been deployed, they tended to be expensive both in terms of development and ongoing maintenance and were task specific with little reusability."

        "The TIPSTER Program officially began at a kickoff workshop held in September of 1991.",
        "The government reviewed the framework, objectives and plans for the following two years of work.",
        "The contractors described their specific approaches to detection and extraction and laid the groundwork for the future sharing of ideas and of software and data resources.",
        "The workshop included parallel working sessions for discussion of specific issues in the different areas of research, including details for addressing the different domains and different languages and the government's preparation of the data.",
        "The workshops were repeated at 6-month intervals for the duration of Phase I.",
        "Selected researchers from other ARPA Human Language Technology (HLT) programs were also invited.",
        "In connection with each of the workshops, uniform evaluations of system performance were conducted and were reported during the meetings.",
        "There were frequent exchanges of information among the government and contractors (with heavy use of email) and, by the end of the two years, a sizable catalog of shareable resources had been developed.",
        "Both the Message Understanding Conferences (MUC's), which preceded TIPSTER, and the Text REtrieval Conferences (TREC's) evaluated the state of the art and provided a major additional benefit in promoting text-processing research and development outside of the TIPSTER Text contracts, since they were organized by NRaD and NIST and advertised to a wider community.",
        "All of the TIPSTER Text contractors were required to participate in MUC or TREC, and MUC-5 and TREC-2, using TIPSTER evaluation techniques, were intentionally timed to coincide with the end of Phase I (the 24-month workshop) so as to provide a measure of the state of the art and identify good performers."

        "Based on a variety of lessons learned and encouraged by the results of TIPSTER Phase I, a four part program began to informally take shape.",
        "While continuing its traditional focus on advanced research and metrics-based evaluation, the need for a supporting architecture was recognized, along with the realization that many of the techniques developed were now sufficiently stable to be applied in an operational environment as demonstration projects."

        "Moreover, the system, not the user, can now automatically expand the queries to draw in more relevant documents (using concept based tools such as thesauri, or using a natural language description of the subject supplied by the user), and the documents are statistically ranked according to how well they match the query, thus improving the chances that the most useful documents will be near the top of the queue.",

        "• increased extensibility within domain with reduced user involvement • greater ease of portability to different domains • language independence and portability to new languages • task independence, solving multiple problems with reusable components • user-focused maintenance with minimal system developer involvement These systems provide the user with extraction tools which feature: • accurate and consistent database content results • minimal user intervention in reviewing extraction results",

        "From this, it was determined that an initial activity of Phase II would be the development of a common, open software architecture for the implementation of text-processing systems.",
        "This architecture was to facilitate sharing of the development tasks, transferring technology to actual applications, future R&D into improved algorithms, and continuous upgrading of systems which use the architecture.",
