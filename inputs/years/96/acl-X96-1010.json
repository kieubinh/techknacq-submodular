        "This work was performed jointly with GE CR&D [2] and shows promising results for large-scale integration; The work will be integrated for the TREC-5 evaluation.",
        "In addition, a range of experiments were performed to extend previous classification results [3] to routing, and to compare the resulting system with those used in TREC-4.",
        "The comparison will be described in the full paper and the results will be incorporated into a submission for the TREC-5 routing systems [4]"
