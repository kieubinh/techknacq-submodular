        "The results of this work, which incorporates much that has been learned from other TIPSTER participants using this method, increase our understanding of the role of syntax in Information Extraction and will be used to further our progress toward the goal of an extraction system which can be configured for a task by the user.",

        "One goal of the experiments is to contribute to the ongoing TIPSTER work in the use of combined Detection and Extraction systems.",
        "Another goal is to understand better what our users need from their retrieval systems and demonstrate an ability to provide retrieval improvements which are meaningful to them."
