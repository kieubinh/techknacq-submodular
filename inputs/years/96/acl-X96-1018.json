        "SUMMARY: The FTM Project is a joint project to build a prototype which retrieves and extracts against free (unstructured) text and to evaluate the prototype's usefulness for the National Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC).",
        "NDIC has strong needs for retrieval and extraction from large multi-source textual databases.",
        "SPONSORS: FTM is jointly sponsored by the Intelligence Systems Support Office (ISSO) of OASD/C3I, the National Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC) and the Office of Research and Development (ORD).",
        "The prototype is being built and evaluated at the Federal Intelligent Document Understanding Laboratory (FIDUL) in Tyson's Corners, VA, in an unclassified environment which replicates the hardware and software environment at NDIC.",
        "PARTICIPANTS: As of April 15, contractors include BETAC, PRC, IDI, HNC and Lockheed Martin.",
        "BETAC and IDI are providing the technical leadership, the integration and the GUI.",
        "PRC is providing TIPSTER expertise (from the TIPSTER SE/CM), and the testing and evaluation leadership (through FIDUL).",
        "HNC and InQuery (via Sovereign Software) are the first detection tools being integrated.",
        "Lockheed Martin is supplying the TIPSIER compliant document manager, document viewer and extraction system used on other TIPSTER demonstration projects.",
        "Information on lessons learned is shared among all the participants and sponsors.",
        "OBJECTIVES: The project objectives (from the Memorandum of Agreement) are to:",
        "• Prototype and demonstrate new technology which might be incorporated into production systems at NDIC.",
        "The NDIC",
        "OASIS/IDEF model and the current NDIC free text management architecture development will guide project activity.",
        "Results will be reported in monthly updates as well as in a final report.",
        "• Assemble a prototype which includes at least two TIPSIER detection tools working on source material which represents NDIC data (unclassified).",
        "• Expand the prototype to include at least two TIPSTER extraction tools, and use the extraction tools to load a database.",
        "The database will serve as the basis for analytical tools.",
        "• Expand the prototype to include conversion of hard copy documents (or the simulation of them), including degraded OCR data.",
        "• Develop (or acquire) a minimal user interface and other interfaces which are necessary to demonstrate integrated use of detection and extraction tools, and any other analysis tools to be demonstrated.",
        "• Develop test measures appropriate for testing these tools in an end-to-end system; test and evaluate the tools.",
        "• Use the TIPSTER Architecture in the development, and work closely with the TIPSIER Architecture Working Group (AWG) to improve the Architecture.",
        "• Explore the implications of the prototype for an end-to-end architecture, i.e., expanding the TIPSIER architecture to include end-to-end text processing (e.g., OCR, machine translation and database loading)."

        "Once the prototype is complete, other detection and extraction tools, GUI's, or alternative TIPSTER-compliant document managers could easily be added to the FTM prototype, providing an excellent unclassified environment for continuing to evaluate and demonstrate TIPSTER technology.",
        "Other possible modifications include fine-tuning the GUI to the NDIC users, and integrating the system into the NDIC environment."
