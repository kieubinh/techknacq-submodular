        "Glossary-Based Machine-Translation (GBMT) was first developed at CMU as part of the Pangloss project [Nirenburg 95; Cohen et al., 93; Nirenburg et al., 93; Frederking et al., 93], and a sizeable Spanish-English GBMT system was implemented.",
        "The Temple project has built upon this experience and extended the GBMT approach to other languages: Japanese, Arabic, and Russian.",
        "This experience with other languages has provided significant insights for the development of a versatile GBMT engine and for the use of off-the-shelf components for building a complete Machine-Translation System.",
        "Building a generic platform for integrating various Machine-Translation Systems in a single flexible user environment built upon the Tipster document architecture [Grishman 95], has also been a valuable experience for developing generic Natural Language Processing support systems.",
        "The user interface of the Temple Workstation includes a collection/document browser, the Tipster Editor for Documents, a generic translation function, access to lexical resources and context-sensitive help (Figure 1).",
        "The Temple Translator's Workstation design is original in that it combines the best features and eliminates the weaknesses of competing alternatives.",
        "On the one hand, like word-based glossers, it puts the user in control by allowing all core linguistic components used by the glossary-based engine to be accessed, modified and developed by the translator.",
        "On the other hand, like advanced MT systems, it uses reliable morphological processors and taggers, components which are relatively inexpensive, require little or no maintenance, and greatly enhance output quality.",
        "Analysts and translators can edit the raw translation using a multilingual editor (Figure 2).",
        "Source documents and their translations are managed using the Tipster Document Manager developed at CRL, which is also used as the architectural basis for integrating the system's components.",
        "The core components of the glossary-based engine are the bilingual dictionaries and the bilingual glossaries, which can easily include entries based on translators' own notes using a multilingual",
        "lexical database editor.",
        "It is this very database that is accessed at run time by the machine-translation system.",
        "Thus, when a translator modifies the lexical database (Figure 5), the modifications are immediately seen and used by the glossary-based engine in the machine-translation system.",
        "By contrast, in MART systems, dictionaries and glossaries are intended for human access only, and in almost all advanced MT systems, dictionaries (but not glossaries) can only be accessed and updated by a lexicologist with special training.",

        "Architecture The Temple prototype includes:",
        "• A GBMT engine that provides an automatic translation for each language pair.",
        "• Morphological analyzers, bilingual dictionaries, and bilingual glossaries for Spanish, Arabic, Japanese and Russian, and an English morphological generator [Penman 88].",
        "• A multilingual document editor (the Tipster Editor for Documents developed at CRL under the Norm project) used to browse documents and their translation.",
        "• A multilingual dictionary and glossary editor and utilities to parse and load flat dictionary (Machine-Readable Dictionaries) and glossary files into the system's lexical database.",
        "• Corpus-based utilities to automatize the acquisition of bilingual glossaries.",
        "• A Tipster Document Manager to support access and processing of user's documents.",
        "The Temple architecture is capable of handling a large number of character codesets through the use of the multilingual text library developed at CRL, which includes a multilingual string library, a multilingual widget library (use for example to develop the multilingual lexical editor) and the multilingual Tipster Editor for Documents.",
        "Tipster annotations are used as a lingua franca for representing linguistic information shared among various NLP components, such as morphological analyzers, taggers, bilingual dictionaries, the GBMT engine and the morphological generator.",
        "Each component has access to the common data structure through a unique interface provided by the Tipster Document Manager developed at CRL.",
        "NLP components are integrated in the architecture",
        "through TCL wrappers and filters that interface the component with the Temple representation stored as annotations in the Tipster Document Manager.",
        "Since most of the NLP components use linguistic representation that may widely differ, a single internal representation is used, e.g., for encoding part-of-speech, morphological features, etc.",
        "An NLP component interface to the document manager includes a mapping from the component representation to the Temple internal unique linguistic representation.",
        "One important outcome of the Temple project is the development of an architecture to support the reuse of NLP tools and resources:",
        "• Tools that are acquired from an external source, such as morphological analyzers, generators, or taggers, can be integrated in the system with a minimum of programming effort.",
        "• Heterogeneous linguistic resources are parsed and mapped to a common multilingual representation."

        "The GBMT engine is the core component of the workstation machine-translation function.",
        "The GBMT engine is parametrized by a bilingual glossary.",
        "The bilingual glossary is essentially a phrasal dictionary: a glossary entry contains a source phrase pattern, a set of corresponding target phrase patterns, and correspondences between variables in the source and in the target patterns (Figure 4).",
        "A GBMT system produces a phrase-by-phrase translation of the source text, falling back on a word-by-word translation when no phrase from the glossary matches the input.",
        "Thus, the size of the glossary and the flexibility of the pattern language are crucial for the production of better translations.The GBMT engine processes source tree structures in four steps:",
        "1.",
        "Glossary phrases are matched within sentence sub-trees (produced by a morphological analyzer and various taggers and segmenters, depending on the language); 2.",
        "Target phrases patterns are added in the tree for each source phrase match; 3.",
        "Morphological information is transferred from source tokens to target tokens; 4.",
        "Agreement binding information is generated for each source phrase.",
        "The tree structure manipulated by the GBMT engine contains both the source tree and the target tree which are simply source and target projections of the same data structure.",
        "Each target tree's lexical token is then sent to the morphological generator which produces the surface inflected form of each lexical token.",
        "Finally, the resulting fully instantiated tree structure is processed to produce a",

        "This list is formatted as a list of",

        "The translator can then use the glossary editor (Figure 5) to edit any entry flagged as incomplete.",
        "Using the glossary editor, the translator can also access bilingual dictionaries and use a variety of corpus-analysis tools, including a key word in context (KWIC) utility and a concordance tool.",
        "The glossary is clearly dependent on the kind of text included in the corpus being used, but dependency on a particular domain and type of text is a natural limitation of machine-translation systems, and a GBMT is no exception.",
        "However, building a small size glossary, such as the Arabic-English glossary which contains approximately 10,000 entries, is a relatively easy and fast task.",
        "The Arabic-English glossary, for example, was built in six man/months.",
        "Moreover, it is fairly easy to enhance the glossary when new texts are being processed: these new texts can be added to the corpus and the corpus can be processed again to provide a new list of potential glossary entries.",
