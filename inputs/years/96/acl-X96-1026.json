        "As a reinvention laboratory, the TIPSTER Program offers the Government not only an opportunity to foster large scale research and development, but also avenues to deploy the resulting enhanced technologies.",
        "The primary focus of TIPSTER Phase One was to advance the state-of-the-art in document detection and information extraction through multiple contract awards for different algorithmic approaches.",
        "Large scale text collections were tackled by the detection contractors, while domain and language portability were the challenge for the extraction contractors.",
        "The Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) and the Message Understanding Conferences (MUC) evaluated and baselined the technology developments.",
        "In contrast, TIPSTER Phase Two focused on creating an architecture to integrate the two technologies, and on deploying these technologies at multiple Government agencies.",
        "The deployments were called demonstration systems because their success in daily use would demonstrate the capabilities of the technologies to end-users.",
        "As a demonstration system, the goal was to port Phase One technologies to Chinese.",
        "The University of Massachusetts ported their INQUERY system with the development of HanQuery.",
        "BBN ported many of the major components of PLUM to Chinese and created Named Entity Identification capabilities.",
        "This paper describes program and technical issues identified during the joint Government-contractor effort and shares lessons learned in these two areas."

        "• There are different understandings of the definition of a word.",
        "For example, the Chinese expression for Beijing Institute of Physics may be legitimately represented in a Chinese lexicon as a single word and a Chinese-speaking user may also perceive it as a word.",
        "But if this expression is stored as a single term, then perfectly reasonable queries such as Physics institutes in China or Beijing technical institutes would fail to match that term.",
        "For the same reason, query-time segmentation should include the raw characters or at least the bigrams in the query.",
        "When the document index is character-based, then query-processing can determine proximity constraints based on word and phrase formation.",

        "Foreign names are represented phonetically in Chinese by a small set of Chinese characters.",
        "These characters may appear individually in Chinese words, but when they are combined to sound out non-Chinese names they form sequences that are not otherwise part of a Chinese lexicon.",
        "Chinese names present a different problem.",
        "There is a relatively small number of traditional Chinese surnames, but given names are essentially unrestricted combinations of two-character sequences.",

        "Ideally name recognition should be efficiently interleaved with segmentation, so that when segmentation fails on a short sequence, the name recognizers can be called.",
        "A makeshift substitute for this interaction is to run the name segmenter to identify guaranteed names (from name lexicon), run the segmenter, and then run the name recognizer again, this time to identify possible names from the still unsegmented characters."

        "The goal was to offer automatic or user-guided query expansion by supplying terms which are related in meaning to the query terms.",
        "In the past, this has been attempted with a general-purpose thesaurus or with a keyword list or topic navigation outline.",
        "The general purpose thesaurus fails by bringing in terms which are unrelated to the usage or the context at hand, and by neglecting other terms which are germane to a query term in context.",

        "It is possible that a combination of bigram treatment with segmentation would produce consistently good results.",

        "In many written languages, word boundaries are clearly marked by spaces.",
        "Chinese and Japanese, on the other hand, have no explicit indication of word boundaries; a reader must determine the writer's intended sequence of words, a process called word segmentation.",
        "Chinese segmentation seems inherently harder than Japanese, based on our experience.",
        "For instance, in Japanese, any change from Kanji characters to kana or to Romaji reliably signals a word boundary.",
        "Chinese has one uniform character set, and therefore does not provide as many easy boundaries.",
        "As a second example, consider foreign names.",
        "In Japanese, foreign names are typically transliterated into a sequence of easily identified kana characters, making recognition of foreign names rather easier than in Chinese, where foreign names are transliterated into the same character set as those used for common words.",
        "The current PLUM architecture for Chinese separates segmentation, part-of-speech analysis, and name extraction into 3 pipelined modules.",
        "There are ambiguities in segmentation that probably can't be resolved without including more context in the decision.",

        "Since neither capitalization nor ending analysis are available in Chinese, the only alternative to reducing the error rate in Chinese newswire is reducing the number of unknown words, e.g., by developing a list of words plus parts of speech.",
