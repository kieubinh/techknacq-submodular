        "GATE presents researchers and developers with an environment in which they can easily use linguistic tools and databases from a user-friendly interface.",
        "Different processes, such as tagging or parsing, can be applied to documents or collections and the results compared and analysed.",
        "System modules, or combinations of modules which form complete systems, e.g. IE, IR or MT systems, can be configured and evaluated (e.g. using the Parseval tools), then reconfigured and reevaluated, providing a kind of edit/compile/test cycle for LE components.",
        "GATE comprises three principal elements:",
        "• the GATE Document Manager (GDM) – a TIPSTER-compatible database for storing information about texts; • the GATE Graphical Interface (GGI) – an interface for launching processing tools on data and viewing and evaluating the results; • a Collection of Reusable Objects for Language Engineering (CREOLE) – a collection of wrap",

        "All communication between the system components goes through GDM, thereby insulating parts from each other and providing a uniform API (applications programmer interface) for manipulating the data produced by the system.'",

        "This facility supports hybrid systems, ease of upgrading and open systems-style module interchangeability.2 Figure 1 shows the launchpad for a MUC-6 IE system.",
        "Colours are used to indicate the status of each component with respect to the current document/collection: dark (red) components have already been run and their results are available for viewing; light (green) components have all their required inputs available and are ready to run, and grey (amber) components require a currently unavailable input before they can become runnable."
