        "Over the past few years, HNC has developed a neural network based, vector space approach to text retrieval.",
        "This approach, embodied in a system called MatchPlus, allows the user to retrieve information on the basis of meaning and context of a free text query.",
        "The MatchPlus system uses a neural network based, constrained self-organization technique to learn word stem interrelationships directly from a training corpus, thereby eliminating the need for hand crafted linguistic knowledge bases and their often substantial maintenance requirements.",
        "This paper presents results from recent enhancements to the basic MatchPlus concept.",
        "These enhancements include the development of a one step learning law that greatly reduces the amount of time and/or computational resources required to train the system, and the development of a prototype multilingual (English and Spanish) text retrieval system."

      "text": [
        "While the current MatchPlus learning law has proven to be effective in encoding relationships between words, it is computationally intensive and requires multiple passes through the training corpus.",
        "The purpose of the one step learning law is to approximate the behavior of the original learning law while performing only a single pass through the training corpus.",
        "The one step learning law uses a single pass through the training corpus to obtain desired dot product values for the set of trained context vectors.",
        "The desired dot product values are determined on the basis of information theoretic statistical relationships between co-occurring word stems found in the training corpus.",
        "Desired dot products are found such that words that tend to co-occur will have context vectors that point in similar directions while words that do not co-occur will have context vectors that tend to be orthogonal.",
        "These desired dot products are used to perform a quasilinear transformation on an initial set of quasi-orthogonal, high dimensional vectors.",
        "This vector transformation and subsequent renormalization results in a set of context vectors that represents the relationships between word stems in a near-optimal fashion.",
        "The time requirements for training this set of vectors scale as O(Nn) where N is the number of word stems in the vocabulary and n is the average number of word stems found to co-occur (and/or be related to) any given word stem (usually on the order of several hundred).",
        "This new learning law reduces the training time by a factor on the order of 100 over the original context vector learning law with little or no degradation in performance.",
        "Results can be improved even further by adjusting the dimension of the context vectors.",
        "HNC has also developed an approach to learning stem-level relationships across multiple languages and has used this approach to develop a prototype multilingual retrieval system.",
        "This technique, called \"symmetric learning\", is based upon the use of tie words, which provide connectivity between each language's portion of the context vector space.",
        "In the symmetric approach, learning is conducted using both languages simultaneously, thus removing any donor language biases.",
        "Tie words are used to connect the context vector space for multiple languages through a \"unified hash table\".",
        "The unified hash table provides the mechanism to translate a stem into an associated context vector.",
        "In the English-only MatchPlus system, this is a straight forward process.",
        "The stem in question is fed to the hashing function and the index is produced.",
        "The resulting index is the offset in the stem hash table.",
        "The content of that location in the hash table is a pointer to the context vector data structure.",
        "Using this approach (hash function collisions not withstanding), each unique stem results in a unique entry and thus a unique context vector.",
        "In the multilingual system, a tie word list is used to provide multiple references, one word stem from each language, for common context vectors.",
        "Context vector learning is performed in multiple languages",
        "simultaneously using multilingual training corpora.",
        "HNC has performed preliminary evaluation of an English-Spanish version of this system by examining stem trees for tie words and non-tie words.",

      "text": [
        "The HNC MatchPlus system was developed as part of the ARPA-sponsored TIPSTER text program.",
        "MatchPlus uses an information representation scheme called context vectors to encode similarity of usage.",
        "Other vector space approaches to text retrieval exist, but none embody the ability to learn word-level relationships [1-5].",
        "Key attributes of the context vector approach are as follows: During this effort, the initially proposed context vector approach using human defined coordinates and initial conditions was extended and refined to allow fully automatic generation of context vectors for text symbols (stems) based upon their demonstrated context of usage in training text.",
        "The MatchPlus system learns relationships at the stem level and then uses those relationships to construct a context vector representation for sets of symbols.",
        "For the text case, these sets of symbols are paragraphs, documents and queries.",
        "To start the learning process, each stem is associated with a random vector in the context vector space.",
        "Random unit vectors in high dimensional floating point spaces have a property that is referred to a \"quasi-orthogonality\"[6].",
        "That is, the expected value of the dot product between any pair of random context vectors selected from the set is approximately equal to zero (i.e. all vectors are approximately perpendicular to one another).",
        "This property of quasi-orthogonality is important because it serves as the initial condition for the context vector learning algorithm.",
        "The usage of the context vector technique is predicated upon the rule that symbols (stems) that are used in a similar context (exhibit proximate co-occurrence behavior) will have trained vectors that point in similar directions.",
        "Conversely, stems that never appear in a similar context will have context vectors that are approximately orthogonal.",
        "To achieve the desired representation, the context vector learning algorithm must take the context vectors for symbols that co-occur and move them toward each other.",
        "Symbols that do not co-occur are left in their quasi-orthogonal original condition.",
        "It is a basic tenet of the MatchPlus approach that \"words that are used in a similar context convey similar meaning\".",
        "Since the learning is driven by proximate co-occurrence of words, the learning results in a vector set where closeness in the space is equivalent to closeness in subject content.",
        "To perform learning, a learning window is used to identify local context.",
        "The window is \"slid\" through each document in the corpus.",
        "The window has 1 target stem and multiple neighbor stems.",
        "Once the context window has been determined, the learning rule of \"Move context vector for target in the direction of the context vector of the neighbors\" is applied.",
        "Once the correction is made, we move the learning window to next location and the learning operation is repeated.",
        "The equation for this learning is shown in Figure 1.",
        "TINew ed y E (ay.",
        "_ eld •Nu).",
        "N;, where: 7;New = Context vector of target i after update = Context vector of target i before update y = Adjustment step size Context vector for neighbor j of target i = Desired context vector dot product for target i and neighbor j",
        "• All stem vectors are of length 1 (unit vectors).",
        "In this paradigm, only the direction of the vector carries information.",
        "• Fully trained vectors have the property that words that are used in a similar context will have vectors that point in similar directions as measured by the dot product.",
        "• Words that are never used in a similar context will retain their initial condition of quasi-orthogonality.",
        "That is, approximately orthogonal with a dot product of approximately zero.",
        "• Trained context vectors result in a concept space where similarity of direction corresponds to similarity of meaning.",
        "• No human knowledge is required for training to occur.",
        "Only free text examples are needed.",
        "• The algorithm determines the coordinate space of the context vectors.",
        "When the training is complete, \"words that are used in a similar context will have their associated vectors point in similar directions\".",
        "Conversely, words that are never used in a similar context will have vectors that are approximately orthogonal.",
        "At the summary level, the MatchPlus system translates free text into a mathematical representation in a meaningful way.",
        "Note that the MatchPlus approach does not use any external dictionaries, thesauri or knowledge bases to determine word vector relationships.",
        "These relationships are learned automatically using only the text examples provided for learning.",
        "The result of the learning procedure is a vocabulary of stem context vectors that can be used for a variety of applications including document retrieval [7], routing [8], document clustering and other text processing tasks.",
        "Once the stem learning is complete, it is possible to \"query\" the vector set to determine the nature of the learned relationships.",
        "To perform this operation, the user selects a \"root\" word and the trained context vector for that word is determined by a table lookup in the context vector vocabulary.",
        "MatchPlus computes the dot product of every other word vector in the vocabulary to the selected word.",
        "The resulting dot products are sorted by magnitude where larger means closer in usage.",
        "Sets of words (text passages and queries) and documents can also be represented by context vectors in the same information space.",
        "Document context vectors are derived as the inverse document frequency-weighted sum of the context vectors associated with words in the document.",
        "Document context vectors are normalized to prevent long documents from being favored over short documents.",
        "The resulting document context vectors have the property that documents that discuss similar themes will have context vectors that point in similar directions.",
        "It is this property that translates the problem of assessment of similarity of content for text into a geometry problem.",
        "Documents that are similar are close in the space and dissimilar documents are far away.",
        "Additionally, it should be noted that all document vectors are unit length.",
        "This prevents system biases in retrieval due to document length."
