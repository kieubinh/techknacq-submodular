        "We need a way for the user to supply a mapping from strings in the text to entries in the template.",
        "This can be accomplished by having a two-window editor; the text being annotated or analyzed is in one window, the template in the other.",
        "The user marks a string in the text, and then either copies the string to a template entry or enters the set fill that is triggered by the string.",
        "Such a system is first of all a convenient text editor for filling data bases from text by hand.",
        "But if the system is trying to deduce the implicit rules the user is responding to to make the fills, then the system is automatically constructing an information extraction system as well.",
        "We have implemented a preliminary experimental version of such a system, and are currently developing a more advanced one.",
        "We assume that the user somehow provides a mapping from text strings to template entries and that the semantics of the rule is completely specified by such a mapping.",

        "For example, if the user has marked the string \"the union resumed talks with the company\" and placed \"the union\" in one slot and \"the company\" in another, then Phase n is the Complex Phrase Recognizer, since it provides those noun groups as independent objects.",
        "On the other hand, if the string is \"the union's resumption of talks with the company\", then the Complex Phrase Recognizer will not do, since it combines at least \"the union\" and possibly \"the company\" into the same complex noun group as \"resumption\" .",
        "We have to back up one more phase, to the Basic Phrase Recognizer, to get these noun groups as independent elements.",
        "In the current version, we determine what Phase n + 1 rule matches the entire string and then construct as general as possible a specialization of that rule.",

        "Under the auspices of the Tipster II program, we have developed in FASTUS a mature, effective, efficient, robust information extraction system.",
        "We have made it substantially easier to use in new domains by implementing the FastSpec declarative specification language and the compile-time transformations, and we believe our work on adapting rules from examples will make the system yet easier to use in new domains.",
        "We have integrated the system into the developing uniform, modular Tipster architecture.",
        "In our view the principal current problems are the need to handle broader domains and applications, the need to continue to make new domains easier to implement, and the need to use the technology in a wide variety of new applications."
