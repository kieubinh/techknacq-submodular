        "The TIPSTER Architecture has been designed to enable a variety of different text applications to use a set of common text processing modules.",
        "Since user interfaces work best when customized for particular applications, it is appropriator that no particular user interface styles or conventions are described in the TIPSTER Architecture specification.",
        "However, the Computing Research Laboratory (CRL) has constructed several TIPSTER applications that use a common set of configurable Graphical User Interface (GUI) functions.",
        "These GUIs were constructed using CRL's TIPSTER User Interface Toolkit (TUIT).",
        "TUIT is a software library that can be used to construct multilingual TIPSTER user interfaces for a set of common user tasks.",
        "CRL developed TUIT to support their work to integrate TIPSTER modules for the 6 and 12 month TIPSIER II demonstrations as well as their Oleada and Temple demonstration projects.",
        "This paper briefly describes TUIT and its capabilities."

        "The GUI is unique in that it provides methods for input, edit, and display of text in multiple languages.",
        "TED is being used in several government sponsored projects at CRL, and is appropriate for other projects that require multilingual text display and edit capabilities.",
        "Before TUIT, TIPSTER applications that needed multilingual text display and edit capabilities required developers to use the Motif API and Xmat API, and write all TIPSTER document browsing functions using the Motif and Xmat libraries.",
        "Ease of incorporating and configuring new applications improve significantly with the TUIT library with its own API as shown in Figure 1.",
        "Applications are able to call Xmat library functions on the created widgets as well.",
