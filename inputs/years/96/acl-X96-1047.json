        "One receives a description of a class of events to be identified in the text; for each of these events one must fill a template with information about the event.",
        "The template has slots for information about the event, such as the type of event, the agent, the time and place, the effect, etc.",

        "• For sense tagging, the annotators found that in some cases Wordnet made very fine distinctions and that making these distinctions consistently in tagging was very difficult.",
        "• For predicate-argument structure, practically every new construct beyond simple clauses and noun phrases raised new issues which had to be collectively resolved.",
        "Beyond these individual problems, it was felt that the menu was simply too ambitious, and that we would do better by concentrating on one element of the SemEval triad for MUC-6; at a meeting held in June 1994, a decision was made to go with coreference.",
        "In part, this reflected a feeling that the problems with the coreference specification were the most amenable to solution.",
        "It also reflected a conviction that coreference identification had been, and would remain, critical to success in information extraction, and so it was important to encourage advances in coreference.",
        "In contrast, most extraction systems did not build full predicate-argument structures, and word-sense disambiguation played a relatively small role in extraction (particularly since extraction systems operated in a narrow domain).",

        "We therefore selected Wall Street Journal texts from 1987, 1988, and 1989 which had already been distributed as part of the \"ACL/DCI\" CD-ROM and which were available at nominal cost from the Linguistic Data Consortium.",
