        "Each restriction rule is attached to a particular nonterminal in the right-hand side of one or more context-free rules.",
        "During parsing the restriction fires immediately after that non-terminal has been constructed, testing the subtree at that point for well-formedness, or attaching an attribute value for use later on.",

        "One of the attributes composed by PROTEUS during parsing is an operator-operand regularized form intended to serve as the representation to which semantic selection and interpretation rules can be applied.",
        "The TINSEL semantic interpreter (Wan-chope, 1990) applies case-frame rules and selection restrictions to the PROTEUS regularized output.",
        "The interpreter can either be invoked post-parse (applied top-down to each candidate sentential regularization) or interleaved with PROTEUS, testing each individual clausal or noun phrase immediately upon construction.",
        "In interleaved mode, if a node's regularization does not pass the case-frame or selection criteria then the node is not added to the chart, which can prune the search space and reduce parsing time considerably.",
        "If the node does pass selection, its regularization is augmented with the relevant semantic class and role information, becoming an intermediate semantic representation suitable for further processing such as reference resolution and quantifier scoping.",
        "The TINSEL interpreter is primarily model-driven, which is to say that the case frame behavior of each predicate in the domain must be explicitly encoded in a declarative semantic representation.",
        "As a result we have not attempted to incorporate any generalized case-frame rules into the interpreter itself, so TINSEL is not bound to any particular theory of thematic relations, giving the system devel",
        "oper maximum flexibility in devising useful semantic representations.",
        "TINSEL does contain some general rules for handling noun phrases, however, such as automatically attempting to interpret certain prepositional phrases as implicit BE-verb relative clauses (the hammer on the table the hammer which is on the table), etc."

        "NAUTILUS was first used in the Eucalyptus (Wauchope, 1994) spoken language interface to the KOALAS Airborne Early Warning C2 simulation (Barrett and Aldrich, 1990).",
        "The original KOALAS interface consisisted of a mouse-sensitive simulated radar screen with a conventional graphical user interface composed of command pushbuttons, dialog boxes and scrolling display windows.",
        "Our objective in Eucalyptus was to make the same command and data access functionality available via natural language, integrated as much as possible with the graphical interface to allow multimodal interactions.",
        "For example, a NL command to the system might result in the display of the same dialog box used in the corresponding GUI command, but with the dialog's data fields fully or partially filled from the NL input;",
        "the user can then fill in any remaining empty fields and issue final acceptance either graphically or verbally.",
        "To that end, the command-oriented Interface Functions in Eucalyptus consist largely of calls to the base functions underlying the KOALAS GUI.",
        "Eucalyptus also includes deictic reference, allowing the user to click on one or more radar blips or screen locations while speaking verbal references like this fighter or these CAP stations.",
        "When a mouse click occurs, NAUTILUS asks the application for the identities of all the objects located at or near the mouse event, and then takes the subset of those objects that match the semantics of the verbal phrase (which can be determined from predicate context as well: for example the word here in Have fighter 1 refuel here necessarily refers to a tanker aircraft).",
        "To avoid the problems of time-correlating speech with graphical input and distinguishing anaphora from deixis, we reserve the words this, these and here for deictic reference and that, those and there for anaphoric reference, and allow no more than one plural deictic reference per utterance.",
        "Database query is used both in answering explicit interrogatives (Which fighters aren't holding CAP station?)",
        "as well as dereferencing qualified NPs (moving aircraft).",
        "The system can also interpret NP sentence fragments as followup commands or queries by substituting the NP into the semantically relevant slot of the prior utterance's logical form.",
        "As originally designed, FOCAL expected a closed-world model of all domain objects to be available at startup time.",
        "This had to be modified somewhat in Eucalyptus since the KOALAS world includes hypothetical objects (suspected threat aircraft) which the user and system can create and destroy at will.",
        "References to hypothetical entities are resolved by having FOCAL dynamically consult the application database for the current object population at the time the phrase was uttered.",
        "The core syntactic grammar of about 150 context-free rules and 50 restriction rules developed for Eucalyptus has been reused in all the other NAUTILUS projects.",
        "Each one has augmented it with a few dozen additional rules for handling application-specific constructs like station two sector one (Eucalyptus), latitude forty degrees north longitude ninety five degrees west (InterVR), the town of Leipzig (InterLACE), and thirty degrees left (InterROB).",
        "The Eucalyptus lexicon totals about 425 words, many of them unused morphological variants generated automatically by the PROTEUS lexical macros; by comparison, the vocabulary for the speech recognition front end is only 260 words.",
        "Total input coverage is on the order of 100 million utterances, deliberately high to test the speech system's ability to detect a wide variety of noun phrase determiners.",
        "Unlike the NAUTILUS grammar, the speech grammar excludes iteration and recursion (such as compounding) to maintain a reasonable level of recognition accuracy.",
        "An experimental addition of relative clauses to the speech grammar was \"productive\" only in the linguistic sense, since the resulting exponential increase in grammar size caused recognition rates to drop to unacceptable levels."

        "We did not have time or resources to tackle the problem of resolving referents based on visual context (for example having that helicopter refer to the one nearest the center of the user's field of view), but we are currently investigating the interaction of vision and language in the InterROB project, to be discussed shortly.",
        "The InterVR speech component has a vocabulary comparable in size to that of Eucalyptus but a more constrained input range (about 1 million utterances) mainly due to a less liberal variety of NP determiners.",

        "might resolve to a road.",
        "The InterLACE domain necessitated extending FUNTRAN to generate proper logical forms for spatial comparatives and superlatives (Is Wurzen closer than Grimma?, the closest lake to Eilenburg) and implicit and explicit reflexives (Do these roads cross [each other]?",
        "), and also introduced direct address (Tank 1, head north) and iterative arguments to navigation commands (Head north on road E2 for 2 km to Wurzen).",
