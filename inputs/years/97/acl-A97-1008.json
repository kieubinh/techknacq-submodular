        "As with human-human interaction, spoken human-computer dialog will contain situations where there is miscommunication.",
        "In experimental trials consisting of eight different users, 141 problem-solving dialogs, and 2840 user utterances, the Circuit Fix-It Shop natural language dialog system misinterpreted 18.5% of user utterances.",
        "These miscommunications created various problems for the dialog interaction, ranging from repetitive dialog to experimenter intervention to occasional failure of the dialog.",
        "One natural strategy for reducing the impact of miscommunication is selective verification of the user's utterances.",
        "This paper reports on both context-independent and context-dependent strategies for utterance verification that show that the use of dialog context is crucial for intelligent selection of which utterances to verify."

        "Recent advances in speech recognition technology have raised expectations about the development of practical spoken natural language (NL) interfaces.",

        "In particular, the ability to obtain computerized telephone assistance via a robust NL interface could provide ready access to information that currently requires direct human interaction.",

        "Miscommunication can arise at several different levels, ranging from discourse structure and speech act misunderstanding (McRoy and Hirst, 1995) to misinterpretation due to misrecog-nition of a speaker's words.",
        "We report on a study that focuses on this latter type of miscommunication.",
        "While speech recognizer performance in controlled environments has improved dramatically in the past decade, recognition errors still occur.",
        "Furthermore, current speech recognizers cannot perform optimally in uncontrolled environments such as telephone interactions.",
        "We examine the strategy of verification subdialogs for resolving miscommunications due to misrecog-nition.",
        "We first review how verification subdialogs can increase the rate of correct interpretation from 81.5% to 97.4% but at a cost of unnecessary verifications approximately once every five user utterances.",
        "However, by adopting a context-dependent strategy for deciding when to use a verification subdialog, we can maintain an understanding rate of 95.3% while reducing the number of unnecessary verifications by over one half.",
        "After describing the technique of selective utterance verification, this paper gives an overview of the dialog system environment that provides the data used in testing various strategies for selective utterance verification, the Circuit Fix-It Shop.",
        "The paper concludes with a description of both context-independent and context-dependent strategies for selective utterance verification and reports on the comparative results of dialog simulations using these strategies.",

        "For Strategy 1 we explored the impact of raising and lowering the threshold on the over and under-verification rates.",
        "Not surprisingly, there was a tradeoff.",
        "As the threshold was raised, more utterances are verified, resulting in fewer under-verifications but more over-verifications.",
        "Lowering the threshold had the opposite impact.",
        "In fact, using just the strategy of lowering the threshold to reduce the over-verification rate to 9.3% causes the under-verification rate to rise to 8.0%.",
        "In contrast, the new context-dependent strategy, Strategy 3, achieves an over-verification rate of 7.6%, but the under-verification rate is only 4.7%.",
        "Clearly, the use of dialog context in the verification subdialog decision rule improves system performance.",
        "Nevertheless, a small set of under-verifications remains.",
        "Are there any possibilities for further reductions in the under-verifications without a substantial increase in the over-verification rate?",
        "Strategy",
        "1.",
        "Parse Cost Only 2.",
        "Context Only 3.",
        "Parse Cost/Context Combination 4.",
        "Domain-Dependent Exceptions",
        "An analysis of the 133 under-verifications that occur with the new strategy indicates that while some of the under-verifications are due to deficiencies in the grammar, there is a a core group of under-verifications where misrecognition of the speaker's words is impossible to overcome.",
        "Incorrect recognition of digits, lost content words, and misrecognized content words can cause the system to have high confidence in an incorrect interpretation.",
        "One approach that may prove helpful with this problem is the use of speech recognition systems that provide alternate hypotheses for the speech signal along with scoring information.",
        "Another possibility is word by word verification of the speaker input (see (Baber and Hone, 1993)), but such a strategy is too time-consuming and tedious for general spoken natural language dialog, especially when the user does not have access to a visual display of what the system hypothesizes was spoken.",
        "In general, experimental trials to observe subject reaction to verification subdialogs are needed.",
        "In conclusion, while useful, there appear to be limits to the effectiveness of verification subdialogs.",
        "Consequently, strategies for delayed detection and resolution of miscommunication (e.g. (McRoy and Hirst, 1995), (Brennan and Hulteen, 1995), and (Lambert and Carberry, 1992)) become necessary and remain an area of continued investigation.",
        "These include both computer-initiated as well as user-initiated strategies."
