        "Heeman and Allen (1994) present an algorithm that detects and corrects modification and abridged repairs.",
        "The algorithm uses some repair patterns to capture potential repairs.",
        "These patterns are built based on the identification of word fragments, editing terms', and word correspondences between the repaired segment",
        "and the repairing segment'.",
        "The resulting potential repairs are then passed to a statistical filter that judges the proposal as either fluent speech or an actual repair.",

        "Nakatani and Hirschberg (1993a; 1993b) investigate the detection of the interruption point of speech repairs based on this line.",
        "The cues that they found are the occurrence of a filled pause, the presence of a word fragment, the energy peaks in each word and other features such as accent.",
        "However, they do not address the problem of correcting speech repairs.",
        "In other words, they do not determine which words are undesired.",
        "These approaches cannot be adopted to deal with Chinese speech repairs for the following reasons.",
        "First, a Chinese sentence is composed of a string of characters without any word boundaries.",
        "In other words, it is necessary to segment Chinese sentence before tagging and parsing (Chen and Liu, 1992; Sproat, et al., 1994; Chen and Lee, 1996).",
        "Repairs make segmentation and text-first approach more difficult.",
        "Second, Chinese repairs may not always have an editing terms between a repaired segment and a repairing segment.",
        "In other words, editing terms do not have much effect in Chinese repair processing.",
        "Third, duplicate constructions (e.g., g Xi* (bang 1 bang 1 mang2, help), tiTMAFR (yan2 jiu4 yan2 jiu4, study)) generated by repeating words or phrases in Chinese utterances are used very often, but they do not always initiate a repair.",
        "That is, a simple pattern matching mechanism cannot be workable.",
        "Forth, the Chinese speech repairs may be initiated at various syntactic environment (Chui, 1995), e.g., before the subject, during the subject, after the subject and before the verb, during the verb, during a direct object, during a prepositional phrase, during subordination, and so on.",
        "The variety makes the identification of Chinese speech repairs more troublesome.",
        "Because the repairs introduce much noise in language processing, we cannot defer the task of repair processing to the latter stages.",
        "This paper employs acoustic and prosodic information to correct Chinese repetition repairs.",

        "Section 2 defines four major types of speech repairs.",
