        "A major concern in corpus based approaches is that the applicability of the acquired knowledge may be limited by some feature of the corpus.",
        "In particular, the notion of text 'domain' has been seen as a major constraint on the applicability of the knowledge.",
        "This is a crucial issue for most application systems, since most systems operate within a specific domain and we are generally limited in the corpora available in that domain.",
        "There has been considerable research in this area (Kittredge and Hirschman, 1983) (Grishman and Kittredge, 1986).",
        "For example, the domain dependence of lexical semantics is widely known.",
        "It is easy to observe that usage of the word 'bank' is different between the 'economic document' domain and the 'geographic' domain.",
        "Also, there are surveys of domain dependencies concerning syntax or syntax-related features (Slocum, 1986) (Biber, 1993) (Karl-gren, 1994).",
        "It is intuitively conceivable that there are syntactic differences between 'telegraphic mes-sages' and 'press report', or between 'weather forecast sentences' and 'romance and love story'.",
        "But, how about the difference between 'press report' and `romance and love story'?",
        "Is there a general and simple method to compare domains?",
        "More importantly, shall we prepare different knowledge for these two domain sets?",
        "In this paper, we describe two observations and an experiment which suggest an answer to the questions.",
        "Among the several types of linguistic knowledge, we are interested in parsing, the essential component of many NLP systems, and hence domain dependencies of syntactic knowledge.",
        "The observations and an experiment are the following:",

        "The definition of domain will dominate the performance of our experiments, so it is very important to choose a proper corpus.",
        "However, for practical reasons (availability and time constraint), we decided to use an existing multi-domain corpus which has naturally acceptable domain definition.",
        "In order to acquire grammar rules in our experiment, we need a syntactically tagged corpus consisting of different domains, and the tagging has to be uniform throughout the corpus.",
        "To meet these requirements, the Brown Corpus (Francis and Kucera, 1964) on the distribution of PennTreeBank version 1 (Marcus et.al., 1995) is used in our experiments.",
        "The corpus consists of 15",
        "domains as shown in Appendix A; in the rest of the paper, we use the letters from the list to represent the domains.",
        "Each sample consists of about the same size of text in terms of the number of words (2000 words), although a part of the data is discarded because of erroneous data format.",
        "For the parsing experiment, we use 'Apple Pie Parser' (Sekine, 1995) (Sekine, 1996).",
        "It is a probabilistic, bottom-up, best-first search, chart parser and its grammar can be obtained from a syntactically-tagged corpus.",
        "We acquire two-non-terminal grammars from corpus.",
        "Here, `two-non-terminal grammar' means a grammar which uses only 'S' (sentence) and `1\\IP' (noun phrase) as actual non-terminals in the grammar and other grammatical nodes, like 'VP' or 'PP', are embedded into a rule.",
        "In other words, all rules can only have either 'S' or `NP' as their left hand-side symbol.",
        "This strategy is useful to produce better accuracy compared to all non-terminal grammar.",
        "See (Sekine, 1995) for details.",
        "In this experiment, grammars are acquired from the corpus of a single domain, or from some combination of domains.",
        "In order to avoid the unknown word problem, we used a general dictionary to supplement the dictionary acquired from corpus.",
        "Then, we apply each of the grammars to some texts of different domains.",
        "We use only 8 domains (A,B,E,J,K,L,N and P) for this experiment, because we want to fix the corpus size for each domain, and we want to have the same number of domains for the non-fiction and the fiction domains.",
        "The main objective is to observe the parsing performance based on the grammar acquired from the same domain compared with the performance based on grammars of different domains, or combined domains.",

        "First, we investigate the syntactic structure of each domain of the Brown corpus and compare these for different domains.",
        "In order to represent the syntactic structure of each domain, the distribution of partial trees of syntactic structure is used.",
        "A partial tree is a part of syntactic tree with depth of one, and it corresponds to a production rule.",
        "Note that this partial tree definition is not the same as the structure definition used in the parsing experiments described later.",
        "We accumulate these partial trees for each domain and compute the distribution of partial trees based on their frequency divided by the total number of partial trees in the domain.",
        "For example, Figure 1 shows the five most frequent partial trees (in the format of production rule) in domain A (Press: Re",
        "portage) and domain P (Romance and love story).",

        "Then, for each pair of domains, cross entropy is computed using the probability data.",

        "We select the partial trees which satisfy the following",
        "two conditions: 1.",
        "Frequency of the partial tree in a domain should be 5 times greater than that in the entire corpus 2.",

        "Each grammar is acquired from roughly the same size (24 samples except L with 21 samples) of corpus.",

        "The grammar of non-fiction and fiction domains are created from corpus of 6 samples each from 4 domains.",
        "Then text of each domain is parsed by the four types of grammar.",

        "For non-fiction domain texts (A, B, E and J), the performance of the fiction grammar is notably worse than that of the same domain grammar or the same class grammar.",
        "In contrast, the performance on some fiction domain texts (K and L) with the non-fiction grammar is not so different from that of the same domain.",
        "Here, we can find a relationship between these results and the cross entropy observations.",
        "The cross entropies where any of the fiction domains are models and any of the non-fiction domains are test are the highest figures in the table.",
        "This means that the fiction domains are not suitable for modeling the syntactic structure of the non-fiction domains.",
        "On the other hand, the cross entropies where any of the non-fiction domains are",

        "For example, in the cross comparison experiment, we have seen that domains K, L and N are very close.",
        "So it may be plausible to say that the grammar of the fiction domains is mainly representing K, L and N and, because it covers wide syntactic structure, it gives better performance for each of these domains.",
        "This could be the explanation that the grammar of fiction domains are superior to the own grammar for the three domains.",
        "In other words, it is a small sampling problem, which can be seen in the next experiment, too.",
        "Because only 24 samples are used, a single domain grammar tends to covers relatively small part of the language phenomena.",
        "On the other hands, a corpus of similar domains could provide wider coverage for the grammar.",

        "The graph between the size of training corpus and accuracy is generally an increasing curve with the slope gradually flattening as the size of the corpus increases.",

        "The results for the press reportage is not so obvious, but the same tendencies can be observed.",
        "In terms of the relationship between the size of training corpus and domain dependency, we will compare the performance of the grammar acquired from 24 samples of the same domain (we will call it 'baseline grammar'), and that of the other grammars.",
        "In the press reportage domain, one needs a three to four times bigger corpus of all domains or non-fiction domains to catch up to the performance of the baseline grammar.",
        "It should be noticed that a quarter of the non-fiction domain corpus and one eighth of the all domain corpus consists of the press report domain corpus.",
        "In other words, the fact that the performance of the baseline grammar is about the same as that of 92 samples of the non-fiction domains means that in the latter grammar, the rest of the corpus does not improve or is not harmful for the parsing performance.",
        "In the romance and love story domain, the wide variety grammar, in particular the fiction domain grammar quickly catch up to the performance of the baseline grammar.",
        "It needs only less than twice size of fiction domain corpus to achieve the performance of the baseline grammar.",
        "These two results and the evidence that fiction domains are close in terms of structure indicate that if you have a corpus consisting of similar domains, it is worthwhile to include the corpus in grammar acquisition, otherwise not so useful.",
