        "1. a morphotactic description of the words to be processed as well as 2. a set of two-level morphonological (or spelling) rules.",

        "The target words are correctly segmented during phase one as: level rule compiler KGEN (developed by Nathan Miles) was used to compile the acquired rules into the state tables required by PC-KIMMO.",
        "Both PC-KIMMO and KGEN are available from the Summer Institute of Linguistics.",
        "Note that the prefix e+ is computed for all the input target words, while all but ekhaya (a correct alternative of ekhayeni) have +ni as a suffix.",
        "From this segmented data, phase two correctly computes 24 minimal context rules: [24] <#.",

The vertical bar (\"I\") is the traditional two-level notation which indicate the disjunction of two (or more) contexts.",
        "The five rules and the single rule of the special pair i:0 in Example 24 can be merged in a similar way.",
        "In this instance, the context of the rule (+:0 _) needs to be added to some of the contexts of the 4 rules of i:O.",

        "Afrikaans plurals are almost always derived with the addition of a suffix (mostly – e or – s) to the singular form.",

        "Some of these words have two plural forms, which introduces ambiguity in the word mappings: One plural is formed with a Latin suffix ( – a) (e.g. emetikum emetika) and one with an indigenous suffix ( – s) (emetikum emetikums).",
        "Allomorphs occur as well, for example – ens is an allomorph of the suffix – s in bed + s beddens.",
        "During phase one, all but eleven (0.3%) of the 3935 input word pairs were segmented correctly.",
        "To facilitate the evaluation of phase two, we define a simple rule as a rule which has an environment consisting of a single context.",
        "This is in contrast with an environment consisting of two or more contexts disjuncted together.",

        "These 44 <#,- rules analyze and generate the 3935 word pairs 100% correctly.",
        "The total number of feasible pairs in the 3935 final input edit strings is 49657.",
        "In the worst case, all these feasible pairs should be present in the rule contexts to accurately model the sound changes which might occur in the input pairs.",
        "However, the actual result is much better: Our process acquires a two-level rule set which accurately models the sound changes with only 4.5% (2227) of the input feasible pairs.",
        "To obtain a prediction of the analysis and generation accuracy over unseen words, we divided the 3935 input pairs into five equal sections.",
        "Each fifth was held out in turn as test data while a set of two-level rules was learned from the remaining four-fifths.",
        "The average recognition accuracy as well as the generation accuracy over the held out test data is 93.9%."
