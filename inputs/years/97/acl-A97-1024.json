        "Like most other big corporations today, IBM is interested in cost-effective, yet high-quality information dissemination.",
        "Every year, many pages of on-line and printed documentation are produced.",
        "No matter what part of the world the documentation is written in, it is normally first written in English, and then translated into all the other supported languages.",
        "IBM has developed a number of tools to help writers cope with this task of information development.",
        "In this paper, we describe EasyEnglish, a tool that helps writers produce clearer and simpler English by pointing out ambiguity and complexity.",
        "Where appropriate, EasyEnglish makes suggestions for rephrasings.",
        "The EasyEnglish system can be viewed as a \"grammar checker++\", in that standard grammar checking facilities such as spell-checking, word count (sentence length), and detection of passive constructions are available in addition to the checks for ambiguity.",
        "Furthermore, facilities for user-defined controlled vocabulary are available.",
        "Totally, there are currently about forty checks.",
        "EasyEnglish is part of IBM's internal Information Development Workbench (IDWB), an SGML-based document creation and document management system.",
        "ArborText's Adept editor is used with IDWB 1.",
        "EasyEnglish summarizes the problems encountered in a given document by giving an overall rating, the Clarity Index (CI).",
        "The CI has to be in a certain range before the document can be accepted for publication.",
        "EasyEnglish combines features from both standard grammar checkers and Controlled Language (CL) compliance checkers with checks for structural ambiguity in a way that we believe is general enough to be useful for any writer., not just technical writers.",
        "It has been claimed that the restrictions found in CLs mostly reflect the inadequacies of the MT systems used in conjunction with CLs (Clemencin 1996; van der Eijk et al.",
        "1996; Hayes et al.",
        "1996).",
        "It is certainly the case that preprocessing a document with the same parser that is used for source analysis improves the MT results.",
        "EasyEnglish uses the same parser as LMT (McCord 1989a, 1989b).",
        "This offers an obvious advantage for MT results.",
        "Other MT systems, including the KANT system (Mitamura and Nyberg 1995; Nyberg and Mitamura 1996), see the advantage of this.",
        "However, we claim that a document that has been \"EasyEnglished\" is also easier to understand for native speakers as well as nonnative speakers of English.",
        "A similar point has been made for Caterpillar Technical English (Hayes et al.",
        "1996).",
        "We think, however, that our approach is more general because our use of a broad-coverage, general English grammar 2 allows us to go beyond the concept of CL to look for more general types of ambiguities.",
        "iEasyEnglish also works with the XEDIT editor on VM and the EPM editor on OS/2.",
        "An earlier version of EasyEnglish was written in Prolog; however, the current version is written in pure ANSI C, and hence the question of platform is mainly a matter of supplying an appropriate editor interface."

        "The emphasis of a CL compliance checker is on ensuring that the input text (document) conforms to the restrictions imposed by the definition of the CL, whereas the emphasis of a standard grammar checker is on ensuring that the text is not ungrammatical.",
        "Controlled Languages have been invented to solve the problems associated with readability and translatability, with slight regard to ensuring grammaticality.",
        "In fact, the point has been made that it is up to the writer to ensure that the text is grammatical (Hayes et al.",
        "1996).",
        "Or, in the words of Goyvaerts (1996): \" ... it is still possible to write controlled non-English.\" A similar point has been made for GIFAS Rationalised French (Lux and Dauphin 1996).",
        "However, the more grammatical the text is, the easier it is to read and translate, so it seems that this concept of a CL checker is too narrow.",
        "On the other hand, in many applications it may not be necessary for writers to restrict themselves to a very limited subset of English in order to write easily understandable and translatable documents.",
        "In this sense the concept of a CL checker may be too broad.",
        "We have developed a system that we believe strikes a useful balance between CL checking and standard grammar checking.",
        "It consists in restricting the CL checking to the detection of structural (syntactic) ambiguity, complexity, and violations of vocabulary constraints.",
        "This view is in line with the description of Dokumentationsdeutsch in (Schachtl 1996).",
        "Dokumentationsdeutsch is not defined by a list of allowed constructions, but rather by a list of forbidden constructions, allowing most of standard German syntax.",
        "In the same way, EasyEnglish allows most of standard English syntax.",
        "Also (Lux and Dauphin 1996) point out the importance of the linguistic coverage being as broad as possible.",
        "At the same time, we perform some of the checks that a standard grammar checker would perform.",
        "3 The CL checks of EasyEnglish do work better when the text is not too ill-formed grammatically, since ill-formedness reduces the chances of the parser making good sense of the input.",
        "Most grammar checkers seem to have a problem with precision, 4 and this evidently stems from the inability of the system to make sense of the input.",
        "This is caused not only by too narrow coverage of the parser, but also by the ill-formed input that a standard gram3 We have conflated the notions of grammar errors and style weaknesses.",
        "For a good discussion of the differences, see (Ravin 1993).",
        "'We define precision to be the number of relevant error reports divided by the total number of error reports.",
        "In other words, it is a measure of how many irrelevant error reports the user will be bothered with.",
        "The higher the precision, the better.",
        "mar checker tries to deal with; it is harder to parse non-standard constructions correctly.",
        "It has been pointed out time and again (Richardson and Braden-Harder 1993; Wojcik and Holmback 1996; Clemencin 1996) that user acceptance depends on suitably high precision.",
        "Of course, the user also wants the checker to find the problems that need to be corrected, 5 but this seems to take much lower precedence (Wo-jcik and Holmback 1996; Clemencin 1996).",
        "We have made a small, preliminary study comparing the quality of EasyEnglish with that of Gram-matik and the grammar checker in AmiPro.",
        "For the study, we used a variety of text types, including technical documents, a manager's speech, and an on-line job advertisement written by a non-native English speaker.",
        "The (Precision, Recall) figures were: EasyEnglish (0.81, 0.87), Grammatik (0.51, 0.86), AmiPro (0.50, 0.69).",
        "There is overlap in the kinds of checks made by these three systems, but we attempted to evaluate each system on its own terms, i.e. on the basis of the collection of checks that it tries to do.",
        "That is, these figures show how well each system does what it tries to do, rather than how useful what it tries to do is.",
        "(The recall figures for Grammatik and AmiPro may be artificially high, since we may not have been able to identify all the problems that these grammar checkers intend to address.)",
        "Of course, high precision and recall alone are not enough to ensure the usefulness of an authoring tool such as EasyEnglish.",
        "We agree with (Adriaens and Macken 1995; Wojcik and Holmbach 1996) that it is also necessary to evaluate how well writers can use the system to arrive at a satisfactory document.",
        "It is our claim that the types of checks EasyEnglish performs are vastly more relevant for ensuring high document quality than a majority of the checks in the above-mentioned grammar checkers (e.g. most of the lexically-based checks).",
        "It has been claimed that standard grammar checkers typically check for stylistic issues that are relevant for writers of fiction (Goyvaerts 1996).",
        "But, as Goyvaerts (1996) puts it: \"Industry does not need Shakespeare or Chaucer, industry needs clear, concise communca-tive writing â€“ in one word Controlled Language.\" Of course, standard grammar checkers do also try to supply checks that are relevant for non-fictional genres.",
        "However, some of the standard stylistic recommendations are not entirely relevant for technical documents at least.",
        "It is, for example, rather common for a standard grammar checker to discourage repetition.",
        "For a company that has to pay for document translation on a per word basis, every repetition means a savings."

        "Some systems support automatic substitution; since we deal with truly ambiguous constructions, we have to involve the user in making the choice.",
        "The EasyEnglish editor interface, however, does allow the user to select an offered rephrasing by mouse-clicking and have the selection substituted automatically.",
        "Other systems, e.g. the Attempto System (Fuchs and Schwitter 1996), present the user with a rephrasing that illustrates which interpretation the system arrived at.",
        "If that interpretation is not the desired one, it is up to the user to construct a rephrasing that will result in the desired interpretation.",
        "We think it is more user-friendly to show the user exactly how the construction may be ambiguous and let her make her own choice.",
        "In order for the disambiguation rules to work properly, it is crucial to have a deep analysis of the text.",
        "This deep analysis is provided by English Slot Grammar (ESG) (McCord 1980, 1990, 1993) in the form of parse trees expressed as a network structure.",
        "The disambiguation rules explore the network to spot ambiguous and potentially ambiguous constructions.",
        "ESG often provides more than one parse, ranked according to a specific numerical ranking system (McCord 1990, 1993).",
        "But, unlike some other systems, e.g. the Boeing Simplified English Checker (Wojcik and Holmback 1996), which look at a whole forest of trees, it is only necessary for EasyEnglish to look at the highest-ranked parse.",
        "ESG parsing heuristics often arrive at correct attachments in the highest-ranked parse.",
        "But even when the attachment is off, EasyEnglish can often point out other attachment possibilities to the writer.",
        "For example, if a present participial clause is attached to the object of a verb, there will also be the possibility that the participial clause actually should modify the subject instead.",
        "However, it is not necessary for the parse to reflect this, since this can be reflected in the EasyEnglish rule instead.",
        "A simplistic view of this rule would be: \"If a present participial clause modifies the object, suggest two rephrasings, one that forces the attachment to the subject, and one that forces the attachment to the object\".",
        "An example taken from an IBM manual: \"Different system users may operate on different objects using the same application program.\" This sentence generates the following message: Ambiguous attachment of verb phrase: \"using the same application program\".",

        "If \"Different system users\", a possible rephrasing would be: \"by using the same application program\"; If \"different objects\", a possible rephrasing would be: \"different objects that use the same application program\".",
        "Notice the additional benefit we get from basing the suggestion on a parse: the correct subject-verb agreement can be inferred for use in the suggestions.",
        "Coordination is another source of ambiguity, since the scope is not always clear.",
        "One type of ambiguity occurs when a conjoined noun phrase premodifies a noun, as in this example from an IBM manual: \" It is the number defined in the file or result field definition.",

        "For example, the implicit subject in a nonfinite clause premodifying the main clause should be the same as the subject of the main clause.",
