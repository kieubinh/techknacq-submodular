        "There is no doubt that the amount of textual information electronically available today has passed its critical mass leading to the emerging problem that the more electronic text data is available the more difficult it is to find or extract relevant information.",
        "In order to overcome this problem new technologies for future information management systems are explored by various researchers.",
        "One new line of such research is the investigation and development of information extraction (IE) systems.",
        "The goal of IE is to build systems that find and link relevant information from text data while ignoring extraneous and irrelevant information (Cowie and Lehnert, 1996).",
        "Current IE systems are to be quite successfully in automatically processing large text collections with high speed and robustness (see (Sundheim, 1995), (Chinchor et al., 1993), and (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996)).",
        "This is due to the fact that they can provide a partial understanding of specific types of text with a certain degree of partial accuracy using fast and robust shallow processing strategies (basically finite state technology).",
        "They have been \"made sensitive\" to certain key pieces of information and thereby provide an easy means to skip text without deep analysis.",
        "The majority of existing information systems are applied to English text.",
        "A major drawback of previous systems was their restrictive degree of portability towards new domains and tasks which was also caused by a restricted degree of re-usability of the knowledge sources.",
        "Consequently, the major goals which were identified during the sixth message understanding conference (AMC-6) were, on the one hand, to demonstrate task-independent component technologies of information extraction, and, on the other hand, to encourage work on increasing portability and \"deeper understanding\" (cf. (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996)).",
        "In this paper we report on SMES an information extraction core system for real world German text processing.",
        "The main research topics we are concerned with include easy portability arid adaptability of the core system to extraction tasks of different complexity and domains.",
        "In this paper we will concentrate on the technical and implementational aspects of the IE core technology used for achieving the desired portability.",
        "We will only briefly describe some of the current applications built on top of this core machinery (see section 7)."

        "Hence, we view SMES as a core information extraction system.",
        "Customization is achieved in the following directions:",
        "• defining the flow of control between modules (e.g., cascaded and/or interleaved) • selection of the linguistic knowledge sources • specifying domain specific knowledge • defining task-specific additional functionality",

        "FST are compiled to Lisp functions using an extended version of the compiler defined in (Krieger, 1987).",
        "A bidirectional lexical-driven shallow parser for the combination of extracted fragments.",
        "Shallow parsing is basically directed through fragment combination patterns FCP of the form (F STie ft, anchor, FSTraght), where anchor is a lexical entry (e.g., a verb like \"to meet\") or a name of a class of lexical entries (e.g., \"transitive-verb\").",
        "FCPs are attached to lexical entries (e.g., verbs), and are selected right after a corresponding lexical entry has been identified.",

        "TDL is used in SMES for performing type-driven lexical retrieval, e.g., for concept-driven filtering, and for the evaluation of syntactic agreement tests during fragment processing and combination.",
        "The knowledge base is the collection of different knowledge sources, viz. lexicon, subgrammars, clause-level expressions, and template patterns.",
        "Currently it includes 120.000 lexical root entries, subgrammars for simple and complex date and time expressions, person names, company names, currency expressions, as well as shallow grammars for general nominal phrases, prepositional phrases, and general verb-modifier expressions.",
        "Additionally to the above mentioned components there also exists a generic graphical editor for text items and an HTML interface to the Netscape browser which performs marking of the relevant text parts by providing typed parentheses which also serve as links to the internal representation of the extracted information.",
        "There are two important properties of the system for supporting portability:",
        "• Each component outputs the resulting structures uniformly as feature value structures, together with its type and the corresponding start and end positions of the spanned input expressions.",
        "We call these output structures text items.",
        "• All (un-filtered) resulting structures of each component are cached so that a component can take into account results of all previous components.",
        "This allows for the definition of cascaded as well as interleaved flow of control.",
        "The former case means that it is possible to apply a cascade of finite state expressions (comparable to that proposed in (Appelt et al., 1993)), and the latter supports the definition of finite state expressions which incrementally perform a mix of keyword spotting, fragment processing.",

        "For example the following basic edge (:mona-cat \"partikel\" pre) tests whether 2\", produced by MONA is a particle, and if so binds the token to the variable pre (more precisely, each variable of a basic edge denotes a stack, so that the current token is actually pushed onto the stack).",

        "Using basic edges the recognition part of an FST is then defined as a regular expression using a functional notation.",
        "For example the recognition part for simple nominal phrases might be defined as follows: (:conc (:star<n (:mona-cat \"det\" det) 1) (:star (:mona-cat \"adj\" adj)) (:mona-cat \"n\" noun)) Thus defined, a nominal phrase is the concatenation of one optional determiner (expressed by the loop operator :star<n, where n starts from 0 and ends by 1), followed by zero or more adjectives followed by a noun.",
        "Output description part The output structure of an FST is constructed by collecting together the variables of the recognition part's basic edges followed by some specific construction handlers.",
        "In order to support re-usability of FST to other applications, it is important to separate the construction handlers from the FST definition.",
        "Therefore, the output description part is realized through a function called BUILD-ITEM which receives as input the edge variables and a symbol denoting the class of the FST.",

        "For example the edge (:mona-cat-type (:and \"n\" \"device\") var) will accept a word form which has been analyzed as a noun and whose lexical entry type identifier is subsumed by \"device\".",
        "As an example of defining agreement test consider the basic edge (:mona-cat-unify \"det\" \"[(num %1)(case %2 = gen-val) (gender %3)]\" agr det) which checks whether the current token is a determiner and whether its inflection information (computed by MONA) unifies with the specified constraints (here, it is checked whether the determiner has a genitive reading, where structure sharing is expressed through variables like %1).",
        "If so, agr is bound to the result of the unifier and token is bound to det.",
        "If in the same FST a similar edge for noun tokens follows which also makes reference to the variable agr, the new value for agr is checked with its old value.",
        "In this way, agreement information is propagated through the whole FST.",
        "An important advantage of using TDL in this way is that it supports the specification of very compact and modular finite expressions.",

        "Control parameters In order to obtain flexible control mechanisms for the matching phase it is possible to specify whether an exact match is requested or whether an FST should already succeed when the recognition part matches a prefix of the input string (or suffix, respectively).",

        "Processing is very robust and fast (between 1 and 10 CPU seconds (Sun UltraSparc) depending on the size of the text which ranges from very short texts (a few sentences) upto short texts (one page)).",
        "In all of the three applications we obtained high coverage and good results.",
        "Because of the lack of comparable existing IE systems defined for handling German texts in similar domains and the lack of evaluation standards for the German language (comparable to that of MUC), we cannot claim that these results are comparable.",
        "However, we have now started the implementation of a new application together with a commercial partner, where a more systematic evaluation of the system is carried out.",
        "Here, SMES is applied on a quite different domain, namely news items concerning the German IFOR mission in former Yugoslavia.",
        "Our task is to identify those messages which are about violations of the peace treaty and to extract the information about location, aggressor, defender and victims.",
        "The corpus consists of a set of monthly reports (Jan. 1996 to Aug. 1996) each consisting of about 25 messages from which 2 to 8 messages are about fighting actions.",
        "These messages have been hand-tagged with respect to the relevant information.",
        "Although we are still in the development phase we will briefly describe our experience of adapting SMES to this new domain.",
        "Starting from the assumption that the core machinery can be used unchanged we first measured the coverage of the existing linguistic knowledge sources.",
        "Concerning the above mentioned corpus the lexicon covers about 90%.",
        "However, from the 10% of unrecognized words about 70% are proper names (which we will handle without a lexicon) and 1.5% are spelling errors, so that the lexicon actually covers more then 95% of this unseen text corpus.",
        "The same \"blind\" test was also carried out for the date, time, and location subgrammar, i.e., they have been run on the new corpus without any adaption to the specific domain knowledge.",
        "For the date-/time expressions we obtained a recall of 77% and a precision of 88%, and for the location expressions we obtained 66% and 87%, respectively.",
        "In the latter case, most of the unrecognized expressions concern expressions like \"nach Taszar/Ungarn\", \"im serbis-chen bzw.",
        "kroatischen Teil Bosniens\", or \"in der Moslemisch-kroatischen Rideration\".",
        "For the general NP and PP subgrammars we obtained a recall of 55% and a precision of 60% (concerning correct head-modifier structure).",
        "The small recall is due to some lexical gap (including proper names) and unforeseen complex expressions like \"die Mehrzahl der auf 140.000 geschatzten moslemischen Fftichtlinge\".",
        "But note that these grammars have been written on the basis of different corpora.",
        "In order to measure the coverage of the fragment combination patterns FCP, the relevant main verbs of the tagged corpora have been associated with the corresponding FCP (e.g., the FCP for transitive verbs), without changing the original definition of the FCPs.",
        "The only major change to be done concerned the extension of the output description function BUILD-ITEM for building up the new template structure.",
        "After a first trial run we obtained an unsatisfactory recognition rate of about 25%.",
        "One major problem we identified was the frequent use of passive constructions which the shallow parser was not able to process.",
        "Consequently, as a first actual extension of SMES to the new domain we extended the shallow parser to cope with passive constructions.",
        "Using this extension we obtained an recognition of about 40% after a new trial run.",
        "After the analysis of the (partially) unrecognized messages (including the misclassified ones), we identified the following major bottlenecks of our current system.",
        "First, many of the partially recognized templates are part of coordinations (including enumerations), in which case several (local) templates share the same slot, however this slot is only mentioned one time.",
        "Resolving this kind of \"slot sharing\" requires processing of elliptic expressions of different kinds as well as the need of domain-specific inference rules which we have not yet foreseen as part of the core system.",
        "Second, the wrong recognition of messages is often due to the lack of semantic constraints which would be applied during shallow parsing in a similar way as the subcategorization constraints.",
        "Although these current results should and can be improved we are convinced that the idea of developing a core IE-engine is a worthwhile venture."

        "The basic design criterion of the system is of providing a set of basic powerful, robust, and efficient natural language components and generic linguistic knowledge sources which can easily be customized for processing different tasks in a flexible manner.",
        "The main features are: a very efficient and robust morphological component, a powerful tool for expressing finite state expressions, a flexible bidirectional shallow parser, as well as a flexible interface to an advanced formalism for typed feature formalisms.",
        "The system has been fully implemented in Common Lisp and C. Future research will focus towards automatic adaption and acquisition methods, e.g., automatic extraction of subgrammars from a competence base and learning methods for domain-specific extraction patterns."
