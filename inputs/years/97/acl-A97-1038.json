        "CogentHelp is a prototype tool for authoring dynamically generated on-line help for applications with graphical user interfaces (GUIs).",
        "In this paper, we describe CogentHelp, highlighting the usefulness of certain natural language generation (NLG) techniques in supporting software-engineering (SE) goals for help authoring tools – principally, quality and evolvability of help texts.",
        "To our knowledge, CogentHelp is unique in that it is the first operational prototype to embody the \"evolution-friendly\" properties of tools in the literate programming tradition (Knuth, 1992) – e.g., the by now well-known j avadoc utility for generating API documentation from comments embedded in Java source code (Friendly, 1995; cf. also Johnson and Erdem, 1995; Priestly et al., 1996; Korgen, 1996) – in a tool for generating end user–level documentation.",
        "CogentHelp is also unusual in that it is (to date) one of the few tools to bring NLG techniques to bear on the problem of authoring dynamically generated documents (cf. Paris and Van-der Linden, 1996; Knott et al., 1996; Hirst and Di-Marco, 1995); traditionally, most applied NLG systems have focused on niches where texts can be generated fully automatically, such as routine reports of various types (e.g. Goldberg et al., 1994; Kukich et al., 1994) or explanations of expert system reasoning (cf. Moore, 1995 and references therein).",
        "While striving to design highly sophisticated, fully automatic systems has undoubtedly led to a deeper understanding of the text generation process, it has had the unfortunate effect (to date) of limiting the use of techniques pioneered in the NLG community to just a few niches where high knowledge acquisition costs stand a chance of being balanced by substantial volume of needed texts (cf. Reiter and Mellish, 1993).",
        "By joining the emerging authoring support crowd and endeavoring to create new opportunities in automated documentation, we hope to contribute to the broader acceptance and visibility of NLG technology in the overall computing community.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we discuss the software engineering goals for CogentHelp.",
        "In Section 3 we provide background on automated documentation and identify where CogentHelp fits in this picture.",
        "In Section 4 we give a brief overview of the CogentHelp system.",
        "In Section 5, we highlight the NLG techniques used in support of the software engineering goals identified in Section 2.",
        "In Section 6 we describe Cogent-Help's authoring interface.",
        "Finally, in Section 7 we conclude by discussing the outlook for CogentHelp's use and further development."

      "text": [
        "From a software engineering perspective, we set out to achieve three main goals in designing CogentHelp, each of which has various aspects.",
        "The first of these goals is end user–oriented, whereas the latter two are developer-oriented.",
        "The first goal is to promote quality in the resulting help systems, which includes promoting",
        "• Consistency – the grouping of material into help pages, the use of formatting devices such as",
        "headings, bullets, and graphics, and the general writing style should be consistent throughout the help system;",
        "• Navigability – the use of grouping and formatting should make it easier to find information about a particular GUI component in the help system; • Completeness – all GUI components should be documented; • Relevance – information should be limited to that which is likely to be of current relevance, given the current GUI state; • Conciseness – redundancy should be avoided; • Coherence – information about GUI components should be presented in a logical and contextually appropriate fashion.",
        "The second goal is to facilitate evolution, which includes facilitating",
        "• Fidelity – the help author should be assisted in producing complete and up-to-date descriptions of GUI components; • Reuse – wherever possible, the help author should not have to write the same text twice.",
        "The final goal is to lower barriers to adopting the technology, which has principally meant providing an authoring interface which makes the benefits of the system available at a reasonable cost in terms of the understanding and effort required of the help author."

    {
      "heading": "3 Automated Documentation",
      "text": [
        "The main idea of CogentHelp is to have developers or technical writers author the reference-oriented part of an application's help system' in small pieces, indexed to the GUI components themselves, instead of in separate documents (or in one monolithic document).",
        "CogentHelp then dynamically assembles these pieces into a set of well-structured help pages for the end user to browse.",
        "The principal advantage of this approach is that it makes it possible to keep the reference-oriented part 'By the reference-oriented part, we mean the part of a help system which describes the functions of individual windows, widgets, etc., as opposed to more general or more task-oriented information about the application; other than providing an easy way of linking to and from CogentHelp-generated pages, CogentHelp leaves task-oriented help entirely to the author.",
        "of an on-line help system up-to-date automatically, since both the application GUI and the documentation can be evolved in sync.",
        "This benefit of generating both code and documentation from a single has source2 n long been recognized, both in the NLG community (cf. Reiter and Mellish, 1993; Moore, 1995; and references therein) and in the SE community, where it is recognized under the banner of literate programming tradition (Knuth, 1992).",
        "Other important benefits stem from supporting the separation of the content of the document to be generated (descriptions of individual components) from the structure of the document (how the content is distributed and formatted): this allows the author to focus on writing accurate component descriptions, and avoid much of the drudgery involved in creating a complex hypertext document manually.",
        "To better understand where CogentHelp fits in, it is instructive to compare it with the closest reference points in the NLG and SE communities.",
        "On the NLG side, there is the Drafter system (Paris and Vander Linden, 1996), which generates drafts of instructions in both English and French from a single formal representation of the user's task.",
        "Drafter is considerably more ambitious in aiming to automate the production of multilingual, task-oriented help; at the same time, however, Drafter is more limited in that it is not evolution-oriented, aiming only to generate satisfactory initial drafts (whence its name).",
        "This is in large part due to the fact that Drafter's input is centered around task representations which are not typically used for GUI-level tasks in software engineering practice; in contrast, nearly every GUI builder provides some form of GUI resource database which could be used as input to CogentHelp.",
        "On the SE side, the nearest reference points are a bit more distant, as CogentHelp has more in common with developer-oriented tools such as the javadoc API documentation generator distributed with Sun Microsystems' Java Developers Kit (Friendly, 1995) than with currently available help authoring tools.",
        "While several current GUI-development environments include tools which generate an initial, \"skeleton\" help system for an application (with topics that correspond to the widgets in the GUI), to our knowledge CogentHelp is the first operational prototype to implement the \"evolutionfriendly\" properties of a tool like javadoc in a system for generating end user–level documentation.",
        "Unlike the \"skeleton generators\" mentioned above, 'Note that this \"single source\" need only be virtual – physically single-source code and documentation can have its drawbacks, which are not however inherent to the approach (Priestley et al., 1996).",
        "which require the help author to start from scratch each time the skeleton is regenerated in response to GUI modifications, CogentHelp supports help authoring throughout the software life cycle."

        "CogentHelp takes as input various human-written text fragments (or \"help snippets\") indexed to GUI resource databases, which provide some useful help-related information in the form of types, labels, locations and part-whole relations for GUI widgets.",
        "CogentHelp generates HTML help files, which can be displayed on any platform for which a Web browser is available.",
        "It is designed to support efficient navigation through the help system, through the use of intelligent, functionally structured layout as well as through an expandable/collapsible table of contents and \"thumbnail sketch\" applet.",
        "These points will be elaborated upon below.",
        "CogentHelp operates in two modes: a \"static\" mode, which does not make use of runtime information, and a \"dynamic\" mode, which uses widget runtime status information to produce more specialized, contextually appropriate messages.",
        "The static mode is useful in the authoring process, since it displays all available help information and has simpler architectural requirements.",
        "In evolving the design of CogentHelp, we have employed a rapid-prototyping approach in working with our TRP /ROAD' consortium partners at Raytheon, who are serving as a trial user group.",
        "The full CogentHelp component architecture and dependencies reflects the particular requirements of this group, and are as follows.",

        "CogentHelp currently works with applications built using the Neuron Data cross-platform GUI builder; while it is not dependent on this product in any conceptually substantial way, using other GUI builders would require a porting effort.",
        "To retrieve runtime information, CogentHelp uses Expersoft's PowerBroker ORB for interprocess communication; in comparison to the Neuron Data connection, other IPC methods could be more easily substituted.",
        "Finally, CogentHelp displays hypertext in Netscape Navigator, using HTTP to mediate access to the dynamically generated texts; since Netscape Navigator remains the most widely used cross-platform browser, we have yet to investigate using other browsers.",

      "heading": "5.1 Knowledge Representation",
      "text": [
        "In developing CogentHelp, we have taken a minimalist approach to knowledge representation following a methodology for building text generators developed over several years at CoGenTex.",
        "As will be explained below, this approach has led us to (i) make use of what amounts to a large-grained \"phrasal\" lexicon and (ii) devise and implement a widget-clustering algorithm for recovering functional groupings, as part of an Intermediate Knowledge Representation System (IKRS).",
        "As Milosavljevic et al.",
        "(1996) argue, to optimize coverage and cost it makes sense to choose an underlying representation which",
        "• makes precisely those distinctions that are relevant for the intended range of generated texts; and • is no more abstract than is required for the inference processes which need to be performed over the representation.",
        "They go on to argue that besides eliminating a great deal of unnecessary 'generation from first principles,' this approach complements their use of a phrasal lexicon (Kukich, 1983; Hovy, 1988) at the linguistic level.",
        "Applying essentially the same approach to the design of CogentHelp, we first determined that for the intended range of generated texts it suffices to associate with each widget to be documented a small number of atomic propositions and properties, identifiable by type.",
        "Next we determined that since no inference is required beyond checking for equality, these propositions and properties can be conflated with their linguistic realizations – i.e., the indexed, human-authored help snippets CogentHelp takes as input.",
        "While we did not originally think of Cogent-Help's collection of input help snippets as a phrasal lexicon a la Milosavljevic et al., in retrospect it becomes evident that this collection can be viewed as",
        "tantamount to one; of course, since these snippets vary in size from phrases to paragraphs, the term \"phrasal\" is not entirely accurate.",
        "The types of snippets in current use include a one-sentence short description of the relevant GUI component; a paragraph-sized elaboration on the short description; various phrase-sized messages concerning the conditions under which it is visible or enabled, if appropriate; and a list of references to other topics.",
        "In the case of the phrase-sized messages, each of these fields is accompanied by a syntactic frame which prompts the author to provide consistent syntax – for example, entries in the WHEN_ENABLED field should fit the frame This element is enabled when To facilitate equality checking and promote text reuse, a mechanism is provided enabling the author to alias the message for one widget to that of another.",
        "To enhance the modularity and robustness of a practical text generator, Korelsky et al.",
        "(1993) argue for the use of an Intermediate Knowledge Representation System (IKRS, pronounced \"Icarus\") to bridge the gap between what the text planner would like to access and what is actually found in the information base of an application program.",
        "A remarkably similar idea has been independently developed by Lester and Porter (1996), under the heading of KB Accessors.",
        "One purpose of an IKRS, Korelsky et al.",
        "suggest, is to provide a component in which to locate domain-level inferencing not provided by the application program.",
        "Note that while this type of inferencing is motivated by text planning needs, it is still about the domain rather than about natural language communication, and thus does not belong in the text planner itself.",
        "In developing CogentHelp, we encountered a need for just this sort of inferencing in order to support sensible layout.",
        "The problem we faced was how to logically arrange descriptions of widgets within a help page (or set of help pages) describing a window, which is the basic unit of organization in CogentHelp.",
        "As will be explained below, grouping widgets by type was considered inadequate, because doing so would obscure functional relationships between widgets of different types.",
        "A naive spatial sorting was likewise considered inadequate, as this would inevitably separate elements of a functional group appearing in a certain area of the window.",
        "Unfortunately, since these functional groups are often not explicitly represented in GUI resource databases, we appeared to be at an impasse.",
        "To illustrate the problem, consider the sample application window shown in Figure 1, from a prototype of an application under development by our trial user group at Raytheon.",
        "This window, whose purpose is to allow a manufacturing shop floor foreman to assign operators to parts, is organized as follows: on the left there are two list boxes for operators (1, 2), with buttons beneath them to access information about these operators (3, 4, 5, 6); on the right there are two list boxes for parts (9, 10), with buttons beneath them to access information about these parts (11, 12); in the middle there are two buttons for making and removing assignments (7, 8); towards the bottom there is a list box showing the assignments made so far (of which there are none here – 13); and at the bottom there are standard buttons such as Save and Done (14, 15 – the Help button would go here).",
        "Given this organization, consider first arranging descriptions by type, and alphabetizing: besides cutting across the implicit functional groupings, arranging descriptions in this way would end up putting the two View K-Factors buttons (4, 11) in sequence, without any indication of which was which!",
        "Now consider a simple top-down, left-to-right spatial sort: again, this would inevitably yield a rather incoherent ordering, such as the Operators without Work list box (1), the Hot Parts list box (9), the Assign button (7), the Operators on Jobs list box (2), the Parts list box (10), the Remove Assignment button (8), etc.",
        "The solution to this problem was to develop, as part of our IKRS, a method of recovering these functional groups using spatial cues as heuristics; the reason this approach might be expected to work is that in a well-designed GUI, functionally related widgets are usually clustered together spatially in order to make the end user's life a bit easier.",
        "We began with the fairly standard hierarchical agglomerative algorithm found in (Stolcke, 1996).",
        "Stolcke's algorithm is an order n' one that iteratively merges smaller clusters into bigger ones until only one cluster remains; new clusters are formed out of the two nearest clusters in the current set, ensuring that the results are independent of the order in which clusters are examined.",
        "After some experimentation, we modified this algorithm to better suit our needs, resulting in the following three differences: (i) to create clusters with more than two elements, we continue adding elements to the newly created cluster until a certain distance threshold is exceeded; (ii) we represent the new cluster using its bounding box, rather than using an average of its elements; and (iii) we restrict the clustering to not operate across explicit groups, such as those formed using panels.",
        "With any clustering approach, there is always the tricky matter of determining a suitable distance measure.",
        "After trying out a variety of features, what we found to work surprisingly well was a simple weighted combination of proximity, alignment and type identity.",
        "In particular, in a test suite of around 15 windows provided to us by our trial user group, we obtained reasonable results (no egregiously bad groupings) on all of them without undue sensitivity to the exact weights.",
        "In the case of the window shown in Figure 1, the clustering procedure performs exactly as desired, yielding precisely the groupings used in the description of this window given above – i.e.: ( ( (1, 2), (3, 4, 5, 6) ), ( (9, 10), (11, 12) ), (7, 8), 13, (14, 15) ).",
        "Once the IKRS has heuristically recovered clusters of widgets likely to form a functional group, these clusters – as well as any explicitly represented groups, e.g. widgets contained within a panel of a window – can be used as a basis for help layout, as discussed below."

        "The automatically generated thumbnail images require no intervention on the part of the help author, and thus are guaranteed to be up-to-date; furthermore, their abstract nature gives them certain advantages over actual bitmaps: they do not present information which is redundant (since the actual window in question will usually be visible) or inconsistent (static bitmaps fail to capture widgets which are enabled/disabled or change their labels in certain situations)."
