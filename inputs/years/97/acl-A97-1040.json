        "Free movement of labour across national boundaries is an important aim of the European Union.'",
        "One of the prerequisites for this open labour market is accessibility of information about employment opportunities, both from the point of view of people seeking work, and of their potential employers.",
        "However, many EU citizens are denied full access to employment opportunities because information may not be readily available, and even where it is, it may not be available in the right language.",
        "The TREE project aims to address this problem by providing a system on the Internet where employers can deposit job ads, and which users can browse, each in their own language.",
        "Access to this service will be either through the user's own Internet provider, or at dedicated terminals located in employment centres.",
        "There are currently very many Internet sites where jobs are advertised, and indeed using information retrieval 1TREE is Language Engineering project LE 1182 of the European Commission's Fourth Framework Programme.",
        "We would like to express our thanks to other partners on the project: Edy Geerts and Marianne",
        "techniques next to natural language processing to search job offer databases is not a new application, cf. (Vega, 1990; Caldwell & Korelsky, 1994).",
        "But no other application as far as we can discover offers the opportunity of searching and of getting summaries of job ads in languages other than that of the original announcement.",
        "TREE therefore offers two significant services: intelligent search and summarization on the one hand, and these independent of the original language of the job ad on the other.",
        "It could be argued that the latter at least could be achieved by hooking a commercial Machine Translation (MT) system up to an Internet employment service.",
        "Although MT has had some success on the Internet (Flanagan, 1996), this is with largely sympathetic users who understand well the limitations of MT.",
        "Its use for a more delicate task aimed at the general public, especially a public which is not necessarily highly educated, is certainly out of the question, for well known reasons which we need not explore here.",
        "Suffice to say that an experiment in Canada using an MT system for precisely this application (Murray, 1989) was far from successful.",
        "It is also apparent that for many jobs in a location where a different language is spoken, sufficient linguistic knowledge at least to read an ad for a job in that region would be one of the prerequisites of the job: this is certainly the case for the kind of professional positions often advertised on the Internet.",
        "Nevertheless, our system offers users the possibility of searching in their own language for jobs advertised in a variety of languages.",
        "Also, there is a significant workforce for which foreign-language skills are not a prerequisite for working abroad, and which, furthermore, has traditionally been one of the most mobile: seasonal semi and unskilled workers.",
        "For this reason, the domain we have chosen for the prototype development of the TREE project is the hotel and catering industry."

        "The TREE system stores job ads in a partly language-independent schematic form, and is accessed by job-seeking users who can specify a number of parameters which are used to search the job database, and who can also customize the way the information retrieved is presented to them.",
        "A second type of user is the potential employer who provides job announcements to the system in the form of free text via an email feed or, it is planned, via a form-filling interface (though we shall not discuss this latter input mode here).",
        "The initial prototype system currently implemented can store and retrieve job ads in three languages English, Flemish and French regardless of which of these three languages the job was originally drafted in.",
        "The system has four key components which are the subject of this paper.",
        "Telematics, HCI and certain other issues such as maintenance of the system (deleting old ads, user training, legality of texts in different countries) and the information retrieval aspects of the system will not be discussed in this paper.",
        "The four components which we discuss here are: (a) the schema data structure for storing the job ads, and the associated terminological and lexical databases; (b) the analysis module for converting job ads received into their schematic form; (c) the query interface to allow users to specify the range of job ads they wish to retrieve; and (d) the generator, which creates a customised selective summary of the job ads retrieved in HTML format.",
        "To a great extent, the design of each of these modules is not especially innovative.",
        "However, the integration of all these functions is, from a methodological point of view, a good example of how a variety of techniques can be combined into a real application with a real use in the real world."

        "We have focused on domain-specific terms and classifications, not covering generic language issues nor providing a general lexicon and thesaurus.",
        "Different kinds of domain-specific information can be found as slot fillers, depending on the intended meaning of schema slots.",
        "The most relevant information is obviously job types.",
        "Existing job classifications have been established for example by the European Commission's Employment Service (EURES, 1989), by the ILO (ILO, 1990) and several individual companies; each provides a hierarchical classification of jobs, specifying, for each term, a distinct code, a description of the job, one or more generic",
        "terms commonly used to refer to the specific job, and possibly a set of synonyms.",
        "The description of the job ranges, depending on the classification, from a quite broad one to greatly detailed ones, sometimes highlighting differences existing in different countries (e.g. according to the EURES classification, a \"waiter\" in some EU states is also required to act as a barman while in others is not).",
        "Job classifications therefore provide at least three different kinds of information: Definition of recognized job types, with a (more or less) precise definition of what the job is; chef is a recognized item, as well as pizza chef, while chef specializing in preparing hors d'oeuvres is not; classifications are obviously arbitrary as long the boundary between whether a specific job is a recognized one or simply an \"unrecognized\" classification simply depends on the level of granularity the classifier decides to use.",
        "Classification of job types along ISA hierarchies (e.g. a wine waiter ISA type of waiter).",
        "Linguistic information about commonly used terms and synonyms used in a given language (or more than one) to refer to the specific term.",
        "Accordingly, job classification terms are classified, coded (i.e. a distinct code identifying the term is associated with each term) and a list of standard \"names\" as well as recognized synonyms is associated with them.",
        "The classification and coding schema of VDAB, one of the end-user partners in the project, is used, but extensions deriving from other schema could obviously be envisaged.",
        "Translation tables are provided for each term, containing the names used in the different languages.",
        "Alignments across different languages are kept whenever possible.",
        "Problems due to missing equivalent terms in different languages, or to slightly different meanings, are handled, at least in the first stage, simply by providing terms nearer in meaning.",
        "An example of some job titles is shown in Figure 2: the hierarchical nature of the titles, and also the existence of some synonyms, is suggested by the numbering scheme, and is more or less self-explanatory.",

        "This makes the schema neutral with respect to analysis, query and generation languages.",

        "Although the job titles themselves provide an obvious area of terminology, we handle various other areas of vocabulary in a similar way.",
        "There are two criteria for \"terminological status\" in our system, either of which is sufficient: (i) hierarchical structure, and (ii) standardization.",
        "An example of \"standardized vocabulary\" in our domain is words like full-time, part-time, which have an agreed meaning, or adjectives like essential as applied to requirements such as experience, or a driving licence.",
        "Of more interest perhaps is vocabulary which can be structured, since this provides us with an opportunity to allow more sophisticated searching of the database.",
        "One example is types of establishment, e.g. hotel, restaurant, cafe, pub etc.",
        "Although such terms do not necessarily figure in recognized terminological thesauri, it is obvious that some structure can be imposed on these terms, for example to enable a user who is looking for a job in an eating establishment to be presented with jobs in a variety of such places.",
        "Some hierarchies are trivially simple, for example full-time/ part-time.",
        "A more interesting example is geographical location.",
        "Most job ads express the location of the work either explicitly or implicitly in the contact address.",
        "But often, these locations are the names of towns or districts, whereas a user might want to search for jobs in a wider area: a user looking for work in Flanders, for example, should be presented with jobs whose location is identified as Antwerp.",

        "\"real-world knowledge\" rather than linguistic knowledge: short of coding an entire gazeteer on the off-chance that some place-name appeared in a job ad, we must rather rely on the user trials envisaged later in our project to identify the extent to which geographical information needs to be included in the system."

        "The input that the TREE system will accept is partially structured, but with much scope for free-text input.",
        "One possible way of analysing this would be to employ a straightforward pattern-matching approach, searching for \"trigger phrases\" such as EM-PLOYER:NAME is seeking JOB-TITLE, with special processors for analysing the slot-filler portions of the text.",
        "This simple approach has certain advantages over a more complex approach based on traditional phrase-structure parsing, especially since we are not particularly interested in phrase-structure as such.",

        "However, both these procedures can be identified as essentially \"rule-based\", in the sense that linguistic data used to match, whether fixed patterns or syntactic rules, must be explicitly listed in a kind of grammar, which implies a number of disadvantages, which we will mention shortly.",
        "An alternative is suggested by the paradigm of \"example-based\" processing (Jones, 1996), now becoming quite prevalent in MT (Sumita et al., 1990; Somers, 1993), though in fact the techniques are very much like those of the longer established paradigm of case-based reasoning."

        "company(X,'Cafe Citrus')}.",
        "will be triggered, and the system will produce the sentence Cafe Citrus advertises as vacant a position as chef.",
        "This is a canned-text approach.",
        "It is trivial to implement, but the disadvantage is, of course, that we would have to store one rule for each utterance that we would like our system to produce.",
        "As soon as a sentence must be produced several times with only slight alterations, a template-based approach is more appropriate.",
        "Let us modify the above rule as follows: s/E --> pn/X-name(X,C), [advertises,as,vacant,a,position,as,chef] # fitem(E,X,Y),job(Y,91202), company (X,c)}.",
        "The following rule is needed to tell the system that it is allowed to realize the value of the feature <company> as the value itself (i.e. the value is the name of the company).",
        "Thus, here too, given the above job database entry, the sentence Cafe Citrus advertises as vacant a position as chef can be generated.",
        "Furthermore, Red Herring Restaurant advertises as vacant a position as chef can be generated as well.",
        "It is not hard to see that the two rules above form the beginning of a grammar.",
        "Such a grammar may be further elaborated as follows:",
        "[advertises,as,vacant,a,position,as].",
        "Now, the above sentences, plus many other sentences, may be generated, given appropriate database entries.",
        "Our approach is based on the idea that canned-text approaches, template-based approaches and grammar-based approaches to natural language generation while they are often contrasted may in fact be regarded as different points on a scale, from the very specific to the very general.",
        "In a sense, templates are just generalized canned texts, and grammars are just generalized templates.",
        "Indeed, the possibility of combining these different modes of generation has recently been highlighted as one of the keys to efficient use of natural language generation techniques in practical applications (van Noord Neumann, 1996; Busemann, 1996)."

        "The European Union is a loose geopolitical organization that has eleven official languages.",
        "As such, it is clear that even in a restricted domain such as that of job ads, novel approaches to Language Engineering are required.",
        "In this paper we have described an approach that summarizes ads into a base schema, and then generates output in the desired language in a principled, though restricted way.",
        "At first glance, this may look like old-fashioned interlingual MT, but there are two important differences.",
        "First, our approach is inherently \"lossy\", in that not all the information in the input ad may be analysed into the schema.",
        "It cannot consequently be included in the generated output.",
        "Second, the format of the output can be controlled and customised by the user which means again that the output text is a summary or digest, not necessarily presented in the same order as the original text.",
        "For both these reasons, our system cannot be descibed as a \"translation system\" .",
        "Nonetheless we believe this approach is capable of giving considerable coverage at a far lower cost and higher quality than that usually associated with MT.",
        "Our approach is not without some disadvantages however: it is well known that a considerable quantity of the semantics of human language is culturally and socially determined.",
        "Thus, even though one can map the names of job categories from one language to another, it is not necessarily true that they mean the same thing.",
        "So for example, waiters in Spain are expected to serve snacks, whereas in Belgium they do not.",
        "There is of course no easy solution to these",
        "problems from the Language Engineering point of view: our service must simply advise users to check that the job description in the target country corresponds to their understanding.",
        "Legal constraints are also a significant issue in the area of job advertising.",
        "Thus, whilst most countries in the EU have legislation to prevent race and sex discrimination in job advertising, some do not.",
        "Thus a Spanish bar can (or could until recently) advertise for Pretty girls wanted as bar staff, and Men wanted to work in the kitchen.",
        "This type of discrimination is illegal in the UK where it would violate Sex Equality Legislation.",
        "Thus we must generate non-discriminatory text to avoid running foul of UK law.",
        "This clearly shows how practical applications of Language Engineering have to conform in unforeseen ways to the real world.",
        "Our future work will continue to extend the pragmatic approach taken so far.",
        "In particular, we are being encouraged to broaden the coverage of our system to include many more employment domains.",
        "It remains to be seen what are the consequences of this scaling on what has so far proved to be a simple but effective architecture."
