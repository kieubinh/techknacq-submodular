        "First, a set of key terms, ranging from single word terms to four word terms, are automatically generated and organized in a hierarchical structure out of a text dataset which represents a specific topic.",
        "Second, a graphic user interface (GUI) is established that provides the domain expert or the user with an interactive environment to visualize the key term hierarchy in the context of the original dataset."

        "The ultimate goal of this prototype system is to offer an automated toolkit which allows the domain expert or the user to visualize and examine key terms in a large information collection.",
        "Such a toolkit has proven to be useful in a number of real applications.",
        "For example, it has helped us reduce the time and manual effort needed to develop and maintain our on-line document indexing and classification schemes.",
        "The system consists of two components: a preprocessing component for the automatic construction of key terms and the front-end component for user-guided graphic interface."

        "Automatically identifying meaningful terms from naturally running texts has been an important task for information technologists.",
        "It is widely believed that a set of good terms can be used to express the content of the document.",
        "By capturing a set of good terms, for example, relevant documents can be searched and retrieved from a large document collection.",
        "Though what constitutes a good term still remains to be answered, we know that a good term can be a word stem, a single word, a multiple word term (a phrase), or simply a syntactic unit.",
        "Various existing and workable term extraction tools are either statistically driven, or linguistically oriented, or some hybrid of the two.",
        "They all target frequently co-occurring words in running text.",
        "The earlier work of Choueka (1988) proposed a pure frequency approach in which only quantitative selection criteria were established and applied.",
        "Church and Hanks (1990) introduced a statistical measurement called mutual information for extracting strongly associated or collocated words.",
        "Tools like Xtract (Smadja 1993) were based on the work of Church and others, but made a step forward by incorporating various statistical measurements like z-score and variance of distribution, as well as shallow linguistic techniques like part-of-speech tagging and lemmatization of input data and partial parsing of raw output.",
        "Exemplary linguistic approaches can be found in the work by Strzalkowsky (1993) where a fast and accurate syntactic parser is the prerequisite for the selection of significant phrasal terms.",
        "Different applications aim at different types of key terms.",
        "For the purpose of generating key terms for our prototype system, we have adopted a learn data from data\" approach.",
        "The novelty of this",
        "approach lies in the automatic comparison of two sample datasets, a topic focused dataset based on a predefined topic and a larger and more general base dataset.",
        "The focused dataset is created by the domain expert either through a submission of an on-line search or through a compilation of documents from a specific source.",
        "The construction of the corresponding base dataset is performed by pulling documents out of a number of sources, such as news wires, newspapers, magazines and legal databases.",
        "The intention is to make the resulted corpora cover a much greater variety of topics or domain subjects than the focused dataset.",
        "To identify interesting word patterns in both samples a set of statistical measures are applied.",
        "The identification of single word terms is based on the variation of a t-test.",
        "Two-word terms are captured through the computation of mutual information (Church et al.",
        "1991), and an extension of mutual information assists in extracting three-word and four-word terms.",
        "Once the significant terms of these four types are identified, a comparison algorithm is applied to differentiate terms across the two samples.",
        "If significant changes in the values of certain statistical variables are detected, associated terms are selected from the focused sample and included in the final generated lists.",
        "(For a complete description of the algorithm and preliminary experiments, please refer to Zhou and Dapkus 1995.)"

        "We view our prototype system as a means to achieve information visualization.",
        "Analogous to scientific visualization that allows scientists to make sense out of intellectually large data collections, information visualization aims at organizing large information spaces so that information technologists can visualize what is out there and how various parts are related to each other (Robertson et al.",
        "1991).",
        "The guiding principle for building the GUI component of our prototype system is to automate the manual process of capturing information content out of large document collections.",
        "The design of the GUI component relies on a number of well understood elements which include a suggestive graphic design and a direct manipulation metaphor to achieve an easy-to-learn user interface.",
        "The layout of the graphic design is intended to facilitate the quick comprehension of the displayed information.",
        "The GUI component is divided into two main areas, one for interacting with key terms structures and one for browsing targeted document collections.",
        "The following descriptions should be viewed together with the appropriate figures of the GUI component.",
        "Figure 1, attached at the end of the paper, represents the overall GUI picture.",
        "Figures 2 and 3 capture the area where the interaction with the key term structures occurs.",
        "Figures 4 and 5 present the area for document browsing and key terms selection.",
        "The topic illustrated in the figures is the legal topic \"Medical Malpractice\".",
        "The left area of the GUI component (see figures 2 and 3) is devoted to selecting, retrieving and operating on the key terms generated by the preprocessing component of the prototype system.",
        "As can be seen, the key terms, ranging from single word terms to four word terms, are organized in a tree structure.",
        "The tree is a two dimensional visualization of the term hierarchy.",
        "Single word terms are represented as root nodes and multiple word terms can be positioned uniformly below the parent node in the term hierarchy.",
        "The goal of the visualization is to present the key term lists in such a way that a high percentage of the hierarchy is visible with minimal scrolling.",
        "The user interaction is structured around term retrieval and navigation as the top level user interactions.",
        "The retrieval of the key terms is treated as an iterative process in which the user may select single world terms from the term hierarchy and navigate to multiple word terms accordingly.",
        "The user begins term navigation by selecting from a list of available topics.",
        "In this case, the legal topic \"Medical Malpractice\" (i.e., medmal3) is selected (see figure 2).",
        "Often data structures are organized linearly by some metric.",
        "Frequency of key term usage is the metric used to organize and partition the term hierarchy in an ascending numerical order.",
        "The partitioning is necessary as it is difficult to accommodate the large ratio of the term hierarchy on the screen.",
        "Currently, each partition contains 100 root nodes (or folders), representing single word terms.",
        "Once a partition has been selected, the corresponding document collection is loaded into the document browser.",
        "The browser provides the user with the ability to quickly navigate through the document collection to locate relevant key terms.",
        "Figure 3 The primary interaction with the key term hierarchy is accomplished by direct manipulation of the tree visualization.",
        "The user can select individual nodes in the tree structure by pointing and clicking the corresponding folders.",
        "When selecting nodes with children, the tree will expand, resulting in the display of multiple word terms of the root key term.",
        "For example, when \"malpractice\" is selected as the root key term, a list of multiple word terms will be displayed including multiple key terms such as \"medical malpractice\", \"malpractice cases\", \"medical malpractice action\", \"medical malpractice claims\", \"limitations for medical malpractice\", etc.",
        "(see figure 3) Functionality to shrink and collapse subtrees is also in place.",
        "When a term is selected from the tree, a corresponding term lookup is conducted on the document collection to locate the selected term within the currently displayed document.",
        "Documents representing the four highest frequencies for the selected term will be displayed first.",
        "Upon location the selected term is always highlighted within the document browser."
