        "With the steady decrease of network communication cost and equipment prices, worldwide computer networks and the number of its users are growing very rapidly.",
        "However, there is a large obstacle against global communication over networks, namely the language barrier, especially for non English-speaking people.",
        "This is a major reason personal EJ (English to Japanese) machine translation systems are gaining popularity in Japan.",
        "They help the user to quickly grasp the content of web pages, by providing rough translation.",
        "Since speed and lexical coverage are most important requirements, conventional automatic machine translation systems developed so far are useful for this purpose.",
        "Contrary to the EJ direction, the major task in JE (Japanese to English) direction will be writing short original documents, such as email.",
        "The most important requirement will be translation quality, because the reader is usually different from the MT user.",
        "To control quality, some kind of human interaction will be inevitable.",
        "However, interactive support for conventional MT systems doesn't seem suitable for these users, since they are primarily intended for professional translators.",
        "Their post-editing function often requires working in a special environment that requires special training.",
        "An interactive, easy-to-use translation support facility, targeted for nonprofessional translators, is desirable.",
        "We may expect that these users have basic knowledge and ability to read and understand English.",
        "This expectation is natural and realistic in a country like Japan, where all high-school graduates are supposed to have completed six year course in English.",
        "Their reading skill and grammar knowledge is usually enough to judge the quality of current MT systems, but they may need help from MT systems when browsing the Internet.",
        "For the JE direction, they will not be satisfied with the raw output of conventional MT systems, but it will be too laborious to write down English sentence from scratch.",
        "For these users, online dictionaries have been used because of the reliability of the result.",
        "However, in spite of abundant information within the dictionary such as inflection, verbal case frame, idioms and so on, the only electronically available part is spelling of translation equivalents (through copy & paste).",
        "Other information is only presented to be read as in the case of a paper dictionary, with all further work left to the user.",
        "In this article, we present an interactive translation method and its implementation, which has advantages of both a dictionary lookup tool and a machine translation system.",
        "The system has an interactive interface similar to Kana-Kanji conversion method, and initially serves as a dictionary lookup tool.",
        "After dictionary lookup, the user can invoke syntactic transformation in terms of grammatical information in the dictionary.",
        "Syntactic transformation proceeds step by step in a bottom-up manner, combining smaller translation components into larger ones.",
        "This \"dictionary-based interactive translation\" approach allows the user to fully utilize syntactic information in the dictionary while maintaining clarity of the result.",
        "In the next section, we give a simple example of translation steps and provide a general idea of the method.",
        "In section 3, we describe the basic model and associated operations.",
        "Section 4 gives further",
        "explanation about disambiguation capability of the interactive operations.",
        "Section 5 discusses extensions to the basic model to treat linguistic phenomena such as idiomatic expressions.",
        "Section 6 describes the current implementation as a front-end to an arbitrary application.",
        "In section 7, the method is compared with former approaches.",

        "Our system is running as a daemon.",
        "While the user is typing English characters, the system does nothing special and let them through to the editor window.",
        "The system wakes up when the user toggles on Japanese input.",
        "The moment the first Japanese character is typed in, the main translation window is opened, and all subsequent characters are typed in to that window instead of the editor window.",
        "Suppose the input sentence is one shown in figure 1 (a).",
        "As soon as (a) is entered, the dictionary lookup function is invoked automatically.",
        "A morphological analyzer recognizes word boundaries in the sentence, looks up corresponding word entries in the system dictionary, and shows the result in the main window (b).1 Content words are replaced by a translation equivalent assumed most plausible, while functional words are left unchanged.",
        "This representation step, in which English words (content words) and Japanese words (functional words) are mixed, separates steps for word translation â€¢ and later syntactic transformation, making translation steps clearer.",
        "Since word order and functional words carrying grammatical functions are unchanged, the user can easily recognize the skeleton of the sentence, and clearly grasp the correspondence between the original word and its translation equivalent.",
        "This representation is not only to show the results of dictionary lookup like (Canisius, 1977), but also carries all interactive operations of the method with it, and has a double role of showing information and being objects of interactive manipulation.",
        "Translation equivalent alternatives for the cursor position word (focus word) are displayed in an alternatives window, appearing nearby that word.",
        "Figure 2 is a snapshot of the alternatives window for ronbun (paper).",

        "To see alternatives for another word, the user has only to move the cursor to that word on the main window.",
        "There is also a CD-ROM dictionary access function, making translation equivalent selection easier.",
        "In addition, the user can change an inflection in a similar manner on an inflection selection window, opened by the user's request.",
        "If the user needs only the result of dictionary lookup, s/he can signal the end of translation at this point, just after choosing the translation equivalent.",
        "If a translation is necessary, the user needs to go one more step.",
        "At the same time as initial translation equivalent selection, the system predicts an appropriate area for translation, as shown by an underline (b).",
        "Just as the translation equivalent selection can be freely changed, the area can be changed by dragging the left or right edge of the underline.",
        "After the user confirms selections of translation equivalents and translation area on (b), the user invokes translation.",
        "The system performs syntactic transformation using syntactic information in the dictionary such as the verbal case frame of the main verb in the area, shows the result on the main window, and replaces the original sentence with the result (c).",
        "When there is more than one possible translation, the different possibilities are shown in an alternatives window similar to figure 2, allowing the user to change the choice.",
        "When the user triggers translation end, the result is sent to the original editor window.",
        "The user can continue to work in the editor after turning off Japanese input.",
        "Most important characteristics of this interactive translation method is that the Japanese input is converted to English in several steps allowing user interaction at each step.",
        "In intermediate steps, a mixture",
        "of target language expression and source language expression are shown to give the current status of the interactive translation.",
        "Translation proceeds from a smaller unit as word to a larger unit as sentence, step by step in a bottom-up manner.",
        "The result can be checked and corrected at each step, making it easier to obtain a desired result.",
        "Interactive operations are similar to those of Kana-Kanji conversion, although they are further extended to be capable of controlling syntactic transformations.",

      "heading": "3.1 Basic Model",
      "text": [
        "The basic model of our method is the syntax-directed translation scheme with bottom-up attribute evaluation (see chapter 5 of (Aho et al., 1986)).",
        "In this scheme, an attribute of a syntax tree node is calculated from that of the children nodes by a semantic rule, associated with the syntax rule used to build the node from children.",
        "Attributes represent partial translation result for the structure below the node, and attribute calculation proceeds from the lexical nodes to the root node in a bottom-up manner.",
        "Interactivity is integrated with this model by allowing interactive operation when attribute is calculated at each node.",
        "Before each calculation, the system pauses to show an interpretation of the underlying structure, and allows the user to examine and change it if necessary.",
        "When interaction is finished, the system chooses a next node and pauses there.",
        "This process repeats until the system reaches the root node.",
        "Any translation method can be used as long as it is compatible with this general scheme.",
        "Although basic model is as described, it is apparently too bothersome to give an operation at every node.",
        "In addition, some nodes only have a formal role in the grammar, and are not meaningful to the user.",
        "For this reason, the nodes at which the system automatically pauses for interaction are restricted to the node marked as a sentence, and the node that dominates a relative clause and its antecedent: in short, just restricted to contain one predicate.",
        "We remark that this restriction is effective only on default decision of which node to pause at, and does not restrict operations by the user.",
        "The system looks for a minimal node marked as above, then pauses for user operation.",
        "At this time, attributes of the focus node and lower nodes are still undetermined except for lexical nodes.",
        "When the user triggers translation, undetermined attributes are calculated, then the result replaces the tree under the focus node.",

        "The basic interaction model of the method is that the system shows current interpretation in the form of translation equivalents and translation area, while the user responds to it by changing these initial selections.",

        "When the system pauses for interaction, it shows initial selection of translation equivalents and translation area, as in figure 1 (b).",
        "Translation equivalent selection for all content words, and the designated region to be translated next, is shown in a compact manner, allowing the user to examine and change them before translation.",
        "This mixed representation level of the source and target language expression serves as a playground for all subsequent interactions.",

        "If there are more than one possible translation, the system presents them in a similar window as alternatives window as in figure 2, and the user is allowed to change the system's selection by the same interface as translation equivalent selection.",
        "Translation equivalent selection enables the user to directly manipulate target language expression.",
        "Selecting before translation is much easier than after translation, because the word order and understood syntactic structure is that of the user's native language.",
        "The meaning of translation area selection is also clear.",

        "The essence of this method is limiting search space utilizing distinguished word classes characteristic to idiomatic expressions, revealed by an intensive analysis of these expressions.",
        "A CD-ROM online dictionary accessing function is also provided to help user's translation equivalent selection.",

        "Interactive method in machine translation have been pursued by many people (Kay, 1973; Melby et al., 1980; Tomita, 1984; Huang, 1990; Somerset al., 1990a; Boitet et al., 1995).",
        "In these approaches, the system asks a set of questions to the user to resolve ambiguities not solvable by itself.",
        "Among problems of this approach are, as Melby pointed out, excessive interaction and necessity for special training for interactive operations.",
        "In our method, interactive operations are initiated and guided by the user and all interactive operations are optional, except for a small number of translation triggers needed for translating component sentences.",
        "The system provides its prediction as a default selection, and other possibilities as second or third choices, but the user is free to obey or ignore them.",
        "If the selection is wrong, the translation result becomes wrong, which is a feedback to the user.",
        "Then the user can undo the translation, correct selections, and try again (for example, see figure 3).",
        "On the other hand, the user has only to repeat \"next\" instruction to obtain a result of automatic translation quality.",
        "Frequency and content of interaction are determined by the user.",
        "In this manner, the user and the system are essentially cooperative, avoiding the problem of excessive questioning by the system.",
        "The problem of difficulty in learning interactive operations is also avoided since our interactions are essentially those of simple Kana-Kanji conversion operations.",
        "We believe an average user can easily learn operations of our system.",
        "An interactive dependency parser reported in (Maruyama et al., 1990), is based on an interface like Kana-Kanji conversion, and shares characteristics described above2.",
        "However, their method is limited to syntactic dependency disambiguation by explicitly specifying the words in the dependency relation, and it is difficult to expand the method to handle the types of ambiguity discussed in this paper.",
        "A user-driven approach to interactive translation, proposed by (Somers et al., 1990b), is based on cut and paste operations, where the content of copy buffer is translated when it is pasted.",
        "This method seems to leave too much burden to the user, since the user must explicitly specify which portions of the text should be translated, and in what order.",
        "Also it is not clear how to combine partial translations of two overlapping expressions, except for direct editing.",
        "Our stepwise conversion scheme, in which conversion proceeds from smaller structures to larger ones, is a natural conclusion of our try-and-error-based conversion approach.",
        "As Melby says, a post-editor will only improve by a certain increment: if the result is completely wrong, s/he will simply abandon the whole result.",
        "Since it is easier to obtain an appropriate result for a shorter and simpler structure, a result obtained by stepwise conversion tends to be of better quality than a result obtained by translating the whole structure at one step.",
        "In other words, our system divides the translation step into smaller pieces, and allows post-editing at every step.",
        "As described before, target users of our method are those who have basic knowledge to read and understand the target language.",
        "According to the target language skill of the user, useful support function will be different.",
        "For example, for a user who is competent in English, our system will be useful as an online dictionary.",
        "While writing in English, the user can look up the system dictionary only by entering a Japanese word.",
        "Then s/he can enjoy easy-to-use interactive operations for translation equivalent selection, inflection selection and CD-ROM dictionary access.",
        "When the user find an appropriate word, s/he only has to push the return key to enter the word into the original application.",
        "These users",
        "will also find it useful to obtain a translation equivalent expression for an idiomatic expression.",
        "These idiomatic expressions, either of source language or target language, are hard to translate since they do not allow literal translation and difficult to find in other dictionaries.",
        "By combining this idiom dictionary and translation function, the user can obtain a useful skeleton for target language expression.",
        "For many users, however, the translation function will be considered helpful to produce a result of the quality level that matches their English reading skill.",
        "Suitable usage will be balanced between the user's skill and the capability of the system.",
        "The function as an add-on function to an arbitrary software will be an advantage equally for all users, enabling them to work in their familiar environment, compared to conventional machine-aided translation systems that force them to work in an independent unfamiliar environment.",
        "Finally we discuss some remaining problems and direction of further work.",
        "Translation quality needs continuous effort for improvement, in both linguistic coverage and precision.",
        "Precision of initial prediction of translation equivalent and translation area is crucial to the performance of the system, since they determine the quality of default translation.",
        "In our experience, the users are willing to use interactive operation to improve translation quality, but never to recover from incomprehensible output.",
        "We also have to mention some ambiguities difficult to resolve though basic operations of the method.",
        "An example is grammatical relation ambiguity between a case element and a verb, when the case marker is hidden.",
        "Generally, the system treats these cases by producing all possibilities in the order of priority and allowing the user to choose one.",
        "However, when such ambiguities are multiplied, the number of possibilities easily grows large, making selection difficult.",
        "One possible solution would be to provide more disambiguation information, possibly a sequence of dialogues, to help the user to make decision.",
        "An important requirement here is that these dialogues must not force a response.",
        "The user should be able to ignore them unless they want to.",
        "Another further work is expanding the dictionary, especially idiomatic expressions.",
        "We are also planning to add translation examples to the knowledge base, so that translation can be performed either using grammars or examples in the knowledge base.",
        "These examples are effective to guarantee correctness of the result, hence will be useful even for users not very familiar in the target language.",
        "In this direction, our system would be expanded as a kind of interactive example-based translation support system."
