        "The users would not know the query terms in Japanese even if the search engine accepts Japanese queries.",
        "In addition, even when the users locate a possibly relevant text in Japanese, they will have little idea about what is in the text.",
        "Outputs of off-the-shelf machine translation (MT) systems are often of low-quality, and even \"high-end\" MT systems have problems particularly in translating proper names and specialized domain terms, which often contain the most critical information to the users.",

        "The system consists of the Indexing Module, the Client Module, the Term Translation Module, and the Web Crawler.",
        "The Indexing Module creates and loads indices into a database while the Client Module allows browsing and retrieval of information in the database through a Web browser-based graphical user interface (GUI).",
        "The Term Translation Module is bi-directional; it dynamically translates user queries into target foreign languages and the indexed terms in retrieved documents into the user's native language.",
        "The Web Crawler can be used to add textual information from the WWW; it fetches pages from user-specified Web sites at specified intervals, and queues them up for the Indexing Module to ingest regularly.",
        "For our current application, the system indexes names of people, entities, and locations, and scientific and technical (S&T) terms in both English and Japanese texts, and allows the user to query and browse the database in English.",

        "The Indexing Module indexes names of people, entities, and locations and a list of scientific and technical (S&T) terms using state-of-the-art IE technology.",
        "It uses different configurations of the same fast indexing engine called NameTagTM for different languages.",
        "Two separate configurations (\"indexing servers\") are used for English and Japanese, and how the English and Japanese indexing servers work is described in (Krupka, 1995; Aone, 1996).",
        "In the Sixth Message Understanding Conference (MUC-6), the English system was benchmarked against the Wall Street Journal blind test set for the name tagging task, and achieved a 96% F-measure, which is a combination of recall and precision measures (Adv, 1995),.",
        "Our internal testing of the Japanese system against blind test sets of various Japanese newspaper articles indicates that it achieves from high-80 to low-90% accuracy, depending on the types of corpora.",
        "Indexing names in Japanese texts is usually more challenging than English for two main reasons.",
        "First, there is no case distinction in Japanese, whereas English names in newspapers are capitalized, and capitalization is a very strong clue for English name tagging.",
        "Second, Japanese words are not separated by spaces and therefore must be segmented into separate words before the name tagging process.",
        "As segmentation is not 100% accurate, segmentation errors can sometimes cause name tagging rules not to fire or to misfire.",
        "Indexing of names is particularly useful in the Japanese case as it can improve overall segmentation and thus indexing accuracy.",
        "In English, since words are separated by spaces, there is no issue of indexing accuracy for individual words.",
        "On the other hand, in languages like Japanese, where word boundaries are not explicitly marked by spaces, indexing accuracy of individual words depends on accuracy of word segmentation.",
        "However, most segmentation algorithms are more likely to make errors on names, as these are less likely to be in the lexicons.",
        "Name tagging can reduce such errors by identifying names as single units.",
        "Both indexing servers are \"intelligent\" because they identify and disambiguate names with high speed and accuracy.",
        "They identify names in texts dynamically rather than relying on finite lists of names.",
        "Thus, they can identify names which they have never seen before.",
        "In addition, they can disambiguate types of names so that a person named \"Washington\" is distinguished from a place called Washington, and a company \"Apple\" can be distinguished from a common noun \"apple.\" In addition, they can generate aliases of names automatically (e.g., \"ANA\" for \"All Nippon Airline\") and link variants of names within a document.",
        "As the indexing servers process texts, the indexed terms are stored in a relational database with their semantic type information (person, entity, place, S&T term) and alias information along with such meta data as source, date, language, and frequency information.",
        "The system can use any ODBC (Open DataBase Connectivity)-compliant database, and form-based Boolean queries from the Client Module, similar to those seen in any Web search engine, are translated into standard SQL queries automatically.",
        "We have decided to use commercial databases for our applications as we are not only indexing strings of terms but also adding much richer information on indexed terms available through the use of IE technology.",

        "The Client Module then retrieves documents which match either the original English query or the translated Japanese query.",
        "As the indices are names and terms which may consist of multiple words (e.g, \"Bill Clinton,\" \"personal computer\"), the query terms are delimited in separate boxes in the form, making sure no ambiguity occurs in both translation and retrieval.",
        "The user has the choice of selecting the sources (e.g, Washington Post, Nikkei Newspaper, Web pages), languages (e.g., English, Japanese, or both), and specific date ranges of documents to constrain queries.",

        "Figure 4).",
        "Once the user selects a particular document for viewing, the client sends the document to an appropriate (i.e., English or Japanese) indexing server for creating hyperlinks for the indexed terms and in the case of a Japanese document, sends the indexed terms to the Term Translation Module to translate the Japanese terms into English.",

        "We have written rules which maps phonetic transcriptions to katakana letters, and generated possible Japanese katakana translations for given English names.",
        "As transliterations of the same English names may differ, multiple katakana translations may be generated for single English names.",

        "In (Aone et al., 1994), we have shown that, in an application of extracting information from foreign language texts and presenting the results in English, the \"MT first, IE second\" approach was less accurate than the approach in the reverse order, i.e., \"IE first, MT second\".",
        "In particular, translation quality of names by even the best MT systems is poor.",
        "There are two cases where an MT system fails to translate names.",

        "This is a non-trivial problem in languages such as Japanese where words are not segmented by spaces and there is no capitalization convention.",
        "Often, an MT system \"chops up\" names into words and translates each word individually.",
        "For example, among the errors we have encountered, an MT system failed to recognize a person name \"Mori Hanae\" in kanji characters, segmented it into three words \"mori,\" \"hana,\" and \"e\" and translated them into \"forest,\" \"England\" and \"blessing,\" respectively.",
        "Another common MT system error is where the system fails to make a distinction between names and non-names.",
        "This distinction is very important in getting correct translations as names are usually translated very differently from non-names.",
