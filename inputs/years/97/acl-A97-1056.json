        "In this paper word–sense disambiguation is cast as a problem in supervised learning, where a classifier is induced from a corpus of sense–tagged text.",
        "Suppose there is a training sample where each sense– tagged sentence is represented by the feature variables (F1, ..., F„_1, S).",
        "Selected contextual properties of the sentence are represented by (F1, ...,Fn_1) and the sense of the ambiguous word is represented by S. Our task is to induce a classifier that will predict the value of S given an untagged sentence represented by the contextual feature variables.",
        "We adopt a statistical approach whereby a probabilistic model is selected that describes the interactions among the feature variables.",
        "Such a model can form the basis of a probabilistic classifier since it specifies the probability of observing any and all combinations of the values of the feature variables.",
        "Suppose our training sample has N sense–tagged sentences.",
        "There are q possible combinations of values for the n feature variables, where each such combination is represented by a feature vector.",
        "Let",
        "fi and 0i be the frequency and probability of observing the iih feature vector, respectively.",
        "Then (11, , fq) has a multinomial distribution with parameters (N, 01, ...,0q).",
        "The 0 parameters, i.e., the joint parameters, define the joint probability distribution of the feature variables.",
        "These are the parameters of the fully saturated model, the model in which the value of each variable directly affects the values of all the other variables.",
        "These parameters can be estimated as maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs), such that the estimate of 0i, 0i, is k. For these estimates to be reliable, each of the q possible combinations of feature values must occur in the training sample.",
        "This is unlikely for NLP data samples, which are often sparse and highly skewed (c.f., e.g. (Pedersen et al., 1996) and (Zipf, 1935)).",
        "However, if the data sample can be adequately characterized by a less complex model, i.e., a model in which there are fewer interactions between variables, then more reliable parameter estimates can be obtained: In the case of decomposable models (Dar-roch et al., 1980; see below), the parameters of a less complex model are parameters of marginal distributions, so the MLEs involve frequencies of combinations of values of only subsets of the variables in the model.",
        "How well a model characterizes the training sample is determined by measuring the fit of the model to the sample, i.e., how well the distribution defined by the model matches the distribution observed in the training sample.",
        "A good strategy for developing probabilistic classifiers is to perform an explicit model search to select the model to use in classification.",
        "This paper presents the results of a comparative study of search strategies and evaluation criteria for measuring model fit.",
        "We restrict the selection process to the class of decomposable models (Darroch et al., 1980), since restricting model search to this class has many computational advantages.",
        "We begin with a short description of decomposable models (in section 2).",

        "Decomposable models are those graphical models that express the joint distribution as the product of the marginal distributions of the variables in the maximal cliques of the graphical representation, scaled by the marginal distributions of variables common to two or more of these maximal sets.",
        "Because their joint distributions have such closed-form expressions, the parameters can be estimated directly from the training data without the need for an iterative fitting procedure (as is required, for example, to estimate the parameters of maximum entropy models; (Berger et al., 1996)).",
        "3.",
        "Although there are far fewer decomposable models than log-linear models for a given set of feature variables, it has been shown that they have substantially the same expressive power (Whittaker, 1990).",
        "The joint parameter estimate fF fF33 S is the probability that the feature vector (11, f2, 13, s,) will be observed in a training sample where each observation is represented by the feature variables (F1, F2, F3, S).",

        "MLEs of the model parameters are simply the marginal frequencies normalized by the sample size N. The joint parameter estimate is formulated as a normalized product:",
        "Rather than having to observe the complete feature vector (fl, f2, f3, si) in the training sample to estimate the joint parameter, it is only necessary to observe the marginals (fi , Si) and (12,13,81)."
