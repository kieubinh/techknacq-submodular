        "The syntactic structures are computed by our syntactic parser and the output shows in a human-friendly graphic interface (1) word features (as computed by POS tagger) (2) non-recursive phrases (as computed by shallow parser) and (3) their relations (the functional structure).",
        "It will be a closed demo.",
        "The outputs will be split into sets in order to focus on the resolution of different kinds of problems (i.e. coordination, long distance subject-verb relation, preposition/determiner resolution).",

        "The tags of the words can also be shown or hidden.",
        "This principle allows to concentrate on word-level or on dependency-level and allows to check precisely the behavior of our parser on specific relation types.",
        "A trace mode enables the step by step display of the construction of the analysis.",
        "In a near future, a graphic comparison between two outputs will be available to control the modification of the rule base and to point out easily the differences.",
        "This comparison between two outputs can also be used to compare an output and an expected output."
