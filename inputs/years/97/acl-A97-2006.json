        "Many studies have been carried out on machine translation and a number of problems has been recognized.",
        "Rule-based machine translation (Hutchins and Somers, 1992) could not deal adequately with various linguistic phenomena due to the use of limited rules.",
        "To resolve this problem, Example-based machine translation (Sato and Nagao, 1990) has recently been proposed.",
        "However, this method requires many translation examples to achieve a practical and high-quality translation.",
        "Echizen-ya and others previously proposed a method of Machine Translation using Inductive Learning with Genetic Algorithms (GA-ILMT), and this method has been evaluated(Echizen-ya et al., 1996).",
        "By applying genetic algorithms, we consider that our proposed method can effectively solve problems that Example-based machine translation would require many translation examples.",
        "However, the results of the evaluation experiments show that this method has some problems.",
        "The main problem is that many erroneous translation rules are produced and these rules cannot be completely removed from the dictionary.",
        "Therefore, we need to improve how to apply genetic algorithms to be able to remove erroneous translation rules.",
        "In this paper, we describe an improvement in the selection process of GA-ILMT, and confirm the effectiveness of improvement in the selection process of GA-ILMT."

      "text": [
        "In the previous method of selection process described in Section 2, translation rules are evaluated only when they are used in the translation process.",
        "These translation rules are part of all the translation rules in the dictionary.",

        "To resolve this problem, we propose an improvement in the selection process.",
        "Our proposed improvement does not require any analytical knowledge as initial condition.",
        "Methods that use analytical knowledge have some problems, such as difficulty in dealing with unregistered words.",
        "We consider that this problem can be resolved by the learning method without any analytical knowledge.",
        "Therefore, we consider that our proposed improvement can remove many erroneous translation rules by utilizing only the given translation examples without the requirement of analytical knowledge.",
        "The system evaluates the translation rules by utilizing the given translation examples directly.",
        "Namely, it determines whether a combination of the English word and the Japanese word in a translation rule is true or false by utilizing the given translation examples.",
        "The combination may be true when it exists in a given translation example.",
        "For example, the combination of words which are \"I\" in English and \"Watashil (In Japanese \"I\" )\" in Japanese is true when this combination exists in a given translation example.",
        "On the other hand, the combination of words which are \"volleyball\" in English and \"Basukettoboru(In Japanese \"basketball\" )\" in Japanese is false when this combination does not exist in all given translation examples.",
        "In the all combinations of words in a translation rule, the system determines whether the each combination of words is true or false.",
        "And the system determines the rate of error based on the number of erroneous combinations, and removes the translation rules for which the rate of error is high."
