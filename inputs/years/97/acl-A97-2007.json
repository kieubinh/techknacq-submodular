        "It uses natural language for both input and output, and can handle a variety of syntactic constructions and lexical items, including sentence fragments and misspelled words."

        "One of the important topics which beginning medical students must learn is how blood pressure is regulated in the human body.",
        "When something happens to change the blood pressure, such as a change in the volume of blood in the body, the body must compensate.",
        "The negative feedback loop which controls this process, known as the baroreceptor reflex, can be a difficult topic for students.",

        "Students are asked to predict the value of the seven parameters at three points in time: the DR or direct response stage immediately after the precipitating event, the RR or reflex response stage after the nervous system responds, and the SS or new steady state stage.",
        "When students start CiRcsim-Tutor, they see the main user interface screen illustrated in Figure 2.",
        "The precipitating event (a broken pacemaker in this case) is shown at the top of the screen.",
        "One side of the screen contains room for students to enter their predictions.",

        "Spelling correction is an important aspect of the input understander, as students frequently misspell words, abbreviate creatively, and make word boundary errors (two words joined together or a single word split in two).",
        "Spelling correction is based on a three-way match algorithm which slides a small window simultaneously across both the unknown input word and a candidate word from the lexicon.",
