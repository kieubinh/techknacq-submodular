        "Two strategies address the goal of minimizing the amount of linguistics expertise required to develop applications with the NL Assistant toolkit.",
        "To reduce the amount of lexical information that the developer must add, large-scale lexical resources have been integrated with the toolkit.",
        "These include Comlex and WordNet as well as additional, internally developed resources.",
        "The second strategy is to provide easy to use editors for entering linguistic information.",
        "Lexical information is supplied by four external servers which are accessed by the natural language engine during processing.",
        "Syntactic information is supplied by a lexical server based on the 50K word Comlex dictionary available from the Linguistic Data Consortium.",
        "Semantic information comes from two servers, a KB server based on the noun portion of WordNet (70K concepts), and a semantics server containing case frame information for 2500 English verbs.",
        "A denotations server using unique concept names generated for each WordNet synset at ISI links the words in the lexicon to the concepts in the KB.",
        "When the engine is connected to the servers, whenever lexical information for specific words cannot be found in the local engine, it is requested from the servers.",
        "When the servers cannot supply lexical information for a particular word, various heuristics are used to hypothesize the missing information.",
        "When hypothesized information is wrong, it can be corrected by using the editors.",
        "Although the servers minimize the amount of linguistic work that needs to be done to develop an application, they do not eliminate it.",
        "The main reason for this is that a particular application will make use of words that do not exist in the dictionary.",
        "For example, in our initial applications these have included words such as the verbs 'OEM', 'interface', `download', and 'customize'.",
        "To improve the",
        "ease of use of the linguistic development environment, several special-purpose editors have also been implemented.",
        "These include editors for lexical, semantic, and knowledge-base work.",
        "The figure below illustrates an editing session in the semantic rule editor for the verb advise."

        "Linking the application-independent semantic representation to the back-end application software is the task of the application module.",
        "To reduce the amount of time required to develop an application and the amount of expertise required, we have structured the application module into a set of several different types of rules.",
        "(Norton, et.",
        "al., 1996) The tasks these rules have to perform are: (1) map the user's utterance into an utterance class which consists of pragmatically equivalent utterances.",
        "(2) determine, based on the user's utterance, the state of the dialog, and any other information relevant to the application (such as the state of a database) what to do next (3) perform the next action or set of actions.",
        "Actions include saying something to the user, retrieving information from a database, and resetting the dialog to a new state.",
        "These rules are written in Prolog.",
        "The toolkit provides an editor for editing and managing these rules.",
        "In addition, the toolkit provides tools for automatically generating rules in the special case of applications which do not control a dialog."
