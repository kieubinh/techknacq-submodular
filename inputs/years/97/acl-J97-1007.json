        "Most of the well-known systems first select and organize the message contents to be generated and then map the organized results into a sequence of surface sentences.",
        "When mapping into the surface form, the selection of appropriate forms for anaphora is very important to make the generated text a cohesive unit (McDonald 1980; Dale 1992).",
        "In this paper, our goal is the computer generation of anaphora in Chinese.",
        "In Chinese, anaphora can be classified as zero, pronominal, and nominal forms, as exemplified in (1) by 011, tal 'he' and nage ren\"that person', respectively (Chen 1987).1 Zero anaphora are generally noun phrases that are understood from the context and do not need to be specified.",

        "(he) recognize that person is who '(He) recognized who that person is.' This research starts with establishing possible rules for the generation of anaphora in Chinese.",
        "Previous work suggests obtaining these rules from consulting the results of linguistic study, including general principles, such as the Gricean maxims (Grice 1975) used in (Dale and Haddock 1991; Reiter and Dale 1992; Dale 1992) and focus theory, as used in (Dale 1992).",
        "A shortcoming of previous work is that it is unclear to what extent the resulting rules are effective in dealing with the generation of anaphora.",
        "In an attempt to overcome this, we adopt an empirical approach to obtaining rules based on observations of real texts.",
        "The basic methodology used is to start with a set of human-generated Chinese texts and the simplest possible anaphor generation rule (a rule that only considers the locality of anaphora).",
        "We then progressively add extra tests to the rule, based on independently motivated but simple linguistic principles.",
        "At each stage, we conduct experiments that compare the anaphora occurring in the human-generated text with those in the texts that would be generated by a computer taking the same syntactic and semantic content as the human texts and generating Chinese anaphora according to the rule being tested (this has to be simulated by hand).",
        "This process continues until a rule with promising performance on the data is obtained.",
        "The objective is thus to answer the question of how complex a rule must be to account for the complexity of anaphor generation exhibited by the test data.",
        "This paper presents one sequence of rules developed using the above methodology and evaluates the effectiveness of the new linguistic principles taken into account at each point.",
        "At present, we have chosen only one intuitively plausible way to generate increasingly complex rules, with refinements introduced as they occurred to us (though not motivated by the data).",
        "Clearly the work could and should be extended to consider all possible combinations of the principles in all possible orders.",
        "Except where noted below, the preselected Chinese data serves as an independent test of the effectiveness of the different rules, which are based on principles that have been independently suggested in the literature.",
        "However, the fact that the chosen data determine the termination condition for the development means that the rules could be overfitting the chosen data.",
        "Therefore a selection of the rules have been implemented in a Chinese natural language generation system and their results are further evaluated by means of an experiment using native speakers.",
        "This paper concentrates on the use of zero, pronominal, and nominal anaphora in Chinese generated text.",
        "We are not concerned with lexical anaphora (Tutin and Kittredge 1992) where the anaphor and its antecedent share meaning components,",
        "while the anaphor belongs to an open lexical class.",
        "For example, flower can be used as a lexical anaphor for rose (Tutin and Kittredge 1992).",
        "In Sections 2 to 3.3, we establish the rules for the generation of anaphora in Chinese.",
        "We consider the case of zero anaphora (Section 2) first, followed by nonzero anaphora (Section 3), which divides into pronouns (Section 3.1) and nominal anaphora (Sections 3.2 and 3.3).",

        "Previous work on the generation of referring expressions focused on producing minimal distinguishing descriptions (Dale and Haddock 1991; Dale 1992; Reiter and Dale 1992) or descriptions customized for different levels of hearers (Reiter 1990).",
        "Since we are not concerned with the generation of descriptions for different levels of users, we look only at the former group of work, which aims at generating descriptions for a subsequent reference to distinguish it from the set of entities with which it might be confused.",
        "The main data structure in these algorithms is a context set, which is the set of entities the hearer is currently assumed to be attending to, except the intended referent.",
        "Minimal distinguishing descriptions pursue efficiency in producing an adequate description that can identity the intended referent unambiguously with a given context set.",
        "Dale (1992) used the global focus space (Grosz and Sidner 1986), as the context set in his domain of small discourse.",
        "Following this idea, the context set grows as the discourse proceeds.",
        "Consider, for example, two nominal anaphora referring to the same entity occurring at different places in a discourse.",
        "According to the above algorithms, a single description would be produced for both anaphora if the context sets at both places contain the same elements.",
        "On the other hand, in general, a description with more distinguishing information is used for the second anaphor if distractors have entered into the context set.",
        "Two entities are said to be distractors to",
        "each other if they are of the same category.",
        "For example, the black dog and the brown dog are distractors to each other because they are of the same category, dog.",
        "The entity, the big cat, is not a distractor to the black dog because it is of different category, cat.",
        "Grosz and Sidner (1986) claim that discourse segmentation is an important factor, though obviously not the only one, governing the use of referring expressions.",
        "If the idea of context set were restricted to local focus space (Grosz and Sidner 1986), then the resulting descriptions would be to some extent sensitive to local aspects of discourse structure.",
        "Although the algorithms would be refined due to the introduction of more discourse structure, they would essentially still serve the purpose of distinguishing potential referents.",
        "The beginnings of discourse segments, in a sense, indicate shifts of intention in a discourse (Grosz and Sidner 1986).",
        "In this situation, it may be preferred that subsequent references be full descriptions rather than reduced ones or pronouns, to emphasize the beginning of discourse segments, even if the referents have just been mentioned in the immediately previous utterance.",
        "See Grosz and Sidner (1986) and Dale (1992) for some examples that illustrate this idea.",
        "Figure 8 indicates that a similar situation may happen in Chinese discourse.",
        "Among the groups of initial and subsequent references, we focus on the one indexed j, la fengzheng de xian 'the string pulling the kite'.",
        "After it is initially introduced in (b), it then appears in zero and nominal forms alternatively in the rest of the discourse, as shown schematically in Figure 9.",
        "At the beginning of the second \"sentence,\" it appears in a full description and then in four reduced descriptions in the rest of the \"sentence.\"6 It is not mentioned in the third \"sentence.\" When it is reintroduced into the fourth \"sentence,\" it appears in another full noun phrase, piao zai kongzhong de xian 'the string fluttering in the sky,' which is not reduced.",
        "Then, in the last \"sentence,\" it repeats the same patterns as in the second \"sentence.\" Since there are no distracting elements for the string in the discourse, the use of full descriptions at the beginning of \"sentences,\" (e) and (g), can be interpreted as emphasizing that a new discourse segment, \"sentence,\" has begun.",
        "The accompanying reduced descriptions can then be explained as being intended to contrast with the emphasis at the beginning of \"sentences.\" Note that a full description is used for the subsequent reference in (p) that is not at the beginning of a \"sentence\" because it is the first mention in the \"sentence.\" Thus, we would generalize the above interpretation to be that a full description is preferred for a subsequent reference if it is at the beginning of a \"sentence\" or the first mention in the \"sentence\"; otherwise, a reduced description is preferred.",
        "Should distracting elements occur in a \"sentence,\" a sufficiently distinguishable description is required for a subsequent reference within the \"sentence\" instead of a reduced one, even if it has been mentioned previously in the \"sentence,\" for example, yuanwan 'the round bowl' in (2d) and fangwan 'the square bowl' in (2e).7 (2) a. zhaolai tongyang daxiao de liangkuai tiepi, get same big-small NOM two iron-piece 'Get two pieces of iron of the same size.'",

        "Basically, the main goal of our work is to generate coherent texts by taking advantage of various forms of anaphora in Chinese.",
        "The system, like conventional ones (McKeown 1985; Maybury 1990; Dale 1992; Hovy 1993), is divided into strategic and tactical components.",
        "Since we do not aim at inventing new concepts in content planning, we borrow the idea of text planning in Maybury's TEXPLAN system (Maybury 1990) as the basis of the strategic component.",
        "As for the tactical component, we have constructed a simple Chinese grammar in the PATR formalism (Shieber 1986), which is sufficient for our purpose at the current stage.",
        "On accepting an input goal from the user, the system invokes the text planner according to the operators in the plan library to build a hierarchical discourse structure that satisfies the input goal.",
        "After the text planning is finished, the decision of anaphoric forms and descriptions is then carried out by traversing the plan tree.",
        "Within the traversal, when a reference is met, if it is a subsequent one, then the program consults Rule 5 to obtain a form: zero, pronominal, or nominal.",
        "If the nominal form is chosen, then the preference rule is consulted to get a description.",
        "In the domain knowledge base, each entity, in addition to the information for the head noun in the surface form, is accompanied by a property list that will be realized in the modification part of the surface noun phrase for the initial reference.",
        "We build up the semantic structure of an initial reference by taking all the elements in the property list, along with the substance of the entity, corresponding to the head noun in the surface noun phrase.",
        "To simplify the work, for the moment, only one element is stored in the property list.",
        "When a full description is chosen for a subsequent reference, its semantic structure contains the same property and substance information as the initial reference.",
        "On the other hand, if a reduced description is decided on, only the substance is taken into the semantic structure.",
        "In the future, we will extend the property list by allowing multiple elements in the list.",
        "The tests of locality, syntactic constraints, and salience are straightforward to implement because the system has complete knowledge of the discourse to be generated",
        "and its syntactic structure.",
        "Only the tests of discourse structure and animacy are difficult, and for these we have had to approximate what a more sophisticated system might be able to do.",

        "Evaluation is becoming an increasingly important issue for natural language generation systems (Meteer and McDonald 1991), though, unfortunately, there are still no generally accepted methods.",
        "In this work, we were particularly concerned to find a method of evaluation that reflected directly on the anaphor generation of the system (unlike \"black box\" evaluation of the kind we had done before [Levine and Mellish 1995]).",
        "We were also wary of asking human subjects to estimate the \"readability\" or \"coherence\" of texts (though this seemed to work well for Acker and Porter [1994]).",

        "After the annotations were collected, we compared the speakers' results with the generated texts to investigate the performance of the test rules.",
        "In each comparison, we noted down the number of matches between the computer-generated text and the human result.",

        "On average, the matching rate of TR3 is 76%, compared with the other systems, the matching rate of TR1 is 72% and of TR2 is 74%.",
        "This average matching rate, however, is lower than the matching rates we obtained in the empirical studies described previously.",
        "The problem is partly because the test texts used in the former comparison are human-created, while the test texts used here are computer-generated.",
        "The grammatical structures of the computer-generated texts are simplified; they are not as sophisticated as human texts.",
        "When asked to decide their preferences for anaphora in the computer-generated texts, speakers may find the information shown in the test texts less complete than what they are used to in creating their own texts and hence it may be difficult for them to make decisions.",
        "In the empirical study, the human-created texts perhaps provided enough information for the hypothetical computer to decide on an appropriate anaphoric form.",
        "A more important reason why the matching rates are lower with speakers than with the hypothetical computer may be that in some circumstances, more than one solution may be acceptable and the speakers may not always choose the same one as the computer.",
        "This hypothesis can be investigated by looking at the extent to which the speakers agree among themselves.",
        "To see how the speakers agree among themselves, we compared speakers' annotations.",
        "The comparison result is shown in Table 5.",
        "For each speaker, the number for each test text is the average of matches with the other eleven speakers.",
        "At the end of the table are the average numbers for the speakers' agreement among themselves.",

        "The measure of agreement gets worse if only the zero/ pronoun/ nominal distinction is considered or if zero and nonzero pronouns are lumped together.",
        "Only two speakers agree with one another with a kappa value of more than 0.7 (none with a value of greater than 0.8).",
        "The speakers as a whole agreed with kappa greater than 0.7 on only 30 out of the 80 anaphora, with complete agreement only 14 times.",
        "To get an overall agreement of greater than 0.8 would require reducing the set of speakers from 12 to a carefully selected 3.",
        "Since all systems produce the same result on Text 1, unsurprisingly they all have the same matching rate, as shown in Table 4.",
        "Text 2 contains three topic shifts that would make the rule containing the salience constraint, TR3, obtain different output",
        "from those without this constraint.",
        "TR/ and TR2 produce the same output and hence they obtain the same matching rate, 70%.",
        "TR3 obtains higher matching rates than the other two, 79%, which shows the effectiveness of the salience constraint in it.",
        "Another middle-sized test text, Text 3, is broken into three \"sentences\" and contains three topic shifts.",
        "The constraints on discourse segment beginnings in TR2 and TR3 and the salience constraint in TR3 would therefore have some effects on the output texts.",
        "The matching rate, as shown in Table 4, increases from 62% to 66% for TR2, which shows that the constraint on discourse segment beginnings in TR2 is effective.",
        "TR3 obtains a 65% matching rate, on average, which is 1% lower than its predecessor TR2.",
        "However, this decrease in average matching rate does not negate the effectiveness of the salience constraint in TR3.",
        "TR2's text differs from TR3's in the three topic shifts: TR2 generates zero anaphora for these shifts, while TR3 generates full descriptions.",
        "The speakers varied greatly in choosing anaphoric forms for these topic shifts: among 12 speakers, 4 chose all full descriptions, 3 used all zero anaphora, and the other 5 chose zero, pronominal, and nominal anaphora.",
        "Thus, 4 of the 12 speakers completely agree with TR3, while 3 agree with TR2.",
        "This shows that the salience constraint in TR3 is still effective.",
        "Next, we examine the more complicated texts, Texts 4 and 5.",
        "As shown in Table 4, the increases in matching rates show the effectiveness of the constraint on discourse segments beginning in TR2.",
        "Again, the average matching rates of TR3 are sightly lower than TR2 for these two texts.",
        "However, similar to the situation in Text 3, the speakers have varied agreement on the choice of anaphora for the topic shiftings in these two texts.",
        "For Text 4, 3 speakers completely agree with TR2 and 1 speaker agrees with TR3.",
        "As for Text 5, 2 speakers completely agree with TR2, while the others partly agree with TR2 and TR3.",
        "The discussions above show that the salience constraint in TR3 is sometimes effective in getting small improvements in the output texts.",
        "In brief, the more sophisticated constraints a rule contains, the better it performs.",
        "Both TR2 and TR3 perform better than TR1.",
        "TR3 performs better than TR2 for texts with simple discourse segment structure.",
        "For the texts having complicated discourse segment structures, TR2 is slightly better than TR3 on average matching rates.",
        "Adding the results of the rules to those of the speakers leads to a slight decrease in kappa for TR/ but progressively better (though only from 0.41 to 0.43) values for kappa for TR2 and TR3.",
        "This indicates that the better rules seem to disagree with the speakers no more than the speakers disagree among themselves.",
        "There are nine anaphora where the kappa score including TR3 is less than that for the speakers alone (in many other cases, the results are better).",
        "These seem to involve places where the speakers were more willing to use a zero pronoun (where the system used a reduced nominal anaphor) and where the speakers reduced nominal anaphora less than the system did."

        "The results obtained from an implementation of this rule, however, correlated less well with human performance.",
        "It is hard to determine the reason for this, though the problems of reliably implementing all the constraints, presenting the anaphora within natural-looking texts and, above all, coping with the disagreements between native speakers, all probably make a contribution.",

        "In the final rule, the implementation of the test of the beginning of a discourse segment is not quite as straightforward as the other constraints.",
        "In our current implementation, we rely on the hierarchical structure of the message content to be generated as the basis for dividing the message into segments, which is effective in improving the texts generated by our Chinese natural language generation system.",
        "The evaluation result also shows that the rule using all constraints collected from the empirical study performs better than one with simpler constraints.",
        "In the future, this work needs to be further developed to deal with anaphora in other types of texts and the use of connectives in generated text to create cohesive discourse.",
        "In addition the constraints for pronominal anaphora could be improved, and the implementation extended to satisfy other types of applications."
