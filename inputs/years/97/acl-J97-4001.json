        "Letter-to-sound rules, also known as grapheme-to-phoneme rules, are important computational tools and have been used for a variety of purposes including word or name lookups for database searches and speech synthesis.",
        "These rules are especially useful when integrated into database searches on names and addresses, since they can complement orthographic search algorithms that make use of permutation, deletion, and insertion by allowing for a comparison with the phonetic equivalent.",
        "In databases, phonetics can help retrieve a word or a proper name without the user needing to know the correct spelling.",
        "A phonetic index is built with the vocabulary of the application.",
        "This could be an entire dictionary, or a list of proper names.",
        "The searched word is then converted into phonetics and retrieved with its information, ff the word is in the phonetic index.",
        "This phonetic lookup can be used to retrieve a misspelled word in a dictionary or a database, or in a text editor to suggest corrections.",
        "Such rules are also necessary to formalize grapheme-phoneme correspondences in speech synthesis architecture.",
        "In text-to-speech systems, these rules are typically used to create phonemes from computer text.",
        "These phonemic symbols, in turn, are used to feed lower-level phonetic modules (such as timing, intonation, vowel formant trajectories, etc.)",
        "which, in turn, feed a vocal tract model and finally output a waveform and, via a digital-analogue converter, synthesized speech.",
        "Such rules are a necessary and integral part of a text-to-speech system since a database lookup (dictionary search) is not sufficient to handle derived forms, new words, nonce forms, proper nouns, low-frequency technical jargon, and the like; such forms typically are not included in the database.",
        "And while the use of a dictionary is more important now that denser and faster memory is available to smaller systems, letter-to-sound still plays a crucial and central role in speech synthesis technology.",
        "Grapheme-to-phoneme technology is also useful in speech recognition, as a way of generating pronunciations for new words that may be available in grapheme form, or for naive users to add new words more easily.",
        "In that case, the system must generate the multiple variations of the word.",
        "While there are different problems in languages that use non-alphabetic writing systems (syllabaries, as in Japanese, or logographic systems, as in Chinese) (DeFrancis 1984), all alphabetic systems have a structured set of correspondences.",
        "These range from the trivial in languages like Spanish or Swahili, to extremely complex in languages such as English and French.",
        "This paper",
        "will outline some of the previous attempts to construct such rule sets and will describe new and successful approaches to the construction of letter-to-sound rules for English and French."

        "The interest in letter-to-sound rules goes back centuries and can be found (in relatively unsystematic descriptions) in many of the older descriptive grammars of languages such as English and French.",
        "The paucity of literature in grapheme-to-phoneme translation is partially due to the fact that the field of linguistics, and in particular, descriptive linguistics, has traditionally shied away from the writing system (except as a study in its own right) since the phonological system was considered of primary importance.",
        "Papers on the subject are rarely found in linguistics journals.",
        "Nevertheless, there have been some important studies done on grapheme-phoneme correspondences in past years; for English: Ainsworth (1973), Bakiri and Dietterich (1991), Bernstein and Nessly (1981), Elovitz et al.",
        "(1976), Hertz (1979, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1985), Hunnicutt (1976, 1980), Levin (1963), McCormick and Hertz (1989), McIlroy (1974), O'Malley (1990), Venezky (1962, 1967a, 1967b, 1967c, 1970), Venezky and Weir (1966), Vitale (1991), Weir (1964); for French: Auberg6 (1991), Béchet, Spriet, and El-Béze (1996), Catach (1989), Catach and Catach (1992), Cotto (1992), Divay (1984, 1985, 1990a, 1990b, 1991, 1994), Laporte (1988), Prouts (1980), Yvon (1996).",
        "Some of these studies (Weir 1964; Venezky 1966, 1970) were more descriptive in nature and represented a solid base of data from which a rule set could be built.",
        "These works consisted of tables of correspondences and examples of words containing these correspondences.",
        "These studies made use of phonetic, phonemic, or even morphophonemic form such as palatalization (credulity, cuticle, etc.",
        "), morphophonemic alternation (symmetry vs. symmetric) and even morphology (singer vs. finger).",
        "Other studies included pause (McIlroy 1974) and even syntactic information (Divay 1984, 1985).",
        "More recent studies have attempted to use learning algorithms to incorporate pronunciation by analogy (Dedina and Nusbaum 1991), a neural network or connectionist approach to the problem (Sejnowski and Rosenberg 1986; Bakiri and Dietterich 1991; Gonzalez and Tubach 1982; Lucas and Damper 1992), automatic alignment by an induction method (Hochberg et al.",
        "1991); a computational approach (Klatt and Shipman 1982; Klatt 1987), an information theoretic approach (Lucassen and Mercer 1984), hidden Markov models (Parfitt and Sharman 1991), and a case-based approach (Golding 1991).",
        "Some have even developed a bidirectional approach of letter-to-sound as well as sound-to-letter (Meng 1995), which is a hybrid of databased and rule-driven approaches and is also useful for automatic speech recognition.",
        "This paper will focus on a rule-based approach, as for example in Allen (1979).",

        "The various attempts at rule formulation were related to differences in the phonemic inventory, the number of rules, the type and format of rules, and even the direction of parse of the rules (whether they were scanned from left to right or from right to left).",
        "Different approaches were also taken in the size of the dictionary, the algorithm used to scan or rescan the dictionary (if one was used), the methods for determining lexical stress placement, the amount of morphological analysis used, and the difficulties in the prediction of the correct phonemic form of homographs.",
        "Part of the educational process for a child is learning to read, and educational literature is filled with disparate pedagogical approaches to this problem.",
        "Developing a letter-to-sound rule set in software is essentially teaching the computer how to read (pronounce) a language.",
        "The difficulty in developing an accurate algorithm to perform this task is directly proportional to the fit between graphemes and corresponding"

        "Any procedure to convert text into phonemes would necessarily make use of a lexical database or dictionary to provide for lookup of words prior to letter-to-sound conversion.",
        "Such a database typically consists of words that exhibit unusual stress patterns (for languages such as English), and of unassimilated or partially assimilated loanwords including place names and personal names that do not fit into the canonical phonological or phonotactic form of the language.",
        "Memory is increasingly less expensive and we now have the capability to store in memory a large number of words (along with their phonetic equivalent, grammatical class, and meaning).",
        "Why not then store all words (or certainly all of the words that would be commonly encountered in text) in memory?",
        "First, if we include derived forms and technical jargon, there are well over three-quarters of a million words in the English or French language.",
        "It would be an extremely difficult task to create such a list.",
        "More importantly, new words come into the language every day and from these are generated many derived forms.",
        "Lastly, when we factor in items that may not even be found in a dictionary, such as proper nouns (first names, surnames, place names, names of corporations, etc.",
        "), the necessity of a rule-governed approach quickly becomes apparent.",
        "For example, there are roughly 1.5 million different surnames in the US alone (Spiegel 1985; Spiegel and Machi 1990; Vitale 1991); moreover, one-third of these surnames are unique in that they are singletons.",
        "In fact, at this stage in the technology, it is still the rule set and not the dictionary that is the more dominant, although this is beginning to change, primarily due to the need for more complex lexical entry containing information on syntax, semantics, and even pragmatics for more natural prosodics in text-to-speech tasks.",
        "It is difficult and time consuming to place all derived forms in the dictionary, including singular and plural forms and all verb affixes, especially for a language like French where a verb can expand, depending on the conjugation, into about fifty strings consisting of the root plus suffixes.",
        "Code could, of course, be added in the dictionary modules providing information on how to form the plurals or conjugations.",
        "The lookup procedure could then strip some of the affixes to retrieve the root in the dictionary.",
        "There do exist letter-to-sound systems based on very large dictionaries (for French, see Laporte [19881) but they require a great deal of memory, especially if the lexical entries contain graphemic, phonetic, syntactic, and semantic information.",
        "The main advantage is that this dictionary can then be used to drive a sentence tagger and parser necessary for improving intonation and naturalness for speech synthesis.",
        "This universal electronic dictionary could also be used for speech recognition and machine translation.",
        "Today, most speech synthesizers do not include such a large dictionary, which, in any case, must be complemented by a set of rules just in case the word or the proper name is not in the dictionary."

        "It has been estimated that external borrowing has been so extensive that English has retained only about 25% of its original Germanic lexicon (Ben Crane 1981).",

        "Since the late Middle Ages, due to the availability of printed materials, dictionaries and grammars, the orthographic system has remained virtually unchanged.",
        "Letter-to-sound transcription for French is complex because a gap has slowly appeared between the orthographic and phonetic forms at the inception of what we would call French (about the 12th Century), and the orthographic and phonetic forms at the current time.",
        "Prior to the Roman invasion in 51 B.C., inhabitants of northern France (called at that time Gallia) spoke a Celtic language.",
        "The Roman occupation (which lasted until 476 A.D.) resulted in well-educated people speaking Latin; for others, a language derived from Latin.",
        "After the Roman pullback, the language continued to evolve in different ways, especially since few people knew how to read.",

        "Then official papers written in Latin began to be written in Roman.",
        "Up until the 17th Century, standardization in spelling had been vague until dictionaries, schools, and laws enforced a standard spelling (Burney 1955; Catach 1978; Thimonnier 1978).",

        "Another difficulty for English concerns the stress in noun compounds such as coffee cup, Thermos bottle, tape recorder, etc., which exhibit a stress pattern of [1 2] or [1 0] due to the semantic unity of the two words in spite of the white space between them.",

        "We have presented the difficulties of grapheme-to-phoneme conversion for English and French.",
        "Both languages have evolved from different origins, and are the results of the historical influence of other languages from which words have been borrowed and assimilated, sometimes only partially.",
        "English and French have interacted and continue to interact with each other.",
        "For both languages, the spelling has been enforced by dictionaries and laws, but the pronunciation has continued to evolve, widening the gap between the written and spoken components of the language.",
        "Both the English and French translation systems presented in this paper are based on rewriting rules.",
        "Nevertheless, some differences exist in the syntax and the interpretation of these rules.",
        "For a more theoretical approach to rewriting rules, see Kaplan and Kay (1994).",
        "English is scanned once from right to left to better take into account the suffixes of the word, which in certain cases determine the stressed syllable.",
        "The rule transforms the grapheme into phonemes and stress marks used by the stress module.",
        "In some cases, the input string is modified to add a morpheme boundary, or to replace the suffix by another suffix to continue the conversion.",
        "Syllabification, stress, and allophonic rules are achieved by programs.",
        "French uses the concept of a class that allows for the grouping of strings having a common property, thus reducing the number of rules.",
        "Several blocks of rules can be defined corresponding to different scans from left to right of the string (the output string replacing the input text at the end of a block of rules).",
        "The input string is not modified.",
        "Rules can check the left and right contexts of the input string, and the left context of the output string.",
        "French is not a stressed language, so there is no need for a syllabification module or a stress module.",
        "Many problems persist for phonemicization.",
        "In English, suffix stripping, compound decomposition, and primary stressed syllable are very important to get the proper phoneme string, and are carried out mostly by rules without an explicit morph dictionary, contrary to as in Allen (1976), who uses a morph dictionary with 12,000 morphs, or Coker (1985), whose dictionary has 43,000 morphs.",
        "In French, the word-byword conversion is probably simpler due to the absence of stressed syllables.",
        "Affixes do not alter the pronunciation of the root; compare, for instance, photo, photograph, and photography in English with photo, photographe and photographie in French.",
        "But in French, there are more interactions between words due to the linking problem (nous avons) and mute e (chemin defer).",
        "These interactions are also dependent on speech rate.",
        "Sometimes the homograph problem can be solved by looking at the left and right context of the word, but the general case requires a better understanding of the overall",
        "structure of the sentence.",
        "This is also required to get a more natural prosodics in text-to-speech synthesizers.",
        "The same formalism could be used for both English and French with a slight modification, for instance, of the French formalism.",
        "Blocks of rules should indicate if the scan is to be done from left to right or from right to left.",
        "In the right-to-left scan, the right context of the output buffer would be usable (instead of the left context if the scan is done from left to right).",
        "The word scandalousness could be decomposed by the following rules:",
        "resulting in scandal+ous+ness.",
        "Translating the root scandal could be done either from left to right or from right to left in one or more blocks of rules.",
        "The required output phoneme string depends on the application.",
        "For speech synthesis, one output string is needed for a word.",
        "If several pronunciations are possible, the software has to produce only one for the synthesizer.",
        "Speech recognition algorithms must know all the phonetic variations of the words in the vocabulary to be recognized, so the output should be a set of phonetic strings corresponding to the input word.",
        "Some rules must be declared optional, and the interpreter modified to take them into account.",
        "For database searches, a set of equivalences can be devised where two (or more) phonemes or allophones could be considered correct.",
        "For example, in many cases [0] and [i] can be considered equivalents.",
        "Similarly, [0][1] and [L] (syllabic [1]) can also be considered equivalents.",
        "For French open [a] and close [a] could be equivalent, as would be [o] and [o], or [e] and [s].",
        "The search could even be done only on phoneme consonants (for proper name searches, for instance).",
        "To our knowledge, learning algorithms, although promising, have not (yet) reached the level of rule sets developed by humans.",
        "The automatic discovery of the underlying structure of a language is not easy, nor is the developing of a universal rewriting rule formalism for the different languages.",
        "Dictionaries and sets of rules will have to continue to coexist either as a dictionary of exceptions and a large set of rules, or as a large dictionary and a set of rules to deal with exceptions."
