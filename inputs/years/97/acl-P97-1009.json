        "Given a word, its context and its possible meanings, the problem of word sense disambiguation (WSD) is to determine the meaning of the word in that context.",
        "WSD is useful in many natural language tasks, such as choosing the correct word in machine translation and coreference resolution.",
        "In several recent proposals (Hearst, 1991; Bruce and Wiebe, 1994; Leacock, Towwell, and Voorhees, 1996; Ng and Lee, 1996; Yarowsky, 1992; Yarowsky, 1994), statistical and machine learning techniques were used to extract classifiers from hand-tagged corpus.",
        "Yarowsky (Yarowsky, 1995) proposed an unsupervised method that used heuristics to obtain seed classifications and expanded the results to the other parts of the corpus, thus avoided the need to hand-annotate any examples.",
        "Most previous corpus-based WSD algorithms determine the meanings of polysemous words by exploiting their local contexts.",
        "A basic intuition that underlies those algorithms is the following: (1) Two occurrences of the same word have identical meanings if they have similar local contexts.",
        "In other words, most previous corpus-based WSD algorithms learn to disambiguate a polysemous word from previous usages of the same word.",
        "This has several undesirable consequences.",
        "Firstly, a word must occur thousands of times before a good classifier can be learned.",
        "In Yarowsky's experiment (Yarowsky, 1995), an average of 3936 examples were used to disambiguate between two senses.",
        "In Ng and Lee's experiment, 192,800 occurrences of 191 words were used as training examples.",
        "There are thousands of polysemous words, e.g., there are 11,562 polysemous nouns in WordNet.",
        "For every polysemous word to occur thousands of times each, the corpus must contain billions of words.",
        "Secondly, learning to disambiguate a word from the previous usages of the same word means that whatever was learned for one word is not used on other words, which obviously missed generality in natural languages.",
        "Thirdly, these algorithms cannot deal with words for which classifiers have not been learned.",
        "In this paper, we present a WSD algorithm that relies on a different intuition: (2) Two different words are likely to have similar meanings if they occur in identical local contexts.",
        "Consider the sentence: (3) The new facility will employ 500 of the existing 600 employees The word \"facility\" has 5 possible meanings in WordNet 1.5 (Miller, 1990): (a) installation, (b) proficiency/technique, (c) adeptness, (d) readiness, (e) toilet/bathroom.",
        "To disambiguate the word, we consider other words that appeared in an identical local context as \"facility\" in (3).",
        "Table 1 is a list of words that have also been used as the subject of \"employ\" in a 25-million-word Wall Street Journal corpus.",
        "The \"freq\" column are the number of times these words were used as the subject of \"employ\".",
        "ORG includes all proper names recognized as organizations The logA column are their likelihood ratios (Dunning, 1993).",
        "The meaning of \"facility\" in (3) can be determined by choosing one of its 5 senses that is most similar' to the meanings of words in Table 1.",
        "This way, a polysemous word is disambiguated with past usages of other words.",
        "Whether or not it appears in the corpus is irrelevant.",
        "Our approach offers several advantages:",
        "• The same knowledge sources are used for all words, as opposed to using a separate classifier for each individual word.",
        "• It requires a much smaller corpus that needs not be sense-tagged.",
        "• It is able to deal with words that are infrequent or do not even appear in the corpus.",
        "• The same mechanism can also be used to infer the semantic categories of unknown words.",
        "The required resources of the algorithm include the following: (a) an untagged text corpus, (b) a broad-coverage parser, (c) a concept hierarchy, such as the WordNet (Miller, 1990) or Roget's Thesaurus, and (d) a similarity measure between concepts.",
        "In the next section, we introduce our definition of local contexts and the database of local contexts.",
        "A description of the disambiguation algorithm is presented in Section 3.",
        "Section 4 discusses the evaluation results."
