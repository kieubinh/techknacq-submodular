        "The evaluation of machine translation (MT) systems has been a central research topic in recent years (cp.",
        "(Sparck-Jones and Galliers, 1995; King, 1996)).",
        "Many suggestions have focussed on measuring the translation quality (e.g. error classification in (Flanagan, 1994) or post editing time in (Minnis, 1994)).",
        "These measures are time-consuming and difficult to apply.",
        "But translation quality rests on the linguistic competence of the MT system which again is based first and foremost on grammatical coverage and lexicon size.",
        "Testing grammatical coverage can be done by using a test suite (cp.",
        "(Nerbonne et al., 1993; Volk, 1995)).",
        "Here we will advocate a probing method for determining the lexical coverage of commercial MT systems.",
        "We have evaluated 6 MT systems which translate between English and German and which are all positioned in the low price market (under US$ 1500).",
        "• German Assistant in Accent Duo V2.0 (developer: MicroTac/Globalink; distributor: Accent) • Langenscheidts Ti Standard V3.0 (developer: GMS; distributor: Langenscheidt) • Personal Translator plus V2.0 (developer: IBM; distributor: von Rheinbaben Sz Busch) • Power Translator Professional (developer/distributor: Globalink)1 • Systran Professional for Windows (developer: Systran S.A.; distributor: Mysoft) • Telegraph V1.0 (developer/distributor: Glob-alink)",
        "The overall goal of our evaluation was a comparison of these systems resulting in recommendations on which system to apply for which purpose.",
        "The evaluation consisted of compiling a list of criteria for self evaluation and three experiments with external volunteers, mostly students from a local interpreter school.",
        "These experiments were performed to judge the information content of the translations, the translation quality, and the user-friendliness.",
        "The list of criteria for self evaluation consisted of technical, linguistic and ergonomic issues.",
        "As part of the linguistic evaluation we wanted to determine the lexical coverage of the MT systems since only some of the systems provide figures on lexicon size in the documentation.",
        "Many MT system evaluations in the past have been white-box evaluations performed by a testing team in cooperation with the developers (see (Falkedal, 1991) for a survey).",
        "But commercial MT systems can only be evaluated in a black-box setup since the developer typically will not make the source code and even less likely the linguistic source data (lexicon and grammar) available.",
        "Most of the evaluations described in the literature have centered around one MT system.",
        "But there are",
        "hardly any reports on comparative evaluations.",
        "A noted exception is (Rinsche, 1993), which compares SYSTRAN2, LOGOS and METAL for German - English translation3.",
        "She uses a test suite with 5000 words of authentic texts (from an introduction to Computer Science and from an official journal of the European Commission).",
        "The resulting translations are qualitatively evaluated for lexicon, syntax and semantics errors.",
        "The advantage of this approach is that words are evaluated in context.",
        "But the results of this study cannot be used for comparing the sizes of lexicons since the number of error tokens is given rather than the number of error types.",
        "Furthermore it is questionable if a running text of 5000 words says much about lexicon size, since most of this figure is usually taken up by frequent closed class words.",
        "• If we are mainly interested in lexicon size this method has additional drawbacks.",
        "First, it is time-consuming to find out if a word is translated correctly within running text.",
        "Second, it takes a lot of redundant translating to find missing lexical items.",
        "So, if we want to compare the lexicon size of different MT systems, we have to find a way to determine the lexical coverage by executing the system with selected lexical items.",
        "We therefore propose to use a special word list with words in different frequency ranges to probe the lexicon efficiently."

        "In a similar manner the figures for lexicon size in MT systems (\"a lexicon of more than 100.000 words\", \"more than 3.000 verbs\" ) .need to be critically examined.",
        "While we cannot determine the absolute lexicon size with a black-box test we can determine the relative lexical coverage of systems dealing with the same language pair.",
        "When selecting the word lists for our lexicon evaluation we concentrated on adjectives, nouns, and verbs.",

        "Still, many words with frequency 1 seem exotic or idiosyncratic uses.",
        "Unfortunately the CELEX data contain some noise especially for the German entries.",
        "This meant that the extracted word lists had to be manually checked.",

        "This is the case if a verb is used with a prefix in both the separable and the fixed variant (as e.g. iibersetzen engl.",
        "to translate vs. to ferry across).",
        "Since our test does not distinguish these variants we took only one of these stems.",
        "Another problem is that the frequency count is purely wordform-based.",
        "That means, if a word is frequently used as an adverb and seldom as a verb the count of the total number of occurrences will be attributed to both the adverb and the verb stem.",
        "Therefore, some words appear at strange frequency positions.",
        "For example the very unusual German verb heuen (engl.",
        "to make hay) is listed among the 100 most frequent verbs.",
        "This is due to the fact that its 3rd person past tense form is a homograph of the frequent adverb heute (engl.",
        "today).",
        "Such obviously misplaced words were eliminated from the list, which was refilled with subsequent items in order to contain exactly 100 words in each frequency class of each word.",
        "The English data in CELEX are more reliable.",
        "The frequency count has been disambiguated for part of speech by manually checking 100 occurrences of each word-form and thus estimating the total distribution.",

        "If a word is the same in English and in German (as e.g. international, Squaw) it must also be excluded from our test list.",

        "The method provides a plausible hypothesis but it cannot prove in a strict sense that one lexicon necessarily is bigger than another.",
        "A proof, however, cannot be expected from any black-box testing method.",
        "We mentioned above that some systems subclas-sify their lexical entries according to subject areas.",
        "They do this to a different extent.",
        "Langenscheidts Ti has a total of 55 subject areas.",
        "They are sorted in a hierarchy which is three levels deep.",
        "An example is Technology with its subfields Space Technology, Food Tech-noloy, Technical Norms etc.",
        "Multiple subject areas from different levels can be selected and prioritized.",
        "Personal Translator has 22 subject areas.",
        "They are all on the same level.",
        "Examples are: Biology, Computers, Law, Cooking.",
        "Multiple selections can be made, but they cannot be prioritized.",
        "Power Translator and Telegraph do not come with built-in subject dictionaries but these can be purchased separately and added to the system.",
        "Systran has 22 \"Topical Glossaries\", all on the same level.",
        "Examples are: Automotive, Aviation/Space, Chemistry.",
        "Multiple subject areas can be selected and prioritized.",
        "Our tests were run without any selection of a subject area.",
        "We tried to check if a lexicon entry that is marked with a subject area will still be found if no subject area is selected.",
        "This check can only be performed reliably for Langenscheidt Ti since this is the only system that makes the lexicon transparent to the user to the point that one can access the subject area of every entry.",
        "Personal Translator only allows to look at an entry and its translation options, but not at its subject marker, and Systran does not allow any access to the built-in lexicon.",
        "For Langenscheidts Ti we tested the word compiler which is marked with data processing and computer software.",
        "This lexical entry does not have any reading without a subject area marker, but the word is still found at translation if no subject area is chosen.",
        "That means that a subject area, if chosen, is used as disambiguator, but if translating without a subject area the system has access to the complete lexicon.",
        "In this respect our tests have put Power Translator and Telegraph at a disadvantage since we did not extend their lexicons with any add-on lexicons.",
        "Only their built-in lexicons were evaluated here.",
        "Of course, lexical coverage by itself does not guarantee a good translation.",
        "It is a necessary but not a sufficient condition.",
        "It must be complemented with lexical depth and grammatical coverage.",
        "Lexical depth can be evaluated in two dimensions.",
        "The first dimension describes the number of readings available for an entry.",
        "A look at some common nouns that received different translations from our test systems reveals that there are big differences in this dimension which are not reflected by our test results.",
        "Table 7 gives the number of readings for the word order ('N' standing for noun readings, 'V' for verbal, 'Prep' for prepositional, and 'Phr' for phrasal readings).",
        "G. Assistant 9 N 3 V 1 Prep Lang.",
        "T1 4N 4V Personal Tr.",
        "6 N 5 V Power Tr.",
        "1 N 1 V 1 Prep Systran n.a.",
        "Telegraph 10 N 4 V 2 Phr There is no information for Systran since the built-in lexicon cannot be accessed.",
        "German Assistant contains a wide variety of readings although it scored badly in our tests.",
        "Power Translator on the contrary gives only the most likely readings.",
        "Still, there remains the question of whether a system is able to pick the most appropriate reading in a given context, which brings us to the second dimension.",
        "The second dimension of lexical depth is about the amount of syntactic and semantic knowledge attributed to every reading.",
        "This also varies a great deal.",
        "Telegraph offers 16 semantic features (ani",
        "mate, time, place etc.",
        "), German Assistant 9 and Langenscheidts Ti 5.",
        "Power Translator offers few semantic features for verbs (movement, direction).",
        "The fact that these features are available does not entail that they are consistenly set at every appropriate reading.",
        "And even if they are set, it does not follow that they are all optimally used during the translation process.",
        "To check these lexicon dimensions new tests need to be developped.",
        "We think that it is especially tricky to get to all the readings along the first dimension.",
        "One idea is to use the example sentences listed with the different readings in a comprehensive print dictionary.",
        "If these sentences are carefully designed they should guide an MT system to the respective translation alternatives.",
        "Our method for determining lexical coverage could be refined by looking at more frequency classes (e.g. an additional class between medium and low frequency).",
        "But since the results of working with one medium and one low frequency class show clear distinctions between the systems, it is doubtful that the additional cost of taking more classes will provide significantly better figures.",
        "The method as introduced in this paper requires extensive manual labor in checking the translation results.",
        "Carefully going through 900 words each for 6 systems including dictionary lookup for unclear cases takes about 2 days time.",
        "This could be reduced by automatically accessing translation lists or reliable bilingual dictionaries.",
        "Judging sense-preserving segmentations or other close to correct translations must be left over to the human expert.",
        "A special purpose translation list could be incrementally built up in the following manner.",
        "For the first system all 900 words will be manually checked.",
        "All translations with their tags will be entered into the translation list.",
        "For the second system only those words will be checked where the translation differs from the translation saved in the translation list.",
        "Every new judgement will be added to the translation list for comparison with the next system's translations."
