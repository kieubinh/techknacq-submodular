        "Our results for disambiguating Turkish indicate that using about 500 constraint rules and some additional simple statistics, we can attain a recall of 95-96% and a precision of 94-95% with about 1.01 parses per token.",

        "Automatic morphological disambiguation is an important component in higher level analysis of natural language text corpora.",
        "There has been a large number of studies in tagging and morphological disambiguation using various techniques such as statistical techniques, e.g., (Church, 1988; Cutting et al., 1992; DeRose, 1988), constraint-based techniques (Karlsson et al., 1995; Voutilainen, 1995b; Voutilainen, Heikkila, and Anttila, 1992; Voutilainen and Tapanainen, 1993; Oflazer and KurtiOz, 1994; Oflazer and Tiir, 1996) and transformation-based techniques (Brill, 1992; Brill, 1994; Brill, 1995).",
        "This paper presents a novel approach to constraint based morphological disambiguation which relieves the rule developer from worrying about conflicting rule ordering requirements.",
        "The approach depends on assigning votes to constraints according to their complexity and specificity, and then letting constraints cast votes on matching parses of a given lexical item.",
        "This approach does not reflect the outcome of matching constraints to the set of morphological parses immediately.",
        "Only after all applicable rules are applied to a sentence, all tokens are disambiguated in parallel.",
        "Thus, the outcome of the rule applications is independent of the order of rule applications.",
        "Rule ordering issue has been discussed by Voutilainen(1994), but he has recently indicated' that insensitivity to rule ordering is not a property of their system (although Voutilainen(1995a) states that it is a very desirable property) but rather is achieved by extensively testing and tuning the rules.",
        "In the following sections, we present an overview of the morphological disambiguation problem, highlighted with examples from Turkish.",
        "We then present our approach and results.",

        "Furthermore, it is also possible to use rules with negative votes to disallow impossible cases.",
        "This has been quite useful for our work on tagging English (Tiir, Oflazer, and Oz-kan, 1997) where such rules with negative weights were used to fine tune the behavior of the tagger in various problematic cases.",
