        "Several methods have recently been proposed for sentence alignment of the Hansards, an English-French corpus of Canadian parliamentary debates (Brown, Lai and Mercer 1991; Gale and Church 1991a; Simard, Foster and Isabelle 1992; Chen 1993), and for other language pairs such as English-German, English-Chinese, and English-Japanese (Church, Dagan, Gale, Fung, Helfman and Satish 1993; Kay and ROscheisen 1993; Wu 1994).",
        "The statistical approach to machine translation (SMT) can be understood as a word-by-word model consisting of two sub-models: a language model for generating a source text segment S and a translation model for mapping S to its translation T. Brown et al.",

        "In the context of SMT, Brown et al.",
        "(1993) present a series of five models of Pr(S I 7) for word alignment.",
        "The authors propose using an adaptive Expectation and Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate parameters for lexical translation probability (LTP) and distortion probability (DP), two factors in the TP, from an aligned bitext.",
        "The EM algorithm iterates between two phases to estimate LTP and DP until both functions converge.",
        "Church (1993) observes that reliably distinguishing sentence boundaries for a noisy bitext obtained from an OCR device is quite difficult.",
        "Dagan, Church and Gale (1993) recommend aligning words directly without the preprocessing phase of sentence alignment.",
        "They propose using char_align to produce a rough character-level alignment first.",
        "The rough alignment provides a basis for estimating the translation probability based on position, as well as limits the range of target words being considered for each source word.",
        "Char_align (Church 1993) is based on the observation that there are many instances of",
        "cognates among the languages in the Indo-European family.",
        "However, Fung and Church (1994) point out that such a constraint does not exist between languages across language groups such as Chinese and English.",
        "The authors propose a K-vec approach which is based on a k-way partition of the bilingual corpus.",
        "Fung and McKeown (1994) propose using a similar measure based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) between occurrence recency sequences to improve on the K-vec method.",
        "The char-align, K-vec and DTW approaches rely on dynamic programming strategy to reach a rough alignment.",
        "As Chen (1993) points out, dynamic programming is particularly susceptible to deletions occurring in one of the two languages.",
        "Thus, dynamic programming based sentence alignment algorithms rely on paragraph anchors (Brown et al.",
        "1991) or lexical information, such as cognates (Simard 1992), to maintain a high accuracy rate.",
