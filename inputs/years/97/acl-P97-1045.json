        "Aspect refers to the internal temporal structure of events and is distinguished from tense, which has a deictic element in it, of reference to a point of time anchored by the speaker's utterance.",

        "Recently, computational linguists also have joined in the act within the context of machine translation or text understanding etc.",
        "For example, consider the following Japanese sentences (quoted from (Gunji, 1992)).",
        "(a).",
        "Ken-wa ima tonarino heya-de kimono-wo ki-te-i-ru.",

        "Ken-wa ano kimono-wo san-nen maeni ki-te-i-ru.",
        "Ken-TOP that kimono-ACC three-year before wear-PRES 'Ken has the experience of wearing that kimono three years ago.'",
        "Notice that English translations use separate lexical items (put on for (a) and wear for (b), (c)) and different aspectual configurations (the progressive for (a), the perfect progressive for (b), and another for (c)), while all Japanese sentences contain the same verbal form ki-te-i-ru.",
        "Thus, when the system tries to translate these sentences, it must be aware of the difference among them.",
        "This paper describes an approach to extract the aspectual information of Japanese verb phrases from a monolingual corpus.",
        "In the next section, we will classify Japanese verbs into six categories by means of aspectual features following the framework of (Bennett et al., 1990).",
        "The aspectual forms land adverbs are defined as the functions which operate on verbs' aspectual features and changes their values.",
        "By using the constraints of the applicability of the functions, we can identify a unique category for each verb automatically.",
        "If one can acquire aspectual properties of verbs properly and know how the other constituents in a sentence operate on them, then the aspectual meaning of the whole sentence will be determined monotonically.",
        "To evaluate the result of the experiment, we will examine the meaning of -teiru which is one of the most fundamental aspectual forms, since the classification itself is difficult to evaluate objectively."

        "Furthermore, the lexical aspect of verbs is closely related with their deep complement structures which may not be directly reflected on the surface argument structures.",
        "Therefore, by combining the aspectual categories of verbs and those that are defined in terms of their surface argument structures, we can obtain an elaborate classification based on semantic types of verbs.",
