        "In contrast, the head transducer approach is more closely aligned with earlier direct translation methods: no explicit representations of the source language (interlingua or otherwise) are created in the process of deriving the target string.",
        "Despite the simple direct architecture, the head transducer model does embody modern principles of lexicalized recursive grammars and statistical language processing.",

        "(1990, 1993), these models have non-uniform linguistically motivated structure, at present coded by hand.",
        "In fact, the original motivation for the head transducer models was that they are simpler and more amenable to automatic model structure acquisition, while the transfer component of the traditional system was designed with regard to allowing maximum flexibility in mapping between source and target representations to overcome translation divergences (Lindop and Tsujii 1991: Dorr 1994).",
        "In practice, it turned out that adopting the simpler transducer models did not involve sacrificing accuracy.",
