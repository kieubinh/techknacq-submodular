        "The area is a tangled thicket of examples in which readings are mysteriously missing and small changes reverse judgments.",
        "It is a prime example of a phenomenon at the boundary between syntax and pragmatics.",
        "VP ellipsis is exemplified in sentence (1).",
        "(1) John revised his paper before the teacher did.",
        "This sentence has two readings, one in which the teacher revised John's paper (the strict reading), and one in which the teacher revised his own paper (the sloppy reading).",
        "Obtaining an adequate account of strict/sloppy ambiguities has been a major focus of VP ellipsis research.",
        "This is challenging because not all examples are as simple as sentence (1).",

        "(1991. henceforth DSP) note that it has only five readings; the reading is absent in which (3) John revised John's paper before the teacher revised John's paper, and Bill revised John's paper before the teacher revised Bill's paper.",
        "Previous analyses have either generated too few or too many readings, or have required an appeal to additional processes or constraints external to the actual resolution process itself.",
        "Examples like (2) test the adequacy of an analysis at a fine-grained level of detail.",
        "Other examples test the generality of an analysis, in terms of its ability to account for phenomena similar to VP ellipsis and to interact with other interpretation processes that may come into play.",
        "For instance, strict/sloppy ambiguities are not restricted to VP ellipsis, but are common to a wide range of constructions that rely on parallelism between two eventualities, some of which are listed in Table 1.",
        "Given the ubiquity of strict/sloppy ambiguities, one would expect these to be a by-product of general discourse resolution mechanisms and not mechanisms specific to VP ellipsis.",
        "Any account applying only to the latter would miss an important generalization.",
        "In this paper, we give an account of resolution rooted in a general computational theory of parallelism.",
        "We demonstrate the depth of our approach by showing that unlike previous approaches, the algorithm generates the correct five readings for example (2) without appeal to additional mechanisms or constraints.",

Two fragments of discourse stand in a parallel relation if they describe similar properties.",

        "This rules out the case in which, for example, the fact that John and Bill are both persons would be used to establish their similarity when the fact that they are both men has already been used.",
        "Inferential independence is generally undecidable, but in practice this is not a problem.",
        "In discourse interpretation, all we usually know about an entity is the small set of properties presented explicitly in the text itself.",
        "We may take these to be inferentially independent and look for no further properties, once properties inferrable from these have been used in establishing the parallelism.",
        "Similarity is a matter of degree.",
        "The more corresponding pairs of inferentially independent properties that are found, and the more contextually salient those properties are, the stronger the similarity.",
        "In a system which assigns different costs to proofs (e.g., Hobbs et al.",
        "(1993)), the more costly the proofs required to establish similarity are, the less similar the properties or arguments should seem.",
        "Interpretations should seek to maximize similarity.",
        "This account of parallelism is semantic in the sense that it depends on the content of the discourse rather than directly on its form.",
        "But syntax plays an implicit role.",
        "When seeking to establish the paral",
        "lelism between two clauses, we must begin with the \"top-level\" properties; this is generally determined by the syntactic structure of the clause.",
        "Then the co-recursion through the arguments and properties normally mirrors the syntactic structure of the sentence.",
        "However, features of syntax that are not manifested in logical form are not taken into account.",
        "An Example To illustrate that the theory has applicability well beyond the problem of VP ellipsis, we present an example of semantic parallelism in discourse.",

        "These facts fall out of recognizing the parallelism.",
        "The procedure for establishing parallelism is illustrated in Figure 1, in which parallel elements are placed on the same line.",
        "The force predicates are the same so there is no need to infer further properties.",
        "The first pair of arguments, w1 and w2 are similar in that both are weights.",
        "To make the second pair of arguments similar, we can assume they are coreferential; as a by-product, this tells us that the object the man's weight is acting on is the ladder, and hence that the man is on the ladder.",
        "The third pair of arguments are both downward directions.",
        "The final pair of arguments, x1 and x2, are similar if their properties distance(xi, f, 20,ft) and distance(x2, t,10 ft) are similar.",
        "These will be similar if their previously unmatched pair of arguments f and t are similar.",
        "This holds if their properties foot( f , L) and top(t, z) are similar.",
        "We infer end( f , L) and end(t, z), since feet and tops are ends.",
        "Finally, we have to show L and z are similar.",
        "We can do this by assuming they are coreferential.",
        "This, as a by-product, tells us that the top is the top of the ladder.",
        "The use of inferences, such as \"a foot is an end\", means that this theory is parametric on a knowledge base.",
        "Different sets of beliefs can yield different bases for parallelism and indeed different judgments about whether parallelism occurs at all.",
        "A crucial piece of our treatment of VP-ellipsis is the explicit representation of coreference relations, denoted with the predicate Coref.",
        "We could use equalities such as y = L, or since equals can be replaced by equals, simply replace y with L. However, doing this would lose the distinction between y and L under their corresponding descriptions.",
        "Consequently, we introduce the relation Coref(y, e2, x, ei) to express this coreferentiality.",
        "This relation says that y under the description associated with e2 is coreferential with x under the description associated with el.",
        "From this we can infer y = x but not e2 = e1, and the coreferentiality cannot be washed out in substitution.",
        "A constraint on the arguments of Coref is that eland e2 be properties of x and y respectively.",
        "The phenomenon of parallelism pervades discourse.",
        "In addition to straightforward examples of parallelism like the above, there are also contrasts, exemplifications, and generalizations, which are defined in a similar manner.",
        "The interpretation of a number of syntactic constructions depends on recognizing parallelism, including those cited in Table 1.",
        "In brief, our theory of parallelism is not something we have introduced merely for the purpose of handling VP ellipsis; it is needed for a wide range of sentential and discourse phenomena.",
        "Other Approaches Based on Parallelism Our aim in this paper is to present the theory of parallelism at an abstract enough level that it can be embedded in any sufficiently powerful framework.",
        "By \"sufficiently powerful\" we mean that there must be a formalization of the notion of inference, strength of inference, and inferential independence, and there must be a reasonable knowledge base.",
        "In Hobbs and Kehler (forthcoming), we show how our approach can be realized within the \"Interpretation as Ab-duction\" framework (Hobbs et al., 1993).",
        "There are at least two other treatments in which VP ellipsis is resolved through a more general system of determining discourse parallelism, namely, those of Priist (1992) and Asher (1993).",
        "Priist (1992) gives an account of parallelism developed within the context of the Linguistic Discourse Model theory (Scha and Polanyi, 1988).",
        "Parallelism is computed by determining the \"Most Specific Common Denominator\" of a set of representations, which results from unifying the unifiable aspects of those representations and generalizing over the others.",
        "VP ellipsis is resolved as a side effect of this unification.",
        "The representations assumed, called syntac",
        "tic/semantic structures, incorporate both syntactic and semantic information about an utterance.",
        "One weakness of this approach is that it appears overly restrictive in the syntactic similarity that it requires.",
        "Asher (1993) also provides an analysis of VP ellipsis in the context of a theory of discourse structure and coherence, using an extension of Discourse Representation Theory.",
        "The resolution of VP ellipsis is driven by a need to maximize parallelism (or in some cases, contrast) that is very much in the spirit of what we present.",
        "Detailed comparisons with our approach are given with the examples below.",

Deriving this reading requires a Coref relation between the elided event and its antecedent in the first main clause, which is obtained when our algorithm bails out in event coreference (see footnote",
