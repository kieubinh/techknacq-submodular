        "Psychological models of reading aloud traditionally assume the existence of two separate routes for converting print to sound: a direct lexical route, which is used to read familiar words, and a dual route relying upon abstract letter-to-sound rules to pronounce previously unseen words (Coltheart, 1978; Coltheart et al., 1993).",
        "This view has been challenged by a number of authors (e.g. (Glushsko, 1981)), who claim that the pronunciation process of every word, familiar or unknown, could be accounted for in a unified framework.",
        "These single-route models crucially suggest that the pronunciation of unknown words results from the parallel activation of similar lexical items (the lexical neighbours).",
        "This idea has been tentatively implemented both into various symbolic analogy-based algorithms (e.g. (Dedina and Nusbaum, 1991; Sullivan and Damper, 1992)) and into connectionist pronunciation devices (e.g. (Sei-denberg and McClelland, 1989)).",
        "The basic idea of these analogy-based models is to pronounce an unknown word x by recombining pronunciations of lexical items sharing common subparts with x.",
        "To illustrate this strategy, Ded-ina and Nussbaum show how the pronunciation of the sequence lop in the pseudo-word blope is analogized with the pronunciation of the same sequence in sloping.",
        "As there exists more than one way to recombine segments of lexical items, Dedina and Nussbaum's algorithm favors recombinations including large substrings of existing words.",
        "In this model, the similarity between two words is thus implicitely defined as a function of the length of their common subparts: the longer the common part, the better the analogy.",
        "This conception of analogical processes has an important consequence: it offers, as Damper and East-mond ((Damper and Eastmond, 1996)) state it, \"no principled way of deciding the orthographic neighbours of a novel word which are deemed to influence its pronunciation (...)\" .",
        "For example, in the model proposed by Dedina and Nusbaum, any word having a common orthographic substring with the unknown word is likely to contribute to its pronunciation, which increases the number of lexical neighbours far beyond acceptable limits (in the case of blope, this neighbourhood would contain every English word starting in bl, or ending in ope, etc).",
        "From a computational standpoint, implementing the recombination strategy requires a one-to-one alignment between the lexical graphemic and phonemic representations, where each grapheme is matched with the corresponding phoneme (a null symbol is used to account for the cases where the lengths of these representations differ).",
        "This alignment makes it possible to retrieve, for any graphemic substring of a given lexical item, the corresponding phonemic string, at the cost however of an unmotivated complexification of lexical representations.",
        "In comparison, the paradigmatic cascades model (PCP for short) promotes an alternative view of analogical processes, which relies upon a linguistically motivated similarity measure between words.",
        "The basic idea of our model is to take advantage of the internal structure of \"natural\" lexicons.",
        "In fact, a lexicon is a very complex object, whose elements are intimately tied together by a number of fine-grained relationships (typically induced by morphological processes), and whose content is severely restricted, on a language-dependant basis, by a complex of graphotactic, phonotactic and morphotactic constraints.",
        "Following e.g. (Pirrelli and Fed-erici, 1994), we assume that these constraints surface simultaneously in the orthographical and in the phonological domain in the recurring pattern of paradigmatically alterning pairs of lexical items.",
        "Extending the idea originally proposed in (Federici, Pirrelli, and Yvon, 1995), we show that it is possible to extract these alternation patterns, to associate alternations in one domain with the related alternation in the other domain, and to construct, using this pairing, a fairly reliable pronunciation procedure."

        "The paradigmatic cascades model crucially relies upon the existence of numerous paradigmatic relationships in lexical databases.",
        "A paradigmatic relationship involves four lexical entries a, b, c, d, and expresses that these forms are involved in an analogical (in the Saussurian (de Saussure, 1916) sense) proportion: a is to b as c is to d (further along abbreviated as a:b=c:d, see also (Lepage and Shin-Ichi, 1996) for another utilization of this kind of proportions).",
        "Morphologically related pairs provide us with numerous examples of orthographical proportions, as in:",
        "Considering these proportions in terms of orthographical alternations, that is in terms of partial functions in the graphemic domain, we can see that each proportion involves two alternations.",

        "The second one transforms reactor into factor (and reaction into faction), and consists in exchanging the prefixes re and f. These alternations are represented on figure 1. reaction",
        "Formally, we define the notion of a paradigmatic relationship as follows.",
        "Given E, a finite alphabet, and ,C, a finite subset of E*, we say that (a, b) Erxr is paradigmatically related to (c, d) E x if there exits two partial functions f and g from E* to E*, where f exchanges prefixes and g exchanges suffixes, and:",

      "heading": "2.2 The Learning Procedure",
      "text": [
        "The main purpose of the learning procedure is to extract from a pronunciation lexicon, presumably structured by multiple paradigmatic relationships, the most productive paradigmatic alternations.",
        "Let us start with some notations: Given G a graphemic alphabet and P a phonetic alphabet, a pronunciation lexicon ,C is a subset of G* x P. The restriction of ,C on G* (respectively .135) will be noted LG (resp.",
        "Lp).",
        "Given two strings x and y, pre f (x, (resp.",
        "su f f (x , y)) denotes their longest common prefix (resp.",
        "suffix).",
        "For two strings x and y having a non-empty common prefix (resp.",
        "suffix) u, f, (resp, g4) denotes the function which transforms x into y: as x = uv, and as y = ut, ft'y substitutes a final v with a final t. A denotes the empty string.",
        "Given ,C, the learning procedure searches LG for any for every 4-uples (a, b, c, d) of graphemic strings such that a : b =f,g c : d. Each match increments the productivity of the related alternations f and g. This search is performed using using a slightly modified version of the algorithm presented in (Federici, Pirrelli, and Yvon, 1995), which applies to every word x in LG the procedure detailled in table 1.",
        "In fact, the properties of paradigmatic relationships, notably their symetry, allow to reduce dramatically the cost of this procedure, since not all",
        "4-uple of strings in LG need to be examined during that stage.",
        "For each graphemic alternation, we also record their correlated alternation(s) in the phonological domain, and accordingly increment their productivity.",
        "For instance, assuming that factor and reactor respectively receive the pronunciations /fwktar/ and /ri:aektar/, the discovery of the relationship expressed in (1) will lead our algorithm to record that the graphemic alternation f re correlates in the phonemic domain with the alternation /f/ /ri:/.",
        "Note that the discovery of phonemic correlates does not require any sort of alignment between the orthographic and the phonemic representations: the procedure simply records the changes in the phonemic domain when the alternation applies in the graphemic domain.",
        "At the end of the learning stage, we have in hand a set A = {Ai} of functions exchanging suffixes or prefixes in the graphemic domain, and for each Ai in A: (i) a statistical measure pi of its productivity, defined as the likelihood that the transform of a lexical item be another lexical item: Ilx E dom(Ai) and A(x) E L} vi I dom(Ai) I (4) (ii) a set {Bi,j}, j E of correlated functions in the phonemic domain, and a statistical measure Pi,j of their conditional productivity, i.e. of the likelihood that the phonetic alternation B1, correlates with A.",
        "Table 2 gives the list of the phonological correlates of the alternation which consists in adding the suffix /y, corresponding to a productive rule for deriving adverbs from adjectives in English.",
        "If the first lines of table 2 are indeed \"true\" phonemic correlates of the derivation, corresponding to various classes of adjectives, a careful examination of the last lines reveals that the extraction procedure is easily fooled",
        "by accidental pairs like imp-imply, on-only or ear-early.",
        "A simple pruning rule was used to get rid of these alternations on the basis of their productivity, and only alternations which were observed at least twice were retained.",
        "It is important to realize that A allows to specifiy lexical neighbourhoods in LG: given a lexical entry x, its nearest neighbour is simply f(x), where f is the most productive alternation applying to x. Lexical neighbourhoods in the paradigmatic cascades model are thus defined with respect to the locally most productive alternations.",
        "As a consequence, the definition of neighbourhoods implicitely incorporates a great deal of linguistic knowledge extracted from the lexicon, especially regarding morphological processes and phonotactic constraints, which makes it much for relevant for grounding the notion of analogy between lexical items than, say, any neighbourhood based on the string edition metric.",
        "2.3 The Pronunciation of Unknown Words Supose now that we wish to infer the pronunciation of a word x, which does not appear in the lexicon.",
        "This goal is achieved by exploring the neighbourhood of x defined by A, in order to find one or several analogous lexical entry(ies) y.",
        "The second stage of the pronunciation procedure is to adapt the known pronunciation of y, and derive a suitable pronunciation for x: the idea here is to mirror in the phonemic domain the series of alternations which transform x into y in the graphemic domain, using the statistical pairing between alternations that is extracted during the learning stage.",
        "The complete pronunciation procedure is represented on figure 2.",
        "Let us examine carefully how these two aspects of the pronunciation procedure are implemented.",
        "The first stage is to find a lexical entry in the neighbour",
        "hood of x defined by ,C. The basic idea is to generate A (x), defined as {Ai (x), forAi E A, x E dornain(Ai)}, which contains all the words that can be derived from x using a function in A.",
        "This set, better viewed as a stack, is ordered according to the productivity of the Ai: the topmost element in the stack is the nearest neighbour of x, etc.",
        "The first lexical item found in A (x) is the analog of x.",
        "If A (x) does not contain any known word, we iterate the procedure, using x', the top-ranked element of A (x), instead of x.",
        "This expands the set of possible analogs, which is accordingly reordered, etc.",
        "This basic search strategy, which amounts to the exploration of a derivation tree, is extremely ressource consuming (every expension stage typically adds about a hundred of new virtual analogs), and is, in theory, not guar-anted to terminate.",
        "In fact, the search problem is equivalent to the problem of parsing with an unrestricted Phrase Structure Grammar, which is known to be undecidable.",
        "We have evaluated two different search strategies, which implement various ways to alternate between expansion stages (the stack is expanded by generating the derivatives of the topmost element) and matching stages (elements in the stack are looked for in the lexicon).",
        "The first strategy implements a depth-first search of the analog set: each time the topmost element of the stack is searched, but not found, in the lexicon, its derivatives are immediately generated, and added to the stack.",
        "In this approach, the position of an analog in the stack is assessed as a function of the \"distance\" between the original word x and the analogy = Ai, (Ai‚Äû_, (... Ai, (x))), according to:",
        "The search procedure is stopped as soon an analog is found in LG, or else, when the distance between x and the topmost element of the stack, which monotonously decreases (Vi, pi < I), falls below a predefined theshold.",
        "The second strategy implements a kind of compromise between depth-first and breadth-first exploration of the derivation tree, and is best understood if we first look at a concrete example.",
        "Most alternations substituting one initial consonant are very productive, in English like in many other languages.",
        "Therefore, a word starting with say, a p, is very likely to have a very close derivative where the initial p has been replaced by say, a r. Now suppose that this word starts with pl: the alternation will derive an analog starting with rl, and will assess it with a very high score.",
        "This analog will, in turn, derive many more virtual analogs starting with rl, once its suffixes will have been substituted during another expansion phase.",
        "This should be avoided, since there are in fact very few words starting with the prefix rl: we would therefore like these words to be very poorly ranked.",
        "The second search strategy has been devised precisely to cope with this problem.",
        "The idea is to rank the stack of analogs according to the expectation of the number of lexical derivatives a given analog may have.",
        "This expectation is computed by summing up the productivities of all the alternations that can be applied to an analogy according to:",
        "This ranking will necessarily assess any analog starting in rl with a low score, as very few alternations will substitute its prefix.",
        "However, the computation of (6) is much more complex than (5), since it requires to examine a given derivative before it can be positioned in the stack.",
        "This led us to bring forward the lexical matching stage: during the expansion of the topmost stack element, all its derivatives are looked for in the lexicon.",
        "If several derivatives are simultaneously found, the search procedure halts and returns more than one analog.",
        "The expectation (6) does not decrease as more derivatives are added to the stack; consequently, it cannot be used to define a stopping criterion.",
        "The search procedure is therefore stopped when all derivatives up to a given depth (2 in our experiments) have been generated, and unsuccessfully looked for in the lexicon.",
        "This termination criterion is very restrictive, in comparison to the one implemented in the depth-first strategy, since it makes it impossible to pronounce very long derivatives, for which a significant number of alternations need to",
        "be applied before an analog is found.",
        "An example is the word synergistically, for which the \"breadthfirst\" search terminates uncessfully, whereas the depth-first search manages to retrieve the \"analog\" energy.",
        "Nonetheless, the results reported hereafter have been obtained using this \"breadth-first\" strategy, mainly because this search was associated with a more efficient procedure for reconstructing pronunciations (see below).",
        "Various pruning procedures have also been implemented in order to control the exponential growth of the stack.",
        "For example, one pruning procedure detects the most obvious derivation cycles, which generate in loops the same derivatives; another pruning procedure tries to detect commutating alternations: substituting the prefix p, and then the suffix s often produces the same analog than when alternations apply in the reverse order, etc.",
        "More details regarding implementational aspects are given in (Yvon, 1996b).",
        "If the search procedure returns an analogy Ai,(Ajk_l(... Ai,(x))) in E, we can build a pronunciation for x, using the known pronunciation 0(y) of y.",
        "For this purpose, we will use our knowledge of the Bi,j, for i E {i1 ...ik}, and generate every possible transforms of 0(y) in the phonological domain: 1/3713.",
        "k(B71 (... (q5(y))))}, with jk in 11 ... nik 1, and order this set using some function of the pi,j.",
        "The top-ranked element in this set is the pronunciation of x.",
        "Of course, when the search fails, this procedure fails to propose any pronunciation.",
        "In fact, the results reported hereafter use a slightly extended version of this procedure, where the pronunciations of more than one analog are used for generating and selecting the pronunciation of the unknown word.",
        "The reason for using multiple analogs is twofold: first, it obviates the risk of being wrongly influenced by one very exceptional analog; second, it enables us to model conspiracy effects more accurately.",
        "Psychological models of reading aloud indeed assume that the pronunciation of an unknown word is not influenced by just one analog, but rather by its entire lexical neighbourhood."

        "We intend to explore several directions to improve this search: one possibility is to use a graphotactical model (e.g. a fl-gram model) in order to make the pruning of the derivation tree more effective.",
        "We expect such a model to bias the search in favor of short words, which are more represented than very long derivatives.",
        "Another possibility is to tag, during the learning stage, alternations with one or several morpho-syntactic labels expressing morphotactical restrictions: this would restrict the domain of an alternation to a certain class of words, and accordingly reduce the expansion of the analog set."

        "The paradigmatic cascades model achieves quite satisfactory generalization performances when evaluated in the task of pronouncing unknown words.",
        "Moreover, this model provides us with an effective way to define the lexical neighbourhood of a given word, on the basis of \"surface\" (orthographical) local similarities.",
        "It remains however to be seen how this model can be extended to take into account other factors which have been proven to influence analogical processes.",
        "For instance, frequency effects, which tend to favor the more frequent lexical neighbours, need to be properly model, if we wish to make a more realistic account of the human performance in the pronunciation task.",
        "In a more general perspective, the notion of similarity between linguistic objects plays a central role in many corpus-based natural language processing applications.",
        "This is especially obvious in the context of example-based learning techniques, where the inference of some unknown linguistics property of a new object is performed on the basis of the most similar available example(s).",
        "The use of some kind of similarity measure has also demonstrated its effectiveness to circumvent the problem of data sparseness in the context of statistical language modeling.",
        "In this context, we believe that our model, which is precisely capable of detecting local similarities in",
        "lexicons, and to jierform, on the basis of these similarities, a global inferential transfer of knowledge, is especially well suited for a large range of NLP tasks.",
        "Encouraging results on the task of learning the English past-tense forms have already been reported in (Yvon, 1996b), and we intend to continue to test this model on various other potentially relevant applications, such as morpho-syntactical \"guessing\", part-of-speech tagging, etc."
