        "A collocation is a recurrent combination of words, ranging from word level to sentence level.",
        "In this paper, we classify collocations into two types according to their structures.",
        "One is an uninterrupted collocation which consists of a sequence of words, the other is an interrupted collocation which consists of words containing one or several gaps filled in by substitutable words or phrases which belong to the same category.",
        "The features of collocations are defined as follows:",
        "• collocations are recurrent • collocations consist of one or several lexical units • order of units are rigid in a collocation.",
        "For language processing such as machine translation, a knowledge of domain specific collocations is indispensable because what collocations mean are different from their literal meaning and the usage and meaning of a collocation is totally dependent on each domain.",
        "In addition, new collocations are produced one after another and most of them are technical jargons.",
        "There has been a growing interest in corpus-based approaches which retrieve collocations from large corpora (Nagao and Mori, 1994), (Ikehara et al., 1996) (Kupiec, 1993), (Fung, 1995), (Kitamura and Matsumoto, 1996), (Smadja, 1993), (Smadja et al., 1996), (Haruno et al., 1996).",
        "Although these approaches achieved good results for the task considered, most of them aim to extract fixed collocations, mainly noun phrases, and require the information which is dependent on each language such as dictionaries and parts of speech.",
        "From a practical point of view, however, a more robust and flexible approach is desirable.",
        "We propose a method to retrieve interrupted and uninterrupted collocations by the frequencies of co-occurrences and word order constraints from a monolingual corpus.",
        "The method comprises two stages: the first stage extracts sequences of words (or characters) from a corpus as units of collocations and the second stage extracts recurrent combinations of units and constructs collocations by arranging them in accordance with word order in the corpus."

        "For example, even if \"local\", \"area\", and \"network\" always appear as the substrings of \"a local area net-work\" in a corpus, this method generates redundant strings such as \"a local\", \"a local area\" and \"area network\" .",
        "To filter out the fragments, we measure the distribution of adjacent words preceding and following IA word is recognized as a minimum unit in such a language as English where writespace is used to delimit words, while a character is recognized as that in such languages as Japanese and Chinese which have no word delimiters.",

        "On the contrary, the words which follow \"a local area network\" are hardly identified because \"a local area network\" is a unit of expression and innumerable words are possible to follow the string.",
