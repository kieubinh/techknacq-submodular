        "Faced with growing volume and accessibility of electronic textual information, information retrieval, and, in general, automatic documentation require updated terminological resources that are ever more voluminous.",

        "Various linguistic and statistical methods to handle this problem are coming to light.",
        "One problem that has been less studied is that of updating these resources, in particular, of classifying a term extracted from a corpus in a subject field, discipline or branch of an existing thesaurus.",
        "This is the first step in positioning a term extracted from a corpus in the structure of a thesaurus (generic relations, synonymy relations This is an important problem in certain disciplines in which knowledge, and, in particular, vocabulary is not very stable over time, especially because of neologisms.",
        "This experiment compares different models for representing a term from a corpus for its automatic classification in the subject fields of a thesaurus.",
        "The classification method used is linear discriminatory analysis, based on a learning sample.",
        "The models evaluated here are: a term/document model where each term is a vector in document vector space, two term/term models where each term is a vector in term space, and the coordinates are either the co-occurrence, or the mutual information between terms.",
        "The most effective model is the one based on mutual information between terms, which typifies the fact that two terms often appear together in the corpus, but rarely apart."

        "In documentation, terminologies, thesauri and other terminological lists are reference systems which can be used for manual or automatic indexing.",
        "Indexing consists of recognising the terms in a text that belong to a reference system; this is called controlled indexing.",
        "The quality of the result of the indexing process depends in large part on the quality of the terminology (completeness, consistence Thus, applications downstream from the indexing depend on these terminological resources.",
        "The most thoroughly studied application is the information retrieval (IR).",
        "Here, the term provides a means for accessing information through its standardising effect on the query and on the text to be found.",
        "The term can also be a variable that is used in statistical classification or clustering processes of documents ([BLO 92] and [STA 95a1), or in selective dissemination of information, in which it is used to bring together a document to be disseminated and its target [STA 93].",
        "Textual information is becoming more and more accessible in electronic form.",
        "This accessibility is certainly one of the prerequisites for the massive use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques.",
        "These techniques applied on particular domains, often use terminological resources that supplement the lexical resources.",
        "The lexical resources (general language dictionaries) are fairly stable, whereas terminologies evolve dynamically with the fields they describe.",
        "In particular, the disciplines of information processing (computers, etc.)",
        "and biology or genetics are characterised today by an extraordinary terminological activity.",
        "Unfortunately, the abundance of electronic corpora and the relative maturity of natural language processing techniques have induced a shortage of updated terminological data.",
        "The various efforts in automatic acquisition of terminologies from a corpus stem from this observation, and try to answer the following question: \"How can candidate terms be extracted from a corpus?\" Another important question is how to position a term in an existing thesaurus.",
        "That question can itself be subdivided into several questions that concern the role of the standard relationships in a thesaurus: synonymy, hyperonymy, etc.",
        "The question studied in this experiment concerns the positioning or classification of a term in a subject field or semantic field of a thesaurus.",
        "This is the first step in a precise positioning using the standard relationships of a thesaurus.",
        "This problem is very difficult for a human being to resolve when he is not an expert in the field to which the term belongs and one can hope that an automated classification process would be of great help.",
        "To classify a term in a subject field can be considered similar to ward sense disambiguation (WSD) which consists in classifying a word in a conceptual class (one of its senses).",
        "The difference is that, in a corpus, a term is generally monosemous and a word is polysemous.",
        "Word sense disambiguation uses a single context (generally a window of a few words around the word to be disambiguated) as input to predict its sense among a few possible senses (generally less than ten).",
        "Term subject field discrimination uses a representation of the term calculated on the whole corpus in order to classify it into about 330 subject fields in this experiment.",
        "The experiment described here was used to evaluate different methods for classifying terms from a corpus in the subject fields of a thesaurus.",
        "After a brief description of the corpus and the thesaurus, automatic indexing and terminology extraction are described.",
        "Linguistic and statistical techniques are used to extract a candidate term from a corpus or to recognise a term in a document.",
        "This preparatory processing allows the document to be represented as a set",
        "of terms (candidate terms and key words).",
        "A classification method is then implemented to classify a subset of 1 1000 terms in the 49 themes and 330 semantic fields that make up the thesaurus.",
        "The 1,000 terms thus classified comprise the test sample that is used to evaluate three models for representing terms."
