        "The traditional approach to automatic abstracting aims at providing a reader with fast access to documents by facilitating a judgement on their relevance to his or her information needs.",

        "In this paper, we discuss an approach to automatic abstracting where an abstract is created by extracting sentences from a text that are indicative of its content.",
        "In particular, the paper focuses on creating abstracts of Japanese newspaper texts.",
        "An approach to abstracting by extraction typically makes use of a text corpus with labelled extracts, indicating which sentence is a summary extract.",
        "However, as far as we know, no question has ever been raised on the empirical validity of the extracts used.",
        "Usually, extracts are manually supplied by",
        "the author himself (Watanabe, 1996) or by someone else (McKeown.",
        "and Radev, 1995) (as in the TIPSTER Ziff-Davis corpus).",
        "Or one takes a roundabout way to identify extracts in a text through a human-supplied abstract (Kupiec et al., 1995).",
        "In the paper, we will propose .",
        "a method for identifying summary extracts in a way that allows objective justification.",
        "We will do this by examining how humans perform on summary extraction and evaluating the reliability of their performance, using the kappa statistic, a metric standarclly used in the behavioral sciences (Jean Carletta, 1996; Sidney Siegel and N. John CasteIlan Jr., 1988).",
        "Based on summary extracts supplied by humans, we construct a collection of texts annotated with information on sentence importance.",
        "They will be used as training and test data for a decision tree approach to abstracting, which we adopt in the paper (Quinlan, 1993).",
        "In a decision tree approach, the task of extracting summary sentences is treated as a two-way classification task, where a sentence is assigned to either \"yes\" or \"no\" category, depending on its likelihood of being a summary sentence.",
        "The merit of a decision tree method is that it provides a generic framework in which to combine knowledge from multiple sources, a property necessary for automatic abstracting where information from a single source alone often fails to determine which sentence to extract."

        "The Kappa Statistic Following Jean Carletta (1996), we use the kappa statistic (Sidney Siegel and N. John Castellan Jr., 1988) to measure degree of agreement among subjects.",
        "The reason for choosing the kappa over other measures of agreement (Passonneau and Litman, 1993) derives from our interest in discovering a relationship between the reliability or quality of data (as quantified by some metric) and the performance of automatic abstracting.",
        "As aptly pointed out in Jean Carletta (1996), agreement measures proposed so far in the computational linguistics literature has failed to ask an important question of whether results obtained using agreement data are in any way different from random data.",
        "It has been left unclear just how high level of agreement among subjects needs to be achieved before reliably using data.",
        "It could be the case that data with high agreement may still be too noisy to use for a task for which they were collected.",
        "We assume that the kappa coefficient gives a suitable way of measuring the reliability of data, where we take reliability to mean reproducibility of data, or the degree to which data are reproduced under different circumstances, with different coders (Krippendorff, 1980).",
        "The kappa coefficient (K) of agreement measures the ratio of observed agreements to possible agreements among a set of raters on category judgements, correcting for chance agreement:",
        "where P(A) is the proportion of the times that raters agree and P(E) is the proportion of the times that we would expect them to agree by chance.",
        "K =1 if there is complete agreement among the raters.",
        "K = 0 if there is no agreement other than that which is expected by chance.",
        "Consider a set of k raters and a group of N objects, each of which is to be assigned to one of in categories.",
        "Each of the raters assigns each object to one category.",
        "We represent the assignments data as an N x m matrix (Table 2), where the value (nii) at each cellid (0 < i< N, 0 <j < m) denotes the number of raters assigning the ith object to the jth category.",
        "Let Ci be the total number of times that objects are assigned to the jth category, i.e., Ci nii- Si measures the proportion of pairwise agreements among the raters on category assignments for a particular object i. Si gives a measurement of agreement among raters on decisions regarding which category a given object i is to be assigned to.",

        "Note that 0 < S < 1.",
        "S = 1 when there is total agreement among the raters for a given category j on the ith row.",
        "Suppose that we asked 2m raters to assign two objects a and b to one of m categories and found results as in Table 3.",
        "For a, there is a complete agreement on the object's category, while for b, decisions are spread evenly over m categories.",

        "P(E) is defined as the sum of chance agreement for each category (Def 4), representing the overall rate of agreement by chance.",
        "The values of P(A) and P(E) are then combined to give the kappa coefficient K. Evaluation Judgements produced by subjects on a summary extraction task can be cast into an assignments matrix in a number of different ways.",
        "(Note that a single extraction",
        "task consists of extracting a specified number of sentences from one text.)",
        "We adopt here a representation scheme where we take N to be the number of choices made by a subject for a text and 712 to be the number of sentences in that text.' (Note that since we asked a subject to choose 10% of sentences in the text, the number of extractions made for each text depends entirely on the text's length, but the number of extractions from a given text should be the same across subjects.)",
        "Imagine for instance that nine subjects are asked to extract three most important sentences from a text with ten sentences.",
        "Under the scheme here, the resulting data could be represented as a matrix of height N = 3 and width m = 10 with k = 9 like one in Table 4, where the first object is thought of as an earliest occurring sentence a subject considers most important, the second object as a second earliest occurring sentence a subject considers most important, and the third object as a third earliest sentence a subject considers most important.",
        "It is important to notice that a matrix is constructed for each extraction task and the agreement coefficient K is determined for each task, not for each sentence in the text.",
        "Table 5 lists the K values for subjects' judgements on sentence importance, averaged over texts.",
        "The number of subjects assigned to one extraction task varied from 4 to 9.",
        "96% of the time, we had over 6 subjects working on a same task.",
        "The average number of subjects per text was 7.33.2 We find in Table 5, however, that there is only marginal agreement among subjects.",
        "'Another possibility is to represent the data as an N x m matrix of height N=the number of sentences in the text and width m = 2 (yes/no), representing a binary judgement about whether a given sentence is relevant for summarizin.g.",
        "'In Table 5, there are more raters than subjects.",
        "This happens because subjects are multiply assigned to extraction tasks.",
        "Level of Agreement and Data Reliability For a behavioral scientist, results in Table 5 would indicate that judgements produced by humans on the summary extraction are not to be trusted: on the reliability scale in Table 6, rates we get for the extraction data are somewhere between SLIGHT and FAIR.",
        "However it is not immediately clear how an abstracting program trained on such 'untrustworthy' data would perform.",
        "How does the notion of level of agreement or data reliability in a behavioral scientist's sense relate to the performance of automatic abstracting ?",

        "In fact our approach here provides a principled basis for Passonneau and Litman (1993)'s notion of majority opinion through the kappa statistic.",
        "Now a decision on whether or not a sentence should be included in a summary extract is said to be a majority opinion if it is positively agreed upon by n subjects, where n ranges anywhere from 2 to the total number of subjects assigned to a task.3 Data with various levels of agreement can be obtained by removing from agreement tables those decisions which are against the majority opinion for various values of n.4 Of them, only those data whose agreement rate is over a specific K threshold are used as training/test data for automatic abstracting.",

        "The row represents K thresholds, and the column represents text types.",
        "Figures in parentheses are the number of texts with a given threshold.",
        "3 For the reasons mentioned earlier, we dismiss a negative agreement among the majority altogether, which is in contrast with Passonneau and Litman (1993)'s approach where agreement among the majority, either positive or negative, counts as a majority opinion."

        "Since the accuracy of evaluation can vary wildly depending on ways in which the data is divided into training and test sets, the re-sampling method of cross-validation is used here, which gives the average over possible partitions of the data.",
        "into training and test sets.",
        "In particular, we use a 10-fold cross-validation method where the data are divided into 10 blocks of cases, of which 9 blocks are used for the training and the remaining one for the",
        "test.",
        "Note that the method here gives a rise to 10 possible divisions and an equal number of corresponding decision tree models.",
        "The average performance of the generated models is then obtained and used as a summary estimate of the decision tree strategy for a particular set of evaluation data.",
        "Further we use information retrieval metrics, recall and precision, to quantify the performance of the decision tree approach.",
        "Precision is the ratio of cases assigned correctly to the \"yes\" category to the total cases assigned to the \"yes\" category.",
        "Recall is the ratio of cases assigned correctly to the \"yes\" category to the total \"yes\" cases.",
        "Furthermore, because different samplings of evaluation data from a source data set could produce wide variations in performance, we performed 50 runs of the evaluation procedure on each of the 9 data sets Each run used a separately (and randomly) sampled set of evaluation data.",
        "Results of multiple runs of the procedure on a data set were then averaged to give a representative performance rating for that data set.",
        "Table 9 lists the average precision ratings for the nine data sets.",
        "Despite some fluctuations of the figures, the results exhibit clear patterns (Figure 2); the kappa coefficient is strongly correlated with performance for texts of editorial type and of news-report type, but correlation for column-type texts is only marginal.",
        "There are also marked differences in performance between text types; the decision tree method performs best on news reports and editorials, but worst on columns.",
        "This means that the attributes used are effective only for texts of certain types.",
        "The results suggest, further, that if attributes used are indeed a good predictor of summary extracts, their strength as a predictor will be enhanced by the reliability or quality of human judgements.",
        "Thus the method's poor performance on column-type texts, despite the fact that texts are becoming increasingly reliable, suggests a need to devise a set of attributes different from those for editorials and news reports."
