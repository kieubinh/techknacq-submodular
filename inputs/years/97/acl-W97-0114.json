        "This paper proposes a. method to identify zero pronouns within a Japanese sentence and their antecedent equivalents within the corresponding English sentence from aligned sentence pairs.",

        "In this method, the Japanese sentence and English translation within the Japanese and English aligned sentence pairs are analyzed.",
        "Then, the pairs of Japanese word/phrase and their English equivalent word/phrase are identified from each aligned sentence pair.",
        "Next, zero pronouns within a Japanese sentence are identified by using the syntactic and semantic stricture of the Japanese sentence and their antecedents within the English sentence are identified by using the characteristics of anaphoric and deictic expressions in English.",
        "This method was implemented using the Japanese-to-English machine translation system, ALT-J/E for the analysis of Japanese sentences and Brill's tagger for the analysis of the English sentences.",
        "According to my evaluation, for 554 zero pronouns in a sentence set for the evaluation of Japanese-to-English machine translation systems, 91.5% of the pairs of zero pronouns in the Japanese sentences and their antecedents in the English translations were automatically identified correctly."

        "In natural languages, elements that can be easily deduced by the reader are frequently omitted from expressions in texts (Kuno, 1978).",
        "This phenomenon causes considerable problems in natural language processing systems.",
        "For example, in a machine translation system, the system needs to recognize those elements which are not present in the source language, but may become mandatory elements in the target language.",
        "In particular, the subject and object are often omitted in Japanese; whereas they are normally obligatory in English.",
        "Thus, in Japanese-to-English machine translation systems, it is necessary to identify case elements omitted from the original Japanese (\"zero pronouns\") for their translation into English expressions.",
        "Several algorithms have been proposed with regard to this problem (Kameyama, 1986; Walker et al., 1990; Yoshimoto, 1988; Dou.saka, 1994).",
        "When considering the application of these methods to a practical machine translation system for which the translation target area can not be limited, it is not possible to apply them directly, both because their precision of resolution is low as they only use limited information, and because the volume of knowledge that must be prepared beforehand is so large.",
        "To overcome these kinds of problems, several methods to resolve zero pronouns which consider applications for a practical machine translation system with an unlimited translation target area, have been proposed (Nakaiwa and Ikehara, 1992; Nakaiwa.",
        "and Ikehara, 1995; Nakaiwa and Ikehara, 1996).",
        "These methods use categorized semantic and pragmatic constraints such as verbal semantic attributes (Nakaiwa et al., 1994) and types of modal expressions and conjunctions as a condition for anaphora resolution of zero pronouns.",
        "But, with these methods it is necessary to make resolution rules for zero pronouns by hand.",
        "To make robust rules, with wide coverage, takes a lot of time and labor.",
        "Analysts who make these resolution rules must be familiar with the NLP system itself.",
        "Furthermore, the types of zero pronouns change depending on the types of documents which must be analyzed.",
        "So, resolution rules must be made depending on the target domain of the documents.",
        "But, it is very difficult to make rules for every domain because of the time consuming labor and the need for expertise.",
        "Because of these problems, a method to make resolution rules of zero pronouns effectively and efficiently is needed.",
        "In order to acquire resolution rules for a NLP system effectively and efficiently, various methods have been proposed.",
        "One typical method for this purpose is to use a. corpus for extracting resolution rules by analyzing each sentence in the corpus.",
        "With regard to the automatic extraction of resolution rules for zero pronouns, several methods have been proposed (Murata and Nagao, 1997; Nasu.kawa, 1996).",
        "But these methods use monolingual corpora and they find it difficult to extract resolution rules of zero pronouns whose referents are normally unexpressed in Japanese.",
        "Furthermore, rules can only be made when similar expressions to those containing the zero pronouns are found in the corpus.",
        "It seems that a bilingual corpus consisting of sentence pairs, with an original in one language and a translation, is better than a monolingual corpus for the purpose of acquiring resolution rules of zero pronouns.",
        "This is particularly so with a bilingual corpus of Japanese and English whose language families are so different and in which the distribution of zero pronouns is also very different.",
        "This combination is more useful than the bilingual corpora of similar languages.",
        "The technique for acquiring various kinds of rules such as translation rules, grammar rules, dictionary entries and so on from bilingual corpora needs to include several kinds of sub-techniques; identification of aligned sentence pairs which consist of pairs of one language sentence and translation equivalents of the sentence (sentence alignment); identification of equivalent -words/phrases pairs from aligned sentence pairs (word alignment); and extraction of rules such as translation rules, grammar rules, dictionary entries and so on from identified aligned sentence pairs and equivalent word/phrase pairs.",
        "Several methods have been proposed with regard to aligning sentences (Brown et al., 1991; Gale and Church, 1991; Haruno and Yama,zaki, 1996; Kay and Roscheisen, 1993), aligning words (Church, 1993; Kupiec, 1993; Matsumoto et al., 1993; Wu, 1995; Yamada et al., 1996) and acquiring rules from bilingual corpora (Dagan et al., 1991; Dagan and Church, 1994; Fang and Church, 1994; Tanaka, 1994; Yamada et al., 1995).",
        "From the point of view of the extraction of resolution rules of zero pronouns, a technique to identify zero pronouns in a sentence in one language and their antecedents in a translation from aligned sentence pairs is needed.",
        "But there is currently no method to identify zero pronouns and their antecedents automatically within bilingual corpora."

        "This paper proposes a powerful method for the automatic identification of Japanese zero pronouns and their antecedents from Japanese and English aligned sentence pairs.",
        "In this paper, only Japanese and English language pairs have been discussed.",
        "But this method can be applied to various kinds of language pairs such as Italian and English, and the effectiveness of the identification depends on how different the two languages are.",
        "In the future, the effectiveness of proposed method for aligned sentence pairs with zero pronouns with intersentential antecedents and for very large corpora of aligned sentence pairs will be examined The effectiveness of the use of English parsers for the English analysis will also be considered.",
        "Methods for extracting the most effective rules for resolving Japanese zero pronouns from aligned sentence pairs will also be studied.",
        "Furthermore, I would like to link more powerful and more robust word alignment techniques, which can align for unknown words in noisy texts, to the proposed method and also would like to link the proposed method with sentence alignment techniques."
