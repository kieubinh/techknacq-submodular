        "The overall precision rate for the system described in this paper is lower than that of similar systems developed for English, since no test of significance was used to filter out possibly erroneous cues.",
        "In the experiment described in the previous section, truly new prepositional frames behaved with respect to frequency of occurrence very much like errors, and would possibly have been discarded by a filtering mechanism A problem in the current version of the system was the fact that segmentation of nominal constituents was not optimally handled by the detection component, leading to a large number of verbal frames with correct prepositions, but with an additional erroneous accusative/dative NC in the frame.",
        "So the precision of the system can be significantly improved with further development of the detection component.",
        "Further, the system should be extended to handle other types of pronominal adverb cues, such as pro-forms for interrogative, personal and relative pronouns; possibly PPs headed by prepositions should also be considered.",
