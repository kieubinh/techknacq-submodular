        "In this paper we describe a method of improving the accuracy of automated speech recognit through text-based linguistic post-processing.",
        "The basic assumption of our approach is tha majority of transcription errors can be attributed to either some inherent limitations of the t guage model employed by a speech recognition system, or else to the specific speech patterns c speaker or a group of speakers.",
        "Many advanced speech recognition systems use trainable I guage models that can be optimized for a particular speaker (speaker-adaptable, or speaker-ii pendent) as well as for a specific sublanguge usage (e.g., radiology).",
        "This optimization necessary to achieve a respectable level of recognition accuracy, however, it may not guaran consistently high-accuracy performance due to the limited capabilities of the underlying langw model, usually a 2 or 3-gram HMMs.",
        "Our method is to take a reasonably accurate transcript (perhaps 70-90% word accuracy) and automatically develop a correction filter that would assi",
        "consistently the highest possible performance.",
        "Unlike other approaches (e.g., Sekine & Grishrn 1996) that attempt to choose from among alternative transcriptions based on syntactic and/or b ical well-formedness, our method is to actually identify and correct transcription errors in the Sl output.",
        "We would like to stress that while the experiments described in this paper are relatively mod and preliminary, the system we designed is robust and fully automatic: there is no human int vention involved."

        "In clinical radiology, an on-duty radiologist reviews and reads dozens of images a day: x-ray fi as well as digital imagery such as CTIs and MRIs, etc.",
        "A radiology department at a medium si hospital handles hundreds of images every day.",
        "In a typical situation, an on-call radiologist exa ines a series of images and dictates his or her findings into a recording device, except in emi gency situations where the consultation may be read directly to an attending physician.",
        "Voi recordings are then sent for transcription, usually by outsourcing, and return as text reports fort radiologist's signature.",
        "The turnaround of this process may take anywhere from a few hours several days, depending upon the priority of the request, and the efficiency of the transcripti service.",
        "For a radiologist dictating dozens of reports a day, it is practically impossible to truly v4 ify the transcription arriving for his signature a few days later - that is verify beyond a surfa \"makes-sense\" assessment.",
        "Therefore, an automated transcription system that can generate printed report within seconds after being dictated, represents a substantial improvement in quail of this process, while eliminating costly manual labor.",
        "The above argument is of course conditioned upon the quality and reliability of automated spee transcription process.",

        "Our initial experiments suggest that this m indeed be possible.",
        "It remains to be seen whether the resulting system can be used in a real radic ogy dictation environment.",

      "text": [
        "The basic premise of our approach is to utilize linguistic and sublanguage-specific informatic even speaker-specific features, in order to improve the accuracy of speech transcription.",
        "For t experiments described in this paper, we considered the speech recognition system as a black be that is, our efforts were directed at correcting the transcription errors in a post-processing moc",
        "rather than to improve the initial transcription.",
        "One advantage of this two-pass approach is independence from any particular SRS, and indeed our Correction Box (C-Box) module can used as a back-end of any speech system.",
        "Nonetheless, there are other possibilities as well, we mention them briefly in the Future Directions section.",
        "The main goal of the C-Box approach is to generate a collection of context-sensitive text-ba correction rules, in the form of XLY XRY , where X and Y are context word patterns, L is a w pattern in an erroneous transcription string, and R is a replacement string correcting transcript errors in L. In order to generate the correction rules we require both training and validation st to optimize the C-Box performance with respect to a specific sublanguage as well as a speake a group of speakers.",
        "Therefore, the C-Box approach consists of the following sub-processes: collecting training data, (2) aligning text samples, (3) generating correction rules, (4) validat correction rules, and (5) applying correction rules."

        "Step 1.",
        "The process is started by collecting a sufficient amount of training text data.",
        "The train data must contain parallel text samples: a manually verified true transcription, and the output the ASR system on the same voice input.",
        "We estimate that about a day worth of dictation is su cient to initiate the training process, some 300 reports or about 150 ICBytes of text.",
        "In additiot fair-sized text corpus of historical, fully verified transcriptions is required.",
        "In the experime described in this paper we used about 1000 reports (400 ICBytes) of parallel text, plus an additional 5881 correct transcriptions corpus (total 3.25 MBytes).",
        "The training was performed on 1 reports, and tested on 200 reports.",
        "Step 2.",
        "The parallel text samples are aligned, sentence by sentence on the word level.",
        "This is achieved using content-word islands, then expanding onto the remaining words, while using so common-sense heuristics in deciding the replacement string correspondences: misaligned sections while different in print, are nonetheless close \"phonetic variants\".",
        "We use character-le alignment for support, especially if the replacement scope is uncertain.",
        "Additionally, we allow known spelling variants to align, e.g., \"1\" for \"one\", or \"Xray\" for \"X - ray\" or \"X-ray\", etc.",
        "Step 3.",
        "When a misalignment is detected, the system lexicon is automatically checked for mi ing words, i.e., we check to see if any given transcription error arose because the speaker had uJ some word or words that are unknown to the speech recognition system.",
        "This is accomplished looking up the misaligned words in a broad-coverage medical terminology lexiconl.",
        "Since st words will be eventually entered into the SRS lexicon, thus eliminating transcription errors, decided not to generate correction rules for them, at this time.",
        "Step 4.",
        "Misaligned sections give rise to preliminary context-free string replacement \"rule R, where L is a section in the ASR output, and R is the corresponding section of the true transcription.",

        "(1994).",
        "The post-correction approach has been considered by Ringger and Allen (1996), for a diffe domain (trains scheduling dialog), and using a probabilistic modeling technique rather than rection rules.",
        "They report some interesting preliminary results, however these are not dire comparable to ours for two reasons.",
        "First, the baseline SRS system used in these experimen much weaker (only about 58% accurate).",
        "Second, the reported improvement cover correction vocabulary deficiencies, not only true transcription mistakes due to weaknesses of the langu model.",
        "It should also be noted here that while the above efforts usually attack the more general prob of speech understanding accuracy, in an ad-hoc speech production situation (though limitel certain domains such as broadcast news), our solution has been specifically tailored to din dictation, and wouldn't necessarily apply elsewhere.",
        "Some of the application characteristics we take advantage of is relatively limited vocabulary (hence smaller training samples), a Jim number of speakers (hence speaker independence less critical), and relatively low perplexit: radiology sublanguage (about 20 vs. about 250 for general English as measured for trigram n els (Roukos, 1995)).",
        "The C-Box approach does not preclude N-Best techniques - in fact we c sider this as a natural extension of the present method - one of the obvious limitations of present approach is the need for parallel training texts, which may be replaced by multiple al natives.",
        "Overall, the C-Box approach is partly related to error-driven learning techniques as used for p of-speech tagging (Brill, 1992, 1995), and spelling correction (e.g., Golding & Schabes, 1996' Text alignment methods have been discussed primarily in context of machine translation, (c Brown et.",

        "It remains to be seen if the present solution is acceptab.",
        "and if a degree of speaker independence can be introduced through rule generalization.",
        "Furth research and evaluations are required with context-sensitive correction rules and various sizes the training data.",
        "At this time it is also an open question how much improvement can be achiev using this method, i.e., if there is an upper bound, and if so what that is.",
        "On the face of it, ti seems to depend only on how good rules we can get.",
        "In practice, we face limits of rule leamabili due to sparse data, as well as rule interference (i.e., one rule may undo another, etc.).",
        "We plan study these issues in the near future.",
        "There are also other possibilities.",
        "Some SRS produce ranked lists of alternative transcriptions 0 Best), which can be used to further improve the chances of making only the right correctior Using N-Best sentence hypotheses may also alleviate the need for parallel correct transcriptio in the training sample, as multiple hypotheses can be aligned in order to postulate correction rulf Using multiple SRS in parallel may also increase the likelihood of locating and correcting spir ous transcription errors.",
        "Finally, we may consider an open-box solution where the informath encoded in C-Box rules is fed back into the SRS language model to improve its baseline perfc mance.",
        "At this time, we made no attempt to address any of the problems related to spontaneous speec such as disfluencies and self-repairs (e.g., Oviatt, 1994; Heeman & Allen, 1994).",
        "In dictatic where the speaker normally has an option of backing up and re-recording, such things are less an issue than the word-for-word accuracy of the final transcription, since there are serious Habib considerations to be reckoned with.",
