        "How similAr are two corpora?",
        "The question arises on many occasions.",
        "Does it matter whether lexicographers use this corpora or that, or are they similar enough for it to make no difference?",
        "(The original impetus for the research was the question, \"are the fiction and journalism parts of the Longman Lancaster Corpus and British National Corpus' (BNC) interchangeable?\")",
        "In NLP, many useful results can be generated from corpora, but when can the results developed using one corpus be applied to another?",
        "There are also questions of more general interest.",
        "Looking at British national newspapers: is the Independent more like the Guardian or the Telegraph?",
        "There are many ways in which the question could be addressed, but the one we take here is to take texts from each newspaper and compare the frequencies of words used.",
        "Given an accurately part-of-speech-tagged or parsed corpus, the same method could be applied to frequency lists of parts-of-speech or syntactic constructions, and the methodological part of the paper would still be salient.",
        "Section 2 presents the case for using word frequencies.",
        "How homogeneous is a corpus?",
        "The question is both of interest in its own right, and is a preliminary to any quantitative approach to corpus similarity.",
        "It is of interest in its own right, because a sublanguage corpus, or one containing only a specific language variety, has very different characteristics to a general corpus (Biber, 1993), yet it is not obvious how a corpus's position on this scale can be assessed.",
        "It is of interest as a preliwtirry to a measure of corpus similarity, because it is not clear what a measure of similarity would mean if a homogeneous corpus was",
        "being compared with a heterogeneous one.",
        "For the statistical language modelling community, the preferred approach to assessing homogeneity is by calculating perplexity, and the approach can be extending to measuring similarity by calculating cross-entropy (Charniak, 1993).",
        "In section 6 compare these methods with the approach developed here.",
        "In this paper we present a method for measuring both corpus similarity and corpus homogeneity.",
        "In brief, the method (for the homogeneity case) is as follows:",
        "• Divide the corpus into two halves by randomly placing texts in one of two subcorpora; • Produce a word frequency list for each subcorpus; • Calculate the x2 statistic for the difference between the two subcorpora; • Normalise; • Iterate.",
        "(to give different random halves); • Interpret result by comparing values for different corpora.",
        "The only differences for the corpus-similarity case are that (1) one subcorpus is taken from the first corpus and the other from the second, and (2) the similarity value is to be interpreted by reference to the homogeneity measure for each corpus.",
        "After arguing the the case for using word frequency lists and describing related work, the paper describes the various pitfallq the measure must avoid and presents some first results."

      "heading": "2 Why word frequency lists?",
      "text": [
        "Are word frequency lists interesting?",
        "Many think not.",
        "There are two recurring themes amongst the noes.",
        "Firstly, what is important about texts is their meaning Since the message is thrown.",
        "out when a text is reduced to a frequency list, the heart of the text is jettisoned.",
        "This argument comes from all quarters: the second comes mainly from linguists.",
        "It is that, if we are to count, the objects we should be counting are ones with a linguistic pedigree.",
        "In relation to content, we should be counting word senses, or lexical units, since any list will be compromised if money bank and river bank are counted together.",
        "In relation to form, we should be counting grammatical constructions: numbers of relative clauses or passives tell us far more about the linguistic character of a text than numbers of occurrences of who or which.",
        "Taking the general argument first, firstly, a text without its context is itself an abstraction.",
        "A transcript of a conversation is a more concise version than an audio tape (which is itself more concise than a video tape).",
        "A newspaper article is understood more fully if the reader is well-versed in the political or other circumstances of its publication.",
        "There is not a complete break between texts, which present meaning, and frequency lists, which do not.",
        "Secondly, our concern is with language corpora, not with texts.",
        "While a text may be coherent in its meaning, a corpus comprising multiple texts can scarcely be.",
        "The objective in gathering multiple-text corpora is to identify a linguistic object in which the individual meanings of teats are taken out of focus, to be replaced by the character of the whole.",
        "Thirdly, as will be evident too all workers in corpus-based computational linguistics, frequency lists are very useful representations of meaning for information retrieval, text categorisation, and numerous other purposes.",
        "They are useful because they are a. representation of the text which is susceptible to automatic, objective manipulation.",
        "The full text is very rich in information, but",
        "that information cannot be readily used to make, e.g., similarity judgements.",
        "When a text or corpus is represented as a frequency list, much information is lost, but the tradeoff is an object that is susceptible to statistical processing.",
        "To move on to the concerns regarding what is counted: in exploring word frequency lists we are also investigating a hypothesis Sinclair has postulated Every distinct sense of a word is associated with a distinction in form2 We take this one step further and postulate \"no linguistic distinction without a word frequency distinction\"; any difference in the linguistic character of two corpora will leave its trace in a difference between their word frequency lists.",
        "It may not be evident which words will be more frequent, and which less, if one corpus uses more relative clauses and less passives than another, on this hypothesis, some will be.",
        "An advantage of using word frequency lists is that there is so much data: two corpora can be compared in respect of thousands of data points (e.g., words).",
        "Although money bank and river bank are counted together, corpora using the one and corpora using the other will tend to be discriminated because the one corpus will use money, account and Barclays more, the other, river and grassy.",
        "It is a research question to determine which words' frequencies vary for a given variation in linguistic structures (see the section on newspapers for an indication of how this can proceed).",
        "For current purposes, we can happily pool the data, referring only to individual words when we seek further insight into why we get the results we do.",
        "Biber's work (see below) shows how quantitative methods can be used to discover and capture register differences, and some of the objects he counts are words (others being grsmrsatical constructions), so his work provides some grounds for optimism.",
        "The hypothesis would of course be a very useful, if true.",
        "Words are far easier to count accurately than syntactic categories or word senses.",
        "To count syntactic categories requires linguistic theory to identify precisely what the syntactic category is; empirical research to identify the features that indicate where it is present; and a computer program, to automatically identify occurrences.",
        "The first two stages are likely to introduce theoretical disagreements, and the last two, errors.",
        "The prospects for two independent teams arriving at the same syntactic-construction frequency list for the same corpus are slim.",
        "By contrast, if agreement is reached on a few tokeni.sadon issues (hyphens, clitics), the chances of two groups arriving at identical word frequency lists is very good.",
        "The rule that any string of alphanumerics surrounded by whitespace or punctuation is a word may have its shortcomings, but it makes word-counting very reliable.",
        "Word frequency lists are cheap and easy to generate, so a measure of corpus similarity based on them would be of use as a quick guide in many circumstances where a more extensive analysis of the two corpora was not viable; for example, to judge how a newly available corpus related to existing resources, so a decision about buying it or installing it could be made, or as a preliminary assessment of how much customisation was likely to be necessary to port an NLP application from one domain (and corpus) to another."

        "corpus, most resemble each other.",
        "They take the 89 most common words in the corpus, find their rank within each genre, and calculate a Spearman rank correlation statistic.",
        "This method is compared empirically with the x2 method in some detail in section 6 below.",
        "There is a large body of work aiming to find words which are particularly characteristic of one text, or corpus, in contrast to another.4 This includes work on linguistic variation, author identification (Mosteller and Wallace, 1964) and information retrieval (Salton, 1989).",
        "(Dunning, 1993) and (Pedersen, 1996) shows how some of the methods which have been used in the past (particularly mutual information scores) are invalid for rare events, and introduce accurate measures of how 'surprising' rare events are.",
        "(Church and Gale, 1995a) show how Inverse Document Frequency, a measure based on the proportion of documents a word occurs in, can be used alongside word frequency to estimate how distinctive a word is of the texts it occurs in.",
        "(Church and Gale, 1995b) extend this work, showing how to model word frequency distributions in a manner consistent with the fact that some words are evenly spread, while others tend to occur often in documents where they occur at all.",
        "As most of this work aims to find good indexing terms for information retrieval, it is mostly concerned with middle-to-low frequency items, and differences in topic rather than differences in register.",
        "There is a growing body of work which explores and quantifies the differences between corpora.",
        "Preeminent in this field is Biber (Biber, 1988; Biber, 1995), in whose studies the objective is to identify the major dimensions of linguistic variation across languages, and to identify the linguistic and functional characteristics which co-occur in the different registers of a language.",
        "His method involves counting a range of linguistic features in each text, and then using factor analysis to determine which of the features co-occur.",
        "Co-occurring features are then grouped together to give the dimensions of variation, and the texts (or corpora) of different registers can be identified by their location with respect to these dimensions.",
        "A recent paper by (Sekine, 1997) explores the domain dependence of parsing.",
        "He parses corpora of various text genres, identifies the subtrees of depth 1 in each corpus, and counts the number of occurrences of each subtree.",
        "This gives him a subtree frequency list for each corpus, and he is then able to investigate which subtree are markedly different in frequency between corpora.",
        "Such work is highly salient for customising parsers for particular domains In the current context, Sekine's subtree frequency lists can readily be compared with word frequency lists to determine which lists are better for measuring corpus similarity and homogeneity.",
        "Within the literature on statistical language modelling, there is much discussion of related questions.",
        "From an information-theoretic point of view, the theoretical answer to the problem is simple: entropy is a measure of a corpus's homogeneity, and the cross-entropy between two corpora quantifies their similarity.",
        "Entropy is not a quantity that can be directly measured.",
        "The standard problem for statistical language modelling is to aim to find the model for which the 'cross-entropy' of the model for the corpus is as low as possible.",
        "For a perfect language model, the cross-entropy would be the entropy of the corpus (Church and Mercer, 1993; Cha.miak, 1993).",
        "The potential for using information-theoretic constructs to measure corpus similarity is a topic for current research.",
        "The Known Similarity Corpora evaluation methodology presented in Section 6 will be applicable to the issue of assessing how well cross-entropy captures pre-theoretical notions of corpus similarity and homogeneity."

        "From the point of view of measuring corpus homogeneity or similarity, it is desirable to use a method which minimises the significance of the division of a corpus into texts.",
        "'Text' and 'document' are problematic constructs: any corpus-building project has to make a range of practical decisions about what is to be considered a text, determining, for example, whether all the poems in a book of poetry count as one text, and how newspapers are going to be divided.",
        "The one point at which our method uses the division into texts is in identifying the chunks of the corpus to be randomly placed in a subcorpus.",
        "Any subdivisions of the corpus which tended to keep contiguous material together and which gave an appropriate number of chunlm (say, between 20 and 200), all of approximately the same size, would be satisfactory.",
        "One possibility is to treat a corpus as a single text, with chunks specified as \"first 5,000 words\", \"next 5,000 words\", etc., the strategy adopted in the experiments described below.",

        "For a contingency table of dimensions m x n, if the null hypothesis is true, the statistic (where 0 is the observed value, E is the expected value calculated on the basis of the joint corpus, and the sum is over the cells of the contingency table) will be x2-distributed with (m – 1) x (n – 1) degrees of freedom.7 (Hofiand and Johansson, 1982) use the test to identify where words are significantly more frequent in the LOB corpus (of British English) than in the Brown corpus (of American English).",
        "In the table where they make the comparison, the x2-value for each word is given, with the value marked 1, 2 or 3 if it exceeds the critical value of the statistic at any of three different significant levels, so one might infer that the LOB-Brown difference was non-random.",

        "Broadsheet newspapers were used as one of the language varieties for each of the KSC sets; the other varieties were chosen on the basis of (1) quantity of text (over 380,000 words were needed to construct the KSC sets), (2) ideally, it was neither too homogeneous (as that would tend to make the task too Pagy) nor too heterogeneous (as then it would not be clear whether the gold standard was true), and (3) it was not too similar to 'broadsheet newspaper' (again, it would not be clear whether the gold standard was true).",
        "This last constraint could be interpreted as meaning that I did not make the task too difficult: this was an unavoidable by-product of ensuring the validity of the gold standard.",
        "It is not pernicious since the technique is only to be used to compare one corpus-similarity statistic with another.",
        "The first three KSC sets contained, in addition to broadsheet-newspaper (for which I used a combination of Guardian and Independent material, hereafter 'ballast% the sources in Table 6.",
        "The sets were constructed as in ratios of 5:0, 4:1, 3:2, 2:3, 1:4 and 0:5, with each corpus comprising 200,000 words.",
        "I then computed corpus similarity.",
        "I used both x2 and Spearman Rank Correlation (hereafter spearman).",
        "As, for evaluation purposes, I was concerned only with similarity measures and gold standard statements did not relate to homogeneity scores, I used whole-corpus frequencies rather than repeatedly taking different random halves of each corpus and averaging results.",
        "This test turned out to be easy.",
        "Provided more than ten words were used as data points, both statistics gave 100% correct answers.",
        "9UCREL, the Unit for Computer Research into Language at the Lancaster University currently has a grant proposal for gathering data about human judgements of similarity between text genres.",
        "To determine whether the one statistic performed better than the other, a more stringent test was required.",
        "Two of the sources already used, the DNB and Compugram/Unigram, had been particularly dissimilar to the ballast.",
        "For the next round, sources more similar to ballast were selected (though the overriding constraint was, again, quantity of text available).",
        "The three further sources were all periodicals (see Table 7).",
        "Also the corpus size was halved to 100,000, and the ratios varied by tenths rather than fifths (2:8, 3:7, 4:6, 5:5, 4:6, 3:7 and 2:8; there was only enough texts for sets such as these.)",
        "Each of these three KSC sets provided 105 gold standard statements.",
        "The results are presented in Table 8.",
        "The table shows that, for this task,",
        "• both measures give correct answers most of the time, • x2 almost always outperforms spearman, • both methods tend to perform better if more data are provided up to a level of around 640 data points, eg., comparing frequencies for the 640 most frequent words.",
        "For any word which is most frequent in the corpus with most ballast, next most frequent in the corpus with next most ballast, and so on, if X2 similarity measures are computed using just that word as evidence, the score would give 100% correct answers.",
        "The is close to being such a word.",
        "Just using the word the gives 99% correct answers for the BMJ KSC set, but little better than chance for ENV and ACC."

        "A measure of corpus similarity has been presented.",

        "The measure can also be used to quantify the homogeneity of a corpus.",
        "The relation between corpus homogeneity and corpus similarity was considered in some detail: a corpus similarity score must be interpreted relative to the homogeneity scores of the two corpora.",
        "Homogeneity and similarity scores were calculated for various corpora where an independent judgement of their similarity could be made, and there was a good fit between the independent judgement and the (interpreted) similarity scores.",
        "The experiments were performed using word frequencies.",
        "The same technique could be used with frequencies of subtrees or word classes or combinations of these.",
        "The measure is potentially of interest in lexicography and language engineering.",
        "Word frequency lists are cheap and easy to generate so a measure based on them would be of use as a quick guide in many circumstances where a more extensive analysis of the two corpora was not viable, to judge, for example, how a newly available corpus related to existing resources.",
        "The paper also presents a method for evaluating measures of similarity between corpora, based on sets of known-similarity corpora.",
        "This evaluation strategy can be used to compare the results of quite different techniques, so the x2-based statistic can be compared with measures from statistical language modelling.",
        "Future work includes the issue of normalising the measure for size of corpus, so it can be used to compare different-sized corpora.",
        "Also, the relationship to perplexity and cross-entropy will be explored, as will the relationship between grammatical and lexical similarity, as a prelude to integrating the work with Biber's methods for quantifying the linguistic characteristics of corpora.",
