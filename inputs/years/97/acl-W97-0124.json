        "New words are continually added to the language, and people will often use words that a parsing system may not expect.",
        "This paper will empirically investigate how well a dictionary of closed-class words, syntactic parsing rules, and a morphological recognizer can parse sentences containing unknown words in natural language processing tasks.",
        "Syntactic knowledge can be used to aid in the analysis of unknown words – sentence structure can be a strong clue as to the possible part of speech of an unknown word.",
        "The distinction between closed-class and open-class words should help to refine the possibilities for an unknown word and enhance the information provided by the syntactic knowledge.",
        "Morphological recognition can also be helpful in predicting possible parts of speech for many unknown words.",

        "A major problem that can occur when parsing sentences is the appearance of unknown words – words that are not contained in the lexicon of the system.",
        "As mentioned in Weischedel, et al.",
        "[15], the best-performing system at the Second Message Understanding Conference (MUC-2) simply",
        "halted parsing when an unknown word was encountered.",
        "Clearly, for a parser to be considered robust it must have mechanisms to process unknown words.",
        "The need to cope with unknown words will continue to grow as new words are coined, and words associated with subcultures leak into the mainstream vocabulary.",
        "In the case of a large corpus, especially one with no specific domain, a comprehensive lexicon is prohibitive.",
        "Thus, it is important that parsers have the ability to cope with new words.",
        "There are two broad approaches to handling unknown words.",
        "The first approach is to attempt to construct a complete lexicon, then deal with unknown words in a. rudimentary way – for example, rejecting the input or interacting with the user to obtain the needed information about the unknown word.",
        "The second way is to attempt to analyze the word at the time of encounter with as little human interaction as possible.",
        "This would allow the parser to parse sentences containing unknown words in a robust and autonomous fashion.",
        "Unknown words could be learned by discovering their part of speech and feature information during parsing and storing that information in the lexicon.",
        "Thus, if the word is encountered again later, it now would be in the lexicon.",
        "Before examining the problem more fully, it is useful to consider work that has already been done on the problem.",
        "There have been several attempts to study the problem of learning unknown words.",
        "These attempts have followed several different methodologies and have focused on various aspects of the unknown words.",
        "Statistical methods are most commonly used in part-of-speech tagging.",
        "Charniak's paper [5] outlines the use of statistical equations in part-of-speech tagging.",
        "Tagging systems make only limited use of the syntactic knowledge inherent in the sentence, in contrast to parsers.",
        "An n-gram tagger concentrates on the n neighbors of a word (where n tends to be 2 or 3), ignoring the global sentence structure.",
        "Also, many part-of-speech tagging systems are only concerned with resolving ambiguity, not dealing with unknown words.",
        "Kupiec [8] and Brill [3] make use of morphology to handle unknown words during part-of-speech tagging.",
        "Brill's tagger begins by tagging unknown words as proper nouns if capitalized, common nouns if not.",
        "Then the tagger learns various transformational rules by training on a tagged corpus.",
        "It applies these rules to unknown words to tag them with the appropriate part-of-speech information.",
        "Kupiec's hidden Markov model uses a set of suffixes to assign probabilities and state transformations to unknown words.",
        "Both these methods work well, but they ignore the global syntactic content of the sentence.",
        "We will examine the effects of combining morphology and syntax, while using a deterministic system to perform parsing.",
        "Weischedel, et al. [15] study the effectiveness of probablistic methods for part-of-speech tagging with unknown words.",
        "They show that using morphological information can increase the accuracy of their tagger on unknown words by a factor of five.",
        "They also briefly address the effect of unknown words in parsing with their part-of-speech tagger.",
        "However, all of their results assume that only one unknown word is present in each sentence or is within the tri-tag range of the tagger.",
        "They also assume that automatic disambiguation will eliminate extraneous parses.",
        "These assumptions will not always hold while parsing many corpora.",
        "In his thesis, Tomita [13] mentions the impact of syntax on determining the part of speech of unknown words during parsing.",
        "He suggests that his system can handle unknown words by simply assigning them all possible parts of speech (without using any morphological analysis of the words).",
        "He performs no experiment to assess his method's viability, but we will demonstrate that this is not a good approach.",
        "The use of all possible parts of speech will cause an exponential increase in the number of parses for a sentence as the number of unknown words increases.",
        "The FOUL-UP system [6], by Granger, is an example of a method that focuses on the use of context.",
        "This method assumes that most words are known, and that all sentences lie in a",
        "common semantic domain.",
        "In FOUL-UP, a strong top-down context in the form of a script is needed to provide the expected attributes of unknown words.",
        "The required use of a script to provide information limits the applicability of this method to situations where scripts are available.",
        "Jacobs and Zernik use a combination of methods in the SCISOR system [7].",
        "Though this system performs morphological and syntactic analysis, SCISOR was designed to be used in a single domain.",
        "When new words are discovered, they tend to be given specialized meanings that are related to the semantic domain, limiting the system to that specific domain.",
        "'There is a need for a parsing system that can act over less precisely defined domains and still efficiently cope with unknown words.",
        "We feel that the use of morphological recognition, a small lexicon of closed-class words, and a dictionary of known open-class words can be used to help our parser to determine the parts of speech for unknown words as they occur.",
        "For this research, we define a word by its parts of speech and a small set of features.",
        "These features include",
        "• Number (singular / plural) • Person (first / second / third) • Verb form (infinitive / present / past / past participle / -ing participle) • Noun type (common / proper) • Noun case (subjective / objective / possessive / reflexive) • Verb sub-categorization (12 different categories) The parser in the experiment outlined in this paper has been developed with two specific goals: • It will be able to parse sentences with an incomplete lexicon with as few errors as possible.",

        "There are a number of closed-class parts of speech, including determiners, prepositions, conjunctions, predeterminers, and quantifiers.",
        "Pronouns and auxiliary verbs (be, have, and do) are also closed-class parts of speech.",

        "The irregular verbs are enumerated by Quirk, et al. [12].",
        "Typically new verbs in a language are not coined as irregular verbs.",
        "The enumeration of irregular verbs allows the recognition of unknown verb forms to be rule-based.",

        "For similar reasons, irregular noun plurals are included in the set of closed-class words.",
        "Open-class parts of speech are those parts of speech that accept the addition of new items with little difficulty.",

        "Noun modifier is a fifth part of speech that is used in this research to indicate those words that can be used to modify nouns; this will eliminate extraneous parses that occur when a word defined as both a noun and adjective is used to modify a head noun.",
        "This part of speech is also used by Cardie [4] in her experiments.",
        "The existence of a set of closed-class words allows the construction of a dictionary in such a way as to facilitate the detection and analysis of unknown words.",
        "By creating a dictionary containing all the closed-class words, some words in any sentence will very likely be known.",

        "There has been little research done in this area.",
        "As noted above, many of the uses of morphology for analysis of lexical items require more knowledge than may be possible for some applications, especially if the system will be using a limited lexicon but will be expected to cope with words in the language but not found in the lexicon.",
        "There is one caveat concerning the use of only affix information in a morphological recognizer.",
        "Since the root of an unknown word is assumed to be unknown, the recognizer can only consider whether an affix matches the word.",
        "This can lead to an interesting type of error.",
        "For example, while checking the word butterfly, the affix -ly matches as a suffix.",
        "Typically, the -ly affix is attached to adjectives to form adverbs (e.g., happy happily), or to nouns to form adjectives (e.g., beast – + beastly); however, the word butterfly was not formed by this process, but rather by compounding the words butter and fly.",
        "Without the knowledge that *butterf is not an acceptable root word, and without some notion of legal word structure, there is no way to determine that butterfly was not formed by applying -/y.",
        "So in this case, butterfly is mistakenly assumed to have the -ly suffix.",

        "This is demonstrated in our use of the match, insertion, and deletion numbers above.",
        "The number of matches is important, since ideally we want the recognizer to return all possible parses that occur when the full dictionary is used.",

        "Table 1 shows the total number of deletions and insertions, as well as each as a percentage of the total number of parses for all the sentences in the corpus (1137).",
        "In Figure 1, we see that the deletion rate for the baseline data is zero, as expected.",
        "Since every possible part of speech is assigned to each unknown word, all the original parses should be generated.",
        "The deletion rate for the experimental run shows that some parses are being deleted when there is one or more unknown words.",
        "With 10% of the open-class dictionary missing, there are 22 deletions out of 1137 total possible parse matches.",
        "This is an average of only 0.045 deletions per sentence, or 1.9% of the total parses, as shown in Figure 1 and Table 1.",
        "With 100% of the open-class dictionary missing – in other words, using only closed-class words – there are 225 deletions, an average of 0.63 per sentence, or 19.8% of the total parses.",
        "In other words, over 80% of the original parses are produced.",
        "The deletion rate is in part due to the fact that many words in the complete dictionary are lexically ambiguous; whereas, many times the morphological recognizer assigns a smaller set of parts of speech, which can result in a correct parse being generated, but not the entire parse forest.",
        "The true value of the experimental approach can be seen when comparing the insertion rates.",
        "Figure 2 shows that the insertion rate in the baseline data is enormous.",
        "Data are only available up to 30% of the open-class dictionary missing, because after this point the program runs out of memory for storing all of the spurious parses.",
        "Since the baseline parser assigns every open-class part of speech to an unknown word, a combinatorial explosion of parses occurs.",

        "At the same point in the experimental run (30% missing), there are only 2.5 insertions per sentence, less than one-hundredth of the baseline value.",
        "With 100% of the open-class dictionary missing, there are 69.3 insertions per sentence when using the morphological recognizer in the experimental run, as compared to the 311.6 insertions per sentence when using the baseline method with only 30% of the dictionary missing.",
        "Performance of the experimental system in terms of insertions with 100% of the open-class dictionary missing is comparable to the baseline performance with 20% of the open-class dictionary removed.",
        "Obviously, the experimental data shows that the insertion rate has been cut drastically from the baseline performance."

      "heading": "6 Conclusions",
      "text": [
        "We have shown that morphological recognition, the distinction between closed-class and open-class words, and syntactic knowledge are powerful tools in handling unknown words, especially when we use a postmortem method of determining the probable lexical classes of words.",
        "These knowledge sources allow us to determine parts of speech for unknown words without using domain-specific knowledge in the TIMIT corpus.",
        "The insertion rate can be drastically reduced with only a moderate increase in the deletion rate.",
        "Obviously, there is a trade-off between the deletion rate and the insertion rate.",
        "This tradeoff can be manipulated by altering the morphological rules to place more importance on a low deletion rate or a low insertion rate, by modifying our postmortem approach to obtain finer control over the process of handling unknown words, or by considering additional knowledge sources.",
        "This issue should be of interest for any researcher developing a parsing system that will need to deal with unknown words.",
        "Future work will investigate the effectiveness of the morphological recognizer.",
        "We would like to compare a computer-generated morphological recognition module with the hand-generated oo",
        "module used in this work.",
        "We would also like to test these morphological recognizers on other corpora.",
        "Finally, we would like to refine the postmortem approach by offering a more elegant solution than the combination of first-choice and second-choice lists.",
        "There is information in the parse forest of failed parses that may allow single words to be identified as \"problem words\".",
        "This would allow the parser to reparse the sentence changing only a few words' definitions, providing better all-around performance."
