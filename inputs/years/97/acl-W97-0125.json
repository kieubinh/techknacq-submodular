        "PNs are understood in general as phonic sequences associated with one referent, without any intrinsic meanings, such as Socrates, Bach or Paris.",
        "They usually are characterized by nominal determination, the upper case marker, prohibition of pluralizing procedure, or non-translativity [Wi191].",

        "On the contrary, some proper nouns such as Baudelaire or Napoleon can be used as well as common nouns in contexts where they occur in metonymic or metaphorical relations with common nouns like: I read some (Baudelaire + poems ofBaudelaire) He is a real (Napoleon + general) Moreover, they often allow, like common nouns, the derivation of adjectives: e.g. Socratic, Napoleonic or Parisian.",

        "In the case of English or French, one could delimit formally the category proper nouns by means of the upper case, even though this criterion does not correspond entirely to our intuition about proper nouns.",
        "However, in Korean, there are no typographical markers such as upper case vs. lower case, while one assumes that the nouns such as in (1) could be semantically and syntactically different from those of (2):",
