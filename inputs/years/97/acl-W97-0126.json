        "One of the major problems in many languages, such as Japanese, Chinese, Korean and Thai, is word boundary ambiguity because these languages do not have any delimiters between words.",
        "The second problem is tagging ambiguity which occurs when there is more than one tag for one word.",
        "Another problem is implicit spelling error that occurs because some incorrect words can be found in a dictionary .This problem is very hard to solve with a simple approach, such as dictionary approach.",
        "Thai morphological analysis must face these three problems which cause many possible alternative or/and the erroneous chains of words.",
        "These problems generate a tot of unnecessary work for the parser.",
        "In order to simplify the parser and speed it up, three important points to bear in mind when considering the morphological processing are neat segmentation of characters into words, part of speech tagging selection, and implicit spelling error detection.",
        "This work attempts to provide a computational solution, called Word Filtering, to handle those three points prior to parsing.",
        "The proposed model of Thai morphological analysis consists of three steps: sentence segmenting, spell checking and word filtering.",
        "Using word formation rules and a dictionary look up algorithm in the first step; all possible word groups with all possible tags will be given.",
        "If there is any explicit error, the second step, that is spell checking, will give a suggestion about a set of most likely words.",
        "However, the implicit spelling error may still exist and will affect the parser.",
        "That is, the parser must search a large set of tagged word combinations in order to choose the right one.",
        "Thus, the main goal of word filtering is to reduce the combination of unuseful tagged words and to identify implicit spelling error.",

        "The proposed Word Filtering method consists of two steps: a filtering process and a scanning process.",
        "The first process will try to filter out any incorrect word boundary and any unsuitable tag.",
        "The second process detects and corrects the implicit spelling error by generating the new words for the detected error.",
        "The basic idea of the filtering process is to calculate the probabilities of all possible chains of tagged words by using a trigrarn of the Markov Model.",
        "The most likely sequences of tagged words are the ones that maximize chain probabilities.",
        "Nevertheless, they may be an erroneous chain which have implicit spelling errors.",
        "Thus, the Word Filtering, also includes the scanning process to detect and correct the error.",
        "At this step, a set of words will be generated by a generating function and be replaced to the detected word.",
        "The most likely sequences of correct words are the ones that maximize chain probabilities.",
        "Both filtering and scanning processes use the statistical information collected from the hand-tagged corpus.",
