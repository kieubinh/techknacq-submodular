        "One content analysis approach, Minnesota Contextual Content Analysis (MCCA) (McTavish & Pirro, 1990), in use for over 20 years and with a well-developed dictionary category system, contains analysis methods that provide insights into the use of WordNet (Miller, et al., 1990) for tagging.",
        "We describe the unique characteristics of MCCA, how its categories relate to WordNet synsets, the analysis methods used in MCCA to provide quantitative information about texts, what implications this has for the use of WordNet in tagging, and how these techniques may contribute to lexical semantic tagging.",
        "Specifically, we show that WordNet provides a backbone, but that additional lexical semantic information needs to be associated with WordNet synsets.",

        "Each category has a name (e.g., activio,, fellow feeling, about changing, human roles, expression arena).",

        "These contexts correspond well to the functions of language (Nida, 1975: 201-5).",
        "After tagging a text and determining category frequencies, the C-scores are calculated by comparison with the expected distribution of the contexts and the E-scores are calculated by comparison with the expected distribution of each category.",
        "These are the quantitative bases for analysis of the concepts and themes.",
        "Unlike other techniques for determining which words are characteristic of a text (Kilgarriff, 1996), such as the x2-test and mutual information, the C-scores and E-scores are examined not only for differences among texts, but also for over and underemphasis against the norms.",

        "We began with the hypothesis that the categories correspond to those developed by (Hearst & Sch√ºtze, 1996) in creating categories from the WordNet noun hierarchy.",
        "We found that the MCCA categories were generally internally consistent, but with characteristics not intuitively obvious.'",
        "As a result, we needed to articulate firm principles for characterizing the categories.",
        "Eleven categories (such as Have, Prepositions, You, 1 -Me.",
        "He, A-An, The) consist of only a few words from closed classes.",
        "The category The contains one word with an average expected frequency of 6 percent (with a range over the four contexts of 5.5 to 6.5).",
        "The category Prepositions contains 18 words with an average expected frequency of 11.1 percent (with a range over the four contexts of 9.5 to 12.3 percent).",
        "About 20 categories (Implication, 1f, Colors, Object, Being) consist of a relatively small number of words (34, 22, 65, 11, 12, respectively) taken primarily from syntactically or semantically closed-class words (subordinating conjunctions, relativizers, the tops of WordNet, colors).",
        "The remaining 80 or so categories consist primarily of open-class words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs), sprinkled with closed-class words (auxiliaries, subordinating conjunctions).",
        "These categories require more detailed analyses.'",
        "Several categories correspond well to the Hearst & SchUtze model.",
        "The categories Functional roles, Detached roles, and Human roles align with subtrees rooted at particular nodes in the WordNet hierarchies.",
        "For example, Detached roles has a total of 66 words, with an average expected frequency of .16 percent and a range from .10 to .35 percent The .35 percent frequency is for the ana4Ptic context; each of the other three contexts have expected frequencies of about .10 percent The words in this category include: ACADEMIC, ARTIST, BIOLOGIST, CREATOR, CRITIC, HISTORIAN, INSTRUCTOR, OBSERVER, PHILOSOPHER, 51n general, we have found that assignment of only about 5 to 10 percent of the words in a category is questionable.",
        "PHYSICIST, PROFESSOR, RESEARCHER, REVIEWER, SCIENTIST, SOCIOLOGIST These words are a subset of the WordNet synsets headed at PERSON, in particular, synsets headed by CREATOR; EXPERT: AUTHORITY: PROFESSIONAL; INTELLECTUAL.7 Other synsets under EXPERT and AUTHORITY do not fall into this category.",
        "Thus, the heuristic Detached roles is like a Hearst & Schatze super-category, but not constructed on a statistical metric, rather on underlying semantic components.",
        "Other categories do not fall out so neatly.",
        "The category Sanction (120 words) has an average expected frequency of .08 percent, with a range over the four contexts of .06 to .10 percent.",
        "It includes the following words (and their inflected forms):",
        "Examination of the WordNet synsets is similarly successful here, identifying many words (particularly verbs) in a subtree rooted at JUDGE.",
        "However, the set is defined as well by including a derivational lexical rule to allow forms in other parts of speech.",
        "Another meaning component is seen in APPROVE and DISAPPROVE, namely, the negative or pejorative prefix, again requiring a lexical rule as part of the category's definition.",
        "Such lexical rules would be encoded as described in (Copestake & Briscoe, 1991).",
        "This set of words (rooted primarily in the verbs of the set) corresponds to the (Levin, 1993) Characterize (class 29.2), Declare (29.4), Admire (31.2), and Judgment verbs (33) and hence may have particular syntactic and semantic patterning.",
        "The verb frames attached to WordNet verb synsets are not sufficiently detailed to cover the granularity necessary to characterize an MCCA category.",
        "Instead, the definition of this class might, following (Davis, 1996), inherit a sort notion-rel, which has a \"perceiver\" and a \"perceived\" argument (thus capturing syntactic patterning) with 7Identilcation of these synsets facilitates extension of the MCCA dictionary to include further hyponyrns of these synsets.",
        "perhaps a selections' restriction on the \"perceiver\" that the type of action is an evaluative one (thus providing semantic patterning).",
        "Another complex category is Normative, consisting of 76 words, with an average expected frequency of .60 percent and a range over the four contexts of .37 to .79 percent.",
        "This category also has words from all parts of speech and thus will entail the use of derivational lexical rules in its definition.",
        "This category includes the following (along with various inflectional forms):",
        "The use of the heuristic Normative to label this category clearly reflects the presence in these words of a semantic component oriented around characterizing something in terms of expectations.",
        "But, of particular interest here, are the adverb forms.",
        "McTavish has also used the heuristic Reasoning for this category.",
        "These adverbs are content disjuncts (Quirk, et al., 1985: 8.127-33), that is, words betokening a speaker's comment on the content of what the speaker is saying, in this case, compared to some norm or standard.",
        "Thus, part of the defining characteristics for this category is a specification for lexical items that have a [content-disjunct +] feature.",
        "These examples of words in the Sanction and Normative categories (repeated in other categories) indicates a need to define categories not only in terms of supercategories using the Hearst & Schatze model, but also with additional lexical semantic information not present in WordNet or MCCA categories.",
        "In particular, we see the need for encoding derivational and morphological relations, finer-grained characterization of government patterns, feature specifications, and primitive semantic components.",
        "In any event, we have seen that MCCA categories are consistent with WordNet synsets.",
        "They recapitulate the WordNet synsets by acting as supercategories similar to those identified in Hearst & Schtitze.",
        "To this extent, results from MCCA tagging would be similar to those of Hearst & Schtitze.",

        "The important questions at this point are why there is value in having additional lexical semantic information associated with tagging and why MCCA categories and WordNet synsets are insufficient.",
        "The answer to these questions begins to emerge by considering the further analysis performed after a text has been \"classified\" on the basis of the MCCA tagging.",
        "As described above, MCCA produces a set of C-scores and E-scores for each text.",
        "These scores are then subjected to analysis to provide additional results useful in social science and information retrieval applications.",
        "The two sets of scores are used for computing the distance among texts.",
        "This distance is used directly or in exploration of the differences between texts.",
        "Unlike other content analysis techniques (or classification techniques used for measuring the distance between documents in information retrieval), MCCA uses the non-agglomerative technique of multidimensional scaling (MDS).8 This technique (Kruskal & Wish, 1977) produces a map when given a matrix of distances.",
        "MDS does not presume that a 2-dimensional representation displays the distances between texts.",
        "Rather, it unfolds the dimensions one-by-one, starting with 2, examines statistically how \"stressed\" the solution is, and then adds further dimensions until the stress shows signs of reaching an asymptote.",
        "Output from the scaling provides \"rotation\" maps at each dimension projected onto 2-dimensional space.",

        "In the simple use, the distance between transcripts of nursing home patients, staff, and administrators was used as a measure of social distance among these three groups.",
        "This measure was combined with various characteristics of nursing homes (size, type, location, etc.)",

        "MDS analysis of the E-score vectors identifies the major concepts that differentiate the texts.",
        "The analyst examines the graphical output to label points with the dominant MCCA categories.",
        "The \"meaning\" (that is, the underlying concepts) of the MDS graph is then described in terms of category and word emphases.",
        "These are the results an investigator uses in reporting on the content analysis using MCCA.",
        "This is the point at which the insufficiency of MCCA categories (and WordNet synsets) becomes visible.",
        "In examining the MDS output, the analysis is subjective and based only on identification of particular sets of words that distinguish the concepts in each text (much like the techniques described in (Kilgarriff, 1996) that are used in authorship attribution).",
        "If the MCCA categories had richer definitions based on additional lexical semantic information, the analysis could be performed based on less subjective and more rigorously defined principles.",
        "(Burstein, et al., 1996) describe techniques for using lexical semantics to classify responses to test questions.",
        "An essential component of this classification process is the identification of sublexicons that cut across parts of speech, along with concept grammars based on collapsing phrasal and constituent nodes into a generalized XP representation.",
        "As seen above in the procedures for defining MCCA categories, addition of lexical semantic information in the form of derivational and morphological relations and semantic components common across part of speech boundaries ‚Äì information now lacking in WordNet synsets ‚Äì would facilitate the development of concept grammars.",
