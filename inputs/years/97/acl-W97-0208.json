        "It is our belief that sense tagging can be carried out effectively by combining several simple, independent, methods and we include the design of such a tagger.",

        "This workshop is about semantic tagging: marking each word tokenl in a text with some marker identifying its semantic category, similar to the way a part-of-speech tagger assigns a grammatical category to each token in a text.",
        "Our recent work has been concerned with sense tagging, a particular instance of this problem.",
        "Sense tagging is the process of assigning, to each content word in a text, its particular sense from some lexicon.",
        "This differs from the more general case of semantic tagging, where the tags for each word (type) are not be specific to that type and do not correspond to word senses in a lexicon.",
        "For example the tags may be broad semantic categories such as HUMAN or ANIMATE or WordNet synsets.",
        "Another, broader, class of algorithms are word sense disambiguation (WSD) algorithms.",
        "By WSD algorithm we mean any procedure which carries out semantic disambiguation on words, these may not necessarily be tagging algorithms, in that they do 'Often loosened to each content word in a text.",
        "not attempt to mark every token in a text but may be restricted to disambiguating small sets of word types.",
        "Sense tagging is a difficult problem: each word (type) has its own set of tags which may be quite large.",
        "This rules out approaches which rely on a discriminator being created for each semantic tag which is then applied to text, although this is a valuable technique when there are a small number of tags which are broad semantic categories.",
        "However, sense tagging is an extremely useful procedure to carry out since the tags which are associated during sense tagging are rich in knowledge and therefore likely to be extremely useful for further processing.",
        "Indeed, the lack of reliable, large-scale, sense taggers has often been blamed for the failure of machine translation for the last 30 years.",
        "In this paper we shall discuss some recent approaches to the WSD problem and examine their usefulness for the more specialised task of sense tagging.",
        "We then propose an approach which makes use of several different types of information and report a partial implementation of this system which produces very encouraging results."

        "Word senses are not absolute or Platonic but defined by a given lexicon, as has been known for many years from early work on WSD, even though the contrary seems widely believed: \".. it is very difficult to assign word occurrences to sense classes in any manner that is both general and determinate.",
        "In the sentences \"I have a stake in this country.\"",
        "and \"My stake in the last race was a pound\" is \"stake\" being used in the same sense or not?",
        "If \"stake\" can be interpreted to mean something as vague as 'Stake as any kind of investment in any enterprise' then the answer is yes.",
        "So, if a semantic dictionary contained only two senses for \"stake\": that vague sense together with 'Stake as a post', then one would expect to assign the vague sense for both the sentences above.",
        "But if, on the other hand, the dictionary distinguished 'Stake as an investment' and 'Stake as an initial payment in a game or race' then the answer would be expected to be different.",
        "So, then, word sense disambiguation is relative to the dictionary of sense choices available and can have no absolute quality about it.\"",

        "We believe the best resource is still a Machine Readable Dictionary: they have a relatively well-defined set of sense tags for each word and lexical coverage is high.",
        "MRDs are, of course, normally generic, and much practical WSD work is for sub-domains We are adhering to the view that it is better to start with such a generic lexicon and adapt it automatically with specialist words and senses.",
