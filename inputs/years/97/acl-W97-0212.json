        "This paper describes a working sense tagger, which attempts to automatically link each word in a text corpus to its corresponding sub-sense in the Cambridge International Dictionary of English (CIDE).",
        "Much research elsewhere has gone into the generation of probabilities from corpora and the extraction of textual information from printed dictionaries.",
        "Our research has had the distinct advantage of being done alongside a large lexicographic team, who have been developing further the database used for the creation of CIDE.",
        "It has thus been possible to have very useful computational data expertly coded by hand.",
        "We have been able to concentrate on defining the specification of this lexical resource, encoding it and then making use of it, rather than on trying to extract or refine the desired information automatically from existing corpora or printed dictionaries."

      "heading": "2. Methodology",
      "text": [
        "The tagger, at present, works on one sentence at a time.",
        "Each word in the sentence has a certain number of possible senses.",
        "The tagger assigns a score (initially 0) to each possible sense of each word.",
        "A number of different tagging process could then adjust any of these scores, increasing them for a positive match (e.g. a collocation that indicates a particular sense), decreasing them for a negative match (e.g. capitalisation indicating a particular sense to be unlikely).",
        "At the end of all these processes, each sense of each word will have a particular score.",
        "For each word, the sense with the highest score is assumed to be the sense meant in the context.",
        "Simple additive weightings are also commonly used in the evaluation of chess positions by computers, where for example, a pawn less could score -100 and an open file for a rook +15.",
        "It is thus possible for a number of positional factors to outweigh more concrete material factors.",
        "It would be possible to use multiplicative probabilities rather than additive weightings.",
        "Chess programmers tend to prefer additive weightings because they are far simpler to program and also more efficient.",
        "There are more rigorous rules for combining probabilities, but it is not clear how much benefit this gives if the original probabilities are only rough estimates anyway.",
        "Probabilities can be derived from training corpora, but it is acknowledged that these can vary enormously from corpus to corpus, e.g. on grounds of register (Biber 1993).",
        "Such methods are far more appropriate for work in restricted contexts, where representative training corpora can be more easily derived."

      "text": [
        "The CIDE database contains detailed information on both single words and multi-word units.",
        "For a word pair X Y (e.g. has been), the tagger is thus able to produce possible scores for X and Y as separate words, and for X Y as a multi-word unit throughout each",
        "tagging process.",
        "If a multi-word unit is found, it is given an initial additional score (a headstart over the words treated separately) proportional to the number of words in the unit minus 1, but this can easily be cancelled out by other scores.",
        "As a learner dictionary, CIDE contains much examples text.",
        "This examples text forms a convenient hand sense tagged corpus, though with only one word (the headword) sense tagged in each example.",
        "Much research has been devoted to using just collocation information for sense disambiguation, even using contexts of as much as 50 words (Gale, Church and Yarowsky, 1992).",
        "We instead choose to look more at the immediate context around a word, by dividing collocation match weightings by the distance between the pair of collocating words, expecting subject domain tagging (see section 3.2) to deal with more long-range effects."

        "Each entry in CIDE has been subject coded.",
        "A subject domain for the sentence is created by looking at the subject codes of each likely (from the tests so far) sense of every word in the sentence, and at any document information available about the subject domain of the article, e.g. a sports page.",
        "Then the subject codes of each sense of each word are compared with the subject domain for the sentence and the number of matches noted.",
        "The subject codes are arranged in a hierarchy, so for example, Christmas and Passover would match at some levels, despite not having exactly the same subject code.",
        "Long sentences can distort the results, so the weightings awarded to subject domain matches are divided by the number of words in the sentence."

      "text": [
        "Our part-of-speech tagger is based on a series of rules, listing valid 'transition pair' sequences of grammatical tags.",
        "These pairs can be given weightings but the emphasis of the approach is on the list of valid pairs rather than the weightings assigned to each pair.",
        "Thus most valid pairs are given a standard weighting of 0.",
        "Six special intermediate tags have been created to reduce the number of tag pairs that need to be listed and to add 'partial parsing' to the process.",
        "These are: p[ and p] around noun phrases acting as subjects (i.e. expecting to be followed by a verb) p< and p> around noun phrases acting as objects p( and p) around adverbial or prepositional phrases, or sub-clauses Thus, for example, a determiner may only be preceded by p[ or p< or a predeterminer.",
        "The p( and p) are a particularly powerful feature which enable intermediate phrases to be ignored.",
        "The tagger does not check for p) followed by the next tag, but rather looks back to what came immediately before the preceding p( and then does the transition pair match on that.",
        "Atwell (1987) has termed these kind of brackets \"hyperbrackets\" and considers a very similar approach to that we are now adopting, choosing himself instead to add hyperbrackets to already tagged text to enhance it with parsing information, but thereby losing the benefit these hyperbrackets can assign to the part-of-speech tagging process itself.",
        "One example of the possible benefit is in trying to make the distinction between a preposition, which is generally followed by what we term an object noun phrase as it will not be followed by a verb, and a subordinating conjunction, which is generally followed by what we term a subject noun phrase as it will be followed by a verb.",
        "For a valid transition pair between two tags, the score is simply calculated by adding the maximum score (from the other tagging processes) for a sense that can have each grammatical tag to the transition pair weighting (usually 0).",
        "There are also some special features to cope with more long-range effects (e.g. singular nouns being followed by the 3ps form of the present simple, conjunctions tending to coordinate the same grammatical tags).",
        "Thus, all valid sequences can be given a score by adding up the relevant transition pair scores.",
        "Our method is more ambitious but intrinsically less efficient than Hidden Markov Model 'approaches, although certain restrictions are applied to reduce the number of sequences to a manageable size (e.g. a limit on the number of nested brackets).",
        "More time also needs to be spent on rule development."

        "Lexicographers have specifically attached CIDE grammar codes (which give verb complementation patterns) to selectional preference patterns using a restricted list of about 40 selectional classes for nouns.",
        "The tagger translates these grammar codes into sequences of grammatical tags and super-segmental tags representing the possible sequences that may follow the verb, and then integrates these with the selectional preference patterns.",

        "the argument pattern (subject and objects) fail to match a tag sequence, this is considered a verb complementation pattern failure.",
        "When an argument is encountered, the class specified in the selectional preference pattern is matched against the possible classes for the word.",
        "Selectional classes are hierarchical in structure like subject domain codes (see section 3.2), so allowance is made for near-matches.",
        "Adjective selectional preferences are matched in a similar but more simple way.",
        "Each adjective is coded with the possible class(es) of the nouns which it may modify.",
        "The adjective class is matched against the class of the noun which it modifies using much the same scoring system as for the verbs.",

        "* Analysing the interaction between different tests, and refining the weightings used for each.",

        "The main weightings currently in use, which may be of interest to other researchers trying to combine different tests, are shown in the table.",
        "An example of how different taggers can interact is given by the following two sentences: He was fired with enthusiasm by his boss.",

        "Each of the 4000 words was manually assigned with just one sense tag and the tagging program likewise assigned precisely one sense tag to each word.",
        "The results are thus strictly determined by the number of matching taggings, with no ambiguous coding allowed.",
        "(These criteria are somewhat overstrict as in some cases more than one tag could be considered acceptable, e.g. where there are cross-references in the dictionary or where there is genuine ambiguity.)",
        "In calculating the results, prepositions were deliberately ignored because they have been heavily \"split\" in CIDE, far more so than in other dictionaries (Lazar 1996).",
        "Any attempt at distinguishing these senses would have to rely heavily on selectional preferences for prepositions, which are yet to be implemented within the tagging program.",

        "It must be noted however that the LDOCE homograph level is far more rough-grained than the CIDE guideword level, let alone the sub-sense level, and that Wilks and Stevenson's approach on its own would, by its very nature, not transfer down to more fine-grained distinctions.",
        "Other research, such as Yarowsky's into accent restoration in Spanish and French (1994), which reports accuracy levels of 90%- 99%, is again at a more rough-grained level, in this case that of distinguished unaccented and accented word forms.",
        "While the sense tagging results are fairly encouraging, the part of speech tagging results are at present relatively poor.",
        "It thus seems sensible, especially noting Wilks and Stevenson's analysis mentioned above, to first run a sentence through a traditional part of speech tagger before trying to disambiguate the senses.",
        "In theory, we would expect information such as subject domain and collocations to help part of speech tagging to be more accurate, however slightly, but we have not yet been able to demonstrate this in practice."
