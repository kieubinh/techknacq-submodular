        "This working session seeks to shed light on the relationship between structured lexicons and semantic tagging.",
        "We will address a number of fundamental questions, including:",
        "• What are the different types of information that we want to tag?",
        "• How can information in a structured lexicon facilitate tagging tasks?",
        "• How long does it take to build a structured lexicon with the relevant pieces?",
        "Can automatic procedures be used for the construction of lexical representations?",
        "What existing resources should we be using and what aids do we have to transform these resources into appropriate representations?",
        "• What lexical levels are required in a lexicon?",
        "Syntactic?",
        "Lexical semantic?",
        "Aspectual?",
        "Ontological?",
        "Deeper Knowledge?",
        " – What do the representations at each of these levels look like like, and how would they be constructed?",
        " – What are the interdependencies between these levels?",
        "Can we take advantage of interacting linguistic constraints from each level for the development of structured lexicons?",
        "Should the levels be kept as separate layers and related explicitly or should they be combined into one layer and be related implicitly?",
        "We will also address related questions, including: • How much of what we can tag is context-dependent?",
        "What tags can only be compositionally derived during the corpus tagging process?"
