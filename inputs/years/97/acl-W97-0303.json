        "The three biggest challenges that continue to stand in the way of accomplishing even this most basic task are extragrammaticality, ambiguity, and speech recognition errors.",
        "In this paper we address the issue of how to handle the problem of extragrammaticality efficiently, where extragrammaticality is defined as any deviation of an input string from the coverage of a given system's parsing grammar.",
        "We demonstrate the superiority of our approach by comparing performance between it and a set of alternative approaches in terms of parse time and parse quality over the same previously unseen test corpus.",

        "ROSE, RObustness with Structural Evolution, repairs extragrammatical input in two phases.",
        "The first phase, Repair Hypothesis Formation, is responsible for assembling a set of hypotheses about the meaning of the ungrammatical utterance.",
        "This phase is itself divided into two stages, Partial Parsing and Combination.",
        "A restricted version of Lavie's GLR* parser (Lavie, 1995; Lavie and Tomita, 1993) is used to obtain an analysis of islands of the speaker's sentence in cases where it is not possible to obtain an analysis for the entire sentence.",
        "In the Combination stage, the fragments from the partial parse are assembled into a set of alternative meaning representation hypotheses.",
        "A genetic programming approach is used to search for different ways to combine the fragments in order to avoid requiring any hand-crafted repair rules.",
        "In ROSE's second phase, Interaction with the User, the system generates a set of queries, negotiating with the speaker in order to narrow down to a single best meaning representation hypothesis.",
        "In this paper, only the Hypothesis Formation phase is described and evaluated.",
        "Since repairs beyond those made possible by the partial parser are performed during the Combination stage, we refer to the implementation of the Combination stage as the repair module.",
        "Though a set of hypotheses are produced by during the Combination stage, in the evaluation presented in this paper, only the repair hypothesis scored by the repair module as best is returned.",

        "There are a wide range of different approaches to handling the problem of extragrammaticality, but which way is best?",
        "Three basic avenues exist whereby the coverage of a natural language understanding system can be expanded: further development of the parsing grammar, addition of flexibility to the parsing algorithm, or addition of a post-processing repair stage after the parsing stage.",
        "It is always possible to add additional rules to a parsing grammar in order to expand the coverage, but this approach is both time intensive in terms of development and ultimately computationally expensive at run time since large, cumbersome grammars generate excessive amounts of ambiguity.",
        "Adding flexibility to the parsing algorithm is preferable in some respects, particularly in that it reduces the grammar development burden.",
        "However, it lends itself to the same weakness in terms of computational expense.",
        "In the extreme case, in a Minimum Distance Parser (MDP) (Lehman, 1989; Hipp, 1992), any ungrammatical sentence can be mapped onto a sentence inside of the coverage of the grammar through a series of insertions, deletions, and in some cases substitutions or transpositions.",
        "The more flexibility, the better the coverage in theory, but in realistic large scale systems this approach becomes computationally intractable.",
        "Current efforts towards robust interpretation have focused on less powerful partial parsers (Abney, 1996; Nord, 1996; Srinivas et al., 1996; Federici, Mon-temagni, and Pirrelli, 1996) and repair approaches where the labor is distributed between two or more stages (Ehrlich and Hanrieder, 1996; Danieli and Gerbino, 1995).",

        "In principle, Minimum Distance Parsers (Lehman, 1989; Hipp, 1992) have the greatest flexibility.",
        "They fit an extragrammatical sentence to the parsing grammar through a series of insertions, deletions, and transpositions.",
        "Since any string can be mapped onto any other string through• a series of insertions, deletions, and transpositions, this approach makes it possible to repair any sentence.",
        "The underlying assumption behind the MDP approach is that the analysis of the string that deviates the least from the input string is most likely to be the best analysis.",
        "Thus, Minimum Distance Parsing appears to be a reasonable approach.",
        "In practice, however, Minimum Distance Parsing has only been used successfully in very small and limited domains.",
        "Lehman's core grammar, described in (Lehman, 1989), has on the order of 300 rules, and all of the inputs to her system can be assumed to be commands to a calendar program.",
        "Hipp's Circuit Fix-It Shop system, described in (Hipp, 1992), has a vocabulary of only 125 words and a grammar size of only 500 rules.",
        "Flexible parsing algorithms introduce a great deal of extra ambiguity.",
        "This in turn may deem certain approaches impractical for systems of realistic scale.",
        "Therefore, an important question one must ask is whether the MDP approach can scale up to a larger system and/or domain.",
        "An example of a more restrictive parsing algorithm is Lavie's GLR* skipping parser described in (Lavie, 1995).",
        "GLR* is a parsing system based on Tomita's Generalized LR parsing algorithm which was designed to be robust to two particular types of extra-grammaticality: noise in the input, and limited grammar coverage.",
        "GLR* attempts to overcome these forms of extra-grammaticality by ignoring the unparsable words and fragments and conducting a search for the maximal subset of the original input that is covered by the grammar.",
        "The GLR* parser is capable of skipping over any portion of an input utterance that cannot be incorporated into a grammatical analysis and recover the",
        "analysis of the largest grammatical subset of the utterance.",
        "Partial analyses for skipped portions of the utterance can also be returned by the parser.",
        "Thus, whereas MDP considers insertions and transpositions in addition to deletions, GLR* only considers deletions.",
        "GLR* can be viewed as a restricted form of MDP applied to an efficient non-robust general parsing method.",
        "GLR* can, in most cases, achieve most of the robustness of the more general MDP approach while maintaining feasibility, due to efficiency properties of the GLR approach and an effective well-guided search.",
        "In the evaluation presented in this paper, GLR* has been restricted to skip only initial segments so that the partial analyses returned are always for contiguous portions of the sentence.",
        "Because GLR* was designed as an enhancement to the widely used standard GLR context-free parsing algorithm, grammars, lexicons and other tools developed for the standard GLR parser can be used without modification.",
        "GLR* uses the standard SLR(0) parsing tables which are compiled in advance from the grammar.",
        "It inherits the benefits of GLR in terms of ease of grammar development, and, to a large extent, efficiency properties of the parser itself.",
        "In the case that an input sentence is completely grammatical, GLR* will normally return the exact same parse as the GLR parser.",
        "The weakness of this and other partial parsing approaches (Abney, 1996; Nord, 1996; Srinivas et al., 1996; Federici, Montemagni, and Pirrelli, 1996) is that part of the original meaning of the utterance may be thrown away with the portion(s) of the utterance that are skipped if only the analysis for the largest subset is returned, or part of the analysis will be missing if the parser only attempts to build a partial parse.",
        "These less powerful algorithms trade coverage for speed.",
        "The idea is to introduce enough flexibility to gain an acceptable level of coverage at an acceptable computational expense.",
        "The goal behind the two stage approach (Ehrlich and Hanrieder, 1996; Danieli and Gerbino, 1995) is to increase the coverage possible at a reasonable computational cost by introducing a post-processing repair stage, which constructs a complete meaning representation out of the fragments of a partial parse.",
        "Since the input to the second stage is a collection of partial parses, the additional flexibility that is introduced at this second stage can be channeled just to the part of the analysis that the parser does not have enough knowledge to handle straightforwardly.",
        "This is unlike the MDP approach, where the full amount of flexibility is unnecessarily applied to every part of the analysis, even in completely grammatical sentences.",
        "Therefore, this two stage process is a more efficient distribution of labor since the first stage is highly constrained by the grammar and the results of this first stage are then used to constrain the search in the second stage.",
        "Additionally, in cases where the limited flexibility parser is sufficient, the second stage can be entirely bypassed, yielding an even greater savings in time."

        "In order to compare the two stage repair approach with the single stage MDP approach in a practical, large-scale scenario, we conducted a comparative evaluation.",
        "As mentioned above, we make use of a version of Lavie's GLR* parser (Lavie, 1995) extended to be able to perform both skipping and inserting which we refer to as LR MDP.",
        "This makes it possible to compare the two stage ROSE approach to MDP keeping all other factors constant.",
        "The parser uses a semantic grammar with approximately 1000 rules which maps the input sentence onto an interlingua representation (ILT) which represents the meaning of the sentence in a language-independent manner.",
        "This ILT is then passed to a generation component which generates a sentence in the target language which is then graded by a human judge as Bad, Partial, Okay, or Perfect in terms of translation quality.",
        "Partial indicates that the result communicated part of the content of the original sentence while not containing any incorrect information.",
        "Okay indicates that the generated sentence communicated all of the relevant information in the original sentence but not in the ideal way.",
        "Perfect indicates both that the result communicated the relevant information and that it did so in a smooth, high quality manner.",
        "The corpus used in this evaluation contains 500 sentences from a corpus of spontaneous scheduling dialogues collected in English.",
        "In a previous experiment we determined that the two stage approach performs about two orders of magnitude faster than Lit MDP.",
        "For the purpose of the evaluation presented in this paper we tested the effect of imposing a maximum deviation penalty on the minimum distance parser in order to determine how much flexibility could be allowed before the computational cost would become unreasonable.",
        "A full, unconstrained implementation of MDP can find an analysis for any sentence using a combination of insertions, deletions, and transpositions.",
        "However, in order to make it viable to test the MDP approach in a system as large as the one which provides the context for this work, we make use of a more restricted version of MDP.",
        "While the full MDP algorithm allows insertions, deletions, and transpositions, our more constrained version of MDP allows only insertions and deletions.",
        "Although this still allows the MDP parser to repair any sentence, in some cases the result will not be as complete as it would have been with the unconstrained version of MDP or with the two stage repair process.",
        "Additionally, with a lexicon on the order of 1000 lexical items, it is not practical to do insertions on the level of the lexical items themselves.",
        "Instead, we allow only non-terminals to be inserted.",
        "An insertion penalty equivalent to the minimum number of words it would take to generate a given non-terminal is assigned to a parse for each inserted non-terminal.",
        "In order to test the effect of imposing a maximum deviation penalty, we used a parameterized version of LR MDP, where the deviation penalty of a parse is the total number of words skipped plus the parse's associated insertion penalty as described above.",
        "The avenues of exploration made available here",
        "are far from exhaustive.",
        "Substitutions and transpositions are not allowed in this version of the parser, nor is it possible to set a separate maximum penalty for skipping and for inserting.",
        "Additionally, insertions and deletions are weighted equally, where some researchers have weighted them differently (Hipp, 1992).",
        "These and other possibilities are left for future inquiry."

        "The LR MDP parser was run over the corpus at three different flexibility settings.",
        "The first setting, MDP 1, is Minimum Distance Parsing with maximum deviation penalty of 1.",
        "Similarly, MDP 3 and MDP 5 are MDP with maximum devaition penalty of 3 and 5 respectively.",
        "We also ran the version of GLR* where only initial segments can be skipped which we refer to as GLR* with Restarts.",
        "Thus, while the parser can restart from each word in the sentence, analyses produced are always for contiguous segments of the sentence.",
        "We ran GLR* with Restarts both with and without repair.",
        "Timings for all five of these iterations over the corpus are displayed in Figure 5.",
        "Notice that GLR* with Restarts is significantly faster than even MDP 1.",
        "And since the repair stage is run only for sentences that the repair module determines need repair, and since the repair process takes only seconds on average to run, no significant difference in time can be seen in this graph between the case with repair and the case without repair.",
        "The translation quality ratings for the five different iterations over the corpus are found in Figure 6.",
        "Predictably, MDP 5 is an improvement over MDP 1 and MDP 3, with an associated significant cost in run time.",
        "Also, not surprisingly, the very restricted GLR* with Restarts, while faster than either of the other two, has a correspondingly lower associated translation quality.",
        "However, GLR* with Restarts + Repair outperforms the other methods in terms of total number of acceptable translations, while not being significantly slower than GLR*",
        "with Restarts without repair.",
        "Though these results display certain trends in the performance of these alternative approaches, the differences in general are very small.",
        "For example, the difference in number of acceptable translations between MDP 5 and GLR* with restarts + repair is only about 1%.",
        "The largest difference between the two is that GLR* with restarts + repair has about 7% more sentences with translation quality of Partial or better, indicating that GLR* with restarts + repair produces analyses that are useful for furthering the conversation between the two speakers using the system 7% more often than MDP 5.",
        "While we have no doubt that increasingly more flexible versions of MDP would perform better than MDP 5, we have already demonstrated that even MDP 5 is impractical in terms of its runtime performance.",
        "Thus we conclude that the two stage ROSE approach, even with a very limited flexibility parser, is a superior choice.",
        "We believe that by increasing the flexibility of the parser to include very limited skipping in addition to restarts would increase the performance of this two stage approach without incurring a significant increase in run time performance.",
        "Determining exactly how much skipping is ideal is a direction for future research."

        "Our analysis demonstrates that the ROSE approach, consisting of a skipping parser with limited flexibility coupled with a completely automatic post-processing repair module, performs significantly faster than even a version of MDP limited only to skipping and inserting and constrained to a maximum deviation penalty of 5, while producing analyses of superior quality."
