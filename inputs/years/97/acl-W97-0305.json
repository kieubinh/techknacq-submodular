        "Automatic detection of subject divisions within a text is considered to be a very difficult task even for humans, let alone machines.",

        "An automatic method for marking subject boundaries is highly desirable.",
        "Hearst (Hearst, 1994) addresses this problem by applying a statistical method for detecting subjects within text.",
        "Hearst describes an algorithm for what she calls Text Tiling, which is a method for detecting subject boundaries within a text.",
        "The underlying assumption of this algorithm is that there is a high probability that words which are related to a certain subject will be repeated whenever that subject is mentioned.",
        "Another basic assumption is that when a new subject emerges the choice of vocabulary will change, and will stay consistent within the subject boundaries until the next change in subject.",
        "These basic notions of vocabulary consistency within subject boundaries lead to a method for dividing text based on calculating vocabulary similarity between two adjacent windows of text.",
        "Each potential subject boundary is identified and assigned a correspondence value based on the lexical similarity between two windows of text, one on either side of the subject boundary.",
        "The values for all potential boundaries are plotted on a graph, creating peaks and troughs.",
        "The troughs represent changes in vocabulary use and therefore, according to the underlying assumption, a change in subject.",
        "A division mark is inserted where a significant local minimum is detected on the graph.",
        "Hearst measured approximately 80% success in detection of subject boundaries on some texts.",
        "We decided to adopt Hearst's underlying assumption that a change in subject will entail a change in vocabulary.",
        "Our aim was to make the algorithm as language independent and computationally expedient as possible, while also improving accuracy and reliability."

        "Hearst treats a text more or less as a bag of words in its statistical analysis.",
        "But natural language is no doubt more structured than this.",
        "Different words have differing semantic functions and relationships with respect to the topic of discourse.",
        "We can broadly distinguish two extreme categories of words; content words versus function words.",
        "Content words introduce concepts, and are the means for the expression of ideas and facts, for example nouns, proper nouns, adjectives and so on.",
        "Function words (for example determiners, auxiliary verbs etc.)",
        "support and coordinate the combination of content words into meaningful sentences.",
        "Obviously, both are needed to form meaningful sentences, but, intuitively, it is the content words that carry most weight in defining the actual topic of discourse.",
        "Based on this intuition, we believe it would be advantageous to identify these content words in a text.",
        "It would then be possible to bias the calculation of lexical correspondences (stage 3) taking into account the higher significance of these words relative to function words.",
        "We would ideally like firstly to reduce the effect of noisy non-content words on the algorithm's performance, and secondly to pay more attention to words with a high semantic content.",
        "In her implementation, Hearst attempts to do this by having a finite list of problematic words that are filtered out from the text before the statistical analysis takes place (Hearst, 1994).",
        "These problematic words are primarily function words and low semantic content words, such as determiners, conjunctions, prepositions and very common nouns.",
        "Church and Gale (Church and Gale, 1995) mention the correlation between a word's semantic content and various measures of its distribution throughout corpora.",
        "They show that: \"Word rates vary from genre to genre, topic to topic, author to author, document to document, section to section, paragraph to paragraph.",
        "These factors tend to decrease the entropy and increase the other test variables\".",
        "One of these other test variables mentioned by Church and Gale is burstiness.",
        "They attribute the innovation of the notion of burstiness to Slava Katz, who, pertaining to this topic, writes (Katz, 1996): \"The notion of burstiness... will be used for the characterisation of two closely related but distinct phenomena: (a) document-level burstiness, i.e. multiple occurrence of a content word or phrase in a single text document, which is contrasted with the fact that most other documents contain no other instances of this word or phrase at all; and (b) within-document burstiness (or burstiness proper), i.e. close proximity of all or some individual instances of a content word or phrase within a document exhibiting multiple occurrence.\"",
        "Katz has highlighted many interesting features of the distribution of content words, which do not conform to the predictions of statistical models such as the Poisson.",
        "Katz (Katz, 1996) states that, when a concept named by a content word is topical for the document, then that content word tends to be characterised by multiple and bursty occurrence.",
        "He claims that, while a single occurrence of a topically used content",
        "word or phrase is possible, it is more likely that a newly introduced topical entity, will be repeated, \"if not for breaking the monotonous effect of pronoun use, then for emphasis or clarity\".",
        "He also claims that, unlike function words, the number of instances of a specific content word is not directly associated with the document length, but is rather a function of how much the document is about the concept expressed by that word.",
        "Therefore, the characteristic distribution pattern of topical content words, which contrasts markedly with that of non-topical and non-content words, could provide a useful aid in identifying the semantically relevant words within a text.",
        "Brief mention should be made of the work done by Justeson and Katz (Justeson and Katz, 1995), which, to a certain degree, relates to the requirements of our task.",
        "In their paper, Justeson and Katz describe some linguistic properties of technical terminology, and use them to formulate an algorithm to identify the technical terms in a given document.",
        "However, their algorithm deals with complex noun phrases only, and, although the technical terms identified by their algorithm are generally highly topical, the algorithm does not provide the context sensitive information of how topical each incidence of a given meaningful phrase is, relative to its direct environment.",
        "It is precisely this information that is needed to judge the content of a particular segment of text.",
        "Although Katz (Katz, 1996) acknowledges what he calls two distinct, but closely related, forms of burstiness, he concentrates on modelling the inter-document distributions of content words and phrases.",
        "He then uses the inter-document distributions to make inferences about probabilities of the repeat occurrences of content words and phrases within a single document.",
        "Another divergence between what Katz has done so far and what the task of subject boundary insertion requires, is that he decides to ignore the issues of coincidental repetitions of non-topically used content words and simply equates \"single occurrence with non-topical occurrence, and multiple occurrence with topical occur-rence.\"",
        "We have implemented a method which assigns an estimated significance score based on a measure of two context dependent properties; local burstiness and global frequency.",
        "The heart of our solution to the problem of assigning context-based values of topical significance to all words in a text, can be summed up in the following formula:",
        "where x is an individual word in the document and Dx,1 is the distance between word x and its ith nearest neighbour.",
        "The 1st nearest neighbour of word x is the nearest occurrence of the same word.",
        "The 2nd nearest neighbour of x is the nearest occurrence of the same word ignoring the 1st nearest neighbour.",
        "In general, the ith nearest neighbour of x is the nearest occurrence of the same word ignoring the 1st, 2nd, 3rd,...,(i – 1)th nearest neighbours.",
        "W is the total number of words in the text.",
        "co is the number of occurrences of the word like x. n is the number of nearest neighbours to include in the calculation and depends on the overall frequency of the word in the text.",
        "This formula will yield a significance score that lies within the range 0 to (high significance to low significance).",
        "This number is then normalised to between 0 and 1, with 0 indicating a very low significance, and 1 indicating a very high significance.",
        "The exact value of n is calculated separately for each distinct word, using the following formula:",
        "This is essentially a sigmoid function with the range varying between two and ten, as shown in Figure 2.",
        "The constants scale and translate the function to yield the desired behaviour, which was derived empirically.",
        "The number of nearest neighbours to consider in equation 1 increases with the word's frequency.",
        "For example, when calculating the signif",
        "icance of the least frequent words, only two nearest neighbours are considered.",
        "But for the most frequently occurring words, the number of nearest neighbours is ten.",
        "Figure 3 shows the main features of the performance of this significance assignment algorithm when tested on a sample text.",
        "The results for three very different words are shown.",
        "Two general trends are the most important features of this graph.",
        "Firstly, elevated significance scores are associated with local clusters of a word.",
        "For example the cluster of three occurrences of \"software\" (a content word) at the end of the document have high significance scores.",
        "This contrasts with the relatively isolated occurrences of the word \"software\" in the middle of the document, which are deemed to be little more significant than several occurrences of the word \"the\" (a function word).",
        "Secondly, frequent words tend to receive lower significance scores.",
        "For example, even local clusters of the word \"the\" only receive relatively low significance scores, simply because the word has a high frequency throughout the document.",
        "Conversely, \"McNealy\" (a high semantic content word), which only occurs in a cluster of three, receives a high significance value.",
        "The important result shown by the graph is that content words (real names such as \"McNealy\") receive higher significance values than function words (\"the\").",
        "We found that an optimal solution to the problem of balancing local density against global frequency was rather elusive.",
        "For example, the words at the centre of a cluster automatically receive a higher score, whereas it may be more desirable to have all the members of a cluster assigned a score lying in a narrower range.",
        "There are many other contentious issues which need to be investigated, such as the use of the ratio of all the occurrences of a word in a given text to the total length of that text in order to calculate the relative significance measure.",
        "Based on intuition, partly derived from Katz's discussion (Katz, 1996) of the relationship between document length and word frequency, the exact nature of this relationship across various document lengths may not be reliable enough.",
        "It may be more consistent to consider this ratio within a constant window size, e.g. 1000 words.",
        "The advantage of this simple statistical method of distinguishing significant content words from non-content words is that no words need to be removed before allowing the algorithm to proceed.",
        "The output of this stage is a normalised significance score (0-1) for each word in the text.",
        "This significance score can then be taken into account when analysing the text for subject boundaries."
