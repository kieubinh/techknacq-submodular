        "Name searching, matching, and recognition have been active areas of research for a number of years [Hickey 1981, Carroll 1985, Rau 1991, Borginan and Siegfried 1992, Paik et al.",
        "1993, Hayes 1994, Proceedings 1995, Pfeiffer et al.",
        "1996], but relatively little evaluation of either the effectiveness of name searching tools or of the effect of name recognition on retrieval perfonnance has been published.",
        "In many retrieval contexts being able to retrieve on names, whether personal, institutional, geographic, or other names, is an important capability.",
        "Some applications [ling and Croft 1994] use name searching to extend the traditional information retrieval paradigm.",
        "To date, however, the main application of name searching has been in determining whether a name of interest in a query matches a name in a database of names [Hickey 1981, Hermansen, 1985].",
        "Two examples of companies that develop customized name matching systems of this sort for business and government clients are Language Analysis Systems, Inc. and Search Software America.",
        "In this paper a different application of name searching is considered using name recognition and matching to support ranked retrieval of free text documents.",
        "Although this application uses name matching techniques much like those used in conventional relational database name searching, and name recognition, or tagging, techniques much like those of information extraction applications; text retrieval is sufficiently different from those applications, as to present different problems and issues, calling for different name searching techniques.",
        "This paper describes a series of experiments exploring the retrieval application and draws some tentative conclusions about it and how it differs from database name matching and information extraction name recognition applications.",
        "This study reviews the accuracy of personal name recognition as shown in the Named Entity Task of the Sixth Message Understanding Conference (MUC-6) [Proceedings 1995]; investigates the frequency of personal and other names in case law and in news database queries; and finally explores the effect on retrieval performance of searching for, personal names differently from other words, through a simulation of name searching based on proximity searching.",
        "The main conclusions of this study are: 1) that name recognition in text can be done effectively; 2) that names occur frequently enough in both texts and queries of legal and news databases to make their recognition worthwhile; and 3) that name searching can lead to improved retrieval for queries with personal names."

        "Name searching is a term that has been used in a variety of ways.",
        "It is useful to define for purposes of this paper what is meant by name searching and related terminology and to describe the application areas for which name searching systems have been developed.",
        "In their comprehensive review article of personal name-matching applications Borgman and Siegfried [1992] categorize applications as being: 1) name authority control, 2) information retrieval, and 3) duplicate detection.",
        "Name-matching in a database context is the process of comparing two character strings and determining whether or not the two strings designate the same entity; in the applications Borgman and Siegfried considered, the same person, but more generally the same institutional, geographical, or other proper-named entities as well.",
        "This determination might be made solely on the basis of a direct comparison of the two strings, or more knowledge might be used, e.g., models of a) variant spelling or representation of names, b) keying errors, c) phonetic models, or d) record-linkage.",
        "That is, if the names to be compared are part of records containing additional fielded information, e.g., age or social security number, this information can be used as additional evidence in the name-matching process: Name-matching assumes that two character strings have been identified which are names and the question is only whether they are instances of the same name.",
        "Typically it is also important to determine if the names refer to the same entity.",
        "Another important class of algorithms is needed for name recognition in applications where the names are not already manually identified.",
        "Name recognition is the process of identifying that a given character string is in fact a name.",
        "Such techniques can be used to extract names from text in the case of an information extraction system [Proceedings 1992, 1995], or as part of the indexing process for an information retrieval system.",
        "The same, or similar, techniques can be used at retrieval time when parsing a user's query.",
        "Commercial products, such as Carnegie Group's NameFinder and IsoQuest's NameTag are available to support these sorts of applications.",
        "Name matching in the context of information retrieval differs from name matching in either database or natural language understanding contexts.",
        "In all three types of applications what is ultimately of interest is not that two names match, whether exactly or approximately, as character strings, but that the entities to which they refer are identical.",
        "Such reference resolution is not generally possible without some additional context.",
        "In the case of database retrieval additional context is provided by the structured nature of the data.",
        "A name typically is one field of a record corresponding to the named entity.",
        "The other fields, e.g., age, or social security number, can be used to infer that the two names being matched do refer to the same individual.",
        "In the case of natural language understanding systems there is linguistic context, as well, perhaps, as domain knowledge representation which can be used to help infer that the two names being matched refer to the same individual.",
        "Information retrieval differs from both of these types of applications, because it has neither the structure provided by a database record, nor the linguistic depth or domain knowledge representation of the natural language understanding system.",
        "Practically name matching becomes a matter of determining whether the surface forms of the two names being matched are close enough as to indicate that it is plausible that they refer to the same individual Name searching can be defined as the process of using a name as part of a query in order to retrieve information associated with that name in a database.",
        "Name searching, in the general case, includes both name recognition and name-matching.",
        "If names are not already identified as such in the database's text records, e.g., when they appear as part of a free text field and have not been previously tagged as being names, then name recognition is required.",
        "Similarly in parsing the query, if the name has not been identified as a name by the syntax of the query, then it will be necessary to recognize it Once names are recognized in query and database record, then name-matching algorithms are needed to determine whether the names are the same, or that they in fact designate the same individual, e.g., two instances of the lexical entity Judge Smith are the same name, but may not designate the same individual."

        "The FED collection consists of 410,883 federal case law documents.",
        "The expert also identified the set of relevant documents from the FED collection associated with each query.",
        "There are several ways that name searching could be implemented in a document retrieval context.",
        "One way would be to use name recognition software to tag all personal names in the document collection and also in queries.",
        "Alternatively, the collection could be tagged, but the user might be required to specify names in the query.",
        "Either way, strings designated as being names in the query would be matched against strings tagged as names in the text.",
        "Strings tagged as names in the collection might also be indexed differently than other strings.",
        "In particular they might not be stemmed, since presumably the similarity in meaning assumed to obtain among strings stemming to a common stem for general terms, would not apply to names.",
        "A different approach to name searching would be to leave the collection unchanged, but to handle name queries differently from other queries.",
        "A combination of these two approaches would also be possible, i. e., tagging names in text and queries, as well as handling name queries differently.",
        "The strong personal name recognition results from MUC-6 [Proceedings 1995] suggest that approaches using name tagging are likely to work well.",
        "In this study, however, names were not tagged.",

        "The proximity searches treated non-name terms in same way the baseline searches did.",
        "However, for name terms, the proximity searches used the if and idf of the proximally ordered name terms.",
        "The proximity searches computed relevance for names using the if and idf of occurrences in which the first name occurred 2 or fewer word positions before the last name.",
        "In this way advantage was taken of the fact that name terms are ordered and resist interruption by non-name terms.",
        "For example, in the query Cases involving jailhouse lawyer Joe Woods, the baseline search treated Joe and Woods as independent concepts.",
        "Joe occurred in 7,669 documents within the 410,883 document test collection and had a normalized idf of 0.31.",
        "Woods occurred in 18,064 documents and had an idf of 0.24.",

        "This study suggests that the name recognition accuracy of name searching software is reasonably good and it seems safe to assume that that accuracy can be improved using domain-specific heuristics and tuning.",
        "For queries containing names there was retrieval performance improvement using name searching, as simulated by proximity operators.",
        "This study further shows that the frequency of occurrence of personal, and other names in cases is sufficient to warrant their separate treatment in document retrieval.",
        "The performance improvement obtained by proximity searching against a collection which had not had names pre-tagged suggests that better retrieval performance improvement gains may be possible using simple name matching heuristics if the query name term is known, rather than relying on preprocessed name tagging.",
        "Whether pre-tagging the collection with name recognition software could give even better retrieval performance is an open research question.",
        "The MUC-6 results imply that recognition accuracy is very high, at least for news text, but whether this would help retrieval much, given that the name to be searched is already known, i.e., specified in the query, is uncertain.",
        "This study supports the view that name recognition and matching in the context of information retrieval is a significantly different problem from either name searching, or matching, in relational databases, or name recognition, or extraction, i.e., tagging names in free text.",
        "Most research and development has focused on these latter two applications, rather than information retrieval.",
        "The prospect of adaptation for information retrieval of the name recognition and matching techniques developed for these applications, seems promising, however.",
        "For Boolean retrieval systems one approach would be to put the burden of query name recognition on the user by requiring that the user tag a query term as being a personal, company, or other name.",
        "Then name recognition techniques, much like those of information extraction, could be used to find candidate matching names in free text and name matching techniques, much like those of database applications, could be used to determine whether names identified in query and text matched.",
        "For systems such as WIN, Freestyle, or Target, of West Publishing, Lexis-Nexis, and DIALOG, respectively, which take natural language queries as input, the approach to take is less clear.",
        "Although it would be possible to have the user, as in the Boolean situation, tag query terms as names, this would seem to violate the underlying philosophy of natural language input search systems, i.e., that the user communicate with the search engine in ordinary natural language.",
        "If the user does not provide query name recognition, then the system must do so automatically.",
        "It might be thought that the same query recognition software used to recognize names in text could do the same in queries.",
        "This is possible, but the nature of document and query text is quite different.",
        "Much less rich syntactic content is usually present in queries, which also tend to be quite short in commercial online systems [Lu and Keefer 1995].",
        "This greatly changes the recognition problem, especially for software which finds patterns in text as the basis of its name recognition [Krupka 1995].",

        "can be used as parts of an overall approach to name searching, but there are major adaptations that need to be made and gaps in the architecture to be filled, such as how to recognize names effectively in user queries.",
