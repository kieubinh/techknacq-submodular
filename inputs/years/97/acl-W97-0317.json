        "There has recently been considerable interest in the use of lexically-based statistical techniques to resolve prepositional phrase attachments.",
        "To our knowledge, however, these investigations have only considered the problem of attaching the first PP, i.e., in a [V NP PP] configuration.",
        "In this paper, we consider one technique which has been successfully applied to this problem, backed-off estimation, and demonstrate how it can be extended to deal with the problem of multiple PP attachment.",
        "The multiple PP attachment introduces two related problems: sparser data (since multiple PPs are naturally rarer), and greater syntactic ambiguity (more attachment configurations which must be distinguished).",
        "We present and algorithm which solves this problem through reuse of the relatively rich data obtained from first PP training, in resolving subsequent PP attachments."

        "Ambiguity is the most specific feature of natural languages, which sets them aside from programming languages, and which is at the root of the difficulty of the parsing enterprise, pervading languages at all levels: lexical, morphological, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic.",
        "Unless clever techniques are developed to deal with ambiguity, the number of possible parses for an average sentence (20 words) is simply intractable.",
        "In the case of prepositional phrases, the expansion of the number of possible analysis is the Catalan number series, thus the number of possible analyses grows with a function that is exponential in the number of Prepositional Phrase (Church and Patil, 1982).",
        "One of the most interesting topics of debate at the moment, is the use of frequency information for automatic syntactic disambiguation.",
        "As argued in many pieces of work in the Al tradition (Marcus, 1980; Crain and Steedman, 1985; Altmann and Steedman, 1988; Hirst, 1987), the exact solution of the disambiguation problem requires complex reasoning and high level syntactic and semantic knowledge.",
        "However, current work in part-of-speech tagging has succeeded in showing that it is possible to carve one particular subproblem and solve it by approximation – using statistical techniques – independently of the other levels of computation.",
        "In this paper we consider the problem of prepositional phrase (PP) ambiguity.",
        "While there have been a number of recent studies concerning the use of statistical techniques for resolving single PP attachments, i.e. in constructions of the form [V NP PP], we are unaware of published work which applies these techniques to the more general, and pathological, problem of multiple PPs, e.g. [V NP PP1 PP2 ...].",
        "In particular, the multiple PP attachment problem results in sparser data which must be used to resolve greater ambiguity: a strong test for any probabilistic approach.",
        "We begin with an overview of techniques which have been used for PP attachment disambiguation, and then consider how one of the most successful of these, the backed-off estimation technique, can be applied to the general problem of multiple PP attachment,"

        "Attempts to resolve the problem of PP attachment in computational linguistics are numerous, but the problem is hard and success rate typically depends on the domain of application.",
        "Historically, the shift from attempts to resolve the problem completely, by using heuristics developed using typical Al techniques (Jensen and Binot, 1987; Marcus, 1980; Crain and Steedman, 1985; Altmann and Steedman, 1988) has left the place for attempts to solve the problem by less expensive means, even if only approximately.",
        "As shown by many psycholinguistic and practical",
        "studies (Ford et al., 1982; Taraban and McClelland, 1988; Whittemore et al., 1990), lexical information is one of the main cues to PP attachment disambiguation.",
        "In one of the earliest attempts to resolve the problem of PP attachment ambiguity using lexical measures, Hindle and Rooth (1993) show that a measure of mutual information limited to lexical association can correctly resolve 80% of the cases of PP attachment ambiguity, confirming the initial hypothesis that lexical information, in particular co-occurrence frequency, is central in determining the choice of attachment.",
        "The same conclusion is reached by Brill and Resnik (1994).",
        "They apply transformation-based learning (Brill, 1993) to the problem of learning different patterns of PP attachment.",
        "After acquiring 471 patterns of PP attachment, the parser can correctly resolve approximately 80% of the ambiguity.",
        "If word classes (Resnik, 1993) are taken into account, only 266 rules are needed to perform at 80% accuracy.",
        "Magerman and Marcus (1991) report 54/55 correct PP attachments for Pearl, a probabilistic chart parser, with Earley style prediction, that integrates lexical co-occurrence knowledge into a probabilistic context-free grammar.",
        "The probabilities of the rules are conditioned on the parent rule and on the trigram centered at the first input symbol that would be covered by the rule.",
        "Even if the parser has been tested only in the direction giving domain, where the behaviour of prepositions is very consistent, it shows that a mixture of lexical and structural information is needed to solve the problem successfully.",
        "Collins and Brooks (1995) propose a 4-gram model for PP disambiguation which exploits backed-off estimation to smooth null events (see next section).",
        "Their model achieves 84.5% accuracy.",
        "The authors point out that prepositions are the most informative element in the tuple, and that taking low frequency events into account improves performance by several percentage points.",
        "In other words, in solving the PP attachment problem, backing-off is not advantageous unless the tuple that is being tested is not present in the training set (it has zero counts).",
        "Moreover, tuples that contain prepositions are the most informative.",
        "The second result is roughly confirmed by Brill and Resnik, (ignoring the importance of n2 when it is a temporal modifier, such as yesterday, today).",
        "In their work, the top 20 transformations learned are primarily based on specific prepositions."

        "While the above equation is perfectly valid in theory, sparse data means it is rather less useful in practice.",
        "That is, for a particular sentence containing a PP attachment ambiguity, it is very likely that we will never have seen the precise (v,n1,p,n2) quadruple before in the training data, or that we will have only seen it rarely.' To address this problem, they employ backed-off estimation when zero counts occur in the training data.",
        "Thus if f(v, nl, p, n2) is zero, they `back-off' to an alternative estimation of which relies on 3-tuples rather than 4-tuples:",
