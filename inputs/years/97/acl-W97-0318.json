        "The ability to distinguish states, e.g., \"Mark seems happy,\" from events, e.g., \"Renee ran down the street,\" is a necessary prerequisite for interpreting certain adverbial adjuncts, as well as identifying temporal constraints between sentences in a discourse (Moens and Steedman, 1988; Dorr, 1992; Klavans, 1994).",
        "Furthermore, stativity is the first of three fundamental temporal distinctions that compose the aspectual class of a clause.",
        "Aspectual classification is a necessary component for a system that analyzes temporal constraints, or performs lexical choice and tense selection in machine translation (Moens and Steedman, 1988; Passonneau, 1988; Dorr, 1992; Klavans, 1994).",
        "Researchers have used empirical analysis of corpora to develop linguistically-based numerical indicators that aid in aspectual classification (Klavans and Chodorow, 1992; Siegel and McKeown, 1996).",
        "Specifically, this technique takes advantage of linguistic constraints that pertain to aspect, e.g., only clauses that describe an event can appear in the progressive.",
        "Therefore, a verb that appears more frequently in the progressive is more likely to describe an event.",
        "In this paper, we evaluate fourteen quantitative linguistic indicators for their ability to classify verbs according to stativity.",
        "The values of these indicators are computed automatically across a corpus of text.",
        "Classification performance is then measured over an unrestricted set of verbs.",

        "Stativity must be identified to detect temporal constraints between clauses attached with when.",
        "For example, in interpreting, \"She had good strength when objectively tested,' the have-state began before or at the beginning of the test-event, and ended after or at the end of the test-event.",
        "However, in interpreting, \"Phototherapy was discontinued when the bilirubin came down to 13,\" the discontinue-event began at the end of the come-event.",
        "As another example, the simple present reading of an event, e.g., \"He jogs,\" denotes the habitual reading, i.e., \"every day,\" whereas the simple present reading of a state, e.g., \"He appears healthy,\" implies \"at the moment.\"",
        "Identifying stativity is the first step toward aspec-tually classifying a clause.",
        "Events are further distinguished by two additional features: 1) telic events have an explicit culminating point in time, while non-telic events do not, and 2) extended events have a time duration, while atomic events do not.",
        "Detecting the telicity and atomicity of a clause is necessary to identify temporal constraints between clauses and to interpret certain adverbial adjuncts (Moens",
        "If a verb can occur: ...then it must be: in the progressive Extended Event with a temporal adverb Event (e.g., then) with a duration in-PP Telic Event (e.g., in an hour) in the perfect tense Telic Event or State",
        "and Steedman, 1988; Passonneau, 1988; Dorr, 1992; Klavans, 1994).",
        "However, since these features apply only to events and not to states, a clause first must be classified according to stativity.",
        "Certain features of a clause, such as adjuncts and tense, are constrained by and contribute to the as-pectual class of the clause (Vendler, 1967; Dowty, 1979; Pustejovsky, 1991; Passonneau, 1988; Klavans, 1994).",
        "Examples of such constraints are listed in Table 1.",
        "Each entry in this table describes a syntactic aspectual marker and the constraints on the aspectual class of any clause that appears with that marker.",
        "For example, a telic event can be modified by a duration in-PP, as in \"You found us there in ten minutes,\" but a state cannot, e.g., \"You loved him in ten minutes.\"",
        "In general, the presence of these linguistic markers in a particular clause indicates a constraint on the aspectual class of the clause, but the absence thereof does not place any constraint.",
        "This makes it difficult for a system to aspectually classify a clause based on the presence or absence of a marker.",
        "Therefore, these linguistic constraints are best exploited by a system that measures their frequencies across verbs.",
        "Klavans and Chodorow (1992) pioneered the application of statistical corpus analysis to aspectual classification by placing verbs on a \"stativity scale\" according to the frequency with which they occur in the progressive.",
        "This way, verbs are automatically ranked according to their propensity towards stativity.",
        "We have previously applied this principle towards distinguishing telic events from non-telic events (Siegel and McKeown, 1996).",

        "This method embodies the intuition that each indicator correlates with the probability that a verb describes an event or state, but that each indicator has its own unique scale, and so must be weighted accordingly.",
        "One way to determine these weights is log-linear regression (Santner and Duffy, 1989), a popular technique for binary classification.",
        "This technique, which is more extensive than a simple weighted sum, applies an inverse logit function, and employs the iterative reweighted least squares algorithm (Baker and Nelder, 1989).",
        "Genetic programming.",
        "An alternative to avoid the limitations of a linear combination is to generate a non-linear function tree that combines multiple indicators.",
        "A popular method for generating such function trees is a genetic algorithm (Holland, 1975; Goldberg, 1989).",
        "The use of genetic algorithms to generate function trees (Cramer, 1985; Koza, 1992) is frequently called genetic programming.",
        "The function trees are generated from a set of 17 primitives: the binary functions ADD, MULTIPLY and DIVIDE, and 14 terminals corresponding to the 14 indicators listed in Table 2.",
        "This set of primitives was established empirically; conditional functions, subtraction, and random constants failed to change performance significantly.",
        "The polarities for several indicators were reversed according to the polarities of the weights established by log-linear regression.",

        "A threshold must be selected for both linear and function tree combinations of indicators.",
        "This way, overall outputs can be discriminated such that classification performance is maximized.",
        "For both methods, this threshold is established over the training set and frozen for evaluation over the test set.",
        "Decision trees.",
        "Another method capable of modeling non-linear relationships between indicators is a decision tree.",

        "Each leaf node is labeled with a classification (state or event).",
