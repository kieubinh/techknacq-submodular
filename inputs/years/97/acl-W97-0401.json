        "Discourse particles are words that are not uttered because of their propositional content, but because of some pragmatic function for the ongoing discourse.",
        "Imagine, for instance, utterance (1) in the midst of a discussion; the right at the beginning serves mainly to signal turn-taking and initiating some kind of break in the conversation.",
        "(1) Right, now let's turn to the next topic.",
        "The exact function of a discourse particle is often difficult to determine, though, and thus the need for disambiguation arises: In the German utterance (2), which can be roughly translated as So we're finished, the ja can be a mere filler that smoothens the intonation contour, or it can mark the overall information as given, e.g. in a situation where the participants have just collectively closed off the final topic.",
        "(2) Dann sind wir ja fertig.",
        "The disambiguation problem is aggravated considerably by the fact that the vast majority of words that can be used as discourse particles also have a \"standard\", lexically-determined, reading.'",
        "In (1), the now can be read as a temporal adverb or as a semantically empty particle.",
        "Similarly, in (2) the dann is most likely just an 'uptake' particle, but in general it is a temporal adverb as well.",
        "We will follow the terminology of Hirschberg and Litman [1993], who distinguish between the sentential usage and the discourse usage of such words.",
        "In these terms, the problem is that many particles have a sentential usage, but it may very well be irrelevant in certain contexts, where only the discourse usage of the particle is relevant – and often that usage has no systematic relationship to the sentential usage.",
        "'Exceptions are, for instance, the English oh or the German ach, which are always discourse particles.",
        "Several studies of English discourse particles have suggested that utterance-initial position is the central criterion to distinguish sentential from discourse reading (e.g., Reichman [1985]), and certainly, adopting such a criterion makes it much easier to gather and evaluate the data (cf. Byron and Heeman [1997]).",
        "The position-criterion, however, holds for a certain class of discourse particles at best.",
        "Hirschberg and Litman [1993] give some counterexamples to the hypothesis.",
        "Furthermore, it does not travel well to the German language, despite the fact that Ripplinger and Alexandersson [1996] also give the utterance-initial criterion for identifying German discourse particles, such as denn, also, ja, in the VERBMOBIL corpus.",
        "In fact, these and other particles can occur almost everywhere in the utterance.",
        "For this and other reasons, the class of discourse particles is a heterogeneous one and very difficult to demarcate in syntactic or other formal ways.",
        "Schiffrin [1987, p.31ff] develops a lengthy definition of units of talk and then treats discourse particles (markers in her terminology) as bracketing such units.",
        "For our purposes here, we do not attempt to give formal criteria for what constitutes a discourse particle; instead we are content with the functional, dual-usage description.",
        "This results from taking a rather broad perspective on the range of functions of discourse particles, which will be developed in section 3.",
        "For the task of translating utterances containing discourse particles, the monolingual ambiguity problem is extended by that of finding an appropriate translation – and different languages have developed quite different conventions for using particles.",
        "German is known to offer an especially wide range of discourse particles, and therefore it is not surprising that many of them do not have any straightforward English translation at all – instead, their function in discourse needs to be signalled by different means.",
        "And in many cases a particle is best dropped from the translation process altogether, if its existence is due merely to certain conventions in spoken German, which do not carry over to the target language.'",
        "The problem is, given a particular utterance containing a particle, to tell which case is at hand.",
        "2Furthermore, the problem is amplified by the fact that German particles can be combined to form conglomerates, as in Wir sollten wohl doch noch ma!",

        "In many cases, it would not be difficult to replace the \"corrected\" portion of an utterance with the portion that \"overwrites\" it, thereby sparing the hearer from reworking the correction herself.",
        "As for routine formulas, they first of all cause the standard problems of idiomatic phrases: they need to be recognized as a single unit of meaning, so that they can be translated en bloc.",
        "This presupposes lexical representations that adequately describe the possible variants of the expression, e.g., whether additional modifiers may be inserted into a phrase, etc.",
        "When processing written language, this is difficult enough – with speech and the additional uncertainties of word recognition, the problems are even harder.",
        "For the time being, a comprehensive treatment of routine formulas and other idioms does not seem feasible.",
        "Regarding the overall system architecture, the deep-analysis phase, as we have described it, need not be necessary for each and every utterance – if the input allows for a standard transfer-based translation (e.g., because it doesn't contain ambiguous particles), that will typically be sufficient.",
