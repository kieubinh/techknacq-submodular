        "Recently, special concerns are paid to research on dialogue machine translation.",
        "Many different aspects of dialogue, however, make it difficult to translate spoken language with conventional machine translation techniques.",
        "One of the reasons is that a surface utterance may represent several ambiguous meanings depending on context.",
        "That means such utterance can be translated into many different ways depending on context.",
        "Interpreting this kind of utterances often requires the analysis of contexts.",
        "Therefore, the discourse structure of a dialogue plays a very important role in translating the utterances in the dialogue.",

        "Many researchers have studied the way how to analyze dialogues.",
        "One of the representative approaches is the plan-based method (Litman et al.",
        "1987; Caberry 1989).",
        "Considering that our dialogue translation system is to be combined with the speech system to develop an automatic translating telephone, however, the plan-based approach has some limitations.",
        "In an automatic translating telephone environment, the system must make one correct translated target sentence for each source sentence and must be able to respond in real time.",
        "However, the plan inference is computationally expensive and is hard to be scaled up.",
        "In order to overcome such limitations, we have focused on defining minimal approach which uses knowledgebase as small as possible while it can handle ambiguous utterances.",
        "This paper presents an efficient discourse analysis model using statistical speech act processing for Korean-English dialogue machine translation.",
        "In this model, we suggest a probabilistic model which uses surface syntactic patterns and the N-gram of speech act reflecting the hierarchical structures of dialogues to decide the speech act of an input sentence and to maintain a discourse structure.",
        "The proposed model consists of two steps : (1) identifying the syntactic pattern of an utterance (2) calculating the plausibility for possible speech acts and discourse relations.",
        "After presenting some motivational examples in section 2, we discuss the statistical speech act processing model to analyze discourse structure in section 3.",
        "In section 4, we describe a method to analyze dialogue structure using the proposed statistical speech act processing.",
        "We discuss experimental results for the proposed model in section 5.",

        "The following dialogue examples show such cases.",
        "To differentiate such cases, a translation system must analyze the context of a dialogue.",
        "Since a dialogue has a hierarchical structure than a linear structure, the discourse structure of a dialogue must be analyzed to reflect the context in translation.",
