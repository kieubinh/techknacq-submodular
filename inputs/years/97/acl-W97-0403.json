        "Based on a number of independent motivations, we have adopted a hybrid analogical approach to the problem of translating spoken language.",
        "Briefly, our approach is motivated by the shortcomings that we perceive in other approaches, such as syntactic or semantic-grammar based, interlingua-based, purely analogical, or purely statistical methods.",
        "For more detailed arguments, please refer to (Horiguchi and Franz, 1997).",
        "In this paper, we have described our view of spoken language pragmatics, and we have described how pragmatic information can be translated within the hybrid analogical approach.",
        "In future work, we will perform corpus analysis for additional pragmatic operators, and extend the prototype implementation of our analogical speech translation system to cover these phenomena."
