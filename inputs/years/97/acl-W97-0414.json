        "The inflection code of the Polish part of an entry is a reference to a set of inflection endings stored in one of classification files prepared in phase 1.",
        "The format of the inflection code of the English part is \"selfconstructive\", i.e. it enables the generation of appropriate inflected forms from a canonical form without the necessity of a time-consuming look up of any classification file.",

        "The translation algorithm is non-modular: its only results are the phrasal structure and the surface form of the English expression corresponding to the Polish input.",
        "The processes of syntactic parsing, semantic analysis, transfer and morphological generation are not separated.",
        "The grammar assumed in parsing Polish expressions consists mostly of DGC rules.",
        "A specific algorithm is used for parsing verbal phrases.",
        "The algorithm deals with a characteristic feature of Polish syntax: an almost arbitrary order of verb modifiers.",
        "Types and admissible orders of modifiers of a given verb are listed in the dictionary.",
        "A few English verbs may correspond to one Polish verb depending on the type and the order of its modifiers.",
        "For each type of a modifier of a Polish verb, the type of the corresponding modifier of the English equivalent is given in the dictionary.",
        "The translation algorithm searches for the constituent verb of a clause, consults the information extracted from the dictionary and first checks for the constructions admissible for the verb.",
        "This approach enables the analysis of the Polish input expression.",
        "the choice of the appropriate English verb equivalent and the synthesis of the correct English output.",
        "If verb modifiers in the clause fulfil none of the types given in the dictionary for the predicate, then default values for the English verb equivalent and the English modifier types are taken.",
        "The algorithm makes it possible to transfer special verbal constructions called (-T) constructions and (T-shifted)",
        "constructions, where T denotes a type of a modifier.",
        "(-T) constructions are used in analysing object questions and relative object clauses in which a modifier of the type T does not explicitly occur, although the type T-modifier is required for the verb according to the dictionary information (e.g. in the sentence \"He is a man I was talking to\" the object of the clause \"1 was talking to\" appears \"outside\" the clause).",
        "The (T-shifted) constructions are used in analysing sentences in which an object of the Polish expression should be transferred into the subject of the English expression (e.g. the Polish .sentence: \"Nie powiedziano rni (object) o tym\"; the English translation: \"I (subject) have not been told about that\").",
        "In a Polish sentence verbs are characterised both by pre-and post-modifiers.",
        "However, the sequence of words between the subject and the predicate in a sentence is subject to a number of constraints and is therefore amenable to deterministic parsing.",
        "This deterministic part of the algorithm has a notable impact on the effectiveness of the translation process.",
        "A few heuristic methods have been developed in order to limit the search space and thus achieve better efficiency.",
        "The \"method of filters\" consists in checking \"negative rules\" first.",
        "The success of a negative rule is equivalent to a failure of the hypothesis.",
        "The method \"replace by alternative\" consists in replacing two rules with the same left-hand symbol and the same beginning of their right sides by one rule - e.g. two rules A-4BC, A-4131) are replaced by one rule A-41(C or D).",
        "This improves effectiveness because of a single (rather than double) attempt to expand the same non-terminal symbol to the given string of terminals.",
        "The method \"from longest to shortest\" says that if a symbol A occurs as a non-last right-hand symbol of a rule - e.g. in the rule D – AE - and the grammar includes more rules than one to replace the symbol A - e.g. rules: A-+BC, A – >B, then it is more effective to make the algorithm check the \"longer\" rule A-*BC before checking the \"shorter\" rule A-43.",
        "This makes it possible to block backtracking in the rule D – >A!E.",
        "The method \"replace symbol by parameter\" may be used when right-hand sides of productions for different symbols start with the same (sequence of) symbol(s).",
        "For example, two rules A – >BC, D-4BE may be replaced by one rule: F(P) – > B((C and P is P1) or (D and P is P2))."
