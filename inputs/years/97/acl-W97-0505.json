        "So far, word prediction methods have been developed in order to increase message composition rate for people with severe motor and speech disabilities.",
        "These methods try to guess what is going to be the current or even the next word the user is trying to type.",
        "Their results are normally measured in terms of keystroke savings (Ks)1.",
        "To our knowledge, the design of word prediction methods is mainly focused on non-inflected languages, like English.",
        "Words in these types of languages have a small amount of variation, like the ones due to number (singular or plural) for instance,",
        "house/houses, spy/spies.",
        "Some other languages admit differences in gender, for example in French: voisin/voisine.",
        "When the number of different forms of a word is small, it is possible to include all of them in the dictionary used in word prediction.",
        "Nonetheless, inflected languages can have a huge number of affixes that determine the syntactic function of each word and therefore it is not possible to include every variation of a word in the dictionary.",
        "So, other methods have to be tried for languages that use extensively prefixes, infixes or suffixes.",
        "As a starting point, let us show what the declension of a word in Basque may be, by means of an example.",
        "The declension of the dictionary entry mendi (which means \"mountain\") can be seen in Table 1.",
        "This table is valid only for words referring to objects, but there are different tables for declensions of words referring to living beings.",
        "Whether the last letter of the lemma is a vowel or a consonant, different tables of declensions are also used.",
        "As shown, there are sixty-two possible word-forms for a single dictionary entry.",
        "In addition, most of the cases admit the recursive concatenation of suffixes.",
        "So, the number of possible cases grows.",
        "It has been estimated that nouns may mathematically have even 458,683 inflected forms in Basque language, taking into account two levels of recursion, (Agirre et al., 1992).",
        "There also are other suffixes which are not shown in Table 1, as those applied to a verb for subordinate sentences.",
        "Even if prefixes and infixes are possible the Basque language is declensed mainly by suffixes.",
        "There are some prefixes that can be used in some specific cases (for example, a prefix for verbs may indicate the absolutive case in the sentence), but in general their frequency of apparition is not very relevant.",
        "The same thing happens with the infixes: there are few of them in Basque and their frequency is not very relevant.",
        "Their prediction makes sense mainly if the",
        "word is an auxiliary or a declined verb.",
        "For the rest of the cases, it seems better to treat the affix in combination with the lemma as a new lemma, if this combination is usual.",
        "Doing this, the complexity of operations decrease because there is only the need to treat lemmas and suffixes.",
        "Thus, in this paper, the problem of suffixes will mainly be mentioned, because our target language is the Basque language."

        "So, the key question is: Are the word prediction methods that we have previously shown useful for inflected languages?",
        "As we mentioned in the introduction, in non-inflected languages it is feasible to include in the dictionary all the forms derived from each lemma, taking into account that the number of variations is quite small.",
        "For instance, in English friends is the only variation (without creating composed words) of friend, and the verbs have a few variations too.",
        "• In Spanish, the word amigo (with the same meaning than friend) may vary in gender and number, giving the words: amiga, amigos and amigas.",
        "But the variations that the word adiskide (same meaning as friend or amigo) may have in Basque make it impossible to store them in the dictionary of the system.",
        "This is one of the changes to be taken into account for the design of a predictor for this type of languages.",
        "In inflected languages, the complexity in making the changes is very high, because of the number of possibilities.",
        "One possibility is to group the suffixes depending on their syntactic function to make it possible to have an easy automatisation.",
        "In addition, we shouldn't forget that suffixes may be recursively concatenated.",
        "In the previously presented prediction methods, the ones using probabilistic information mainly work with the words as isolated entities.",
        "That is, they work seeing each word in the dictionary as a whole to be guessed, without taking into account the morpho-syntactical information inherent to the languages.",
        "So, a word that is not at the lexicon can not be guessed.",
        "The impossibility to store all the combinations of a word, make these methods not very suitable for inflected languages2.",
        "Therefore, it would be very interesting to treat the entire sentence.",
        "Then, the first syntactic approach is not very useful, because it only takes into account the previous word.",
        "And the second one is very hard to implement, because of the number of variations a word may have.",
        "Maybe a great number of rules have to be defined to cope with all the variations, but in this way the probabilities to guess the rule which is being used are very small, because of their variety.",
        "The same thing happens with the semantic approach, which has, as it has been said before, the same procedural characteristics as the second syntactic one.",
        "So, the complexity needed to create a correct word, including all the suffixes it needs, in inflected languages may make it necessary to search for other prediction methods, apart from all that were shown in the previous section.",
        "2To know what the suitability for the next shown approaches can be, let us show a special case for Basque: verbs, mainly auxiliary verbs.",
        "They depend not only on the subject (which normally appears as absolutive or ergative cases) but also on the direct complement (if the sentence is transitive this complement has the absolutive case while the subject has the ergative case) and on the indirect complement (the dative case).",
        "For instance, the auxiliary dizut is related to the subject of the first person singular, the object complement in the singular and the indirect complement of the second person singular.",

        "Both cases are in the present of the indicative.",
        "If the tense of the verb changes, the verb itself also changes (for example, the past of the indicative of dizut is nizun and the past of dizkigute is zizkiguten).",

        "As there is a huge variety of inflected languages, let us concentrate on the particular characteristics of the Basque language, customising to this case the operational way.",
        "For this first approach, due to the above mentioned primacy of suffixes (over other affixes) in the Basque language, and to simplify the problem, prediction in Basque is divided in two parts: prediction of lemmas and prediction of suffixes.",
        "Thus, two dictionaries (one for lemmas and other for suffixes) are used.",
        "The first one includes the lemmas of the language alphabetically ordered with their frequencies and some morphologic information in order to know which possible declensions are possible for a word.",
        "The second one includes suffixes and their frequencies ordered by frequencies.",
        "To start the prediction, the system tries to anticipate the lemma of the next word.",
        "Most of the methods seen in previous sections can be used for this purpose.",
        "When the lemma is accepted (or typed entirely if the predictor fails), the system offers the suffixes that are correct for this lemma ordered by frequencies.",
        "As the acceptable suffixes for a noun can be about 62 (as we have seen in the Table 1) only the most probable n suffixes are offered3.",
        "As can be seen, the operational way is very similar to word prediction using tables of probabilities, but there is some added complexity because the system (and also the user) has to distinguish between lemmas and suffixes.",
        "In addition, more than one table of probabilities may be necessary to properly make predictions.",
