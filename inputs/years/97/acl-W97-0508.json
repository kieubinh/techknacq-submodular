        "This paper briefly overviews a project whose long-term goal is the development of a \"writing tutor\" for deaf people who use American Sign Language (ASL).",
        "We wish to address the particular difficulties faced by the deaf writer learning English and to create a system with the capabilities of accepting input via an essay written by a user (possibly several paragraphs in length), analyzing that essay for errors, and then engaging the user in tutorial dialogue aimed toward improving his/her overall literacy.",
        "The goal is a system designed to be used over an extended period of time, with the capacity to model the student's state of language proficiency and changes in that proficiency.",
        "The tutoring provided by the system would then be hand-tailored toward the individual user and his/her level of acquisition of written English.",
        "Such a system must have several components.",
        "First, it must have the ability to analyze the input texts and determine what errors have occurred.",
        "It must then be able to select which of these errors to discuss with the learner, and in what order to discuss them.",
        "Finally, it must be able to generate appropriate corrective tutorial messages concerning the errors, keeping in mind both the goal of correcting this sample text and the larger objective of improving the overall literary of the student.",
        "Concurrent with these explicit components, the system must be capable of constructing and updating a user model to be consulted in both the selection of errors to be corrected and the generation of corrective text.",
        "This user model would take into account a theory of second language acquisition which regards the process as a systematic revision of an internalized concept of the language to be acquired.",
        "Students would be placed within a model of climbing literacy, with language concepts rated as above, below, or within their current realm of acquisition, and the tutorial interaction tailored to this model.",
        "In this paper, after motivating our specific application, we introduce the architecture of our eventual system and motivate its various components.",
        "After describing our current implementation status, we motivate the need for a model of second language acquisition.",
        "We finish with describing how we propose to model this process."

        "The problem of deaf literacy has been well-documented and has far reaching effects on every aspect of deaf students' education.",
        "Though data on writing skills is difficult to obtain, we note that the reading comprehension level of deaf students is considerably lower than that of their hearing counterparts, \"...with about half of the population of deaf 18-year-olds reading at or below a fourth grade level and only about 10% reading above the eighth grade level...\" (Strong, 1988)",
        "of English or any other spoken language (Stokoe, Jr., 1960), (Baker and Padden, 1978), (Baker and Cokely, 1980), (Hoffineister and Shettle, 1983), (Klima and Bellugi, 1979), (Bellman, Poizner, and Bellugi, 1983).",
        "The structure of ASL is radically different from that of English, being much more similar to that of Chinese or the Native American language Navaho.",
        "In addition to sign order rules (which are similar to word order rules of English), ASL syntax includes systematic modulations to signs as well as non-manual behavior (e.g., squinting, raising of eyebrows, body shifts, and shaking, nodding or tilting the head) for morphological and grammatical purposes (Baker and Cokely, 1980), (Liddell, 1980), (Padden, 1981), (Klima and Bellugi, 1979), (Kegl and Gee, 1983), (Ingram, 1978), (Baker, 1980).",
        "The modality of ASL encourages simultaneous communication of information which is not possible with the completely sequential nature of written English.",
        "In addition to radical differences in the structure of ASL and English, another obstacle to the ASL user acquiring English is the unique processing strategies s/he brings to the task (Anderson, 1993).",
        "The cognitive elements used to store signs in short-term memory are distinctively different from those used with a spoken/written language.",
        "Also, hearers of spoken language buffer the speech in order to process it together in words and phrases, but the buffer for visually observed data has a much quicker decay time than that of auditory or visual data, which leads to repetition and redundancy in signed languages that does not occur in the same manner elsewhere.",
        "Moreover, long, involved utterances of a manual language are parceled into small parts that are recursively reinforced, referring back to previous details as each new piece of information is added, another characteristic atypical of spoken language.",
        "Adding to these difficulties is the fact that ASL has no accepted written form, eliminating the opportunity to establish literacy skills in a fluent native language and then transfer those skills to the new language being learned.",
        "Perhaps the worst difficulty for the deaf learner is that s/he has little to no understandable input in the language s/he is attempting to acquire.",
        "Thus, in addition to providing feedback on the student's writing, a tutoring system should be capable of offering sample understandable input using constructions that the student is currently attempting to master.",
        "We anticipate that our system will address the unique needs of the deaf population in other ways as well.",
        "For instance, this system would provide the focus has been on those people who are (near native) users of American Sign Language.",
        "user with feedback on his or her writing without involving a human teacher.",
        "Some students might prefer this mode of feedback since they would not risk feeling a \"loss of face\" as they might with a human tutor.",
        "The hope is that this will get the students to write more.",
        "In explaining the difficulties faced by the deaf learner of English, we do not propose that ASL natives are fundamentally different from other learners of English as a Second Language; rather, we want to stress the view that English is, for ASL natives, a fundamentally different and challenging language, motivating the need to adopt a Second Language Acquisition strategy toward facilitating the learning process.",
        "There exist many obstacles to this process, some which are shared with other native language populations and some which are unique, such as the absence of the opportunity to have English input tailored to the personal level of acquisition and understanding of the learner.",
        "The system we propose attempts to address these needs as closely as possible within its own constraints (i.e., without the ability to converse with the learner in his native language).",
        "We should note that while there are \"style check-ers\" and \"grammar checkers\" on the market, these programs do not satisfy the needs of the deaf.",
        "Educators of the deaf (and other people working with deaf individuals) report that such checkers, geared toward the errors of hearing writers, frustrate deaf students.",
        "Tailored toward the writing style of fluent, native English speakers, they do not catch many errors that are common in the writing of people who are deaf, and, at the same time, they flag many constructions that are not errors.",
        "We ran some of our writing samples from deaf subjects through a few grammar checkers, and we judged the results to be consistent with these reports.",
        "There have been some attempts to develop \"grammar checkers\" for people who are deaf.",
        "Perhaps the most notable of these is the system named Ms. Pluralbelle which was developed and tested with students at Gallaudet University (Loritz, 1990), (Loritz, Parhizgar, and Zambrano, 1993).",
        "The work described here differs from this earlier work mainly in its emphasis on correction and on its model of the user's acquisition process."

        "The system, called ICICLE (Interactive Computer Identification and Correction of Language Errors), is designed to be a general purpose language learning tutor.",
        "While our current focus is on users of ASL, and thus some of the modules",
        "will be specific to the errors and difficulties of this learner population, our eventual goal is to have the language-specific aspects of the system to be excisable, allowing modules for different native languages to be inserted, so the system would eventually be usable for any learner of English as a Second Language.",
        "The input/feedback cycle of ICICLE begins when the user enters a portion of text into the computer.",
        "The user's text is processed by the Error Analysis component which is responsible for tagging all errors.",
        "This component first performs a syntactic parse of a sentence using an English grammar augmented with error-production rules, or mal-rules (Sleeman, 1982), (Weischedel, Voge, and James, 1978).",
        "These mal-rules allow sentences containing errors to be parsed with the grammar, and enable the system to flag errors when they occur.",
        "The mal-rules themselves are derived from an error taxonomy which resulted from our writing sample analysis in conjunction with an analysis of how ASL knowledge might influence written English and other ASL information (Sun i and McCoy, 1993).",
        "The initial taxonomy was developed from an analysis of forty-eight Freshman and Sophomore writing evaluation samples from Gallaudet University (a liberal arts university for the deaf), seventeen writing evaluation samples from the National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID, a deaf school in Delaware), and five letters and essays written by ASL natives and collected through the Bicultural Center in Washington, DC.",
        "In total, the samples represent about 25,000 words.",
        "The errors were hand-counted and categorized, leading to the development of the mal-rules which represent them.",
        "The possible effects of ASL on the errors identified are captured in the Language Model.",
        "The effects from the acquisition of English as a Second Language are captured in the Acquisition Model (described later in this paper).",
        "These two models affect a scoring mechanism which is used to identify a single parse (and set of errors) when multiple possibilities exist (McCoy, Pennington, and Sun, 1996).",
        "The error identification phase must also look for semantic errors (e.g., mixing of have and be), and for discourse level errors (e.g., NP deletions).",
        "Some of these errors will be flagged after syntactic parsing using independent error rules.",
        "Finally, the Error Identification module is responsible for updating any discourse information tracked by the system (e.g., focus information).",
        "Once this information is recorded, the next sentence will be analyzed.",
        "After all analyses are completed, the text, along with the error results and annotations from the error rules, will be passed to the Response Generator.",
        "The Generator component processes this information (along with data from the User Model and possibly the History Module) in order to decide which errors to correct in detail and how each should be corrected (including what language level should be used in generating any required instruction).",
        "The decision as to which errors to correct in detail will be most influenced by reasoning on the Acquisition Model.",
        "The second decision that must be made in the Response Generator is which kind of correction strategy to use in actually generating the response.",
        "This decision is also affected by information stored in the User Model and History Module.",
        "The content of the response itself will be derived from the annotations on the errors that were passed from the Error Analysis component; additional content for the responses may be provided by the ASL/English \"Expert\" (Language Model) and influenced by the Acquisition Model.",
        "Finally, the responses will be displayed to the user who then has an opportunity to enter corrections to the text and have it rechecked.",
        "At the same time, information from the Response Generator will be used to update the recent and long-term \"history\" of the user.",
        "This knowledge can then be utilized to assess the user's second-language ability and other user characteristics, and to evaluate the success (or failure) of the correction techniques employed thus far."

        "Once the text is loaded, the user may ask that it be analyzed by the system.",

        "This rule would recognize an error at the sentence formation level, in subject-verb agreement - specifically, an error where the subject is plural but the verb form is third-person singular, such as \"We does...\" or \"They has...\" By tagging the sentence parse with the feature (error-feature +), it is identified as containing an error, and the parse tree can be examined to discover the mal-rule (in this case, mv01 .2) that was used in the parse.",
        "After all of the sentences have been parsed in this way, the current system displays the text with colored highlighting over all error-containing sentences (different colors are used for different classes of error, again as identified from the mal-rules which were used).",
        "In addition, a color-coded menu appears which names the errors and associates them with the colors from the highlighted display.",
        "At this point the user may investigate the individual errors further.",

        "We are currently developing a computational model that captures the way that English is acquired (as a second language) and gives us a framework upon which to project a student's \"location\" in that process.",
        "There is considerable linguistic evidence that the acquisition order of English features for second-language learners is relatively consistent and fixed regardless of the first language (Ingram, 1989), (Du-lay and Burt, 1974), (Bailey, Madden, and Krashen, 1974).",
        "In addition to studies concentrating on second language acquisition, research in language assessment and educational grade expectations (e.g., (Berent, 1988), (Lee, 1974), (Crystal, 1982)) also suggests that language features are acquired in a relatively fixed order.",
        "This research outlines sets of syntactic constructions (language features) that students are generally expected to master by a certain point in their study of the language.",

        "Within each hierarchy, the intention",

        "This is intended to capture sets of features which are acquired at approximately the same time.",

        "While a learner is acquiring these features, we do not expect to see any relative clauses which are beyond that level of acquisition.",
        "We anticipate that SLALOM, when fully developed, will initially outline the typical steps in acquiring English as a second language.",
