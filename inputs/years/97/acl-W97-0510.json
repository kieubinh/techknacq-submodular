        "We describe here the EREL system, a therapeutic software devoted to the Education, Rehabilitation and Evaluation of Language devoted to children suffering from language (and then communication) disorders, and especially devoted to \"autistic-like\" children.",
        "In addition to their difficulties to express themselves verbally, many of these children suffer also from cognitive and/or motor disorders which make graphic or written expression difficult, and often make these persons keep socially apart (Ornitz, 1974) (Maurer and Damasio, 1982).",
        "But, given a motivating context, an individualised surrounding environment and materials, some of these children may be able to exteriorise capacities which had hitherto remained mute.",
        "For more than ten years, a large amount of research has been carried out in the field of communication rehabilitation for handicapped persons, and technical aids known as \"communication aids\" have now been developed with some success.",
        "They can use \"communication bords containing words (whose quantity, i.e. vocabulary, depends on the capacities of the user), graphic representations (pictures and photos, hierarchies of pictures, e.g. TEACCH program widely used in USA), written communication, synthetic voices.",
        "They aim to compensate the loss of communication for people without the use of speech.",
        "The use of computers as an intermediary has been seen as a natural extension of the use of classical communication aids; it may enable to bypass the different handicaps temporarily at least, and to compensate for the problems with language and motricity (Gaxoux et al.",
        ", 1989) (Howlin, 1989).",
        "The EREL system, described here, is an application of research in the domain of natural language processing and especially of the development of natural language interfaces, and has been designed in a collaboration with medical staffs (doctors, psychologists, etc.)",
        "specialised in the treatment of children suffering from developmental disorders (such as typical and atypical autism, or childhood psychosis) (Godbert, 1996).",
        "The system provides a set of educational play activities illustrated through multimedia technology and designed to stimulate and help users to employ common language to express themselves within a specific context.",
        "The development of EREL is based on the French ILLICO system, a generator for various natural language processing systems which provides a set of language processing tools using computational linguistic techniques making it possible to produce text in a \"guided mode\" (Pasero and Sabatier, 1994) (Pasero",
        "and Sabatier, 1997).",
        "We will show that this mode is of great relevance to communication aids for the disabled.",
        "In part 2, we describe the ILLICO system.",
        "In part 3, we mention the state of the art in the domain of communication aids for autistic children, and we show why ILLICO is relevant to the development of software devoted to the rehabilitation of persons suffering from language disorders.",
        "The functionality of EREL is described in part 4.",

        "The kernel of the ILLICO system carries out an interactive processing of natural language, based on partial synthesis, which checks the well-formedness of the produced sentences as the user goes on composing the sentences.",
        "This checking is simultaneously done at all the levels of well-formedness: the constraints defined at the different levels are corou-tined (i.e. taken into account in a \"parallel-like\" way), in an algorithm which runs either in parsing or in synthesis.",
        "Sentence composition using partial synthesis enables the system to offer the possibility to generate sentences in a \"guided mode\".",
        "In this mode, the user is guided while he produces text: at each step of the composition of a sentence, the system synthesises and displays the words and expressions that can be used to continue the sentence and that will lead to a well-formed sentence.",
        "The guided composition mode enables the development of user-friendly interfaces in which errors on the domain of the application never occur, and in which non-expected (i.e. incorrect) expressions are never used (Pasero and Sabatier, 1997) (Pasero and Sabatier, 1994) (Mil-haud, 1994) (Godbert et a!., 1993)."

      "text": [
        "We have carried out a survey in the field of currently available communication aids for autistic persons, to try to determine the qualities and shortcomings of these systems.",
        "In fact, the international state of the art in this domain is rather poor.",
        "We can mention \"Speaking Dynamically\", \"Boardmaker\" (Mayer-Johnson, USA) as well as \"Talk:About\" (Don Johnston, USA).",
        "These systems use boards and picture communication symbols to compose picture sentences, some of them use a set of predefined sentences.",
        "We must also mention the \"Facilitated Communication\" method, which aims to help the user to use a keyboard of a computer to express himself by words and sentences.",
        "But Facilitated Communication is devoted to persons who are physically unable to communicate, but do not have a difficulty with communication at the cognitive level.",
        "We must also note that ordinary computer assisted language learning systems can seldom be used by autistic persons for they require intuitive cognitive knowledge which is often lacking in autistic persons.",
        "Why is ILLICO relevant to the development of a language rehabilitation software ?",
        "First of all, we think that the two characteristics of ILLICO described in part 2 are big assets for the development of a language rehabilitation software:",
        "• In the guided mode, the user is led step by step during the construction of each sentence.",
        "This allows him to compose rapidly, with minimal cognitive load, sentences which are always correct at each level; this ensures also that the system never jams, i.e always \"understand\" what the user says.",
        "So the user doesn't become discouraged by fruitless attemps.",
        "The guided mode allows to begin rehabilitation as soon as possible, even for very young or seriously disabled children.",
        "• The modularity of ILLICO is also a great asset, because it makes it easy to define various exercises about language with different levels of difficulty: by using linguistic modules (lexicon and grammar) with broad or restricted coverage, by allowing or not the guided mode, we obtain a lot of different exercises, among which one can choose the one which is suitable for each user's capacities.",
        "• Moreover, the ILLICO system, through the modularity of its knowledge bases (defined at every level of well-formedness), makes it possible to propose different steps in the language acquisition or rehabilitation process:",
        "- a lexical step which proposes exercises that allow acquisition of words and expressions of language in agreement with the subjects proposed; - a syntactical step which allows the acquisition of grammar rules by controlling the syntactic correctness of sentences; - a conceptual step which allows the user to acquire common sense rules by controlling the semantic correctness of sentences; - a contextual step which makes it possible for the user to learn how to link sentences with the \"real\" world; at this step, the system verifies that the sentences make reference to objects actually present in the world; this arises in particular when using pronominal references or definite descriptions.",
        "From the survey we have made of the existing software in AAC, we are convinced that the sound techniques from artificial intelligence and computational linguistics provided by the ILLICO system are very interesting and innovative in the field of communication aids for autistic persons: in the elaboration of our language rehabilitation software described below, our method has consisted in adapting existing technical solutions (graphic interfaces, etc.)",
        "to the needs of autistic users, by integrating ILLICO's technology.",
        "We believe that the language systematic interactions (between lexicon, syntax and semantics) carried out by ILLICO are crucial for the treatment of language and cognitive disorders, i.e. can help users to improve their language and cognitive skills.",

        "Here are some examples of sentences corresponding to different levels of difficulty: - Permute the grey circle with the black triangle.",

        "Concerning linguistic forms, the system proposes, for example, graduated ways to designate objects: - At the simplest level, an object is necessarily designated by its shape and its color (the black circle) and plurals are not allowed.",
        "- At higher levels of difficulty, the use of relative clauses is allowed and an object can be designated by its position (the circle which is in the square A3); plurals (the circles) and the generic word pawn are also allowed.",
        "- Finally, the use of pronouns (in particular, clitic pronouns like in put them in the square A3) makes it possible to designate objects referentially.",
        "Concerning space locating, several levels are also possible to point out a square or a position.",
        "- A first level proposes to point out a square simply by clicking on it; then, the system completes the sentence of the user with a noun phrase corresponding to the expression of the position designated that way.",

        "In order to compute lower levels of grammars, some rules of this grammar can be dynamically switched off according to the value of a global variable coding the level chosen by the user.",
        "A lexicon and a set of semantic composition rules have been developed and are used in the same way.",
        "The conceptual model describes the world of the application in terms of domains of objects and possible relations between them.",
        "In order to take into account spatial expressions like above the square B4 or at the left of the pawn which..., we have specified which objects can be categorised as a plate and which ones cannot.",
        "Following (LePesant, 1996), we think that not all the words which can appear in spatial expressions are places, but only some of them like square, stock.",
        "This allows us to distinguish between the correct spatial expression in the stock and the incorrect (according to our application) one *in the triangle.",
        "In order to describe the conceptual features of correct expressions like above the triangle, we consider this sort of prepositions as functions which, applied to an object which is not a place, give a place as result: thus, the expression above the triangle can be used with a verb like put which requires a place as a complement (put the grey circle above the triangle).",
        "Some forms need a more elaborated semantic processing and, in particular, definite descriptions like the black circle, the pawn which is at the left of the square which contains the black triangle.",
        "Following (Russel, 1905) and (Strawson, 1950), we consider that a definite description refers to one and only one object in the context.",
        "In the type of applications described here, the object so designated must be identified by the system in order to act on it and the consequences of the action upon the object must be taken into account in the representation of this object in the context.",
        "All these operations are made by the contextual module.",
        "Moreover, as we exposed in (Mouret and Rolbert, 1996), the treatment of definite descriptions when used in the guided mode, introduces particular constraints: because the system must propose correct sentences only (and beginning of correct sentences only), it has to know as early as possible (and actually in advance) which definite descriptions are correct according to a particular context.",
        "These constraints require the system to apply specific processes to the context in order to know which objects can be designated by a definite description and which cannot: if there is no such objects in the context, then no definite description can be produced.",
        "If such objects exist in the context, the system can produce definite descriptions which must agree with the description of these objects.",
