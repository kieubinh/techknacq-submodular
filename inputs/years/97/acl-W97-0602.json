        "We present a generic template for spoken dialogue systems integrating speech recognition and synthesis with 'higher-level' natural language dialogue modelling components.",

        "Our research aim in developing this generic template is to investigate a new approach to the evaluation of Dialogue Management Systems.",
        "Rather than attempting to measure accuracy/speed of output, we propose principles for the evaluation of the underlying theoretical linguistic model of Dialogue Management in a given system, in terms of how well it fits our generic template for Dialogue Management Systems.",
        "This is a measure of `genericness' or 'applicationindependence' of a given system, which can be used to moderate accuracy/speed scores in comparisons of very unlike DMSs serving different domains.",

        "There are two approaches to evaluating a dialogue management system: to use a qualitative or a quantitative measure.",
        "A qualitative evaluation would rely on the user's opinion of the system.",
        "Dybkjaer et al. (1995) conducted interviews after each session and asked whether the dialogue seemed natural and pleasant.",
        "Such a subjective evaluation is fraught with problems.",
        "For example, the user may learn after the first attempt how to address the system and which words to use or avoid.",
        "Subsequent evaluations of the same system may then vary even though the system has not changed.",
        "Some users may find the system difficult to use whilst other will find it effortless.",
        "\"Pleasantness\" differs from person to person, too.",
        "As Vilnat (1996) argues, there is no clear consensus of what comprises a good dialogue.",
        "When asking the user, the designer has to make sure that the user is representative of the end user in terms of background and frequency of use.",
        "Because of these problems, many researchers have tried to provide a",
        "means of objectively evaluating a system.",
        "The two methodologies for quantitative evaluation, black and glass box, are concerned with input and output behaviour and the behaviour of each of the components in the system, respectively.",
        "Glass box evaluation can rely on a comparison between the output of a component and a retrospective reference.",
        "By directly comparing the two it is possible to measure the accuracy of that component.",
        "The black box approach, on the other hand, cannot use this method to evaluate a dialogue since there is no \"correct\" dialogue to compare it with.",
        "Despite this, objective evaluation of the dialogue is necessary in order to compare the performance of different systems.",
        "Initial efforts have been made to standardise this (for example in EAGLES, see Fraser 1995a) but remain work in progress."

        "Speech And Language Technology researchers are used to thinking of evaluation in terms of speed and accuracy of system outputs, for example 'success rate' of a speech recogniser or syntactic parser in analysing a standard test corpus.",
        "However, 'Dialogue Management' is a high-level linguistic concept which cannot be measured so straightforwardly for several reasons: - existing DMSs are very domain-specific, and we need to compare dialogue systems across domains; so it makes no sense to look for a common standard 'test corpus'; - the boundary between 'good' and 'bad' dialogue is very ill-defined, so it makes little sense to try to assess against a target 'correct output', or even by subjective assessment of 'pleasantness' of output; - the structure of dialogue (and hence a DMS) is complex, multi-level, and non-algorithmic, making a single overall 'evaluation metric' meaningless without consideration of component behaviours; - we need to evaluate the integrated system holistically, as opposed to measuring speed or accuracy of individual components; - alternative dialogue systems use a wide range of alternative component technologies; only by fitting these against a generic template can we discriminate between superficial and substantive differences in component assumptions and functionalities.",
        "There is a useful analogy with evaluation of NL parsers; typically, rival parsers are compared by measuring speed (sentences-per-minute) and/or accuracy (e.g. percentage of sentences parsed) - e.g. (Sutcliffe et al. 1996).",
        "However, rival parsing schemes include varying 'levels' of syntactic information, as shown in EAGLES recommendations (Leech et al. 1995).",
        "Atwell (1996) proposes an orthogonal evaluation of parsing schemes against the generic EAGLES 'template' of syntactic levels, so that a given parser speed/accuracy measure should be moderated by a `genericness' weight; for example, the EN-GCG parser (Voutilainen and Jarvinen 1996) is very fast and accurate BUT its underlying parsing scheme instantiates only a small subset of the EAGLES 'template', which moderates an overall 'score'.",
        "In much the same way, we propose that very unlike rival DMSs can be meaningfully compared by assessing how well they match our generic template for dialogue management architecture, and using this `genericness' score to temper any measures of speed, accuracy, naturalness, etc.",
        "Consider (Churcher et al. 1997), which included a first attempt at an outline of a generic spoken language system.",
        "The model includes generic modules for syntactic, semantic, and speech act constraints; these constraints are integrated into spoken input interpretation to compensate for limitations in speech recognition components.",
        "The model constitutes a template tool for designing integrated systems; it specifies the standard components and how they fit",
        "together.",
        "As is the predicament of any generic system it is necessarily vague and since it attempts to combine components found in a variety of individual models, it may not fit all systems, if any in particular.",
        "In our survey, we studied how this generic model mapped onto a range of existing real systems, by looking at the representation formats for the various linguistic features in the dialogue management schemes; as with grammatical analysis schemes, there is a need for a theory-neutral `interlingua' standard dialogue representation scheme (Atwell 1996)."
