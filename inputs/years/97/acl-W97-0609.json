        "Traditionally, the most important input to the dialogue management component of a natural language system are semantic representations (e.g., formulae of first-order predicate calculus).",
        "Only recently, other kinds of information (e.g., phonetic transcriptions of unknown words) has been used.",
        "There is, however, room for the utilization of additional knowledge sources.",
        "In what follows, we first explicate how information from the accoustic level (e.g., the presence of certain kinds of background noise from a radio) enables better system performance.",
        "Our argumentation is that this is possible since the dialogue manager can use acoustic clues, on the one hand, to establish better recognition conditions, and on the other hand to generate more cooperative interactions.",
        "After this argumentation, we indicate how the acoustic cues for dialogue management components can be generated."

        "For spoken language input, this repertoire of information ensues interactions like the (unsuccessful) dialogue in Figure 1 (from a train timetable enquiry system).1 What happens in a dialogue like this is the following: The dialogue manager tries to verify a value that is needed for a database query.",
        "This attempt fails several times, since the incoming semantic representations are inconsistent due to recognition errors.",
        "After an arbitrary number of trials (two in the example), the dialogue manager surrenders.",
        "More advanced systems exploit additional information to generate more intelligent feedback for the user.",
        "The Verbmobil device which translates spoken utterances between German and English as well as between Japanese and English (see (Kay et al., 1994)), e.g. exploits representations of unknown words and information about phonetically similar words to generate clarification dialogues along the lines of Figure 2 (cf. (Maier et al., 1997)).",

        "Still missing even from the more sophisticated systems like Verbmobil is a flow of information all the way from the acoustic level up to the dialogue management component.2 This kind of coupling will enable more successful systems for two reasons: improved speech recognition and more informative responses to the user.",
        "Improvement in speech recognition will stem from the dialogue manager acting as a kind of mediator between the speech recognizer and the user.",
        "In case of bad recognition rates (speech recognizers already deliver confidence scores), the dialogue manager could ask for acoustic clues concerning the recognition conditions.",
        "If it then receives some clues about background noise (e.g., a radio), it might initiate a request to the user to establish a better acoustic environment.",
        "More specifically, the dialogue manager could generate the concepts to ask Could you please turn off the radio?",
        "The quality of responses to users equally well can profit from information about the acoustic environment.",
        "To see this, imagine a situation where a police officer reports from the scene of an accident: In this situation, the acoustic conditions presumably are so adverse that recognition accuracy is inacce-ptable.",
        "Unlike in the scenario above, however, little can be done to change the environment.",
        "The appropriate action of the dialogue manager thus would be to make it clear to the officer that he is wasting his time in trying to get his message through.",
        "Thus, with information on the acoustic conditions/environment, the dialogue in Figure 1 could become the one outlined in Figure 3.",

      "heading": "4 Techniques for Detecting Acoustic Clues",
      "text": [
        "Work on the acoustic level that is suited for integration into a dialogue framework like that depicted above has not advanced far enough, yet.",
        "Only recently, in the background of the DARPA evaluations for speech recognition systems, the importance of the type of noise tracking that is needed has been realized.",
        "A component that not only detects but also classifies noise (as, e.g., music or street noise) has a good chance of becoming the first plug-and-play spoken language interface entity (SLIE), and seems to be realizable by well-mastered techniques for speech recognition like Hidden Markov Models ((Rabiner, 1989)).",
        "One approach for classifying acoustic conditions into different categories (e.g. background music) would be to use techniques like the ones used for non-word based topic spotting (see (Nowell and Moore, 1995)).",
        "The different categories of noise would correspond to topics, and typical sections of acoustic material from each category would correspond to keywords.",
        "Based on samples from each category/topic, keywords which are most useful in identifying this topic would then be extracted automatically.",
        "An incoming signal could then be classified as belonging to one of the categories, depending on which keywords appear most frequently.",
        "Another approach is to build a simple Hidden Markov Model which gets trained for each category from the data in that category.",
        "An incoming signal could then be assigned to the category whose HMM gives the best match.",
        "Research is also needed in the realm of dialogue management.",
        "It remains to be investigated in exactly which ways the acoustic information can be used.",
        "Obvious requests or follow-up questions like those exampli-fied above are one option; more clever questions like Our communication may proceed more smoothly if the system adapts to your acoustic conditions; shall this be done?",
        "are another."
