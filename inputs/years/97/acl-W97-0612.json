        "A spoken dialogue system that can understand spontaneous speech needs to handle extensive range of speech in comparision with the read speech that has been studied so far.",
        "The spoken language has looser restriction of the grammar than the written language and has ambiguous phenomena such as interjections, ellipses, inversions, repairs, unknown words and so on.",
        "It must be noted that the recognition rate of the speech recognizer is limited by the trade-off between the looseness of linguistic constraints and recognition precision , and that the recognizer may output a sentence as recognition results which human would never say.",
        "Therefore, the interpreter that receives recognized sentences must cope not only with spontaneous sentences but also with illegal sentences having recognition errors.",
        "Some spoken language systems focus on robust matching to handle ungrammatical utterances and illegal sentences.",
        "The Template Matcher (TM) at the Stanford Research Institute (Jackson et al., 91) instantiates competing templates, each of which seeks to fill its slots with appropriate words and phrases from the utterance.",
        "The template with the highest score yields the semantic representation.",
        "Carnegie Mellon University's Phoenix (Ward and Young, 93) uses Recursive Transition Network formalism; word patterns correspond to semantic tokens, some of which appear as slots in frame structures.",
        "The system fills slots in different frames in parallel, using a form of dynamic programming beam search.",
        "The score for frame is the number of input words it accounts for.",
        "Recently many multi-modal systems, which combine speech with touch screen, have been developed.",
        "For example, Teil and Bellik developed the tool for drawing coloured geometric objects on a computer display using speech, tactile and a mouse (Teil and Bellik, 91).",
        "We also developed a multi-modal dialogue system based on the robust spoken dialogue system.",
        "In Section 2, we present an overview of our spoken dialogue system through multi-modalities.",
        "In Section 3, we describe the robust interpreter from errorful speech recognition results and illegal sentences, and in Section 4, we describe the cooperative response generator.",
        "In Section 5, we show the results of the evaluation experiments."

        "Input speech is analyzed by the following conditions",
        "The acoustic models consist of 113 syllable based HMMs, which have 5 states, 4 Gaussian densities and 4 discrete duration distributions.",
        "The speaker-independent HMMs were adapted to the test speaker using 20 utterances for the adaptation.",
        "The grammar used in our speech recognizer is represented by a context-free grammar which describes the syntactic and semantic information.",
        "Our recognizer integrates the acoustic process with linguistic process directly without the phrase or word lattice.",
        "We could say that this architecture is better for not only cooperatively read speech but spontaneous speech rather than hierarchical architectures interleaved with phrase lattice (Kai and Nakagawa, 95).",
        "Furthermore, the recognizer processes interjections and restarts based on an unknown word processing technique.",
        "The unknown word processing part uses HMM's likelihood scores for arbitrary syllable sequences.",
        "A context free grammar is made to be able to accept sentences with omitted postpositions and inversion of word in order to recognize spontaneous speech.",
        "We assume that the interjections and",
        "restarts occur at the phrase boundaries.",
        "Thus, our speech recognizer for read speech was improved to deal with spontaneous speech."
