        "During the last few years the recognition of spontaneous speech in telephone applications has greatly improved; nevertheless spoken dialogue between computers and inexperienced users still presents some problematic issues that reduce the user satisfaction in interacting with spoken language systems.",
        "The occurrence of errors in the acoustic decoding of users' utterance is the potential cause of miscommunication in oral interaction with spoken language systems.",
        "Some of these errors have important consequences in reducing the naturalness of human-machine dialogues.",
        "Sometimes a robust approach in parsing and the use of language models during recognition are not sufficient to avoid recognition breakdowns.",
        "The recognition performance has a direct impact on the requirements that the dialogue modules of spoken language systems have to meet.",
        "In order to increase the usability of the applications, dialogue management modules have to deal with partial or total breakdowns of the lower levels of analysis by preventing and detecting miscommunication sources.",
        "In this paper we identify some typologies of recognition errors that cannot be recovered during the syntactico-semantic analysis, but that may be effectively approached at the dialogue level.",
        "Our analysis and the methodologies we describe have been tested in a task-oriented telephone application, but we deem that some considerations may also be useful for other display-less human-machine communication applications.",
        "We will describe how non-understanding and the effects of misrecognition are dealt with in Dialogos, a real-time spoken language system that allows users to access a database of railway information by using the telephone.",
        "A detailed description of the different modules of Dialogos may be found in (Albesano et al., 1997).",
        "In this paper we will discuss the importance of supporting confirmation turns, and clarification and correction subdialogues.",
        "The dialogue module of Dialogos makes an extensive use of context knowledge: contextual information is used not only for validating or rejecting semantic interpretations, but it is also sent to the lower levels of input analysis for helping the recognizer.",
        "We will show that the positive effects of robust dialogue management and dialogue state dependent language modeling may be evaluated by taking into account both the recognition and understanding performance, and the success rate of dialogue transactions.",
        "From our experience we may conclude that if we provide robust behaviour in our dialogue systems, speech is a viable interface even with relatively low word accuracy rates.",
        "Nevertheless we believe that some important issues are still unexplored, and one of these is related to the weight that recognition errors have with respect to the degree of cooperativeness of the users.",
        "These open issues and some experimental data that emphasize their",
        "urgency will be discussed in the section on experimental data."

        "State-of-the-art systems that receive their input by high-quality microphone have word accuracy scores above 90%.",
        "However, the recognition of spontaneous speech in telephone environment is below that rate.",
        "Actually, the telephone input of the recognizer may greatly differ from the uttered acoustic signal, due to the noisy environment of the call, and to the quality of the telephone microphone and propagation network.",
        "Most current task-oriented applications of telephone human-machine dialogue are developed for being used by a large population of potential users.",
        "These applications require speaker independent real-time systems, and the opportunity of having training sessions with the system cannot be provided.",
        "The speaker independent recognizers designed for such applications assure the coverage of a great number of speakers, but some aspects of the speech modality of some users can induce the recognizer to make mistakes, especially in recognizing long sentences.",
        "The adverse recognition environment and the variability in user dependent features are the most frequent reasons of three kinds of recognition errors.",
        "The Speech community usually classifies these errors into deletions, insertions, and substitutions.",
        "Some of them may be prevented by using language models during the recognition.",
        "At present, some approaches to language modeling take advantage of contextual information sent by the dialogue model.",
        "However, the task of the dialogue state dependent language modeling is more difficult in some application domains.",
        "For example, some of the task-oriented systems that give information about railway timetable, or flight scheduling, have large vocabularies that contain an huge number of words belonging to the same class: for example, Dialogos vocabulary is 3,500 words, including 2,983 proper names of places; another example is the LIMSI Arise Railway Information system (Lamel et al., 1996) that has 1,500 words, including more than 680 station names.",
        "This peculiarity directly impacts on the performance of the language models, that is in these applications, language modeling predictions are weaker: when the dialogue prediction says that next user's utterance is likely to be about a departure place, this does not exclude that the recognizer substitutes the actually uttered name with a phonetically similar one.",
        "Only the user is able to detect such kinds of errors.",
        "In this situation the dialogue system should identify the user's detection of miscommunication and provide appropriate repairs.",
        "All the problems described above lead to the decrease of the recognition performance and of the usability of spoken language systems.",
        "More specifically, they identify some severe requirements that spoken dialogue modules have to meet.",
        "In particular, dialogue systems for telephone applications have to rely not only on an adequate model of the human user, but they should also implement particular techniques for preventing and recovering communication breakdowns."

        "For preventing recognition errors the dialogue system sends to the lower levels of analysis information about the domain objects focused during each turn of the interaction; this information allows the triggering of context dependent language models that help to constraint the lexical choices at",
        "the recognition level (see section 4).",
        "Moreover, in order to detect recognition or interpretation errors that occurred in previous turns, the dialogue system takes advantage from the global history of the interaction and it only accepts interpretations of user's input that are coherent with the dialogue history.",

        "In this initial dialogue context there were no parameters to be denied, and the dialogue module was able to discard this information related to the negative adverb.",
        "It addressed the user with the request of confirmation of T3 – S.",
        "T4 – U was a confirmation turn of the user.",
        "After having consulted the data in the railway database, the system realized that the number of connections between Milano and Roma in the evening was high, and it suggested the user to choose a more precise departure time (T5 – S).",
        "In T6 – U the utterance segment \"mah mi dica se c'e' qualcosa\" (who knows ... tell me if there is something) was misrecognized as \"mattino Ginosa\" (morning Ginosa, where \"Ginosa\" is the name of an Italian village).",
        "As a consequence, the parser output contains another value for the part-of-day parameter and a departure hour.",
        "However, the dialogue discarded the information about the part-of-day, since this conflicted with a parameter value that the user had already confirmed, and only the second part of the utterance interpretation was retained (that is, the departure hour).",
        "In this case the insertion of a concept due to misrecognition was repaired at the dialogue level 1 .",
        "As we can see from the example, the dialogue module makes use of confirmation turns because it deals with potentially incorrect information.",
        "However, the need for confirmations may result in a lack 'This version of Dialogos only considers the first best solution.",

        "On the contrary, in principle the user is able to detect and correct such errors, and often she does it immediately or in subsequent turns.",
        "In (Danieli, 1996) an analysis of such phenomena is offered, and the method described in that paper is currently implemented in Dialogos.",

        "In particular, the dialogue system is able to deal with non-understandings and misunderstandings (see (Hirst et al., 1994) for the classification of non-understanding, misunderstanding, and misconception), and it may recognize the occurrence of a miscommunication phenomena on the basis of the occurrence of two pragmatic counterparts, that is the deviation of the the user's behaviour from the system expectations, and the generation of a conversational implicature.",
        "Non-understanding is recognized by the dialogue system as soon as it happens, because the system is not able to find any interpretation of the current user turn.",
        "On the contrary, misunderstandings are more difficult to detect and solve, because usually the dialogue system may get an interpretation of the user's utterance, but that interpretation is not the one intended by the speaker.",
        "If the user's correction of a misunderstanding occurs when the parameter is focused (that is, it occurs as a third-turn repair, see (Schegloff, 1992)), the focusing mechanism and the dialogue expectations allow to grasp the correction immediately.",
        "However, it is more problematic to detect user's corrections if they happen some turns after the occurrence of the errors.",
        "The dialogue system initially interprets user's correction with respect to its current set of expectations.",

        "However, clarification subdialogues may be avoided if the dialogue expectations allow to choose an interpretation of ambiguous input.",
        "Clarification sub dialogues may also occur in case of parser outputs that contain inconsistent related information.",
        "Those may be so either because of recognition errors, or because of user's misconceptions.",

        "The conversation took place on Thursday February, 27th 1997: TI-S: What date do you travel?",
        "The dialogue system recognizes the misconception in T2 – U because the week day, the day, and the month are not interpretable with respect to its knowledge of the year's calendar (and the computer presumes that its calendar is correct).",
        "Moreover the dialogue system finds that different chunks of the information supplied by the user could be coherently interpretable.",

        "In the Dialogos corpus we observed that while subjects were usually able to correct errors in confirmation turns that concern a single information, or two semantically related information (such departure and arrival); on the contrary, some errors were not corrected when the feedback was offered together with a system initiative, or when the system asked to confirm information that had not strong relationships.",

        "In our task domain most of the recognition errors occur during the recognition of departure city and arrival city.",
        "When users are asked to repeat a city name that was misrecognized by the system, some of them modify their way of speaking: they repeat the name louder, or spelt it, or even accept a misrecognized name proposed by the system.",
        "In this corpus 15.1% of the dialogues failed for users' errors.",
        "Similar behaviour has been described in (Bernsen, Dybkjaer, and Dybkjaer, 1996).",
        "During the evaluation of the Dialogos corpus we classified the users' errors into two main classes:",
        "1. the user confirmed a task parameter value that derived from a misrecognition (76% of the users' errors) after having experienced several recognition errors; 2. the user accepted a task parameter derived from a word that was inserted by the recognizer and interpreted by the parser (24%).",
        "We applied the above classification in a different experimental set-up: in May 1996 a laboratory test was designed to study the reaction of users to different speech technologies and dialogue strategies applied to the railway information domain.",
        "48 naive subjects took part in the experiment: they were equally distributed by sex; the age range was from 18 to 62 years.",

        "Each of them played two different predetermined scenarios with each system; after the trial, they were interviewed (the discussion of this experiment may be found in (Billi, Castagneri, and Danieli, 1997)).",
        "By analyzing the 96 dialogues between Dialogos and the experimental subjects, we found that the occurrence of users' errors could be classified into the two classes described above, that is users' errors were always conComitant with substitutions or insertions in the best-decoded sequence.",
        "In particular, in both the experiments subjects reaction to recognition errors was characterized by an alteration in the way of speaking.",
        "In the interviews collected in the second experimented, the subjects that made errors expressed the fatigue in experimenting repetitive recognition errors.",
        "However, we hypothesize that the non-cooperative behaviour may be partially due to the artificial experimental conditions: we are planning to experiment the current version of Dialogos in a real environment with users that really need to take trains for travelling all around Italy, and that will use the system for having timetable information.",
        "While there are clearly many aspects in which our current approach requires further work, we may claim that speech is a viable interface if we provide spoken systems with robust dialogue management.",
        "We have shown that the use of contextual information in different system modules may reduce the recognition errors, and increase the usability of telephone human-computer dialogue."
