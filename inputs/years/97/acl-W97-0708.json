        "The information to include in a summary vanes depending on the author's intention and the use of the summary To create the best summaries, the appropriate goals of the extracting process should be set and a guide should be outlined that instructs the system how to meet the tasks The approach described in this report is intended to be a basic architecture to extract a set of concise sentences that are indicated or predicted by goals and contexts To evaluate a sentence, the sentence selection algorithm simply measures the informativeness of each sentence by comparing with the determined goals, and the algorithm extracts a set of the lughest scored sentences by repeat application of this comparison This approach is applied in the summary of newspaper articles The headlines are used as the goals Also the method to extract characteristic sentences by using property information of text is shown In this experiment in which Japanese news articles are summarized, the summaries consist of about 30% of the ongtnal text On average, thus method extracts 50% less text than the simple title-keyword method"

        "Summary requirements (such as length and content) vary widely, depending on form, subject, and situation of use For example, even several sentences may seem too long for news articles obtained from a network Similarly, as short as possible summaries will be desirable to preview sites in a web browser, when a huge number of results are retrieved from search engines To extract a short summa* for this land of purpose, an extract covering all topics in the text will be too long Using small number of sentences to extrapolate the contents of the entire text will be adequate for an efficient preview To include the intended points and characteristic information in a short summary, the mechanism to detect the purpose of the summary and select the sentences that match the goals is needed in the summarization process In this report, an algorithm that helps realize such a goal and context information oriented summarization system is described The algorithm evaluates the informativeness of each sentence in a text and selects a small number of sentences, including effective information One of the applications of this algorithm is shown in the experiment on the sentence extraction from the newspaper articles and market surveys The experimental system uses headlines and titles as the goals of the sentence selection, and the results are shorter and more effective than the simple title-keyword method (Pane, 90) The results of the current simple experiment are based on the word matching that as the goal processing However, the experiments should include processing of the following structural goals, the concept level matching that uses the thesaurus, and the topic detection from the text"
