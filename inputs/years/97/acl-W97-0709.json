        "Retrieving a most significant paragraph in a newspaper article can act as a kind of summarization It can give the human reader some hints on the contents of the article and help him to decide whether it deserves a full reading or not It may also act as a filter for a robust natural language understanding system, to extract relevant information from that paragraph in order to enable conceptual information retrieval Taking a newspaper article and a base corpus, word co-occurrences with higher resolving power are identified These co-occurrences are used to establish links between the paragraphs of the article The paragraph which presents the larger number of links to other paragraphs is considered a most significant one Though designed and tested for the Portuguese language, the statistical nature of our proposal should ensure its portability to other languages"

        "An idea borrowed from Information Retrieval, is that a term will be so more relevant in a document the more frequently it occurs in that document, and the less frequently it occurs in a base corpus Maarek (1992), following other authors, considers that using pairs of words as an indexing unit is more adequate to information retrieval than using single words Intuitively, it is plausible to admit that, for instance, the pair [file system] is far more informative than the words file and system taken in isolation Maarek aims at retrieving pairs of lexically related words In English, 98% of the lexical relations occur between words within a span of 5 words in a sentence, e, the window to consider when extracting words related to word w, should span from positmon w-5 to w+5 Maarek also defines the resolving power of a pair in a document d as"

        "As stated before, the method of Church and Hanks identifies pairs of lexically related words So, for instance, the pair [conselho seguranca] (security council), with an associated mutual infortniition of 5.3, can be considered as a potential indexing term, while the pair [para a] (to the), though 63 tunes more frequent in our corpus, having a mutual information of 0.7, can be excluded We have then a criterion for exclusion, that dispenses with the need for stop lists, and that aims at assuring the existence of a lexical relation between the words of the remaining pairs But not all pairs of lexically related words are good indexing terms of a document The pair should also meet the requirement of being relevant in the considered document The method of Maarek proposes a measure of the resolving power of each pair in the concerned document, thus enabling the selection, among all the potential indexing terms, of those that are relevant in each document For instance, [estados umdos] (united states) has a high mutual information (8 1) but it can be of little relevance in an article about the liberation of prisoners by the Serbs of Sarajevo (p=0 007) The experiments carried out point to a threshold of the resolving power around 001 We consider as relevant in a document only the pairs with a resolving power above this threshold When the same par occurs in different paragraphs of the same document, links can be established between those paragraphs At this point, we only consider pairs that were not excluded in previous steps (mutual information 3 and resolving power 001) Though, each link is not limited to pairs of words In fact, the wider the link, the higher its relevance After processing a document, we often get overlapping pairs For instance, in an article where the expression dos fres antzgos behgerantes (of the three former contenders) is used repeatedly, the following pairs were retrieved [tres behgerantes] [anhgos behgerantes] [dos behgerantes]l By observing the overlap of these pairs in the very document, a single link can be retrieved, in the farm of the tuple [dos tras anhgos behgeran- tes] Adapting the method of Salton and Allan, we can formulate the hypothesis that the paragraph with the larger number of links to other paragraphs would be of central importance in the document In summary, the steps of the proposed method are \"in a base corpus, compute the frequency of each word and the frequency of each co-occurrence, considering a window spanning from position w-5 to w+5, •to each document compute, similarly, the frequency of each word and.each co-occurrence,",
        "• exclude, from the co-occurrences identified in the document, those presenting a mutual information or a resolving power under the defined thresholds (gx,y) < 3 or p < 0 01),",
        "•take the selected pairs and group the overlapping ones, the resulting tuples (pairs and groups of pairs) occurring repeatedly in different paragraphs establish links between those paragraphs, • hypothetically, the paragraph presenting a larger number of links to other paragraphs will be of central importance in the document It should be noted that this proposal, compared to Salton and Allan's, has the advantages (at least m theory) of avoiding the use, always arbitrary, of stop hsts2, and of basing the calculations exclusively on the tuples that are relevant in the document, instead of using the heavy vectors containing all the terms of each paragraph We don't have, so far, enough data to make any claim about the comparative quality of the links paws Was anbgos] [dos antigos], though considered relevant, didn't score enough mutual information to be selected 2 the relevance of a word depends on the context, so, we prefer not to a pnon exclude any word, by sending it to a stop list In fact, some of the tuples we retrieved as relevant include words that would otherwise be part of such a list An example is the pair [ago armadas] (nonaligned) where the word nao (not) though quite significant in context, would be excluded via stop list"
