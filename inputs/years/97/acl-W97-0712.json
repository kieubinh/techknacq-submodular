        "The goal of the research reported here has been to develop a flexible, easily-portable and scalable, but also efficient and robust, NLP system that automatically generates summaries of real-world tin-restricted texts To this effect, an architecture was designed for a hybrid COnnectionist – SYinbolic MAchme for Text Summarisation (henceforth, COSY-MATS) (Aretoulala, 1996) A major concern in designing COSY-MATS has been to identify content selection features that are generic and application-independent (Section 2) The features should be applicable to any text, irrespective of domain or text type This is so that COSY-MATS is readily portable to different operation environments with a minimum amount of customisation The isolation of such features would provide a permanent infrastructure for both content selection and analysis The front-end text analysis modules can be developed so that they are geared towards the summarisation task, rather than text understanding in general, which is computationally-intensive Thus, these modules need only perform an analysis that is sufficient for the evaluation of the selected content selection features The establishment of universal importance determination criteria means that the permanent set of analysis, interpretation, content selection and generation processors can be extended with application-specific modules during the porting of COSY-MATS This is also what renders COSY-MATS a type of summarisation shell Significantly, the computations of the supplementary modules will already be accommodated for in the standard flow of processing of the system by virtue of• these features (Section 3) Admittedly, the identification of content selection features of general applicability is a very difficult task This is demonstrated in the limitations of the two main trends in current summarisation research (cf (Aretoulaki, 1996)) There are Information Extraction (in) environments, which perform a superficial and partial analysis of the input text based on the progression of keywords and application-specific phrasal patterns therein, e g (ET, 1994, Jacobs and Rau, 1990, Luhn, 1958, M1JC-5, 1993, Peace, 1981, Patce, 1990, Salton et , 1994) The problem with in systems is that, although they can be used very efficiently on any type of text, they are domain-dependent and likely to produce inaccurate output This is due to their excessive reliance on specialised content words There are also systems which are based on Natural Language Understanding (Nut) methods involving deeper pro-cessmg Apart from syntactic and Iexico-semantic analysis, the hierarchical rhetorical organisation of the source text can also be taken into account, as can certain aspects of the context of the discourse, e g (Garigliano et al., 1093, Lehnert, 1981, Mitkov et al., 1994) Such more sophisticated types of system, however, are prohibitively slow as a result of the extensive processing involved They are also very fragile, because the high-level knowledge employed is usually hand-coded and hence arbitrary and incomplete Even when this knowledge has been acquired automatically, e g (Maybury, 1993, Soderland and Lehnert, 1994), it is application-dependent Consequently, despite their occasional",
        "domain-independence (e g (Endres-Niggemeyer and Neugebauer, 1996, Ono et al. , 1994, Rau et at, 1993, Sharp, 1991)), NLU approaches are – on the whole – specialised in a particular text-type For the design of COSY-MATS, a holistic and unifying approach has been adopted that involves both extrahnguistic, mV-type, analysis and selective statistics-based linguistic processing reminiscent of IE, in coordination Similarly to NLU, analysis in COSY-MATS is sufficiently deep for the semantic, rhetorical and contextual aspects of the input text to be considered in content selection In contrast to what the case is with such systems, however, the computation of these diverse aspects of the text is efficient This is because objective cues on the surface of the text are also exploited in COSY-MATS, echoing the TB approach Nevertheless, unlike IE, these cues are function words And gin.enc content words which point towards the high-level functions of the respective textual units in the context of the discourse, while at the same time being domain-independent Thus, apart from identifying universal content selection criteria that should render COSY-MATS portable and scalable, the research reported here has also attempted to establish mappings between the concrete and the more abstract criteria in the devised feature scheme, so that the system is also intelligent and practical, i e so that the evaluation of these abstract criteria is fully automated (Section 2)"

        "In order to identify generic content selection features that can be used by COSY-MATS in any application context, an extensive corpus analysis was carried out on a variety of real-world texts Three main types of text have been analysed newspaper articles, scientific papers and (scientific) author abstracts The subcorpus of newspaper articles (160) is extremely diverse in both its content and form The topics range from business news and legal reports to social commentary, medical issues and politics Similarly, the other two subcorpora consist of 170 articles and abstracts, respectively, that pertain to scientific fields such as computer science, the natural sciences, as well as philosophy and linguistics In addition, the texts are of varying length from half a page in the case of the abstracts and most news agency reports, to four or more pages, when scientific papers and newspaper special reports are involved Consequently, apart from covering a range of subject domains, the corpus used in designing the content selection processes in COSY-MATS also represents more than two text types The corpus was analysed both on the surface and on more abstract levels Gwen the diversity of the types of text and the writing styles exhibited in the corpus, regularities regarding the rhetorical development of the texts and the central informational units therein could not be easily established Only in the case of the scientific papers and their abstracts could any statements be made on the logical progression of the presentation of the content, from the purpose of the research, to the methodology, the experimental set-up and the evaluation of any results (cf (Gop-mit, 1972, Jordan 1993, Lucas et at, 1993, Maizell et , 1971)) The newspaper articles were mainly studied in terms of groups of adjacent sentences and the rhetorical relationship between them (cf (Ono et at, 1994)) No generalisations could be made re-gardmg their top-level organisation A number of theories of pragmatics, discourse analysis and text development have provided useful concepts for this study of the corpus at a higher level",

        "The intermediary features (Fig 2) represent rhetorical semantic criteria often employed in the processing of focus information and in anaphor disambiguation For example, Topscalisation, Focus Change, Canlanality and Ellspsas have all been used in computational contexts such as (Hobbs, 1978, Re-ichman, 1985, Sidner, 1983, Webber, 1983) Finally, the surface features (Fig 3) coincide mostly with explicit cues in the text which denote cohesive and coherence relations among sentences (cf (Luhn, 1958, Paice, 1981)) The Function Word and the Common Content Word Pools, for instance consist of lexical items with a semantic/rhetorical load extensively discussed in a Systemic-Functional (Coulthard, 1994) and Problem-Solution context (Jordan, 1984, Jordan, 1995) Consequently, by using features such as these in COSY-MATS, all three levels of language – from the low-level surface to the high-level pragmatic – can be collectively considered in order to 'holistically' determine the Importance of individual propositions in a text Apart from this grouping of the features into different levels, the surface and the intermediary features proposed in this scheme have also been used to objectify the abstract pragmatic features This was in order to facilitate the automatic evaluation of the latter during the actual operation of the fully-developed COSY-MATS (d Section 3) To this effect, a number of mterlevel mappings were identified both between the pragmatic and the lower levels, and between the intermediary and the surface levels These mappings were compiled in a manual which was used by 5 subjects in encoding texts from this corpus (Aretoulaki, 1996) The encoded texts were then employed for the empirical testing of a prototype of the content selection module, reported in Section 4 EXample mappings are given below • The pragmatic feature Repetition is correlated to the surface features Personal and Possessive Pronouns and Demonstratives (Sidner, 1983) It 19 also associated with the intermediary Focus Change (Muer, 1983, Webber, 1983) and El-(Hovy, 1987) This is because the central topics in a text are often resumed by means of anaphora, both in the same sentence and later on in other important sentences",

        "features that provide the input for a cascade of low and higher-level Artificial Neural Networks (alms), each responsible for specific subtasks The low-level ANNS map linguistic features (surface and intermediary) into extrahnguistic features (intermediary and pragmatic) The pragmatic features provide the input to the highest-level content selection arm that ultimately determines the relative degree of importance of each sentence This latter ANN Is also the only component of COSY-MATS that has been implemented to date Finally, the sentences selected as important during the content selection phase will be used as the basis for generating either a comprehensive summary or a more concise abstract (Aretoulaki, 1996) This processing will take place in another cluster of symbolic processors, almost symmetric to that used for text analysis and interpretation It is here that the planning and the actual synthesis of the summary/abstract will be realised However, it is important to note that the output list of the best-scoring sentences produced by the content selection ANN can also be used to provide a draft summary, i.e a concatenation of already-existing sentences instead of an original text (cf (Kupiec et",
        "al 1995)) This is also the only type of generation that is currently preoccupying this research (cf Section 4 1) Despite the dominance of the generic modules therein, COSY-MATS does provide for the incorporation of application-specific information First of all, the architecture is highly modular, so that new specialised processors can be – in principle – simply plugged in The simplicity of the interface between the various modules means that new modules that are either symbolic or connectionist can equally well be accommodated For example, in addition to the existing lower-level ANNS, other ANNS can be easily incorporated which have been trained to recognise specific keywords and structural phrases that differentiate one domain or text type from the other in expressing the same rhetorical and pragmatic functions Hence, COSY-MATS can function as a shell for the building of speciahsed summarisers As regards the front-end symbolic analysers, the processing that Will take place therein will be dictated by the type of data that needs to be computed in the ANNs The latter computation, in turn, will be based on the identified generic and application-specific mappings across the three levels of description the pragmatic, the intermediary and the surface (Section 2) In addition, it is the implementation of the content selection ANN that will determine the eventual type and number of pragmatic features required for the whole process of summarisation (Section 4) As a result, a partial analysis and interpretation of the input text only need to be performed in COSY-MATS The common problem in mil-based systems of combinatorial explosion and inefficient computation in the search for a solution will thus be largely avoided At the same time, this pragmatism in the analysis and interpretation processes does not decrease the amount of deep processing (semantic, discourse and pragmatic) earned out in the system High-level processing is salient in the pragmatic features identified These are, nonetheless, 'grounded' by means of the generic lower-level features, as well as other surface and semantic characteristics of texts pertaining to the specific application of interest In summary, the proposed architecture is both modular and hybrid The complex task of content selection is systematically decomposed into much more manageable computations In addition, the strong points of both symbolic and connectionist processing are combined in a complementary Way (cf (Aretoidslo, 1996)) The symbolic analysers can.",
