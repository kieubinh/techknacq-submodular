        "In a manually built-up semantic net in which not the concept definitions automatically determine the position of the concepts in the net, but rather the links coded by the lexicographers, the formal properties of the encoded attributes and relations provide necessary but not sufficient conditions to support maintenance of internal consistency and avoidance of redundancy.",
        "According to our experience the potential of this methodology has not yet been fully exploited due to lack of understanding of applicable formal rules, or due to inflexibility of available software tools.",
        "Based on a more comprehensive inquiry performed on the lexical database WordNetTM 1.5, this paper presents a selection of pertinent checking rules and the results of their application to WordNet 1,5.",

        "When building large-scale lexical/semantic resources, subsequent - or better, simultaneous - validation of content is essential.",
        "Basic validation includes formal redundancy and consistency checks.",
        "Taking WordNet 1.5 as an example, we illustrate the development and application of such rules.",
        "The computational environment for this enquiry is TerminologyFramework, an object-oriented generic tool developed to represent and consistently maintain concept-oriented dictionaries of different types, including WordNet [Fischer et al., 1996].",
        "Into this system, the content of WordNet 1.5 was downloaded from the \"dietidata.",
        "*\"-files; some checks were performed during download as part of the operational semantics of our relation definitions, but most of the checks were simulated a-posteriori by database queries.",
        "The main aim of the enquiry is not to produce an error report on WordNet 1.5, but to develop a methodology of redundancy and consistency checks for reuse.",
        "Therefore, not only WordNet 1.5 has been checked, but our ideas have been developed and checked for validity and relevance using WordNet 1.5.",
        "Compared to the thesauri we had previously modeled and downloaded, WordNet 1.5 offers a richer set of semantic and lexical relations which give rise to new questions of redundancy or consistency (cf. [Fischer, 1993]).",
        "The more relations introduced into a manually built up net, the more dependencies are created which hold each other in check; once they are explicated, formulated as guidelines and implemented, they can be used to support internal consistency - a necessary, but not sufficient condition for the correctness of a semantic net.",
        "In the following - after having characterized in general the status of formal checks in semantic nets of the WordNet-type - we present and comment a series of constellations which shall give exemplary insight into the topic.",
        "How to read the pictures in this paper All pictures in this paper are snapshots from the screen, and clippings from a window of TerminologyFrarne-work's graphical browser [M6hr and Rostek, 1993].",
        "The original, and hence uncorrected WordNet 1.5 data is shown as a graph where a node may represent a concept (i.e. synset, named by its first synset-element) or occasionally a term, i.e. synset element linked to its concept by the designation relation which is shown by its inverse from the concept side and is thus labeled term.",
        "Terms are represented in TenninologyFramework as unique objects having the synset element word/phrase as their possibly homographic name, and a system-generated and maintained homograph counter number which is stored separated from the name string as another term attribute.",
        "A term node label is distinguished from a concept label by a lowercase prefix indicating the part of speech (hence N for noun concepts / n for noun terms, 17 for verb concepts / v for verb terms).",
        "A concept's label body takes its content from its first synset element which is also transformed on download into a term with this label",
        "body.",
        "We do not present examples from the adjectives and adverbs which are also contained in the database.",
        "2 Formal checks versus checks based on concept definitions We suggest that Woods and Schmolze [1992] implicitly also critize semantic nets of the WordNet-type when they characterize \"typical frame-based representation systems\" by stating that in these systems the semantics of manually linking concepts by is-a or a-kind-of relations is \"strictly operational - defined by how they work and what they cause to happen.\"",
        "Then they continue: \"There is no external criterion of correctness to which these decisions should adhere\" (p.135).",
        "We wonder what would be an external criterion of correctness even in a system of terminological logic, or is there a criterion which checks the adequacy of a manually supplied logic concept definition?",
        "In any case, we would call the criteria which are based on the reasoning of the system internal ones.",
        "However, in the framework of a KL-ONE-type system they can be necessary and sufficient - relying on a set of undefined concepts, axioms, and a logic calculus - while in a manually built-up thesaurus or semantic net of the WordNet-type only necessary conditions of correctness can be checked.",
        "Note that Woods and Schmolze [1992] assume that something \"happens\" when the lexicographer draws a semantic link; they do not criticize - as we do - that sometimes nothing happens or not enough happens which differentiates this type of link from some other, except that they have different labels.",
        "Then linking would be nothing but connecting nodes.",
        "Our aim is to dig out and apply rules which approximate the intended semantics of the links, or to populate the inventory of those checks which are based on formal properties of the used relations and attributes and their logical dependencies, thus constituting their operational semantics.",
        "They are not based - as in a terminological logic system - on an \"understanding\" of the individual concept definitions.",
        "Therefore we call them formal.",
        "WordNet concept definitions are given by glosses in natural language - not referring explicitly to the net itself, thus not making use of its disambiguated polysems.",
        "These glosses are attached to the concepts, but sometimes they are not available and sometimes they are intermixed with or replaced by usage examples.",
        "Checks may be conceived which are based on an understanding of these definitions whether the reader of the glosses is a human reader or a program, based on linguistics.",
        "However, sometimes the glosses are faulty and the link structure is correct, and sometimes the contrary is true; thus they could hold each other in check, as long as they are independent of each other.",
        "We continue these notes on formal versus content based checks at the end of this paper (see section 5) by presenting three examples, contrasting both types of checks when we already have explicated the formal ones we then can refer to."

        "To our knowledge, the WordNet lexicographers were not supported by dynamic checking on update, or by an easy-to-use database query language for batch-checking, nor by a graphical browser/editor for visual feedback.",
        "WordNet's database set-up program, the \"grinder\", obviously controls consistency, however we are not informed about this.",
        "According to TerminologyFramework's error report on download, the \"grinder\" did not faultlessly perform range-checking because it allowed a few semantic (synset-to-synset) pointers where they should be lexical ones (synset-element to synset-element), and in very few cases it missed that a synset-element should not be an antonym of itself (h-reflexivity of antonymy), and that a synset should not be a hyponym of itself (h-reflexivity, as an entailment of acyclycity of the generic relation).",
        "Beyond these few slips we found more interesting examples of errors or of redundancies which were not detected by chance, but by triggers (created by TerminologyFramework from the specification of the operational semantics of the relations) or mostly by queries to the database, guided by our methodological interest.",
        "A practical lesson is that the design of dictionary relations should be such that they are tractable by formal checking, and this is severely impeded if different relations are merged of which one has the checkable property p and another lacks it; the merged relation has then lost the checkable property p. Examples from WordNet 1.5 are meronymy (which is treated in this paper only by a short note) and antonymy.",
        "Another point we had to struggle with was WordNet's treatment of disjunctive hypernyms, especially when they are lexical gaps.",
        "The topic of implicit logical junctors in value sets of Word-Net's generic and meronymic relations was also treated by Bloksma of al., but the therapy they propose we could not get to like.",
        "This paper does not contain a complete list of checking rules for WordNet 1.5: Whenever we tried to evaluate a rule we got hints for another rule, and we have not yet taken into account all WordNet relations and attributes.",
        "Of course, there are important and less important relations, but note, if one takes only the important ones, or the most important relation, the generic relation, then formal checking in this type of semantic net is very limited.",
        "In any case, formal checking is only a kind of syntax checking, the next step after spelling checking, but 100 new pennies will make up an Euro.",
        "Some of our concrete diagnoses may be wrong, or fall short, or become obsolete by a new release, but the questions to be posed for this type of semantic net remain."
