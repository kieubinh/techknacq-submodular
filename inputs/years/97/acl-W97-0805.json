        "WORDNET is a thesaurus for the English language based on psycholinguistics principles and developed at the Princeton University by George Miller [Miller, 1990].",
        "It has been conceived as a computational resource, so improving some of the drawbacks of traditional dictionaries, such as the circularity of the definitions and the ambiguity of sense references.",
        "Lemmas (about 130, 000 for version 1.5) are organized in synonyms classes (about 100, 000 synsets).",
        "The more evident problem with WORDNET is that it is a lexical knowledge base for English, and so it is not usable for other languages.",
        "Here we present the efforts made in the development of the Italian version of WORDNET [Magnini and Strapparava, 1994; Magnini et al., 1994], a project started at IRsT about one year ago in the context of Ir.,Ex [Dehnonte et al., 1996) a more general project aiming at the realization of a computational dictionary for Italian'.",
        "A second problem with WORDNET is that it needs some important extensions to make it usable for effective parsing.",
        "In particular, parsing requires a powerful mechanism for lexical discrimination, in order to select the appropriate lexical readings for each word in the input sentence.",
        "In this paper we also explore the integration of \"selecttonal restractume , a traditional technique used for lexical discrimination, with Italian WORD NET.",
        "Selectional restrictions provide explicit semantic information that the verb supplies about its arguments [Jackendoff, 19901, and should be fully integrated into the verb's argument structure.",
        "Although selectional restrictions are different in different domains [Ba.sili et at., 1996] we are interested in finding common invariants across sublanguages.",
        "It is our intention to build a very general instrument that can be afterwards tuned to particular domains by identifying more specific uses.",
        "The main motivation is to have both a robust and a computational efficient natural language system.",
        "On one hand, robustness is emphasized because sentences that are syntactically correct, but which are not successfully analyzed in the specific application domain, can have a valid linguistic meaning.",
        "On the other hand, we are able to filter the sentence meanings on a linguistic basis.",
        "This phase discards the unplausible lectures pruning the search space by looking for compatibility semantic relations.",
        "This kind of discrimination can be realized with computationally effective algorithms by exploiting the lexical taxonomy of WORDNET, postponing more complex and expensive computations to the domanin specific analysis.",
        "The paper is structured as follow.",
        "Section 2 describes the Italian prototype of WORDNET; while section 3 shows how selectional restrictions has been added to verb senses.",
        "Section 4 shows how Italian WORDNET has been coupled with the parser, both for describing lexical senses and as a repository for selectional restrictions, Section 5 reports a number of experiments that has been performed to individuate the methodology design with the best trade-off between disambiguatiori rate and precision.",
        "Finally section 6 provides some conclusive remarks."

        "The Italian version of WORD NET is based on the assumption that a large part of the conceptual relations defined for English (about 72, 000 IsA relations and 5, 600 PART-OF relations) can be shared with Italian.",
        "WORDNET can be described as a lexical matrix with two dimensions: the lexical relations, which hold among words and so are language specific, and the conceptual relations, which hold among senses and that, at least in part, we consider independent from a particular lan",

        "The Italian version of WORDNET aims at the realization of a multilingual lexical matrix through the addition of a third dimension relative to the language.",
        "Figure 1 shows the three dimensions of the matrix; (a) words in a language, indicated by 34,1; (b) meanings, indicated by M,; (c) languages, indicated by Lk.",
        "From an abstract point of view, to develop the multilingual matrix it is necessary to remap the Italian lexical forms with corresponding meanings (M.), building the set of synsets for Italian (making explicit the values for the intersections 4).",
        "The result will be a complete redefinition of the lexical relations, while for the semantic relations, those originally defined for English will be used as much as possible.",
        "An implementation of the Multilingual lexical matrix has been realized which allows a complete integration with the English version and the availability of all the translations for the Italian lemmas.",
        "The architecture is easily extendable to other languages.",
        "The integration with the computational lexicon ILEX is under development: it will make the access to other levels of lexical information, such as morphological classes, syntactic categories and sub-categorization frames available.",
        "The Italian version of WORDNET, in December 1996, included about 10,000 lemmas (7,000 nouns, 700 verbs, 1,500 adjectives, 600 adverbs).",
        "Till now, data acquisition has been mostly manual, with the help of a graphical interface; however a basic goal of the project is the experimentation of techniques for the (serni)automatic acquisition of data.",
        "Algorithms for the resolution of the ambiguities in the coupling with the English WORD NET have been developed.",
        "Versions automatically created are then tested against manually acquired data, with the aim of incrementally improve the precision level.",
        "A final manual check is performed for all the data automatically acquired.",

        "A number of steps have been followed to add selectional restrictions to Italian WORD NET.",
        "First, Italian verb senses were extracted from a paper version of an Italian dictionary and checked against a corpus of genereric Italian texts.",
        "Each verb sense has been then coupled with one or more English WORD NET synsets2.",
        "This phase has been performed manually with the help of a graphical interface (see figure 2) that includes four integrated working tools: (i) a bilingual dictionary with more than 30, 000 lemmas; (ii) a graph that allows the visualization of the coupling with the English WoRDNET; (iii) the bilingual WORDNETi that behaves exactly like the English version with the additional possibility to browse the Italian semantic network; (iv) finally, the working cards allow the insertion, modification and check of the data for a synset.",
        "The result of this phase is the extension of the English WordNet with the Italian synsets.",
        "Figure 3 shows the correspondence between English and Italian synsets for the verb Scrivere (Write).",

        "Syntactic information are associated to single verbs, while semantic information are associated to the whole synset, i.e., semantic participants are shared among all the verbs belonging to the synset.",

        "The appropriate combination of synsets for an arguments' position has to be both enough general to preserve all the human readings, and enough restricted for discriminating among different senses of both verb and noun, Founding the appropriate selectional restrictions revealed itself difficult and time consuming.",

        "The parser used is a CYK chart parser embedded in the GEPPETTo environment [Ciravegna et al., 199], and coupled with a proper unification algorithm.",
        "GEPPETTO is based on a Typed Feature Logic [Carpenter, 1992] for the specification of linguistic data.",
        "The GEPPETTO environment allows to edit and debug grammars and lexica, linking linguistic data to a parser and/or a generator, integrating various form of KBs, and using specialized processors (e.g., morphological analyzers).",
        "In particular, we integrated the hierarchical structure of WORDNET as an external KB, while an IsA function uses the WORD NET hierarchy in order to check subsumption relationships between WORDNET synsets.",
        "The grammar is written adopting a HPSG-like style, and each rule is regarded as Typed Feature Structure (TFS).",
        "For the current experiment the grammar coverage is limited to very simple verbal sentences formed by a subject, a main verb together with its internal arguments and, possibly, an adjunct phrase.",

        "We excluded the possibility to capture these complex nominal phrases.",
        "Indeed, the object of the experiment is to disambiguate among WORDNET senses of both verbs and nouns on the basis of the lexical semantic restrictions for the arguments of the verb and the lexical semantic associated to the noun.",

        "The arguments to Is function may be a complex boolean combination of synsets (e.g., see selectional restrictions in figure 4), The parser controls the overall processing.",
        "Whenever it tries to build a (partially recognized) constituent it incrementally verifies the admissibility of the semantic part of such a constituent, using the WORD NET hierarchy.",
        "In particular, whenever a noun is associated with a verbal argument the Isa function is triggered to check whether the synset of the noun is subsumed by the selectional restriction of the corresponding verbal argument.",
        "Due to the large number of analyses, it is useful to discard unplausible constituents as soon as possible to cut the search space.",

        "The experiment has been carried out on 60 sentences with 1201 different lectures, and formed by using seven verbs (write, eat, smell, corrode, buy, receive, associate) coupled with fifty common nouns and two proper nouns.",
        "In the general experimental setting a sentence is given to the parser in a situation characterized by multiple lexical entries for each single word (one for each WORD NET sense).",
        "The analyses produced by the parser are compared with the set of interpretations given by a human.",
        "As far as nouns are concerned, a lexical entry includes all the senses found in Italian WORDNET, Some of the nouns used in the experiment are shown in figure 5.",
        "As for verbs, we started from the Italian WoaDNET senses and then we faced to the problem of individuating the proper selectional restrictions for each argumentsl position of the verb subcategorization frame as seen before.",
        "So we build a small number of lexical entries, by means of which we composed the sentences of the experiment.",
        "We experiment the two hypotheses on selectional restrictions presented in section 3, i.e., the one with general WORDNET frames and the other with more refined selectional restrictions.",
        "As an example, figure 6 shows the output of the parser for the sentence \"La regina scnsse iiia lettera a Gio-vanni\" (\"The queen wrote a letter to John\").",
        "As a con-venction, we decided to describe internal arguments with the symbol 7', while a 11' denotes a verbal adjunct.",
        "This sentence was selected because it produces an high number of lectures (40) among the test suite sentences.",
        "This is due to both the verb sense ambiguity (write has five senses) and to the noun ambiguities (queen has five senses, and letter two).",
        "Note that the parser excludes the sense Write-Publish since the indirect object must be introduced by the Italian prepositions \"se\" or \"per\" (in English \"on\" or \"for\"), while in this example we have the preposition \"a\" (\"to\").",
        "Let us first consider the results obtained in the second experimental setting, which best approximate the human judgment.",
        "Out of the eight interpretations accepted, two are implausible for a human reader.",
        "This caused by the contemporary presence of the sense Letter-Missive and of the proper noun John as, respectively, patient and beneficiary of the write verb sense.",
        "Note that, each of these senses are, per se, valid arguments since they satisfy the selectional restrictions.",
        "In the first experimental setting, the presence of weaker seledional restrictions (just Somebody, Something) yields more spurious readings.",
        "As a matter of fact, the more evident problem is that many times ar-gumental positions are not properly filled.",
        "For example, that \"a Queen-Regnant could Write-Music an Letter-triselve\" (i.e., a kind of correspondence) is one of the allowed readings.",

        "periment.",
        "They are preliminary since they have been obtained on a limited number of sentences (60).",

        "These results have to be interpreted considering that the focus of the experiment is on selectional restrictions, which of course is just one among the various kinds of information occurring during lexical discrimination.",
        "It is worth mentioning here, among the others, some crucial information sources: (i)",
        "world knowledge: e.g., it is very strange to Write an Article-Clause on a Newspaper-Periodic; (ii) aspec-tual properties of the verb: e.g., it is very difficult to interpret La regsna sta scrivendo un articolo snl gion ale (The queen as wrsting an article on the newspaper) with the Write-Publish sense, because publishing is a cul-minative process."
