        "On the basis of such examples, the system creates rules that translate text to semantic nets; then it generalizes these rules so that they can apply to a broad class of text instead of only the training articles.",
        "Finally, the generalized rules are used to scan large numbers of articles to extract the particular information targeted by the user.",

        "SRI developed a specification language called FAST-SPEC that automatically translates regular productions written by the developer into finite state machines (Appelt et al., 1995).",
