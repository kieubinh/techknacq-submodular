        "Each of these transducers adds syntactic information represented by reserved symbols (annotations), such as segment names, boundaries and tags for syntactic functions.",

        "Each step defines a syntactic construction using two major operations: segmentation and syntactic marking.",
        "Segmentation consists in bracketing and labeling adjacent elements belonging to a same partial construction (e.g. a nominal or a verbal phrase, or a more partial syntactic chain if necessary).",
        "Segmentation includes also the identification of clause boundaries.",
