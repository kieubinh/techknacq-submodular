        "Any natural language processing system treating anything beyond the most restricted domains is confronted with the problem of distinguishing between uses of polysemous words.",
        "The idea behind semantically tagging words is that sense markings added to words may be used by some automatic process in order to choose the proper senses of words in a given context.",
        "For example, the word hark would receive at least two possible semantic tags and these tags along with the tags of other words in the surrounding context would allow the process to distinguish between the senses the bark of a tree, and the bark of a dog.",
        "(See [Dagan and Itai, 1994; Gale et al., 1992a; Gale et a!, 1992b; Ng and Lee, 1996; Wilks, 1996; Yarowski, 1992; Yarowski, 1995] for recent work on word sense disambiguation).",
        "Semantic tagging is considered to be a much more difficult task than part-of-speech tagging.",
        "Despite this current thinking, we decided to perform an experiment to see how well words can be semantically disambiguated using techniques that have proven to be effective in part-of-speech tagging.",
        "We decided to use the 45 semantic tags available through the WordNet package.",
        "In this typology, the word bark has two a priori semantic tags: bark as a \" covering, natural covering, cover\" receives tag 20 (nouns denoting plants); and bark as \"noise, cry\" has tag 11 (nouns denoting natural events).",
        "This semantic tagset has two advantages: it is a reasonable size, so that statistical techniques that we are testing do not need an inordinate amount of training data; and secondly, a semantically tagged corpus is available that we can use for testing."

        "Despite this, the WordNet team has taken upon themselves to create a general semantic tagging scheme and to apply it on a large scale: every set of synonymous senses, synsets, are tagged with one of 45 tags as WordNet version 1.5'.",
        "In their schema, there are 3 tags for adjectives (relational adjectives, participial adjectives and all others), 1 tag for all adverbs, 26 tags for nouns (act, animal, man-made artifact, attributes, body parts, ..., substance, and time), and 15 tags for verbs (from grooming and dressing verbs, to verbs of weather).",

        "In our experiments, we used the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) tagging method described in [Cutting et al., 1992].",

        "Lexical probabilities would more accurately inform the tagger with the frequency with which a certain word receives a certain tag, but acquiring this frequency requires much greater amounts of tagged text than is necessary with the ambiguity class method.",
        "The HMM training and tagging programs in our experiment [Wilkens and Kupiec, 1995] are based on bigrams, i.e. only the immediate context of a word is taken into account.",

        "For instance, when stuck appears in the sentence my own parents stuck together the translation displayed after the user clicks on stuck is the one for the whole phrase stick together and not only for the word stick.",
        "Currently LocoLex is purely syntactic and cannot distinguish between the different meanings of a noun like bark.",
        "If, in addition to the current syntactic tags, we had access to the semantic tags provided by WordNet for this word (natural event and plants) and we were able to include this label in the online dictionary, this would improve the bilingual dictionary access of Locolex even further.",
        "Current bilingual dictionaries often include some semantic marking.",
