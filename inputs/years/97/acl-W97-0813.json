        "In the literature, semantic similarity is usually assessed with reference to a hierarchically structured thesaurus (e.g. WordNet, [Miller, 1990]).",
        "The goal of the paper is to investigate an alternative way of measuring semantic similarity, based on distributional evidence, and to show that this evidence can reliably be used to disambiguate words in context.",

        "Eventually, the sense supported by those patterns which are semantically closer to the context in question is selected as the most likely one (see, among others, [Dolan, 1994], [Resnik, 1995a, 1995b], [Agirre and Rigau, 19961, [Sanfilippo, 1997]).",

        "We suggest that, for accendere-pipa to be understood in the appropriate sense, namely aceendere_l as in ac-cendere_l-sigaretta 'light-cigarette', semantic proximity need be computed on different grounds.",
        "The relevant similarity wich links pipes and cigarettes in this specific context relates to their both being typically smoked objects, a fact which is orthogonal to their general semantic class and can be captured on a distributional basis: pipa and sigaretta are distributionally equivalent relative to the same verb sense, i.e. they both occur as typical objects of the verb fumare 'smoke'.",
        "Distributional equivalence correlates with semantic similarity under the assumption that nouns which bear the same syntactic relation to the same verb sense are part of a semantically coherent class.",
        "It turns out that, in examples such as accendere-pipa, distributionally-based semantic similarities can permit more appropriate sense assignments which are specifically tailored to the context to be disambiguated.",
        "Observe further that also similarities commonly captured on the basis of thesaural information, as in the case of radio and telewsione above, can in principle be inferred from distributional evidence through relevant contexts of use (e.g. spegnere-radio `switch_off-radio' and spegnere-telewsione `switch_offtv' in the example at hand).",
        "Summing up, we contend that thesaural relationships capture only some of the various dimensions of word sense analogy which appear to play a relevant role in the disambi-ugation of word co-occurrence patterns.",
        "In fact, while thesaural relationships are defined out of context once and for all, effective analogies are to be tailored to the specific contextual pattern to be disambiguated.",
