        "Although the general framework will support a variety of algorithms for automatic language identification, our implementation is based on Dunning's (1994) character ngram approach, which is conceptually quite simple and achieves good performance even given relatively small training sets (50K of training text is more than enough, and one can make do with as little as 1-2K), and even when the strings to be classified are quite short (e.g., 50 characters).",
        "Essentially, the method involves constructing a probabilistic model (or \"profile\") based on character ngrams for each language in the classification set, and then performing classification of an",
        "unknown string by selecting the model most likely to have generated that string.",
        "Although the model itself is quite simple, some subtle and not-so-subtle issues do arise in putting the algorithm into practice.",
        "First among these is the problem of matching the character set of the input text to the character set assumed by the language profiles – for example, Shift-JIS and EUC-Japan are frequently used to encode Japanese documents in the PC and Unix worlds, respectively.",
        "Documents currently found on the WWW are often insufficiently labeled to indicate the language of text or the encoding of the characters within the document.",
        "We believe that use of Unicode will become increasingly widespread, obviating this problem, although for the time being we avail ourselves of the reasonable tools available3 for identifying and converting among character sets.",
        "Second, sparse training data is a significant factor in ngram modeling, even at the level of character co-occurrences, since we consider character sequences up to 5 characters in length.",
        "We have experimented with simple add-k smoothing and, noting known problems with that method (Gale and Church, 1990), we have also experimented with Good-Turing smoothing (Good, 1953) – finding, to our surprise, that the simple \"add is only slightly less accurate.",
        "Table 2 shows the performance of the language identification algorithm when run on Dunning's (1994) English/Spanish test set, using language profiles for English and Spanish constructed from training sets of 50K characters each and varying the size of the ngrams and length of the test strings.",
        "This experiment used Good-Turing smoothing and also adopted a simplified approximation of conditional probabilities used by Dunning (personal communication) in his experiments.",
        "Each row of the table shows the language and length of the test strings, the ngram size, the number of test strings classified correctly and incorrectly, and the percentage correct.",
        "Third, in an environment where computation may more efficiently be done on the client side rather than the server side, the size of the language profiles becomes relevant, since computation cost must be traded off against communication cost for the data needed in order to perform the classification.",
        "Given that probabilities for low frequency items can be poorly estimated anyway, we have experimented with eliminating low-frequency items from the profile – e.g., treating singletons (ngrams appearing just once in the training data) as if they never appeared at all and using the smoothed-zero value for them instead, thus trading model size against classification accuracy.",
        "Again to our surprise, we",
        "have found that quite reasonable classification performance is sustained even when filtering out not only singletons but even ngrams that appear twice and even three times in the training set.",
        "(see Tables 3-5).",
        "Table 1 shows the dramatic size reduction that takes place as smaller window sizes are used in training the language models.",
        "In the current implementation plain text files are used for maximum portability of the resources.",
        "An application that uses a 5-gram model without filtering any of the training data would use a 220K model containing 13K observed ngrams, with an average accuracy of 98.68% for 100-500 character length strings.",
        "If the same application can function effectively with a marginally lower accuracy rate of 98.32%, then the same training data can be used to produce a profile a full order of magnitude smaller (a 23K profile containing only 1.6K ngrams), by using a trigram model and filtering out those trigrams whose observed frequency is less than 4.",
        "This 10X reduction in size for this particular resource could mean supporting 10 times as many languages with the same memory footprint or delivering the linguistic resource 10 times as fast for a client side computation.",
        "Finally, standardization of language labels must be addressed; this work follows the ISO standards for language and country codes for internationalization (ISO, 1988b; ISO, 1988a; Yergeau et al., 1997; Alvestrand, 1995)."

        "In disconnected or low bandwidth situations, the client must perform its own labeling.",
