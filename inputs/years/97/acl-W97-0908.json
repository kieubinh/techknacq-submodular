        "A broad-coverage multilingual NLP system such as the one currently being developed at Microsoft Research faces the challenge of parallel grammar development in multiple languages (currently English, French, Spanish, German, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean).",
        "This development is by nature a very complex and time-consuming task.",
        "In addition, the design of the overall NLP system has to be well suited to be readily portable to languages other than the one the development started with (English in our case).",
        "For these reasons, few groups have succeeded at the challenge of multilingual NLP.",
        "One approach to multilingual development is to rely on theoretical concepts such as Universal Grammar.",
        "The goal is to create a grammar that can easily be parameterized to handle many languages.",
        "Wu (1994) describes an effort aimed at accounting for word order variation, but his focus is on the demonstration of a theoretical concept.",
        "Kameyama (1988) describes ä prototype shared grammar for the syntax of simple nominal expressions for five languages, but the focus of the effort is only on the noun phrase, which makes the approach not applicable to a large-scale effort.",
        "Principle-based parsers are also designed with universal grammar in mind (Lin 1994), but have yet to demonstrate large-scale coverage in several languages.",
        "Other efforts have been presented in the literature, with a focus on generation (Bateman et al.",
        "1991.)",
        "An effort to port a grammar of English to French and Spanish is also underway at SRI (Rayner et al.",
        "1996.)",
        "The approach taken in the MSNLP project focused from the beginning on possibilities for grammar sharing between languages to facilitate grammar development and reduce the development time.",
        "We want to stress that our use of the term \"grammar sharing\" is not to be confused with \"code sharing.\" Grammar sharing, in our use of the term, simply means that the existing grammar for one language can be used totally or in part to serve as the development basis for a second language.",
        "In this paper we want to demonstrate that the jumpstart through grammar sharing considerably accelerated grammar development in French, Spanish, and German.",
        "We will present test and progress data from all languages to support our claim."

        "The English grammar that we used as our starting point, as well as the target-language grammars that were spawned from it, are sketch grammars.",
        "Sketch grammars use a computational dictionary typological languages, a mature English grammar was taken as the starting point for each of the other three grammars.",
        "In each case, through a combination of adding and deleting a modest number of grammar rules, and modifying the conditions on many others, a broad-coverage target grammar emerged.",
        "Tests indicate that this approach has been successful in achieving a high degree of coverage in a relatively short period of time.'",
        "In the Microsoft Natural Language Processing System (MSNLP), grammar sharing between English, French, Spanish, and German has been an important means for speeding up the development time for the latter grammars.",
        "containing part-of-speech, morphological, and subcategorization information to yield an initial syntactic analysis (the sketch).",
        "The rules used in sketch have no access to any semantic information that would allow the assignment of semantic structure such as case frames or thematic roles.",
        "Further analysis proceeds through a stage of reattachment of phrases using both semantic and syntactic information to produce the portrait, then to a first representation of some aspects of meaning, the logical form, and to word sense-disambiguation and higher representations of meaning.",
        "In this paper, however, we will restrict our attention to the sketch grammars.",
        "A bottom-up parallel parsing algorithm is applied to the sketch grammar rules, resulting in one or more analyses for each input string, and defaulting in cases (such as PP attachment) where semantic information is needed at a later stage of the processing (portrait) to give the correct result.",
        "Context-sensitive binary rules are used because they have been found necessary for the successful analysis of natural languages (Jensen et al.",
        "1993, pp.",
        "33-35; Jensen 1987, pp.",
        "65-86).2 Figure 1 gives a template for the rule formalism for a binary rule, in this case a rule that combines a verb phrase with a prepositional phrase to its right.",
        "Each sentence parse contains syntactic and functional role information.",
        "This information is carried through the system in the form of arbitrarily complex attribute-value pairs.",
        "The sketch always produces at least one constituent analysis, even for syntactically invalid input, and displays its analyses as parse trees.",
        "1-11TED parses are obtained when an input string cannot be parsed up to a sentence node (possibly because it is a noun phrase, a sentence fragment, or otherwise deficient).",
        "FITTED parses contain as much constituent structure as the grammar could assign to the input string.",
        "Two types of trees are available (Figure 2).",
        "One strictly follows the derivational history of the parse, and is therefore binary-branching.",
        "In the binary tree the names of the rules that have produced a node are displayed to the right of that node.",
        "The second (which is used in later processing because it accords better with our intuitive understanding of many structures) is nary branching, or \"flattened,\" and is computed from a small set of syntactic attributes of the analysis record.",
        "The * indicates the head of the phrase.",
        "The sketch grammar is written in G, a Microsoft-internal programming language that has been specially designed for NLP.",
        "The English",
        "grammar contains 129 rules, which vary in size from two to 600 lines of code, according to the number of conditions that they contain.",
        "The coverage of English is broad.",
        "Processing time is rapid: a typical 20-word sentence requires about an eighth of a second on a Pentium 200 MHz machine.",
        "The goal of all Natural Language Research and Development at Microsoft Research is to produce a broad coverage multilingual NLP system that is not tailored to any specific application, but has the potential to be used by any of them.",
        "To date, the English system is the foundation of the grammar checker in Word 97.",
        "We expect our multilingual technology to be used in as wide a spectrum of applications as Possible."

        "Grammar work in each language proceeds according to the same rationale: the grammarian processes sentences from diverse text sources and examines the resulting parses.",
