        "The systems which have participated in the MUCs have been quite successful at extracting information from the domains that they have been trained on (MUC-4, 1992), (MUC5, 1993), (MUC-6, 1995).",
        "The precision and recall statistics were around 60% and 50% respectively for MUC-6.",
        "However, these systems are domain dependent and customizing them to a new domain is a long and tedious process.",
        "For example, porting BBN's PLUM system from the Joint Ventures (MUC-5) domain to the Microelectronics (MUC-5) domain took approximately 3 person weeks (Weischedel, 1993).",
        "Moreover, training and adapting these systems to a particular domain is done by a group of computational linguists.",
        "These linguists determine all the ways in which the target information is expressed in a given corpus and then think of all the plausible variants of these ways, so that appropriate regular patterns can be written.",
        "The explosion in the amount of free text material on the Internet, and the use of this information by people from all walks of life, has made the issue of generalized information extraction a central one in Natural Language Processing.",
        "Many systems, including ones from NYU (Grishman, 1995), BBN (Weischedel, 1995), SRI (Appelt, 1995), SRA (Krupka, 1995), MITRE (Aberdeen, 1995), and the University of Massachusetts (Fisher, 1995), have taken steps to make the process of customizing a system for a particular domain an easy one.",

        "So the synset {board} (a person's meals, provided regularly for money), consisting only of the noun board itself, can be distinguished from the other senses by the gloss associated with it.",
        "In addition, WordNet attempts to organize different senses of a word based on the frequency of usage of the senses.",
        "For example, a listing of all the synonyms of board yields 8 different synsets, each designating a different sense of the noun.",
