        "The idea used for the validity testing process is as follows.",
        "Since the mutual information denotes the amount of probabilistic knowledge that a word provides on the proceeding word in a corpus, if similar behaving words are collected together to the same clusters than the loss of mutual information would be minimal.",
        "So the search is among possible alternatives for sets or clusters with the aim to obtain a minimal loss in mutual information.",
        "Although this top-to-bottom method seems theoretically possible, in the presented work a different approach, which is bottom-up is used.",
        "In this incremental approach, set prototypes are first built and then combined with other sets or single words to",

        "The points that are the words in a corpus are positioned on this n-dimensional space according to their behaviour related to other words in the lexicon space.",
        "Each wordi is placed on the ith dimension according to its bigram statistic with the word representing the dimension.",
        "So the degree of similarity between two words can be defined as having close bigram statistics in the corpus.",
        "Words are distributed in the plane according to those bigram statistics.",
        "The idea is quite simple: Let w1 and w2 be two words from the corpus.",
        "Let Z be the stochastic variable ranging over the words to be clustered.",
        "Then if Px (wi , Z) is close to Px(w2, Z) and if Px (Z , wi) is close to Px(Z, w2) for Z ranging over all the words to be clustered in the corpus, than we can state a closeness between the words wi and w2.",
        "Here Px is the probability of occurences of word pairs as stated in section 3.1.",
        "Px (wi , Z) is the probability where w1 appears as the first element in a word pair and Px (Z, wi) is the reverse probability where wi is the second element of the word pair.",
        "This is the same for w2 respectively.",
        "In order to start the clustering process, a distance function has to be defined between the elements in our plane.",

        "Since Px(wi, wi) is defined as -11,\\.4=1 the proportion of the number of occurences of word pair wi and wi to the total number of word pairs in the corpus, the distance function for w1 and w2 reduces down to:",
        "Having such a distance function, it is possible to start the clustering process.",
        "The first idea that can be used is to form a greedy algorithm to start forming the hierarchy of word clusters.",
        "If the lexicon space to be clustered consists of {w1, w2, then the first element from the lexicon space wi is taken and a cluster with this word and its nearest neighbour or neighbors is formed.",
        "Then the lexicon space is {(wi, w„, ws„), wi, wn} where (wi , w„ , w„) is the first cluster formed.",
        "The process is repeated with the first element in the list that is outside the formed sets, wi for our case and the process iterates until no word is left not being a member of any set.",
        "The formed sets will be the clusters at the bottom of the cluster hierarchy.",
        "Then to determine the behaviour of a set, the frequencies of its elements are added and the previous process is carried on the sets this time rather than on single words until the cluster hierarchy is formed, so the algorithm stops when a single set is formed that contains all the words in the lexicon space.",
        "In the early stages of this research such a greedy method was used to form the clusters, however, though some clusters at the low levels of the tree seemed to be correctly formed, as the number of elements in a cluster increased towards the higher levels, the clustering results became unsatisfactory.",
        "Two main factors were observed as the reasons for the unsatisfactory results.",
        "These were:",
        "• Shortcomings of the greedy type algorithm.",
        "• Inadequency of the method used to obtain the set behaviour from its element's properties.",
        "The greedy method results in a nonoptimal clustering in the initial level.",
        "To make this point clear consider the following example: Let us assume that four words w1,w2, w3 and w4 are forming the lexicon space.",
        "And let the distances between these words be defined as d„,„).",
        "Then consider the distribution in Figure 1.",
        "If the greedy method first tries to cluster wi .",
        "Then it will be clustered with w2, since",
        "the smallest d„„,, for the first word is So the second word will be captured in the set and the algorithm will skip w2 and continue the clustering process with w3.",
        "At this point, though w3 is closest to w2, since it is captured in a set and since w3 is more closer to w4 than the center of this set is, a new cluster will be formed with members w3 and w4.",
        "However, as it can be obviously seen visually from Figure 1 the first optimal cluster to be formed between these four words is the set {w2, w3}.",
        "The second problem causing unsatisfactory clustering occurs after the initial sets are formed.",
        "According to the algorithm after each cluster is formed, the clusters behave exactly like other single words and get into clustering with other clusters or single words.",
        "However to continue the process, the bigram statistics of the clusters or in other words the common behaviour of the elements in a cluster should be determined so that the distance between the cluster and other elements in the search space could be calculated.",
        "One easy way to determine this behaviour is to find the average of the statistics of all the elements in a cluster.",
        "This method has its drawbacks.",
        "The points in the search space for the natural language application are very close to each other.",
        "Furthermore, if the corpus used for the process is not large, the proximity problem becomes more severe.",
        "On the other hand the linguistic role of a word may vary in contexts in different sentences.",
        "Many words are used as noun, adjective or falling into some other linguistic category depending on the context.",

        "With a larger training data, an increase in the convergence of frequencies, thus an increase in the quality of clusters is expected.",
        "Since the distance function depends on only the difference of the bigram statistics, the running time of the algorithm is quite low compared to algorithms using mutual information.",
        "Though the complexity of the two algorithms are the same there is an increase in the efficiency due to the lack of time consuming mathematical operations like division and multiplication needed to calculate the mutual information of the whole corpus.",

        "Therefore different similarity metrics have not been tested for the algorithm.",

        "Also the algorithm could be used to infer the phrase structure of a natural language.",
        "Finch (Finch, 1993) again uses the mutual information to find out such structures.",
        "Using fuzzy membership degrees could be another way to repeat the same process.",
        "To find out the phrases, most frequent sentence segments of some length could be collected from a corpus.",
        "In addition to the frequencies and bigrams of words, the statistics for these frequent segments could be gathered and then they could also be passed to the clustering inference mechanism and the resulting clusters would then be expected to hold such phrases together with the words.",
        "To conclude, it can claimed that automatic word categorization is the initial step for the acquisition of the structure in a natural language and the same method could be used with modifications and improvements to find out more abstract structures in the language and moving this abstraction up to the sentence level succesfuly might make it possible for a computer to acquire the whole grammar of any natural language automatically."
