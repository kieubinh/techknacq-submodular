        "The ICALL system, and the computational model for representing interlanguage, have been designed after previous work on psycholinguistics, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics.",
        "This article will be focused on the computational model of interlanguage.",
        "Description of the ICALL system can be found in (Maritxalar et al., 1994).",
        "The concepts transitional dialects (Corder, 1971) and approximate systems (Nemser, 1971) are precursors to interlanguage (Selinker, 1972) (Selinker, 1992).",
        "Their aim was to define communicative and grammatical competence in second languages.",
        "All of them have these common features: a) a student's Martxalar, Diaz de Harr= & Maite Oronox discourse is independent from the native language (L1) and the target language (L2) and it is the product of a structured linguistic system; b) the linguistic system is variable during the learning process and it is very similar in students of the same language level, with the exception of some differences, results of a person's learning experience.",
        "In our case, the above mentioned characteristics are the basis for modelling the interlanguage.",
        "For example, as the linguistic system is very similar in students of the same level, we can infer that we will have an interlanguage model for each level.",
        "Therefore, in our ICALL system we find a module where the different Interlanguage Level Models (ILMs) of each language level are represented.",
        "Representation of the ILMs will be presented in this article.",
        "Our work is based on corpus analysis.",
        "At this moment we have focused on the implementation of the morphological and morphosyntactic competence at word level.",
        "Work at word level is important in our case because Basque is an agglutinative language with rich morphosyntactic information within words.",

        "We are aware of the limits of the modelling only taking into account written material.",
        "Spoken material could also be collected for a better modelling.",
        "However, as the computational tools we have for studying Basque are only for writing studies, we have discarded the treatment of the spoken output of the learners.",
        "In the next section we will explain the conceptual model of ILMs by means of the KADS Domain Description Language (DDL) proposed in Schreiber (Schreiber et al., 1993).",
        "Next, we will give an idea of the experimental method used in order to collect written material and the top-down methodology used in order to model interlanguage in support of the selected corpora.",
        "After that, we will describe some of the implemented tools for modelling ILMs.",
        "Then, we will describe the output of the modelling tool, in order to compare the information given by the computational tool and the conceptual model of ILMs proposed before.",

        "In this section we show the psycholinguistic model for Interlanguage Level Models (ILMs).",
        "The ILMs characterise different grammars of the interlanguage the ideal learner can have for the second language at each language level.",
        "It must be noted that, although some linguistic structures are particular to each student, others are common to all students at the same level.",
        "These common structures are those which will be represented in the ILMs.",
        "We represent ILMs by means of two different types of sequences of models: consecutive sequences and embodied sequences.",
        "For each level, two different kinds of knowledge are represented: the variable knowledge, the knowledge the student is supposed to be learning; and, the fixed knowledge, the knowledge the learner has already acquired.",
        "The knowledge the language learners have acquired at a concrete level includes the knowledge acquired at previous levels.",
        "However, the knowledge they are learning at each level follows a different structure: each model from each level is independent from other levels, although intersections between knowledge at different levels Can occur at times.",
        "The set of different variable language structures at each language level consists of consecutive sequences of models, while the set of fixed ones consists of embodied sequences (see Fig. 1).",
        "When we say fixed knowledge or variable knowledge we refer to the language structures the learners have in their interlanguage, without making any distinction between the representation of correct and \"incorrect\" structures.",
        "When we specify interlanguage all the language structures, right and \"deviant\", are represented in the same way.",
        "It must be noted that while a language structure used by high level learners can be considered deviant, the same structure in the case of beginners could be seen as correct at their level.",
        "For example a deviation at 10th level like avoiding the word ote 'could' (i.e. nor da ?",
        "'who is?'",
        "instead of nor ote da ?",
        "'who could be?'",
        ") is not considered a deviation in lower levels of the language.",

        "Some structures appear in the interlanguage in specific contexts, however, others appear in any context.",

        "The properties of the interlanguage structures are: description of the structure; contextualization, that is, context dependent or context independent; deviation, which marks if the structure must be considered deviant at the related language level and, finally, stabilization.",
        "The stabilization property is a qualitative value",
        "which represents the acquisition level of the structure for a particular language level.",
        "It is by means of this property that a language structure inside the student's interlanguage is considered fixed knowledge or variable knowledge.",
        "When the value of the stabilization property is always it means that the language structure has been assimilated by the learner and in the future it would be quite difficult making some changes.",
        "However, when the value is rarely, there is a high variability of the language structure, and, therefore, a good teacher (could be an ICALL system) should be able to help the learner to take away those structures in case they would not direct the student towards a target language.",

        "are also non-linguistic conditions.",
        "Interlanguage forms can vary from one activity type to another, even though the discourse domain is the same.",
        "The activity types can be related to the structure of the whole text (text_conditions); in addition there are also some non-linguistic conditions (e.g. length of the sentence) related to a particular language structure in the text (struc-ture_conditions).",
        "For example, sometimes students mark agreement between verb and complements in small simple sentences, and, at the same time they forget it in long sentences.",
        "In our case, structure conditions are studied by means of the corpus; text conditions, however, are detected by means of interviews with the teachers and learners.",
        "Linguistic conditions are studied by means of a corpus.",
        "In the corpus composed of texts written by high level and upper intermediate language students (350 texts collected between 1991 and 1995) we found linguistic influence in some language structures of the interlanguage.",
        "For instance, the presence of plurality of some components in the sentence can cause verbs to agree with such components, whether or not these must be in agreement with the verb (the phenomenon of plurality has also been observed in second language learners of French (Lessard et al., 1994)).",
        "Finally, we would like to claim that this way of putting linguistic structures in context could be applied similarly when modelling first languages.",
        "After defining which kind of conditions must be taken into account when linguistic phenomena are identified, we will see which type of linguistic rules can be found inside the phenomena.",
        "It is usual that language learners know only some linguistic rules corresponding to a particular linguistic phenomenon, and not all of them.",
        "In the case of language natives, however, they know, in most cases, all linguistic rules.",
        "That is the reason for representing explicitly in the student's interlanguage the set of linguistic rules related to the linguistic phenomena of the language structure.",
        "In other cases, as in natives, it should not be necessary to make their linguistic rules explicit as the linguistic phenomena define, implicitly, the set of linguistic rules.",
        "In the same way, we could say that linguistic rules identify the corresponding linguistic phenomenon, Martxalar, Dz'az de Ilarraza & Maite Oronoz 53 Computational Model of Interlanguage however, it is necessary to make it explicit, as a linguistic phenomenon could be detected in a student's interlanguage, but the linguistic rules would not be identified until after some interactions with the student.",
        "The student model is dynamic, so, the language structures are also dynamic.",
        "Therefore, in the first interactions with the student a linguistic phenomenon can be detected inside the student's interlanguage before eliciting the corresponding linguistic rules.",
        "Next we shall define the structure of the linguistic rules.",
        "In the experiments the teachers have identified three types of language phenomena in the students' interlanguage: first, simple interlanguage structures composed of a set of linguistic phenomena and linguistic rules; second, avoiding interlanguage structures defined as linguistic rules that the student usually avoids; and, third, replacement language structures where the learner uses a structure too often (or rarely) instead of using other structures (e.g. when a person uses the conjunction and all time and rarely uses structures such as however, nevertheless, thus .",
        ".",
        ").",
        "Consequently, we can say that there are relationships between linguistic rules of the interlanguage.",

        "It must be noted that some information of the interlanguage models, for example text conditions (see section 2), are detected semiau-tomatically with the help of the teachers and learners.",
        "Before explaining modelling based on corpus analysis, we would like to make some comments about the criteria for defining the corpus: we collected written material from different language schools (IRALE1, ILAZKI) and grouped this material depending on some features of the texts such as, 1) the kind of exercise proposed by the teacher (e.g. abstract, article about a subject, letter ... ) and 2) the student who wrote the text.",

        "The last feature is what we have called text condition in section 2.",
        "At the same time, a database for gathering the relevant information about the students' learning process was developed.",

        "The corpus collected from 1990 to 1995 is made up of 350 texts.",
        "This corpus has been divided in subsets depending on the language level.",
        "At the moment we have defined three language levels of study that we call low, intermediate, and high levels.",

        "The language learners had five hours of language classes per week, and they wrote one composition every week or every fortnight.",
        "For modelling interlanguage at different language levels we use a top-down methodology, that is, we start from the modelling of high levels and continue to lower ones (see Fig 1).",
        "The reasons for",
        "a top-down methodology are that most computational tools for Basque we have (lemmatiser, spelling checker-corrector, morphological disambiguator ) can be easily adapted for high language levels; besides, usually computational tools for analysing written texts of high language levels are more robust than those of low levels and, finally, there usually is more written material at high levels than at low ones.",

        "The presented work proves that the implementation of psycholinguistic models of interlanguage is viable from the adaptation of the linguistic-computational tools we have for the automatic study of Basque.",
        "Modelling at word level is important in our case because Basque is an agglutinative language with rich morphosyntactic information within words.",
        "The results obtained using the developed tools for language learning studies provide us statistical information about phenomena that teachers and psycholinguistics knew by intuition.",
        "Therefore, we can say that corpus analysis is a good technique for modelling ILMs.",
        "In the near future we will develop new tools in order to model each student's knowledge.",
        "The detection of contexts will be improved in order to identify contexts related to the characteristics of the particular learners.",
        "Moreover we will work on the detection of interlanguage structures at sentence level .",
        "Field studies have been carried out in this sense (Maritxalar et al., 1993) (Andueza et al., 1996).",
        "At the moment, we are studying some aspects of the morphosyntax and syntax for L2, taking as a basis the results obtained in Andueza (Andueza et al., 1996), where in a final test the hypothesis obtained in the study carried out in the 94/95 academic year were contrasted with the students.",
        "In this work, we also analysed the reasons for using some language structures in addition to the detection of their context.",
        "We plan in the future to add to the system such knowledge about the diagnosis of structures.",
        "Finally, we would like to remark that together with the experiments explained in the article, two environments are being prepared in the ICALL system: the Knowledge Acquisition Subsystem and the Learning Process Subsystem.",
        "The Knowledge Acquisition Subsystem helps language teachers to make hypotheses about, among others, the reasons students have for using deviant language structures.",
        "The Learning Process Subsystem guides users in their learning process giving hints according to their language level."
