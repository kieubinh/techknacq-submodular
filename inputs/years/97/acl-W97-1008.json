        "The target of the tool was languages for which the word seemed already a useful level of abstraction from which to expand, and experiments were first performed on English and German for the scheduling task.",
        "One important motivation for this work was the desire to capture lexicalized expressions that exhibit, in natural speech, markedly different pronunciation from what concatenating the constituent words would predict.",
        "Examples of such expressions are don't-know (dunno), i-would-have (ida), you-all (yaw).",

        "Until very recently most implementations of this idea have made use of measures of co-occurrence that have been useful in other domains, and the pair is chosen by maximizing that criterion.",
        "In contrast we assume that we want to model the corpus with a statistical language model and search for those sequences that increase the modeling power of the model by the largest amount.",
        "Our measurements are based on information theoretic principles and the usage of m-gram models of language, a common practice in the speech community.",
        "The model described here will therefore implicitly consider the words surrounding the phrase candidates and use information about the context to determine the goodness of a sequence, which is in contrast to traditional measures.",

        "This paper for the most part ignores the search problem.",
        "The acoustic model is in part influenced by the sequences since we can change the entries in the pronunciation dictionary that encode the phoneme sequences the speech system uses to generate its models.",
        "During this generation process most modern systems make only partial use of neighboring words and the construction process is up to date also unable to model contractions, especially at word boundaries.",
        "It is therefore of great advantage to have a basic unit in the decoder that allows for manual or automatic dictionary modification that captures these phenomena.",
        "This has recently been reported to be a very promising modeling idea on several different speech recognition tasks in English.",

        "By creating a new word, credit_card, we eliminate one choice and decrease the surprise of seeing the next word.",

        "This technique is obviously just an approximation of an algorithm that considers all word sequences at once and would allow the statistical model to produce the components of a sequence separately.",

        "The approach described in Section 3.2 is a bottom-up approach to sequence finding, and the segmentation of Japanese is more intuitively viewed as a top-down problem in which an input string is broken down to some level of granularity.",

        "The nasal consonant kana is considered an independent unit.",
        "The problem of segmentation is not unique to Japanese; there are other languages without spaces in the written language, and verb conjugations and other inflective forms are issues in almost any language.",
