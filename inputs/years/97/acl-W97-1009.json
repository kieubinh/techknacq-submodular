        "Precocious abilities in newborn infants are frequently taken as evidence for pre-specification of the representations that support those abilities.",
        "The prespecifications of these representations is innately determined, presumably in the genome of the individual.",
        "One such ability is that of newborn infants to be universal listeners, able to discriminate speech contrasts of all languages.",
        "This is all the more remarkable since the low-pass filtered speech sounds",
        "that foetuses hear in utero vary widely between different languages.",
        "Eimas et al.",
        "(1971) showed that 1-4 month old infants displayed categorical perception of the syllables /ba/ and /pa/.",
        "That is to say, infants carve up the phonetic space into a set of categories with sharp boundaries.",
        "Variants of a phoneme, such as are not discriminable, even though they differ acoustically by the same amount as /p/ and /b/ (although see (Kuhl, 1993)).",
        "More recent research has shown that the categories are universal, so that English-learning infants can discriminate non-native contrasts in Czech (Trehub, 1973), Hindi (Werker, Gilbert, Humphrey, & Tees, 1981), Nth-lakampx (Werker & Tees, 1984a), Spanish (Aslin, Pisoni, Hennessy, & Perey, 1981) and Zulu (Best, McRoberts, & Sithole, 1988).",
        "This suggests that infants develop an initial representation of speech that is universal and largely insensitive to the particular language to which they are exposed.",
        "The ability to discriminate some non-native speech contrasts declines after the age of 10-12 months (Werker & Tees, 1984a).",
        "Such rapid learning can be defined in terms of a taxonomy developed in the field of animal behaviour.",
        "Mayr (1974) suggested that programs of development form a continuum of flexibility in their response to environmental stimulation.",
        "He distinguished between \"open\" and \"closed\" programs of development.",
        "\"Closed\" programs of development rely on environmental input to a relatively small degree, producing highly stereotyped behaviour.",
        "Precedents of rapidly learned \"closed\" development abound and are also termed \"innately guided\" learning e.g. imprinting in geese and ducks and song acquisition in birds (Marler, 1991).",
        "\"Open\" programs, on the other hand, are responsive to a much broader range of stimulation and can produce a broader range of responses.",
        "The presence of one type of developmental program does not preclude the existence of the other, however.",
        "Just because a duckling has imprinted on its mother does not mean that it is unable to learn to recognise new objects later in life.",
        "Similarly, the rapid learning of speech sounds by infants does not preclude later tuning of the speech representation.",
        "In fact, we would argue that it aids such development by ensuring that later language-specific fine-tuning of the representation does not encounter local minima, which would be catastrophic for linguistic development.",
        "To quote from a recent review (Jusczyk, 1992): Jusczyk and Bertoncini (1988) proposed that the development of speech perception be viewed as an innately guided learning process wherein the infant is primed in certain ways to seek out some type of signals as opposed to others.",
        "The innate prewiring underlying the infant's speech perception abilities allows for development to occur in one of several directions.",
        "The nature of the input helps to select the direction that development will take.",
        "Thus, learning the sound properties of the native language takes place rapidly because the system is innately structured to be sensitive to correlations of certain distributional properties and not others.",
        "In order to make explicit what is meant by \"innately guided learning\" and \"innate prewiring\" we have developed a connectionist model of innately guided learning.",
        "The approach taken has been to encode an artificial neural network (ANN) in a genome which stores its architecture and learning rules.",
        "The genomic space of possible ANNs is searched for networks that are well suited to the task of rapidly learning to detect contrastive features of human speech sounds using unsupervised learning.",
        "Importantly, networks start life with a completely randomized set of connections and therefore have no representational knowledge about speech at the level of individual connections.",
        "The network must therefore use its architecture and learning rules in combination with auditory input to rapidly converge on a representation.",
        "The model attempts to explain how innate constraints on a neural network could allow infants to be sensitive to a wide range of features so soon after birth, and to develop the same initial features whatever their target language.",
        "It also exhibits other features typically associated with human speech perception, namely categorical perception and patterns of phoneme confusability similar to that of humans.",
        "The model does not account directly for the much slower, roughly yearlong process by which some fea-tural distinctions are lost.",
        "It is possible that features are never lost and that units which represent information that is redundant in the target language are ignored by higher level processing, as suggested by Werker and Tees (Werker & Tees, 1984b)."

        "The goal of the model is to create a neural network that takes speech spectra as input and develops the same representation of speech whatever the language it is exposed to.",
        "Furthermore we avoid hard-wiring the connections in the network.",
        "Rather, the network employs a set of unsupervised learning rules that converge on the same representation whatever the initial set of connection strengths between neurons in the network.",
        "It is important that the learning is unsupervised as the developing infant has no teaching signal as to the contrasts present in speech.",
        "In essence this model of early speech perception embodies Waddington's (1975) principle of epigenesis, or what Elman et al.",
        "(1996) have more recently described as architectural/computational innateness.",
        "The approach we have taken is to encode the properties of neural networks in a genome and to evolve, by a process called a genetic algorithm, a population of neural networks that respond in the appropriate way to speech spectra.",
        "Initially, a population of 50 genomes are randomly generated.",
        "Each of these networks is presented with speech spectra and we quantify how well its neuronal engram of speech encodes the incoming signal.",
        "This number is called the \"fitness\" of a network.",
        "For the task of representing speech sounds we want a network that is responsive to the salient aspects of the speech signal, in particular those necessary for identification of speech segments.",
        "A network that is good at representing speech will encode tokens of the same acoustic segment as similarly as possible and different segments as differently as possible.",
        "The initial population performs very poorly on the task, but some networks perform better than others.",
        "Two parents are randomly selected from the population with a probability that increases with increasing fitness.",
        "The parental genomes are spliced together to form one child network that is then tested to find its fitness.",
        "The child network then replaces the network that has the lowest fitness in the population.",
        "Each gene also has a small chance of mutating to a new value after sexual reproduction, so that new genes are constantly entering the collective gene pool, otherwise the evolutionary process would simply be a reshuffling of genes present in the initial population.",
        "The process of parental selection, sexual Nakisa & Plunkett 71 Evolution of Speech Representations reproduction, mutation of the offspring and evaluation of the offspring is repeated for several thousand generations.",
        "Genes that are useful for the task at hand, as specified by the fitness function, increase in frequency in the population, while genes that are not useful decline in frequency.",
        "Within a few hundred generations the networks in the population develop representations that have a high fitness value, as illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "Clearly, the encoding scheme used to store the properties of neural networks critically affects how well the networks may perform on any given task.",
        "The encoding scheme we have chosen is very flexible, storing information about the architecture of a network and its learning properties.",
        "Architecture defines what neurons may be connected to other neurons, and this presupposes some way of grouping neurons such that these gross patterns of connectivity can be defined.",
        "For the purposes of defining network architecture, therefore, the network is subdivided into subnetworks.",
        "The genome specifies how many subnetworks there are, how many neurons are in each subnetwork what subnetworks are connected to one another, and given that two subnetworks are connected, what learning rule is used in connections between neurons in those subnetworks."

        "Within pools there are inhibitory connections and between pools there are excitatory connections.",

        "Because of these interactions the activity of units in IAC networks develop over time, sometimes settling into steady patterns of activation.",
        "Inhibitory connections within a pool mean that one unit at a time dominates the others in a winner-take-all fashion.",
        "The TRACE model of speech perception is possibly the most successful and best known example of such models (McClelland Elman, 1986).",

        "They asked subjects to identify CV pairs where the consonant was one of the sixteen being tested and the vowel was /a1/, as in father.",
        "By adding noise to the stimuli at a constant loudness and varying the loudness of the speech they could control the signal to noise ratio of the stimuli and measure the number and type of errors produced.",
        "Subjects produced a consistent pattern of errors in which certain pairs of consonants were more confusable than others.",
        "For example, the following pairs were highly confusable: m – n, f-0, v – s, p – t – k, d – g, z-3.",
        "When clustered according to confusability the consonants formed three groups: voiceless, voiced and nasal consonants.",
        "Confusabil-ity was greatest within each group and smallest between groups.",
        "Since our model did not classify phonemes it was not possible to create a phoneme confusability matrix using the same method as Miller and Nicely.",
        "However, it was possible to create a clustering diagram showing the similarity structure of the representations for each phoneme.",
        "If given noisy input, phonemes whose representations are closest together in the output space will be more easily confused than phonemes that lie far apart.",
        "Since a cluster analysis of many thousands of phoneme tokens would not be clear, a centroid for each phoneme type was used as the input to the cluster analysis.",
        "Centroids were calculated by storing the input and output representations of phonemes in 1000 TIMIT sentences.",
        "Cluster analyses for the spectral input representation and the featural output representation are shown in Figure 8.3 From Figure 8 it is clear that the featural output representation broadly preserves the similarity structure of the spectral input representation despite the eightfold compression in the number of units.",
        "In both the input and output representations the phonemes can be divided into three classes: fricatives/affricates, vowels/semi-vowels, and other consonants.",
        "Some phonemes are shifted between these broad categories in the output representation, e.g. t, 0 and f are moved into the fricative/affricate category.",
        "The reason for this shift is that t occurs with 31t should be noted that for stops, TIMIT transcribes closures separately from releases, so /p/ would be transcribed /pcl p/.",
        "The results shown here are for the releases, hence their similarity to fricatives and affricates.",
        "Nakisa & Plunkett 77 Evolution of Speech Representations a high token frequency, so by pulling it apart from other frequently occurring, spectrally similar consonants, the fitness is increased.",
        "Both spectral and featural representations showed a high confusability for m – n, f – O, d – g, s – f, , as found in the Miller and Nicely experiments.",
        "There were discrepancies, however: the stops p – t – k were not particularly similar in either the input or output representations due to an artifact of the representations being snapshots at the midpoints of the stop release.",
        "In human categorisation experiments, phonemes are judged on the basis of both the closure and the release, which would greatly increase the similarity of the stops relative to other phonemes.",
        "In the input representation, v-6 are fairly close together, but are pulled apart in the output representation.",
        "Both these phonemes had low token frequencies, so this difference may not be a result of random variation.",
        "In Figure 8 3 is not shown because it occurred very infrequently, but the centroids of z-3 were very close together, as found by Miller and Nicely.",

        "By developing an appropriate architecture, time-constants and learning rules over many generations, the task of learning to represent speech sounds is made more rapid over the course of development of an individual network.",
        "Evolution does all the hard work and gives the network a developmental \"legup\".",
        "However, having the correct innate architecture and learning rules is not sufficient for creating good representations.",
        "Weights are not inherited between generations so the network is dependent on the environment for learning the correct representation.",
        "If deprived of sound input or fed acoustically filtered speech input, the model cannot form meaningful representations because each network starts life with a random set of weights.",
        "But given the sort of auditory input heard by an infant the model rapidly creates the same set of universal features, whether or not it is in a noisy environment and whatever the language it hears.",
        "We envisage that this method of creating a quick and dirty initial representation of sounds by innately guided learning is not specific to humans.",
        "Clearly, humans and other animals have not been selected for their ability to discriminate the phonemes of English.",
        "But we would expect results similar to those presented here if the selection criterion were the ability to discriminate a wide range of spectrally dissimilar sounds in the environment from only limited exposure to their patterns of regularity e.g. discrimination of the maternal call from other conspecific calls, and the sound of predators from everyday environmental noises.",
        "It is therefore unsurprising that animals have been found, after suitable training, to discriminate some phonemes in similar ways as do humans (Kuhl & Miller, 1975).",
        "The advantages of innately guided learning over other self-organising networks are that it is much faster and is less dependent on the \"correct\" environmental statistics.",
        "It also offers an account of how infants from different linguistic environments can come up with the same featural representation so soon after birth.",
        "In this sense innately guided learning as implemented in this model shows how genes and the environment could interact to ensure rapid development of a featural representation of speech on which further linguistic development depends."
