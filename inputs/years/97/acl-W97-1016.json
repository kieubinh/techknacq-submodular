        "A sentence is structurally ambiguous when it can be assigned more than one syntactic structure.",
        "The drosophila of structural ambiguity resolution is Prepositional Phrase (PP) attachment.",
        "Several sources of information can be used to resolve PP attachment ambiguity.",
        "Psycholinguistic theories have resulted in disambiguation strategies which use syntactic information only, i.e. structural properties of the parse tree are used to choose between different attachment sites.",
        "Two principles based on syntactic information are Minimal Attachment (MA) and Late Closure (LC) (Frazier, 1979).",
        "MA tries to construct the parse tree that has the fewest nodes, whereas LC tries to attach new constituents as low in the parse tree as possible.",
        "These strategies always choose the same attachment regardless of the lexical content of the sentence.",
        "This results in a wrong attachment in one of the following sentences:",
        "In sentence 1, the PP \"with a fork\" is attached to the verb \"eats\" (high attachment).",
        "Sentence 2 differs only minimally from the first sentence; here, the PP \"with anchovies\" does not attach to the verb but to the NP \"pizza\" (low attachment).",
        "In languages like English and Dutch, in which there is very little overt case marking, syntactic information alone does not suffice to explain the difference in attachment sites between such sentences.",
        "The use of syntactic principles makes it necessary to re-analyse the sentence, using semantic or even pragmatic information, to reach the correct decision.",
        "In the example sentences 1 and 2, the meaning of the head of the object of 'with' determines low or high attachment.",
        "Several semantic criteria have been worked out to resolve structural ambiguities.",
        "However, pinning down the semantic properties of all the words is laborious and expensive, and is only feasible in a very restricted domain.",
        "The modeling of pragmatic inference seems to be even more difficult in a computational system.",
        "Due to the difficulties with the modeling of semantic strategies for ambiguity resolution, an attractive alternative is to look at the statistics of word patterns in annotated corpora.",
        "In such a corpus, different kinds of information used to resolve attachment ambiguity are, implicitly, represented in co-occurrence regularities.",
        "Several statistical techniques can use this information in learning attachment ambiguity resolution.",
        "Hindle and Rooth (1993) were the first to show that a corpus-based approach to PP attachment ambiguity resolution can lead to good results.",
        "For sentences with a verb/noun attachment ambiguity, they measured the lexical association between the noun and the preposition, and the verb and the preposition in unambiguous sentences.",
        "Their method bases attachment decisions on the ratio and",
        "reliability of these association strengths.",
        "Note that Hindle and Rooth did not include information about the second noun and therefore could not distinguish between sentence 1 and 2.",
        "Their method is also difficult to extend to more elaborate combinations of information sources.",
        "More recently, a number of statistical methods better suited to larger numbers of features have been proposed for PP-attachment.",
        "Brill and Resnik (1994) applied Error-Driven Transformation-Based Learning, Ratnaparkhi, Reynar and Roukos (1994) applied a Maximum Entropy model, Franz (1996) used a Loglinear model, and Collins and Brooks (1995) obtained good results using a Back-Off model.",
        "In this paper, we examine whether Memory-Based Learning (MBL), a family of statistical methods from the field of Machine Learning, can improve on the performance of previous approaches.",

        "An important advantage of MBL is its use of similarity-based reasoning.",

        "Machine learning algorithms extrapolate from the examples to new input cases, either by extracting regularities from the examples in the form of rules, decision trees, connection weights, or probabilities in greedy learning algorithms, or by a more direct use of analogy in lazy learning algorithms.",

        "But if we have information about feature relevance, we can add linguistic bias to weight or select different features (Cardie, 1996).",
        "An alternative, more empiricist, approach is to look at the behavior of features in the set of examples used for training.",
        "We can compute statistics about the relevance of features by looking at which features are good predictors of the class labels.",

        "To this end, we use the Modified Value Difference Metric (MVDM), see Cost and Salzberg (1993); a variant of a metric first defined in Stanfill and Waltz (1986).",

        "It is possible to cluster the distributions of the values over the categories, and obtain classes of similar words in this fashion.",
        "For an example of this type of unsupervised learning as a side-effect of supervised learning, see Daelemans, Berck, and Gillis (1996).",
        "In a sense, the MVDM can be interpreted as implicitly implementing a statistically induced, distributed, non-symbolic representation of the words.",

        "This means that if two such values occur with the same class, the MVDM will regard them as identical, and if they occur with two different classes their distance will be maximal.",
        "In many cases, the latter condition reduces the MVDM to the overlap metric, and additionaly some cases will be counted as an exact match on the basis of very shaky evidence.",
        "It is, therefore, worthwile to investigate whether the value difference matrix b(Vi, Vi) can be reused from one task to another.",
        "This would make it possible to reliably estimate all the .5 parameters on a task for which we have a large amount of training material, and to profit from their availability for the MVDM of a smaller domain.",
        "Such a possibility of reuse of lexical similarity is found in the application of Lexical Space representation (Schiitze, 1994, Zavrel and Veenstra, 1995).",
        "In LexSpace, each word is represented by a vector of Zavrel, Daelemans & Veenstra 138 Memory-Based PP Attachment real numbers that stands for a \"fingerprint\" of the words' distributional behavior across local contexts in a large corpus.",

        "The position of a word in Lexical Space is thus given by a four component vector, of which each component has as many dimensions as there are context words.",

        "To reduce the 1000 dimensional Lexical Space vectors to a manageable format we applied Principal Component Analysis' (PCA) to reduce them to a much lower number of dimensions.",
        "PCA accomplishes the dimension reduction that preserves as much of the structure of the original data as possible.",
        "Using a measure of the correctness of the classification of a word in Lexical Space with respect to a linguistic categorization (see Zavrel and Veenstra (1995)) we found that PCA can reduce the dimensionality from 1000 to as few as 25 dimensions with virtually no loss, and sometimes even an improvement of the quality of the organization.",
        "Note that the LexSpace representations are task independent in that they only reflect the structure of neighborhood relations between words in text.",

        "They found an increase in performance by using semantic information from WordNet.",
        "Ratnaparkhi, Reynar, and Roukos (1994) used a Maximum Entropy model and a decision tree on the dataset they extracted from the Wall Street Journal corpus.",
        "They also report performance gains with word features derived by an unsupervised clustering method.",
        "Ratnaparkhi et al.",
        "ignored low frequency events.",
        "The accuracy of these two approaches is not optimal.",
        "This is most likely due to the fact that they treat low frequency events as noise, though these contain a lot of information in a sparse domain such as PP-attachment.",
        "Franz (1996) used a Loglinear model for PP attachment.",
        "The features he used were the preposition, the verb level",
        "(the lexical association between the verb and the preposition), the noun level (idem dito for nounl), the noun tag (POS-tag for nounl), noun definiteness (of nounl), and the PP-object tag (POS-tag for noun2).",
        "A Loglinear model keeps track of the interaction between all the features, though at a fairly high computational cost.",
        "The dataset that was used in Franz' work is no longer available, making a direct comparison of the performance impossible.",
        "Collins and Brooks (1995) used a Back-Off model, which enables them to take low frequency effects into account on the Ratnaparkhi dataset (with good results).",
        "In Zavrel and Daelemans (1997) it is shown that Memory-Based and Back-Off type methods are closely related, which is mirrored in the performance levels.",
        "Collins and Brooks got slightly better results (84.5 %) after reducing the sparse data problem by preprocessing the dataset, e.g. replacing all four-digit words with 'YEAR'.",
        "The experiments with Lexical Space representations have as yet not shown impressive performance gains over Back-Off, but they have demonstrated that the MBL framework is well-suited to experimentation with rich lexical representations."

        "We have shown that our MBL approach is very competent in solving attachment ambiguities; it achieves better generalization performance than many previous statistical approaches.",
        "Moreover, because we can measure the relevance of the features using an information gain metric (IB1-IG), we are able to add features without a high cost in model selection or an explosion in the number of parameters.",
        "An additional advantage of the MBL approach is that, in contrast to the other statistical approaches, it is founded in the use of similarity-based reasoning.",
        "Therefore, it makes it possible to experiment with different types of distributed non-symbolic lexical representations extracted from corpora using unsupervised learning.",
        "This promises to be a rich source of extra information.",
        "We have also shown that task specific similarity metrics such as MVDM are sensitive to the sparse data problem.",
        "LexSpace is less sensitive to this problem because of the large amount of data which is available for its training."
