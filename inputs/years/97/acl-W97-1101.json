        "When drawing up genetic trees of languages, it is sometimes useful to quantify the degree of relationship between them.",
        "Mathematical approaches along these lines have been pursued for some time now – Embleton (1991) is an excellent review of some important techniques.",
        "Cheng (1982), in fact, attempts to address the issue central to this paper – that of obtaining distance measures between related Chinese dialects.",
        "However, he does this at a lexical level by using Karl Pearson's tetrachoric correlation coefficient on 905 words from a lexical dictionary (Cihui, 1964).",
        "This paper takes a novel approach to this problem by pioneering the use of phonological data to find dissimilarity measures, as opposed to lexical (which has been used most frequently up till now), semantic or syntactic data.1 'Indeed, semantic similarity, which is usually necessary for the identification of cognates in Indo-European languages, is not even relevant in the case of the Chinese languages we are concerned with in this paper because cognates can be visually identified in Chinese languages due to a common ideographic writing system stretching back over 3 millenia (Streeter, 1977, p.103).",
        "An argument can also be made that phonetic or phonological dissimilarity measures, being the least abstract of all, could give the most realistic results.",
        "Unfortunately, studies in this direction have been relatively rare.",
        "Two such works which should be mentioned are Grimes and Agard (1959) and Hsieh (1973), both of which are, however, constrained by the use of lexicostatistical methodology.",
        "In fairness to existing methods, it must be noted that many other existing methods for obtaining dissimilarity measures are in fact applicable to non-lexical data for deriving non-lexical measures.",
        "In practice, though, they have been constrained by a preoccupation with the lexicon as well as by the unavailability of phonological data.'",
        "Hopefully, the phonological data developed in this project should provide fresh input to those methods and revive their application to the problem area in future research."

        "The data we use to illustrate our ideas are two phonological histories taken from the field of Chinese linguistics.",
        "One is an account of the Modern Beijing (MB) dialect from an earlier stage of Chinese, referred to as Middle Chinese, and published as Chen (1976); the other is an account of the Modern Cantonese (MC) dialect also from Middle Chinese, published as Chen and Newman (1984a, 1984b and 1985).",
        "These should be consulted for further explanation of the diachronic rules and their relative chronology as well as for an explanation of the rule labels used in this paper.",
        "For brevity, we will refer to the former as Chen76 and the latter as CN84 in subsequent sections.",
        "We would now like to draw attention now to five features of these accounts which make them ideal for the purpose at hand:",
        "1.",
        "The accounts are relatively explicit in their expositions.",
        "Each account assumes Middle Chinese reconstructions which are phonetically explicit, states each rule in a formal style, and defines the ordering relationships which hold between the rules.",
        "This degree of comprehensiveness and explicitness in writing the history of a",
        "language is relatively rare.",
        "It is even rarer to have accounts of two related dialects described in a similarly explicit way.",
        "Obviously, when it comes to translating historical accounts into phonological derivations, the more explicit the original account, the more readily one can arrive at the derivations.",
        "2.",
        "The two accounts assume identical reconstructions for the Middle Chinese forms, which of course is crucial in any meaningful comparison of the two dialects.",
        "Not surprisingly, given the existence of Sinology as an established field and one with a history going back well over a hundred years, there are many conflicting proposals about Middle Chinese and its pronunciation.",
        "Decisions about the forms of Middle Chinese go hand in hand, necessarily, with corresponding decisions about the historical rules which lead from those forms to modern-day reflexes.",
        "One can not easily compare competing historical accounts if they assume different reconstructed forms as their starting points.",
        "See Chen76 for a full description and justification of the Middle Chinese reconstructions used in these accounts.",
        "3.",
        "The two accounts are couched in terms of one phonological framework.",
        "This, too, is a highly desirable feature when it comes to making comparisons between the sets of rules involved in each account.",
        "The framework could be described as a somehwat \"relaxed\" version of SPE (Chomsky and Halle, 1968).",
        "For example, the accounts make use of orthodox SPE features alongside others where it was thought appropriate (e.g. [+/- labial], [+/- acute]).",
        "Phonotactic conditions are utilized as a way of triggering certain phonological changes, alongside more conventional rule statements.",
        "4.",
        "The accounts purport to describe the phonological histories of a single database of Chinese characters and their readings in modern dialects (Zihui, 1962).",
        "This is a substantial database containing about 2,700 Chinese characters and it is the readings of these characters in two of the dialects – Modern Beijing and Modern Cantonese dialects which are the outputs of the rule derivations in the two accounts.",
        "5.",
        "The accounts themselves are published in an easily available journal, The Journal of Chinese Linguistics, which allows readers to scrutinize the original discussion and rule statements.",
        "The features alluded to in points 1-5 make these two accounts uniquely suited to testing out formal hypotheses relating to historical phonology.",
        "The historical account of Modern Beijing/Modern Cantonese is construed as a set of derivations.",
        "The input to a derivation is a reconstructed Middle Chinese form; the input is subjected to a battery of (ordered) phonological rules; and the output of the derivation is the reflex in the modern dialect."

        "The mechanistic model we have used to represent diachronic phonological derivations is that of Probabilistic Finite State Automata (PFSA).",
        "These are state determined machines which have stochastic transition functions.",
        "The derivation of each word in MB or MC from Middle Chinese consists of a sequence of diachronic rules.",
        "These rule sequences for each of the approximately 2700 words are used to construct our PFSA.",
        "Node 0 of the PFSA corresponds to the reconstructed form of the word in Middle Chinese.",
        "Arcs leading out of states in the PFSA represent particular rules that were applied to a form at that state, transforming it into a new intermediate form.",
        "A transition on a delimiter symbol, which always returns to state 0, signifies the end of a derivation process whereby the final form in the daughter language has been arrived at.",
        "The weightings on the arcs represent the number of times that particular arc was traversed in processing the entire corpus of words.",
        "The complete PFSA then represents the phonological complexity of the derivation process from Middle Chinese into one of the modern dialects.",
        "If this is the case, then the length of the minimal description of the PFSA would be indicative of the distance between the parent and daughter languages.",
        "There are two levels at which the diachronic complexity can be measured.",
        "The first is of the canonical PFSA, which is a trie encoding of the rules.",
        "This is the length of the diachronic phonological hypothesis accounting for the given dataset.",
        "The second is of a minimised version of the canonical machine.",
        "Our minimisation is performed initially using the sk-strings method of Raman and Patrick (1997b) and then reducing",
        "the resultant automaton further with a beam search heuristic (1997a).",
        "The sk-strings method constructs a non-deterministic finite state automaton from its canonical version by successively merging states that are indistinguishable for the top s% of their most probable output strings limited to a length of k symbols.",
        "Both s and k are variable parameters that can be set when starting program execution.",
        "In this paper, the reduced automata are the best ones that could be inferred using any value of string size (k) from 1 to 10 and any value of the agreement percentage (s) from 1 to 100.",
        "The beam search method reduces the PFSA by searching recursively through the best m descendants of the current PFSA where a descendant is defined to be the result of merging any two nodes in the parent PFSA.",
        "The variable parameter m is called the beam size and determines the exhaustiveness of the search.",
        "In this paper, m was set to 200, which was the maximum the Sun Sparcserver 1000 with 256 MB of main memory could tolerate.",
        "The final resultant PFSA, minimised thus is, strictly speaking, a generalisation of the proposed phonology.",
        "Its size is not really indicative of the complexity of the original hypothesis, but it serves to bring to light important patterns which repeat themselves in the data.",
        "The minimisation, in effect, forms additional diachronic rules and highlights regular patterns to a linguist.",
        "The size of this structure is also given in our results to show the effect of further generalisation to the linguistic hypothesis.",
        "A final point needs to be made regarding the motivation for the additional sophistication embodied in this method as compared to, say, a more simplistic phonological approach like a distance measure based on a simple summation of the number of proposed rules.",
        "Our method not only gives a measure dependent on the number of rules, but also on the interrelationship between them, or the regularity present in the whole phonology.",
        "A lower value indicates the presence of greater regularity in the derivation process.",
        "As a case in point, we may look at two closely related dialects, which have the same number of rules in their phonology from a common parent.",
        "It may be the case that one has diverged more by losing more of its original structure.",
        "As in the method of internal reconstruction, if we assume that the complexity of a language increases with time due to the presence of residual forms (Crowley, 1987, p.150-153), the PFSA derived for the more distant language will have a greater complexity than the other."

        "The Relative Chronologies (RC) of the diachronic rules given in Chen76 and CN84 propose rule orderings based on bleeding and feeding relationships between rules.3 We have tried to be as consistent as possible to the RC proposed in Chen76 and CN84.",
        "For the most part, we view violations to the RC as exceptions to their hypothesis.",
        "Consistency with the RC proposed in Chen76 and CN84 has been maintained as far as possible.",
        "For the most part, violations to them are viewed as serious exceptions.",

        "Since the n-initial is voiced, the t4-tripart rule is considered to apply exceptionally.",

        "It also needs to be mentioned that there are a few cases where an environment for the application of a rule might exist, but the rule itself may not apply although it is required to by the linguistic hypothesis.",
        "This would constitute an exception again.",
        "The details of how to handle this situation more accurately are left as a topic for future work, but we try to account for it here by applying a special rule [!A] where the `!'",
        "is meant to indicate that the rule A didn't apply when it ought to have.",
        "As an example, we may consider the derivation of Modern Cantonese hap(Tone 4a) from Middle Chinese *kh ap(Tone 4) (\"exactly\").",
        "The sequence of rules deriving the MC form is \"t4-split:spirant:x-weak:\".",
        "However, since the environment is appropriate (voiceless initial) for the application of a further rule, AC-split, after t4-split had applied, the non-application of this additional rule is specified as an exception.",
        "Thus, \"t4split:spirantx-weak:[!AC-split]:\" is the actual rule sequence used.",
        "In general, the following conventions in representing and treating exceptions have been followed as far as possible: Exceptional rules are always denoted in square brackets.",
        "They are considered excluded from the RC and thus are consistently ordered at the end of the rest of the derivation process wherever possible.",
        "A final detail concerns the status of allophonic changes in the phonology.",
        "The derivation process is actually two-stage, comprising a diachronic phase during which phonological changes take place and a synchronic phase during which allophonic changes are automatically applied.",
        "Changes caused by Cantonese or Beijing Phonotactic Constraints (PCs) are treated as allophonic rules and fall into the synchronic category, whereas PCs applying to earlier forms are treated in line with the regular diachronic rules which Chen76 calls P-rules.",
        "A minor problem presents itself when it comes to making a clear-cut separation between the historical rules proper and the synchronic allophonic rules.",
        "In Chen76 and CN84, they are not really considered part of the historical derivation process.",
        "Yet it was found that the environment for the application of a diachronic rule is sometimes produced by an allophonic rule.",
        "Such feeding relationships between allophonic and diachronic rules make the classification of those allophonic rules difficult.",
        "The only rule considered allophonic in Beijing is the *CHAMEL PC, this being a rule which determines the exact qualities of MB vowels.",
        "For Cantonese, CN84 has included two allophonic rules within its RC under bleeding and feeding relationships with P-rules.",
        "These are the BREAK-C and Y-FUSE rules, both of which concern vocalic detail.",
        "In these cases, every instance of their application within the diachronic phonology has been treated as an exception, effectively elevating these exceptions to the status of diachronic rules.",

        "Nevertheless we exercise caution in interpreting the results as such.",
        "The measures were obtained using just one of many reconstructions of Middle Chinese and one of many proposed diachronic phonologies.",
        "It is, of course, hypothetically possible that a simplistic reconstruction and an overly generalised phonology could give smaller complexity measures by resulting in less complex PFSA.",
        "One might argue that this wrongly indicates that the method of obtaining distances as described here points to the simplistic reconstruction as the better one.",
        "This problem arises partly because of the fact that the methodology outlined here assumes all linguistic hypotheses to be equally likely a-priori.",
        "We note, however, that simplicity and descriptive economy are not the only grounds for preferring one linguistic hypothesis to another (Bynon, 1983, p.47).",
        "Many other factors are usually taken into consideration to ensure whether a reconstruction is linguistically viable.",
        "Plausibility and elegance (Harms, 1990, p.314), knowledge of what kinds of linguistic changes are likely and what are unlikely (Crowley, 1987, p.90), and in the case of Chinese, insights of the \"Chinese philological tradi-tion\" (Newman, 1987) are all used when deciding the viability of a linguistic reconstruction.",
        "Thus, a final conclusion about the linguistic problem of subgrouping is still properly within the domain of historical linguists.",
        "This paper just provides a valuable tool to help quantify one of the important parameters that is used in their decision procedure.",
        "We make a further observation about the results that the complexity measures for the phonologies of Modern Beijing and Modern Cantonese are not immensely different from each other.",
        "Interestingly also, while the MML of the canonical PFSA for Modern Beijing is greater than that for Modern Cantonese, the MML of the reduced PFSA for Modern Beijing is less than that for Modern Cantonese.",
        "While the differences might be within the margin of error in constructing the derivations and the PFSA, it is possible to speculate that the generalisation process has been able to discern more structure in the diachronic phonology of Modern Beijing than in Modern Cantonese.",
        "From a computational point of view, one could say that the scope for further generalisation of the diachronic rules is greater for Modern Cantonese than for Modern Beijing or that there is greater structure in the evolution of Modern Beijing from Middle Chinese than in the evolution of Cantonese.",

        "At least one of the present authors claims the difference in MML for a single pected as they are both contemporary and have descended from a common ancestor.",
