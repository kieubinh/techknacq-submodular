        "We describe ongoing work in the experimental evaluation of a range of methods for measuring the phonetic distance between the dialectal variants of pronunciations.",
        "All are variants of Levenshtein distance, both simple (based on atomic characters) and complex (based on feature vectors).",
        "The measurements using feature vectors varied according to whether city-block distance, Euclidean distance or (a measure using) Pearson's correlation coefficient was taken as basic.",
        "Variants of these using feature weighting by entropy reduction were systematically compared, as was the representation of diphthongs (as one symbol or two).",
        "The results were compared to well-established scholarship in dialectology, yielding a calibration of the method.",
        "These results indicate that feature representations are more sensitive, that city-block distance is a good measure of phonetic overlap of feature vectors, that weighting is not useful, and that two-phone representations of diphthongs provide a more satisfactory base for this sort of comparison."

        "Dialectologists frequently speak of the range of dialects they describe as a \"continuum\", 1 which suggests a need to supersede the inherently discrete method of isoglosses.",
        "Dialectologists have long recognized the need for alternative notions of dialectal relationships (Durand (1889),p.49).",
        "1 For example, Tait on Inuit: \"a fairly unbroken chain of dialects L.] the furthest extremes of the continuum being unintelligible to one another\" (Tait (1994), p.3) It is furthermore the case that a sensitive measure of dialectal distance could have broad application to questions in sociolinguistics and historical linguistics, e.g. the significance of political boundaries, the effect of the media, etc.",
        "Levenshtein distance is a measure of string distance that has been applied to problems in speech recognition, bird song ethology, and genetics.",
        "It is presented in (Kruskal, 1983), and may be understood as the cost of (the least costly set of) operations mapping from one string to another.",
        "Kessler (1995) applied Levenshtein distance to Irish Gaelic dialects with remarkable success, and Nerbonne et al.",
        "(1996) extended the application of his techniques to Dutch dialects, similarly with respectable results.",
        "Although Kessler and Nerbonne et al.",
        "(1996) experimented with more sensitive measures, their best results were based on calculations of phonetic distance in which phonetic overlap was binary: nonidentical phones contribute to phonetic distance, identical ones do not.",
        "Thus the pair [a,t] count as different to the same degree as [a,o]."

        "It may be understood as the cost of (the least costly set of) operations mapping from one string to another.",
        "The basic costs are those of (single-phone) insertions and deletions, each of which costs half that of substitutions.",
        "Nerbonne et al.",
        "(1996) explains its use in the present application at some length.",
        "The various modifications below all tinker with the cost of substituting one phone for another.",
        "Kessler (1995) experimented with making the measure more sensitive, but found little progress in using features, for example.",
        "The present paper experiments systematically with several variations on the basic Levenshtein theme.",
        "The overall scheme is as follows: a definition of phonetic difference is applied to 101 pairs of words from forty different Dutch dialect areas.",
        "All of the pronunciations are taken from the standard dialect atlas ((Blacquart et al., 19251982) – hence: RND, Reeks Nederlandse Dialectatlassen).",
        "After some normalization, this results in an AVERAGE PHONETIC difference for those dialects – a 40 x 40 matrix of differences in total (of which one half is redundant due to the symmetry of distance: dist(a, b) = dist(b, a)).",
        "This distance matrix is compared to existing accounts of the dialects in question, especially the most recent systematic account, (Daan and Blok, 1969).",
        "A visualization tool normally identifies very deviant results, see Fig. 1.",

        "So the total distance of two dialects is equal to the sum of 101 Levenshtein-distances.",
        "If we simply use the Levenshtein-distance, it would tend to bias measurements so that changes in longer words would tend to contribute more toward the average phonetic distance (since they tend to involve more changes).",
        "This may be legitimate, but since words are a crucial linguistic unit we chose to stick to average word distance.",
        "This involves the computation of 'relative distance', which we get by dividing the absolute distance by the length of the larger word.",
        "We have also considered using the average length of the two words being compared, which makes little difference where both words are present.",

        "Naturally no difference is recorded where a word is missing in both dialects.",
        "If only one dialect is missing the word, the difference at that point is just length x insertion-cost, but normalization divides this by the length again, yielding just the cost of insertion.",

        "Although we experimented with variable costs for substitutions, depending on whether their base segments or diacritics differ, we could not settle on a natural weighting, and further reasoned that a feature-based cost-differential should systematize what the transcription-based differential intended.",

        "Dutch has a rich system of diphthongs, which, moreover have been argued to be phonologically di-segmental (Moulton, 1962).",

        "Instead, we compared the dendro-gram to the dialect map and checked for congruence.",

        "These relative distances (to ABN, represented in our data set by Haarlem and Delft) should be reflected in Levenshtein distance, and we can test the prediction by how accurate the relfection is.",
        "This method of testing has the large advantage that it tests only Levenshtein distance without involving the added level of clustering.",
        "A second method of using the dialect map to calibrate the Levenshtein metric is to use the 28 various dialect regions as predictions of \"minimal dis-tance\".",
