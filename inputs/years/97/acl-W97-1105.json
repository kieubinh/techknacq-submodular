        "A lexical database tool tailored for phonological research is described.",

        "Database queries are expressed using HTML forms, and these permit regular expression search on any combination of fields.",
        "Regular expressions are passed directly to a Perl CGI program, enabling the full flexibility of Pen extended regular expressions.",
        "The regular expression notation is extended to better support phonological searches, such as Search for minimal pairs.",
        "Search results are presented ; in the form of HTML or LATEX tables, where each cell is either a number (representing frequency) or a designated subset of the fields.",
        "Tables have up to four dimensions, with an elegant system for specifying which fragments of which fields should be used for the row/column labels.",
        "The tool offers several advantages over traditional methods of analysis: (i) it supportls a quantitative method of doing phonological research; (ii) it gives universal access to the same set of informants; (iii) it enables other researchers to hear the original speech data without having to rely on published transcriptions; (iv) it makes the full power of regular expression search available, and search results are full multimedia documents; and (v) it enables the early refutation of false hypotheses, shortening the analysis-hypothesis-test loop.",
        "A life-size application to an African tone language (Dschang) is used for exemplification throughout the paper.",
        "The database contains 2200 records, each with approximately 15 fields.",
        "Running on a PC laptop with a standalone web server, the `Dschang HyperLexicon' has already been used extensively in phonological fieldwork and analysis in Cameroon.",
        "Initial stages of phonological analysis typically focus on words in isolation, as the phonemic inventory and syllable canon are established.",
        "Data is stored as a lexicon, where each word is entered as a transcription accompanied by at least a gloss (so the word can be elicited again) and the major syntactic category.",
        "In managing a lexicon, the working phonologist has a variety of computational needs: storage and retrieval; searching and sorting; tabular reports on distributions and contrasts; updates to database and to reports as distinctions are discovered or discarded.",
        "In the past the analyst had to do all this computation by hand using index cards kept in shoeboxes.",
        "But now many of these particular tasks are automated by software such as the SIL programs Shoebox (Buseman et al., 1996) and Findphone (Bevan, 1995),1 or using commercial database packages.",
        "Of course, many tasks other than those listed above have already benefitted from (partial) automation.2 Additionally, it has been shown how a computational inheritance model can be used for structuring lexical information relevant for phonology (Reinhard & Gibbon, 1991).",
        "And there is a body of work on the use of finite state devices – closely related to regular expressions – for modelling phonological phenomena (Kaplan & Kay, 1994) and for speech processing (cf. Kornai's",
