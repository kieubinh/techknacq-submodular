        "Prosody, particularly the placement of phrasing and relatively prominent syllables within an utterance, is important in human understanding of speech.",
        "(Boogaartand Silverman, 1992; Price et.al., 1991) While great improvements in the prosody of synthetic speech have been made over the past decade, naturalness itself has proved elusive (Boogaartand Silverman, 1992; Veilleux, 1994).",
        "One reason for the remaining differences between synthetic and human speech is an incomplete understanding of the mapping between the speaker's intended meaning and that meaning's acoustic consequences, which are, in part, encoded in the prosodic structure (Price et.al., 1991).",
        "Prosody, therefore, is an important part of the route from meaning to speech.",
        "In order to see how prosody can be improved in automatic speech synthesis systems, it is useful to examine what is known about the relationship between prosody and the acoustic speech signal on the one hand and between prosody and the meaning embedded in that speech on the other.",
        "Clearly, prosody is related to the acoustic speech signal.",
        "In human speech, prosodic phrases and prominence are cued by acoustic features such as f0 contour and duration.",
        "For example, final syllable lengthening and a descending f0 pattern on the word think (as well as know) will lead the listener to the perceive a phrase break between know and I in the underlined utterance: Don't you think Michael Jordan is great?",
        "I don't think; I know.",
        "Furthermore, this sentence might reasonably be produced with a pitch accent (e.g. an H*, or rise/fall f0 pattern) on the words think and know, lending the perception that these two words are more prominent than other words in the utterance and that they are being contrasted (Prevost, 1996).",
        "Prosody is also related to higher order linguistic structures such as the syntax of an utterance.",
        "In the above example, the main clauses [S I don't think] and [S I know] align with major prosodic phrase breaks.",
        "Other researchers, as well as myself, have gainfully used this prosody/syntax relationship in both speech synthesis and speech analysis (automatic recognition and understanding) applications.",
        "(e.g. (Veilleux, 1996; Wang and Hirschberg, 1992)).",
        "Also note that the same word string could be used to convey the opposite meaning, as in What's the capital of Sri Lanka?",
        "I don't think I know.",
        "However, this sentence does not have the same syntactic structure and one would not expect the same prosodic structure (e.g. there would be less of a \"break\" after think in the second example).",
        "However, just as syntax is not fully determined by word choice or order, syntax is not the only factor that determines the prosodic structure.",
        "For example (from (Steedman, 1991)), the sentence",
        "can be naturally produced with a major phrase break bisecting the verb phrase: (Mary prefers) (corduroy).",
        "It is reasonable to conclude that prosody is constrained by factors in addition to (and possibly in conflict with) syntax.",
        "The following example shows that semantic issues also play a role in determining prosody.",
        "Did she come with Bill's wife?",
        "* No, she came with BILL's sister.",
        "Bill is inappropriately produced with prosodic prominence (denoted by the use of capital letters) given the intention of the speaker to directly answer the question.",
        "Notice that the following pair is perceived as appropriate: Did she come with John's sister?",
        "No, she came with BILL's sister.",
        "Considerations of this kind suggest that prosody is therefore linked to the syntax and semantics of an utterance, which in turn are related to the speaker's intentions, or the concept that the speaker wishes to convey.",
        "Collectively, syntax and semantic structure will be referred to here as the information structure of an utterance.",
        "However, we purposely leave information structure as a loosely defined term that can be expanded as our understanding of the relationship between prosody and the meaning embedded in speech evolves.",
        "Therefore, we find that prosody is related to the information structure on one hand and to the acoustic signal on the other.",
        "Consequently, prosody can be useful as a bridge, or intermediary representation between concept and speech.",
        "This work presents a general methodology for deriving a formalism to describe the acoustic/ prosody/ concept relationships for use in automatic spoken language systems, by generating a mapping between the acoustics of speech on one hand, and a syntactic/semantic representation of the speaker's intentions on the other.",
        "This computational mapping serves to create an acoustic/ prosody/ concept model.",
        "Most recent applications of this model have been in the area of automatic speech recognition where the acoustic/ prosody/ syntax mapping' was used to decrease word error (Veilleux, 1996).",
        "However, the mapping is bi-directional, and this model can be used for speech synthesis as well as for speech analysis (recognition and understanding).",
        "The method for doing so will be presented after the model is described in more detail.",
        "The consequences of the analysis of the relationships between information structure, prosody and speech described above show that the use of prosody in concept-to-speech synthesis (CTS) can not be achieved merely as plug-in extension of prosody models that have been developed for text-to-speech (TTS) systems (e.g. (Veilleux, 1994; Wang and Hirschberg, 1992)).",
        "Although prosody models could be applied after the generation of the word string, as in TTS applications, prosodic structure must be determined not only by the word string, but also by the meaning-specific syntax and semantic structure.",
        "The lack of mapping between this information structure and prosody is partly responsible for the persistent unnaturalness in synthetic speech.",
        "Clearly, there are many aspects of the factors that determine prosodic structure that are still to be understood.",
        "While the acoustic correlates of prosody(Pierrehumbert80, 1980; t'Hart et.al., 1990) and the relationships between prosody and syntax (e.g. (Selkirk, 1984; BachenkoFitzpatrick, 1990; Ostendorf and Veilleux, 1993; Gee and Grosjean, 1983; Wang and Hirschberg, 1992; Terken and Hirsh-berg, 1994)), have been investigated in some length, the mapping and interactions between these domains has not been completely quantified.",
        "Moreover, the effect of other factors such as focus and discourse structure on prosody, have not been studied as extensively.",
        "A strength of the model presented here is that it is general, and therefore adaptable as our understanding of the prosody/ concept and prosody/speech relationships improves.",
        "This generality in the formalism will be pointed out as the model is described.",
        "One more general comment about this model is in order before we turn to the details.",
        "The formalism presented here is probabilistic.",
        "It is data-driven (labeled training data is used to derive model parameters, i.e. the probabilities).",
        "It therefore has",
        "the strengths of corpus-driven approaches in that it is informed by a large body of example.",
        "It also has the characteristic weakness of probabilistic models in that it tends to generalize unless otherwise directed (e.g. by manipulating misclassification costs, or providing constraints to distinguish different events.)",
        "One other feature of the model presented here is that it explicitly incorporates linguistic knowledge in the design of decision trees used as probability estimators.",
        "This serves to cluster data according to linguistic context, decreasing the bias towards generalizing the most prevalent."

        "If the task of automatic speech synthesis can be framed as that of selecting the most probable acoustic production associated with a text string annotated for intended meaning, it can be achieved by finding",
        "That is, by finding the acoustic sequence x that maximizes the joint probability of the acoustic sequence given the meaning or concept the speaker wishes to convey.",
        "For this work, the word string itself is assumed to have been generated in a prior step.",
        "Therefore, the acoustic sequence would be a sequence of prosody related supra-segmental features.",
        "The term meaning is quite open to interpretation.",
        "For the purposes of this work, meaning will be assumed to be straightforwardly encoded in the information structure, that is, the syntax and semantic structure of the utterance.",
        "For the present, information structure (denoted by I in the equations below) represents some aspects of the underlying concept that are covered by theory (such as syntax) or description (such as an instantiation of a focussed constituent).",
        "This structure will be represented as annotations on the text string, which can serve as input to a speech synthesis system.",
        "What features, beyond syntax, are relevant and can be reliably annotated is, of course, an open research question, that will probably be answered over time.",
        "Some suggestions for features and a method for incorporating them in this probabilistic model are described in Section 3.",
        "So, returning to the model derivation, we see that we wish to find argm,ax„p(xj/), (2) that is, the acoustic sequence x that maximizes the probability of the acoustics given the informational annotation.",

        "This sequence of abstract prosodic labels describe an ordered set of prosodic events, such as prominence and phrasing.",
        "In order to capture these prosodic events in a computational model, this work uses prosodic labels based on the ToBI transcription convention (Tones and Break Indices, see (Silverman et.al., 1992)).",
        "The ToBI system labels prosodic prominence with a pitch accent type (Tone), from a subset of Pierrehum-bert's inventory (Pierrehumbert80, 1980).",
        "In previous work, data with this level of detail was not available so the simple label of ± prominence on each syllable was used.",
        "Prosodic phrasing is captured by placing a break index (BI: 0 to 4) at each word juncture, to indicate the level of decoupling between the words.",
        "For example, the juncture between two words in a clitic group would be labeled with a 0 break index.",
        "At the other end of the spectrum, the junction between two words separated by a major prosodic phrase would be labeled with a 4 break index.",
        "Moreover, the ToBI system allows one to label prosodic events that are conspicuous in spontaneous speech.",
        "For example, significant lengthening of a final syllable, without the comcommittant intonational cues associated with prosodic phrasing can be labeled with a diacritic.",
        "If these events serve a communicative purpose in informal speech (marking focus, holding the floor) then future models may make use of these labels.",
        "Applying Bayes' Law to Equation 3:",
        "This form of the equation more clearly reflects the use of prosody as an intermediate representation, relating the acoustic sequence to the information structure by modeling p(x12-) in terms of the conditional probability of acoustic sequence given the prosodic structure (p(xla)) and the conditional probability of prosody given the information structure (p(a11)).",
        "The model parameters can be estimated using statistical methods: in this work, using an automatically derived binary decision trees.",
        "In speech synthesis applications, each prosodic event can be realized by manipulating the acoustic signal according to a set of context-based f0",
        "and duration rules (va,nSanten, 1993).",
        "For example, a syllable labeled with a high pitch accent (II* or simply +prominence from this work), would be given a rise/fall f0 contour, adjusted according to e.g. the duration of the vowel, etc.",
        "In such applications, p (x/a), the probability of the acoustic parameters given the prosodic labels, is fully determined by these rules alone.",
        "Although a stochastic model of prosody and acoustic features could be useful in more specifically determining the correlates of prosody in fO, duration and vowel quality, it is left to future work to incorporate a probabilistic acoustic model of prosody in the synthesis algorithm.",

        "Furthermore, though useful to simplify the decoding problem, independence assumptions are probably not viable once demands on spoken language systems become more sophisticated.",
        "Several prosodic models have been developed that relax this assumption.",
        "For example, work in predicting prominence by (Ross et.al., 1992) makes use of a Markov assumption.",
        "Also, a hierarchical model (Ostendorf and Veilleux, 1993), makes use of the strict layer hypothesis of prosodic phrase structure, assuming that a well-formed utterance is comprised of major phrases, which are in turn comprised of minor phrases.",

        "First, binary trees can be used to map heterogeneous features to prosodic labels.",
        "Features can be continuous (e.g. degree of syntactic bracketing) or discrete (e.g. classes of function word types).",
        "Furthermore, the features can be inter-dependent, such as location of the last predicted phrase boundary or prominence.",
        "The automatic algorithm which determines the tree structure typically chooses features to minimize misclassification of prosodic labels, and as such, can indicate how relevant a feature is in the choice of a particular prosodic label.",

        "This model therefore allows us to map information structure onto prosodic structure, or, alternatively, to map acoustic parameters onto prosodic structure.",
        "Binary decision trees, like the one shown in Figure 1, are a series of binary questions about features (text-derived syntactic, grammatical and pragmatic properties in this case).",
        "Each data token (a data token would be a word pair in trees designed to predict prosodic phrase breaks and a single syllable to predict ± prominence), is \"dropped\" through the tree, starting with the root question.",
        "In the example shown here, a binary decision tree has been grown to predict the phrase break index between each word pair.",
        "The root node represents the question Is the left word a content word and the right word a function word?",
        "If the answer is no, the word pair is dropped to the lower right node, and examined in the light of that node's question (What function word class is the right word?).",
        "The process is repeated until the data token reaches a leaf (terminal node).",
        "In some cases (Wang and Hirschberg, 1992) the leaf node would be associated with a specific prediction, e.g. phrase break index 1, and the word pairs shunted to this leaf node would be pre",
        "Each data token (a word pair) is shunted along a path from the root to a leaf node.",
        "Features include syntactic derivations (e.g. domift means \"what is the highest syntactic constituency that dominates the left word but not the right word\"), word class type, degree of syntactic bracketing, relative position in the syntax tree and relative position in the sentence.",

        "The distributions are then used in the computational model described above to find the most likely sequence of prosodic labels.",
        "Again, the advantage of decoding the entire sequence is that one is able to explicitly make use of the interdependencies in the assignment of specific prosodic labels as in (Ostendorf and Veilleux, 1993).",
        "Furthermore, focus might be marked by a confluence of prominence and phrasing (Selkirk, 1997), requiring a relaxation of the assumption that these events are independent.",
        "In order to see how a decision tree is used as a conditional probability estimator rather than as a predictor, recall how such a tree is originally constructed.",
        "Binary decision trees, like most statistical models, are derived using labeled training data.",
        "In this case, the training data would be hand-labeled prosodically (ToBI) and would be associated with features automatically extracted for each data token.",
        "The tree in the example above was derived to estimate the conditional probability of the prosodic break indices (bi), given",
        "• syntactic constituency and derivation rules, • part-of-speech classes, • and pragmatic rules such as relative location in the utterance.",
        "To generate this p(bilT(syntax)) tree, data tokens (word pairs) were hand-labeled for prosodic break indices, analyzed by an automatic parser and other feature extraction programs equipped with e.g. function word tables and dictionaries, to produce a labeled database.",
        "A similar tree was also generated to estimate the probability of ± prominence, given similar syntactic/pragmatic features.",
        "To estimate the conditional probabilities between prosodic labels and acoustic signal, trees have also been derived using acoustic features such as normalized fO, duration, and vowel quality (Wightman, 1991).",
        "After the database is fully labeled, an automatic tree-growing algorithm partitions this training data based on one of these extracted features (in Figure 1 the cw-fw feature) into two subsets, each more homogeneous with respect to break indices than the whole set 3 .",
        "The partitioning process is repeated on each of the subsets, using one of the extracted features and each time producing children subsets that are more homogeneous than their parents.",
        "Ideally, the final subsets, which share a particular syntactic/ pragmatic context, would contain data where all word pairs had been labeled with the same break index, prompting only a single prediction.",
        "However, this is unlikely, since all factors that determine prosody are either not yet understood, such as focus structure, or can not be known from text, such as speaking rate, and thus are not used in the partitioning process.",
        "Instead, each of the final subsets has a distribution of prosodic labels that can be used to estimate a probability distribution p(al/eafi).",
        "In this example, each leaf represents a unique path which serves to describe a distribution of prosodic labels as a function of the syntax and related features.",
        "Therefore p(alieafi) = p(alT(syntax)).",

        "Sorin (Sorin et.al, 1987) has shown that prosodic phrase breaks in French tend to correspond with just cw-fw junctions.",
        "Although this rule over-generates phrase boundaries in English, the choice of this feature in the decision tree indicates a persistent correlation.",
        "3 Use of semantic features in the prosody/concept mapping Previous work has made use of this probabilistic model of the relationships between prosody, the acoustic signal and information structure (Veilleux, 1996) but only insofar as information structure could be captured using syntax and related features.",
        "From the examples above, it is clear that prosody, even prosodic phrase structure, is not constrained by syntax alone.",
        "What remains to be investigated and incorporated are other factors that constrain prosody and are related to the concept the speaker intends to convey.",
        "One such feature of the information structure is the placement of focussed constituents in an utterance.",
        "The literature presents a variety of definitions of semantic focus, some describing focus in terms of semantic intent (Rooth, 1994; Gussenhoven, 1994) and others more directly in relationship to givenness (Schwarzschild, 1997).",
        "Furthermore, some definitions of focus overlap with rheme (Prevost, 1996), while others do not.",
        "In any case, focus is generally agreed to be linked to pitch accent placement (e.g. (Selkirk, 1984)) and probably to phrase break placement as well (Selkirk, 1997)).",
        "This focus/prosody relationship presents an opportunity to generate synthetic speech that has a more appropriately assigned prosodic structure, reflecting the underlying meaning to be conveyed.",
        "As the mapping between prosody and focus is investigated more fully, results can be incorporated into the computational model presented here by simply representing focus markings as labeled features in the binary tree.",
        "Some promising work by Selkirk (Selkirk, 1997) describes the choice of prosodic phrase structure to be the outcome of an ordering of competing factors, including focus, syntax and pragmatic constraints.",
        "While some constraints may be violable (such as the alignment of major prosodic breaks with syntactic boundaries), the outcome is optimal, i.e. it conforms to the constraints of the highest ranked factor (e.g. the alignment of a major prosodic phrase boundary with the right edge of a focussed constituent).",
        "Previous use of the acoustic/prosody/syntax model has already established the function of syntactic edges to predict prosodic phrasing (note the use of e.g. domift features in the tree given in Figure 1).",
        "Labeling the right edges of focussed constituents in training data and growing a binary decision tree based on this additional feature, will generate probability distributions as functions of the focus as well as syntactic and pragmatic structure.",
        "If the supposition about the relationship between focussed constituents and prosodic boundaries is represented in data, such a feature should be selected as useful in decreasing the misclassification of prosodic phrase break indices between two words in the automatic design of a binary tree.",
        "Moreover, a ranking implies an interaction of factors, each of which can be encoded as binary tree features.",
        "The order in which the features are selected in the tree structure, as well as their co-occurance (or lack of) on a root-leaf path, can indicate potential areas of interaction or redundancy.",
        "In this way, binary decision trees not only generate conditional probabilities for synthesis models, but also test hypotheses about the relative use of a feature in predicting a prosodic label.",
        "Work by Prevost explicitly addresses the relationship between theme-rheme and prosodic prominence and phrase placement in cases of explicit contrast.",
        "This work significantly extends previous heuristics concerning newness and pitch accent placement.",
        "Again, training data labeled with theme-rheme notation, and devising a feature for the decision tree growing algorithm to select, would incorporate this rule in the estimation of probabilities of prosodic structure.",
        "Another active and related area of research that addresses the relationship between higher order linguistic structure and prosodic structure has been explored by (Terken and Hirshberg, 1994) and (Nakatani, 1993).",
        "The latter work examines the placement of accents, as constrained by the interaction of discourse, surface structure and lexical form.",
        "Pitch accent placement on pronouns as well as on explicit forms in the subject position motivate theory that describes new and givenness in terms of a hierarchical discourse structure (Grosz and Sidner 1986).",
        "Again, the implications of this theoretical framework can be extracted as features for generating conditional probabilities of prosodic events, with reference to the theory.",
        "One such feature could be an annotation of discourse segmentation in the input text.",
        "Using this annotation as a feature in the binary tree would also serve to allow the tree to chose limits on how far back in the history list to look for an antecedent.",
        "If the pronoun represents a new (re-introduced) item within this window, it may be more likely to be accented.",
        "Again, as a feature in a decision tree, this property would be a candidate for selection to minimize misclassification error and generate conditional probabilities that are functions of the discourse environment.",
        "In summary, the formalism for incorporating emerging linguistic theory in a joint model of the acoustic/prosody/concept relationships is described",
        "here.",
        "It makes use of binary decision trees to estimate model parameters, the conditional probabilities.",
        "The binary decision trees themselves, make use of explicit linguistic infOrmation to partition data into more homogeneous prosodic contexts.",
        "In doing so, the model remains general, and can accommodate the results of our evolving understanding of the interaction between factors that determine prosody.",
        "While this model has been successful in both speech synthesis and analysis applications, it has made use of syntactic and pragmatic information alone.",
        "Extension of this model to map prosodic structure to other higher order linguistic structures that more fully describe the meaning that an utterance is to convey is straightforward.",
        "As hypotheses are developed in the ranking of competing constraints, including focus structure, and in the role of discourse history, they can be integrated into the model as features in the binary decision tree."
