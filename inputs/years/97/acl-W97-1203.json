        "This type of processing is known as incremental processing.",
        "The acoustic speech signal is by its nature volatile; it can only be heard once.",
        "This makes it imperative that the generator provides the synthesizer with all information necessary to produce high-quality speech.",
        "In human speech, information is conveyed not only in the individual words, but also in the prosody which provides the listener in many subtle ways how these words are related to each other.",
        "It often conveys information not explicitly contained in the spoken words, such as the focal point of a sentence or the contrast of certain words (ideas) with other spoken or unspoken words.",
        "A prerequisite for high-grade synthetic speech is therefore that all phonologically and prosodically relevant information contained in the concepts forwarded to the generator and the syntactic structure produced by it be passed on in a suitable form to the synthesis module.",
        "Only the consideration of structural information can assure the production of high-quality prosody by the synthesis module.",
        "The details of these \"phonological\" structures are of course language dependent, but there are certain properties common to all languages.",
        "As the overall system described here is strictly modular and (in principle) multilingual, the phonologically relevant information of an utterance has to be coded in a high-level interface protocol, that can both be output by a variety of generators as well as used as input for a variety of synthesis modules.",

        "The speech generation and synthesis modules have to be able to run in real time and to produce high â€“ quality speech output.",
        "To produce naturally sounding speech, the synthesizer has to have not only the knowledge of the words to utter and the order in which they appear but also information about their structural relationship.",
        "The latter is expressed acoustically in the form of prosody, i.e. how the voice raises and falls during an utterance, the rhythm, where pauses are set, etc.",
        "Prosody is also influenced by the properties associated with given words in the context of an utterance, e.g. the focus of a sentence or certain emphatic elements.",
        "This article describes a compact representation for conveying this type of information from the generator to the synthesizer in a modular system and describes how (parts of) this information is (are) derived in the EFFENDI system, the generation module for a speech dialogue system for train inquiries."

        "The speech generation and synthesis modules of a speech dialogue system are very important, since they form the output \"visible\" to the user.",
        "Natural-language generation for a speech dialogue system must therefore operate in real time.",
        "In a system which outputs speech, real time is essentially the time the system takes before it starts to utter what it has to say.",
        "The reaction time to the previous user input should be minimal.",
        "One way of increasing",
        "pends on the structure of the semantic input concepts and the syntactic structures generated from them, section 2 gives a short overview of the dialogue management module and our generation system that has been developed in the EFFENDI project'.",
        "Section 3 then describes the compact representation for prosodically relevant knowledge and briefly indicates how the information for this representation is obtained from the input concepts of the generator and the syntactic structures generated from them.",
        "As incremental generation often requires the repair of some previously generated parts, section 4 considers the effects of incremental generation that concern the synthesis module and how we try to avoid unnecessary repetitions of words as far as possible.",
        "The final section describes the goals of the ongoing work in EFFENDI.",
        "2 Overview of the Dialogue System The syntactic generator EFFENDI is integrated into the speech dialogue system implemented by Daimler-Benz.",
        "The generator itself is particularily adapted to the specific needs of a real time speech dialogue system (cf. (Poller and Heisterkamp 1997)).",
        "A more detailed description of the diaogue system as a whole can be found elsewhere (cf. e.g. (Brietzmann et al.",
        "1994), (Hanrieder and Heisterkamp 1994) or also (Heisterkamp 1993)).",
        "We will thus restrict our description to those components of the dialogue system that interact with the generator.",
        "The planning of a system utterance (also called \"strategic generation\" or \"what-to-say\") is the main task of the dialogue management component.",
        "This means the determination of the appropriate type of utterance in a given dialogue situation, the items that are to be talked about in which manner or style and finally to deliver a semantic description of the utterance to the syntactic generator.",
        "A module called the Dialogue Manager operates with a set of goals (cf. e.g. (Heisterlcamp and Mc-Glashan 1996)) that result from the contextual interpretation of the user utterance in a Belief Module ((Heisterkamp et al.",
        "1992)), the requirements of the application system, and the current confirmation strategy (cf. (Heisterkamp 1993)).",
        "'EFFENDI stands for \"EFfizientes FormulierEN von DIalogbeitrigen\" (Efficient formulation of dialogue contributions) and is a joint research project of the DFKI Saarbriicken and Daimler-Benz Research Ulm.",
        "2Historically, our dialogue system goes back in part to the one developed in the SUNDIAL project.",
        "The architecture of that system was laid out to accommodate a generator (cf. (Youd and McGlashan 1992), but for various reasons the work on this aspect was discontinued.",
        "The Dialogue Module selects from the overall set of goals that subset which should constitute the next system utterance.",
        "A Message Planner receives this subset consisting of types utterances (e.g. a request for confirmation), the task item of that goal (e.g. a departure place) and the status of this item (new, repeated n times).",
        "It requests a semantic description of that task item from the Belief Module.",
        "The semantic description is then combined with the dialogue goal types for the phrase type markers (e.g. question) and verbosity markers inferred from the status (e.g. the possibility of ellipting a verb or reducing it to a prepositional phrase) to result in a semantic structure3.",
        "This semantic structure is then passed on to the generation module.",
        "A special interface translates these semantic representations into syntactically oriented input specifications for the generator.",
        "The most important property of the EFFENDI generator is its incrementality.",
        "Incremental generation means that both the consumption of the input elements as well as the production of the output elements work in a piecemeal and interleaved fashion.",
        "Input consumption and output production interleave in such a way that first parts of a sentence are uttered before the generation process is finished and even before all input elements are consumed.",
        "This kind of flexible syntactic generation is only possible if the processing can be broken down into a large set of independent tasks which can run in parallel (cf. (Kempen and Hoenlcamp 1982)).",
        "Applying this principle, generation in EFFENDI is realized by synchronizing a set of actively communicating, independent processes (so-called objects) each of which is responsible for the syntactic realization of an input element and its integration into the syntactic structure of the whole utterance (cf. (Kilger 1994)).",
        "In addition, incremental generation should be separated into two main computational steps.",
        "The first step must comprise the construction of the hierarchical (syntactic) structure.",
        "The word order of the surface string is computed in a second step (linearization).",
        "The reason for this separation is the observation that decisions at the hierarchical level are often possible at a time where input information is not yet sufficient to make decisions at the positional level ((Kilger 1994)).",
        "Incremental syntactic generation can therefore be organized as follows.",
        "The incremental input interface immediately translates each incoming input specification into an independent process (object).",
        "This process immediately and independently runs the following computational steps.",
        "At the hierarchical level, an elementary syntactic structure for the individual input element is selected.",
        "In order to build a virtual syntactic structure for the whole sentence, the objects exchange structural and syntactic information by explicitely sending messages to related objects.",
        "An object that completes the structural combination with related objects, changes to the positional level the task of which is the determination of the resulting word order of the surface string (linearization) and its output.",
        "Linearization and output production have to be synchronized with respect to the word order that globally results from the local linearizations.",
        "So, incremental output production is organized as a global visit of all objects.",
        "As soon as an object has finished its linearization, it can be uttered, i.e. sent to the synthesizer.",
        "The incrementality of the output is automatically ensured because the individual objects finish their local linearizations at different times."

        "The goal of the interface protocol is to form a compact representation that contains all phonologically and prosodically relevant information which the generator can currently derive from its concept input or the syntactic structures generated from it.",
        "Both are relevant for phonological realisation, but they neither are nor directly contain the phonological knowledge itself, as the strategic generation, linguistic generation and final synthesis task are divided into different modules.",
        "The representation concerns categories that the prosodic construction makes use of rather than instructing it directly.4 A phonologically oriented description suitable for generating proper sentence prosody differs in many aspects from the traditional syntactically oriented description normally produced by a sentence generator such as EFFENDI.",
        "The following section shows how the basic phonological specification can be derived from existing semantic and syntactic structures of art utterance in three main steps.",
        "For reasons of simplicity the treatment of incremental processing is postponed to the next section.",
        "\"In integrated systems, where conceptual construction, generation and synthesis have full mutual access to the relevant knowledge, there is no need for such an interface, and the linguistic grammar can directly incorporate the phonological features (cf. e.g. (Prevost and Steedman 1994)).",
        "However, apart for lack of flexi-blility, integrated systems mostly must make use of the concept-to-speech synthesis ((Steedman 1996)), whereas the interface presented here can also be used with a text-to-speech synthesis."
