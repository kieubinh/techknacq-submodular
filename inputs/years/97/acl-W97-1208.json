        "Within the framework of Concept-to-speech, our aim is to integrate additonal information such as structuring, focus, dialogue act, speaker attitude into the prosodic modelling of synthesized utterances.",
        "The first step into this direction is to find out which additional information is reflected in the prosodic structure.",
        "An investigation as to what information about the content of an utterance is actually encoded in the prosody and how this coding is realized by the natural speaker is inherently necessary [Lib74].",
        "The aim for more natural prosody generation can only be determined by an adequate description of human prosody and its interaction with content information.",
        "In this paper we propose a method determining which linguistic concepts have a functional influence on prosody.",
        "Prosody is known to be of a very complex nature, yet we cannot per se suggest that every communicative function is relevantly encoded it in.",
        "At least we have to distinguish between functions that necessarily pertain to the prosodic structure, and those that are not identifiably located within prosody.",
        "Once the relevant concepts have been found, their influence on the acoustic parameters related to prosody can be investigated."
