        "We are in the process of developing a system for interpreting definite descriptions (DDs) in written text without restrictions of domain.",
        "The implementation work has been supported by an analysis of definite description use in corpora of written language (Poesio and Vieira, 1997).",
        "In one of our experiments, we asked 2 subjects to classify the uses of definite descriptions in a corpus of English textsl using a taxonomy derived from the proposals of (Clark, 1977; Hawkins, 1978; Prince, 1981; Fraurud, 1990; Prince, 1992).",
        "In the taxonomy used in that study, we defined bridging references as those uses of definite descriptions based on previous discourse which require some reasoning in the identification of their textual antecedent (rather than just matching identical nouns).",
        "These definite descriptions may be co-referential with an entity already introduced in the discourse, but be characterized by a different head noun (as in a car ... the vehicle); or may be simply semantically related to it (in the sense that the door is related to house).",
        "Of the 1040 DDs in that corpus, 204 (20%) were identified as bridging descriptions, 312 (30%) as anaphoric (DDs and antecedents",
        "which co-refer and have the same head noun), and 492 (47%) as larger situation/unfamiliar (Hawkins, 1978) (Prince's discourse new (Prince, 1992)); the remaining definite descriptions were classified as idiomatic or doubtful cases.",
        "These results led us to concentrate initially on resolving same-head anaphoric DDs and on recognising larger situation/unfamiliar uses.",
        "Our analysis of the corpus suggested that many of the latter could be recognised using syntactic heuristics: e.g., on the basis of the presence of restrictive pre and post-modification, of the presence of special predicates (such as the superlatives first, best), or because the DD occurred in a copula or appositive construction.",
        "A first prototype with these capabilities (Vieira and Poesio, 1997) achieved an overall recall of 56% and precision of 84% when tested on our corpus.",
        "Of all anaphoric DDs 72% were resolved, and 74% of all larger situation and unfamiliar uses were identified.",
        "The definite descriptions not handled by this first prototype were typically larger situation uses based on common knowledge (such as the government) and bridging descriptions.",
        "In this paper we present our subsequent work devoted to handling some of these remaining cases."

        "Linguistic and computational theories of bridging descriptions identify two main subtasks involved in their resolution: first, finding the element in the text to which the bridging description is related (ANCHOR) and second, finding the relation (LINK) holding between the bridging description and its anchor (Clark, 1977; Sidner, 1979; Heim, 1982; Carter, 1987; Fraurud, 1990; Strand, 1997).",
        "A speaker is licensed to use a bridging DD when he/she can assume that the common-sense knowledge required to identify the relation is shared by the listener (Hawkins, 1978; Clark and Marshall, 1981; Prince, 1981).",
        "This reliance on commonsense",
        "knowledge means that, in general, a system could only resolve bridging references when supplied with an adequate knowledge base; for this reason, the typical way of implementing a system for resolving bridging references has been to restrict the domain and feeding the system with hand-tailored world knowledge.",
        "(This approach is discussed in detail in (Carter, 1987)).",
        "In order to get a system capable of performing on unrestricted text, we decided to use WordNet (WN) (Miller, 1993) as an approximation of a knowledge base containing generic information, and to supplement it with heuristics to handle those cases which WN couldn't handle.",
        "Vieira and Teufel (1997) analyzed the corpus to identify the cases of bridging descriptions that could be resolved using WordNet, those for which we could use heuristics, and those that couldn't be interpreted at the moment.",
        "Six classes of bridging descriptions were identified.2 Synonymy/Hyponymy/Meronymy This class (henceforth, Syn/Hyp/Mer) includes those DDs which are in a synonymy/hyponymy/meronymy relation with their anchors, i.e., the kind of semantic relation that is currently encoded in WordNet.",
        "Examples' are:",
        "(1) a. Synonymy: new album – the record; three bills – the legislation.",
        "b. Hypernymy-Hyponymy: rice – the plant; the daily television show – the program.",
        "c. Meronymy (part-of relation): plants – the pollen; house – the chimney.",
        "Names This class includes definite descriptions that refer back to proper names such as people's and company names, as in: (2) Bach – the composer; Pinkerton's Inc – the company.",
        "Compound Nouns This class includes bridging descriptions whose LINGUISTIC ANCHOR (i.e., the element in the text to which they are related) is a noun occurring as part of a compound noun other than the head.",
        "Examples include: (3) stock market crash – the markets; discount",
        "packages – the discounts.",
        "Events These are cases where the linguistic anchors of DDs are not NPs but VPs or sentences.",
        "Examples are:",
        "(4) Individual investors and professional money managers contend.",
        " – They make the argument ...; Kadane Oil Co. is currently drilling two wells and putting money into three others.",
        " – The activity ... Discourse Topic There are some cases of DDs which are related to the (often implicit) discourse topic (in the sense of (Reinhart, 1981)) of a text, rather than to some specific NP or VP.",
        "For instance, (5) the industry (in a text whose discourse topic",
        "is oil companies); the first half (in a text whose discourse topic is a concert).",
        "Inference We collect in this class all the cases of bridging descriptions whose relation with their NP anchor was based on more complex inferential relations: for example, cases in which the relation between the anchor and the DD was of reason, cause, consequence, or set-membership: (6) last week's earthquake – the suffering people are going through; Democratics/Republicans – the two sides.",
        "The relative importance of these classes in our corpus is shown in Table 1.",
        "This classification is based on what we took to be the main linking relation for each of the 204 bridging DDs in the corpus'."

        "of the following is true:",
        "• The nouns are in the same synset (= synonyms of each other), as in suit – lawsuit.",
        "• The nouns are in direct hyponymy relation with each other, for instance, dollar – currency.",
        "• There is a direct or indirect meronymy between them.",
        "Indirect meronymy holds when a concept inherits parts from its hypernyms, like car inherits the part wheel from its hypernym wheeled_vehicle.",
        "• Due to WordNet's idiosyncratic encoding, it is often necessary to look for a semantic relation between coordinate sisters, i.e. hyponyms of the same hypernym, such as home – house which are hyponyms of housing, lodging.",
        "Sometimes, if a relation between two head nouns is not encoded in WN directly, the semantic closeness might be found through the compound nouns made up of them.",
        "Thus, for a pair such as record, album we find synonymy between record_album and album.",
        "We ran a test in which WordNet was used to identify the DD's anchors.",
        "For each of the 204 bridging DDs in our corpus, we considered the NPs in the previous five sentences as a potential anchor', and queried WN with the DD and potential anchor pair.",
        "WordNet reported a possible relation for 107 of the 204 DDs.",
        "Often, more than one link was found between a DD and a potential anchor,' and sometimes links could be found with more than one potential anchor in the previous five sentences.",
        "Only in 34 of these 107 cases we found at least one appropriate anchor linking relation, and only in 21 cases we found only appropriate anchors (for 13 there was a mixture of suitable and unsuitable anchors).",
        "Of these 34 DDs for which a correct anchor was found, only 18 were among those we had classified as Syn/Hyp/Mer.",
        "In 8 of these 18 cases, WordNet found a link with an anchor that was not the one we had identified manually, but which was still valid; for instance, we identified the link pound – the currency which was not found in WordNet, whereas our automatic search found sterling – the currency).",
        "The 16 remaining relations were found for DDs that we had not classified as Syn/Hyp/Mer: for instance, whereas we had classified the DD the population as belonging to the class of DDs based on names having as anchor Koreans, our implementation found a WordNet relation for the pair nation – the population; the system also found a few relations with proper names, such as Bach – the composer.",
        "In the following tests we have considered only direct meronymy, as indirect meronymy presented extreme low recall and precision at a very expensive computational cost.",
        "In order to reduce the number of false positives (86 out of 107)7. we tried using a stack-based approach towards finding potential anchors in the previous sentences, as suggested in (Sidner, 1979); i.e., the system would go back one sentence at a time, and stop as soon as a relation with a potential anchor was found, rather than trying to find all possible links.",
        "As a result, we found exactly one correct anchor for 30 DDs, slightly improving our results (76 false positives).",
        "Table 2 shows the distribution of the different semantic relations between DDs and the anchors found by our stack-based search.",
        "It presents precision figures (P) related to each type of relation8.",
        "Sister relations are the least satisfactory ones.",
        "We tested, in particular, whether WordNet encoded a semantic link between the 38 syn/hyp/mer relations in our corpus (just described) plus other 32 relations extracted from a second corpus study (Poesio and Vieira, 1997).",
        "The results for the 70 DDs are summarised in Table 3.",
        "Overall recall (R) was 46%.",
        "We could have expected 100% precision, since we had manually identified the anchors, but the precision figures (P) report an error when a sister relation is found instead of the expected (syn/hyp/mer) re-7 The anchors found for 73 of the DDs were incorrect, for the remaining 13 DDs the resulting anchors were mixed (some right/some wrong).",
        "We cannot estimate recall since we do not have a precise number of syn/hyp/mer anchors that should be found (as different types of anchors may allow resolution of bridging descriptions).",
        "lation.",
        "The poorest recall was surprisingly obtained for synonymy relations, followed by meronymy relations, as expected, since these are only partially implemented in WordNet.",
        "The low recall for synonymy relations may be due to the context dependent, specialized senses of sublanguage terminology (for instance, crash, bust and slump in Economics terminology).",
        "Some nouns were not even encoded in WN (such as newsweekly, spinoff).",
        "Other relations were missed due to the unexpected way in which knowledge is organised in WordNet.",
        "For example, no association was found between house and walls, because house is not encoded in WordNet as a hyponym of building but of housing, and housing does not have a meronymy link to wall whereas building does.",
        "Another example of counter-intuitive position in the hierarchy is that of catastrophe, not listed as a hypernym of earthquake, but as its coordinate sister.",
        "This example demonstrates the problems that WordNet lexicographers faced when they had to coerce real-world concepts into a hierarchy with single, no-default inheritance: catastrophes clearly subclassify into earthquakes and floods, but minor earthquakes don't have to be catastrophic."
