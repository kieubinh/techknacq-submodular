        "In this paper, we propose a method for anaphora resolution of zero subjects in Japanese manual sentences based on both the nature of language expressions and the ontology of ordinary instruction manuals.",
        "In instruction manuals written in Japanese, zero subjects often introduce ambiguity into sentences.",
        "In order to resolve them, we consider the property of several types of expressions including some forms of verbal phrases and some conjunctives of clauses, and so on.",
        "As the result, we have a set of constraints and defaults for zero subject resolution.",
        "We examine the precision of the constraints and defaults with real manual sentences, and we have the result that they make a good estimate with precision of over 80%."

      "heading": "1 Introduction",
      "text": [
        "From simple electrical appliances to complex computer systems, almost all machines are accompanied by instruction manuals.",
        "Since recently there are many machines whose operating procedures are complicated, we have much more trouble in many cases including translating their manuals into other languages, maintaining consistency between the description in manuals and the actual behavior of the machines.",
        "To solve these problems, we have to have a computer assisted system for processing manual sentences.",
        "In processing instruction manuals written in Japanese, however, it is problematic that almost all subjects are omitted.",
        "They are called \"zero sub-jects.\"",
        "For example, machine translation systems have to supply appropriate subjects to translate sentences.",
        "Therefore, we have focused on anaphora resolution of zero subjects in Japanese manual sentences.",
        "Mori et al.",
        "(Mori and Nakagawa, 1996) show that properties of Japanese conditionals can be used to resolve them.",
        "In this paper, we propose new constraints and defaults based on properties of linguistic expressions, which are useful to estimate omitted subjects in addition to the constraints and defaults proposed by Mori et al.",
        "A large number of researchers have come to grip with the method of understanding some types of text including instruction manuals(Abe et al., 1988; No-mura, 1992; Eugenio, 1992).",
        "One of the most important matters of concern in these types of system is how we can resolve ambiguities in semantic representations and fill underspecified parts of them.",
        "Generally speaking, almost all systems described above take the following scheme.",
        "Firstly, each sentence in a text is translated into a semantic representation.",
        "In this process, the system uses only non-defeasible syntactic and semantic constraints.",
        "This way of analysis is known as the Nondefeasibility Thesis(Kameyama, 1995).",
        "Secondly, all of undetermined parts of the semantic representation are filled or settled by some kind of inferences based on the domain knowledge.",
        "This type of method, which uses a large amount of domain knowledge, seems to be dominant from the viewpoint of disambiguation.",
        "Moreover it scarcely depends on the language in use because the way of disambiguation is based on the inference with a certain knowledge base.",
        "On the other hand, in order to use this method, we have to prepare the amount of knowledge being large enough to cope with various types of described objects.",
        "Unfortunately, so far we have not had such a commonsense knowledge base.",
        "One of the ways to get rid of this situation is to adopt some knowledge which is independent of any particular domain.",
        "As such a kind of knowledge, we pay attention to pragmatic constraints, which have not been used sufficiently in the former methods.",
        "We expect that owing to pragmatic constraints the ambiguity in manual sentences would be resolved to some extent not in the process of inference but in the process of the translation of manual sentences into semantic representations.",
        "We do not commit ourselves to the domain specific knowledge, but use some ontological knowledge of ordinary manuals.",
        "For example, the correspondence of objects in the manual sentences to the objects in linguistic constraints, namely linguistic roles like",
        "the speaker, the hearer, and so on.",
        "Note that the ontology in this paper does not refer to all of the objects in the world described by manuals, like a certain part of machine.",
        "Aiming at independence from the domain knowledge of objects, we adopt one of general ontologies which is applicable to almost all manuals.",
        "Now we have to define the term 'SUBJECT' we used in this paper.",
        "Since our final goal is the determination of \"the main participant\" which is omitted, both of the term 'subject' and the term 'agent' are not suitable for referring to the omitted objects.",
        "For example, in a sentence in passive voice, the subject corresponds to not the agent(namely the main participant), but the patient.",
        "Moreover, there are several types of sentences whose subjects are main participants even if they are not agents, like the description of states, attributes and so on.",
        "Therefore, we use the term 'SUBJECT' to denote the main participant of the sentence, namely ether the agent or the surface subject(in the case where the agent is not defined).",
        "2 Zero pronouns in manual sentences Let's consider the following Japanese sentence, which shows a certain instruction.",
        "(1) Oa kono-botan-o osu -to,",
        "Oa-NOM this-button-Acc push -TO, (kb der are mas -u.",
        "0b-NOM go out can -POL -NONPAST.",
        "If Oa push(es) this button, then Ob can go out.",
        "Native speakers of Japanese have the following intuitive interpretation for (1) without any special context.",
        "(2) Oa = Oh = the hearer (= the user)",
        "Here, `TO' is a Japanese conjunctive particle which represents a causal relation, and 'ARE' shows ability or permission.",
        "The symbol 0 denotes a zero pronoun.",
        "On the other hand, the following sentence, which does not have the suffix 'ARE', has a different interpretation.",
        "(3) Oc kono-botan-o osu -to,",
        "c'c-NOM this-button-ACC push -TO, Od de mas -u.",
        "(fid-Nom come Out -POL -NONPAST.1 If push(es) this button, then Od will come out.",
        "The zero pronoun Oci refers to not the hearer(the user) but the machine, even though 0, refers to the 'The English translation of `IDERU' in (3) is different from the translation in (1).",
        "It is due to the difference of the viewpoint between Japanese and English.",
        "The difference has no effect on the selection of zero pronoun's referent.",
        "user as well as (1).",
        "Note that when only the matrix clause of (3) is used as shown in (4), 0, can be interpreted as either the hearer or the machine2.",
        "(4) 0, de mas -u. Oe-NOM go out -POL -NONPAST.",
        "Oe will go out.",
        "These examples show that the expressions TO and ARE impose some constraints on the referents of SUBJECTS of the sentences.",
        "As described so far, there are many cases that linguistic expressions give us key information to resolve some type of ambiguity like the anaphora of zero pronouns.",
        "In the rest of this paper, we will show several pragmatic constraints, which can account for the interpretations of zero subjects including the cases described above.",
        "Dohsaka(Dohsaka, 1994) proposes a similar approach, in which several pragmatic constraints are used to determine referents of zero pronouns.",
        "For example, honorific expressions and the speaker's point of view are used in his approach.",
        "While his approach treats dialogue, our targets are manual sentences.",
        "Nakaiwa et.al.",
        "(Nakaiwa and Shirai, 1996) also propose the method which is based on semantic and pragmatic constraints.",
        "Although they report that their method estimates over 90% of zero subjects correctly, there are several difficulties including the fact that the test corpus is identical with the corpus from which the pragmatic constraints are extracted, and the fact that there are so many rules(46 rules to estimate 175 sentences).",
        "As for the identifying method available in general discourses, the centering theory(Brennan et al., 1987; Walker et al., 1990) and the property sharing theory(Kameyama, 1988) are proposed.",
        "The important feature of these theories is the fact that it is independent of the type of discourse.",
        "However, according to our experimental result, it seems that these kinds of theory do not estimate zero subjects in high precision for manual sentences3.",
        "The linguistic constraints specific to expressions are more accurate than theirs if the constraints are applicable.",
        "3 Hypothesis and general ontology of manuals",
        "Kaiho et al.",
        "(Kaiho et al., 1987) explain the basic function of instruction manuals as follows: â€¢ A manual is an interface between humans and machines based on language information.",
        "2 It seems to be more natural that rbe is interpreted as the hearer.",
        "'The result precision of centering theory is 60% to 70% in our experiment.",
        "One reason why the precision is not so good is that the structure of texts in (Japanese) manuals is slightly different from the ordinary discourses structure.",
        "â€¢ Since the essential function of manuals is to provide users with information to make the machine operate properly, the existence of users should be considered at all times.",
        "â€¢ Manuals should appropriately provide information which is required by users.",
        "On the other hand, the following tendency are pointed out in many linguistic literatures.",
        "â€¢ The readers have the same point of view as the writer.",
        "â€¢ Generally, the first candidate of the point of view is the nominative.",
        "According to these considerations, we make the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 1 (Manuals easy to understand)",
        "â€¢ All descriptions are written from the viewpoint of users.",
        "Therefore, in general, subjects in manual sentences tend to be users.",
        "â€¢ Things users know, tend to be omitted for readability unless they are needed.",
        "Therefore, the subject of the sentence whose agent is a user tends to be omitted.",
        "â€¢ On the other hand, things which readers do not known, like reactions of operations, prompt from machines and so on, tend to be specified",
        "As the parts of ontology, we should consider, at least, two types of information: the properties of the objects in manuals and the discourse situation that is characterized by linguistic roles like a writer and a reader.",
        "From these constraints of the ontology, we can obtain the constraint of persons as follows.",
        "Constraint 3 (Persons) First Person = Manufacturer Second Person = User Third Person = Machine In the rest of this paper, we will propose several constraints and defaults based on the property of linguistic expression under the hypothesis and the constraints described above.",
        "Then, we will examine them with test examples from several manual sentences.",
        "Note that the constraints and defaults we propose here are derived not from some specific manuals but from our linguistic consideration for each of linguistic expressions.",
        "Therefore, we do not adopt strict validation method like 'cross valida-tions', which is used in machine learning, to examine them.",
        "However, in order to confirm the validity of our constraints and defaults, we have checked them out with 24 manuals from various areas.",
        "Although we cannot explain all of our defaults and constraints here because of shortage of space, we will briefly show the table of our all defaults and constraints in Section 6."
