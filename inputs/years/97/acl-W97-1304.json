        "This paper proposes a method to extract rules for anaphora resolution of Japanese zero pronouns from aligned sentence pairs.",
        "The method focuses on the characteristics of Japanese and English in which both the language families and the distribution of zero pronouns are very different.",
        "In this method, zero pronouns in the Japanese sentence and the English translation equivalents of their antecedents are extracted from Japanese and English aligned sentence pairs.",
        "Then resolution rules for Japanese zero pronouns are automatically extracted using the pairs of Japanese zero pronouns and translation equivalents of their antecedents in English and equivalent word/phrase pairs which were extracted from the aligned sentence pairs, based on the syntactic and semantic structure of the Japanese sentence.",
        "This method was implemented in the Japanese-to-English machine translation system, ALT-J/E.",
        "The evaluation showed that, for 371 zero pronouns with deictic reference in a sentence set for the evaluation of Japanese-to-English machine translation systems, the rules which were created automatically from Japanese and English aligned sentence pairs correctly resolved 99.2% of zero pronouns in a window test and 87.6% of zero pronouns in a blind test."

      "text": [
        "In all natural language, elements that can be easily deduced by the reader are frequently omitted from expressions in texts (Kuno, 1978).",
        "This phenomenon causes considerable problems in natural language processing systems.",
        "For example, in a machine translation system, the system needs to recognize that elements which are not present in the source language, may become mandatory elements in the target language.",
        "In particular, the subject and object are often omitted in Japanese whereas they are often mandatory in English.",
        "Thus, in Japanese-to-English machine translation systems, it is necessary to identify case elements omitted from the original Japanese (\"zero pronouns\") for their translation into English expressions.",
        "Several methods have been proposed with regard to this problem (Kameyama, 1986; Walker et al., 1990; Yoshimoto, 1988; Dousaka, 1994).",
        "When considering the application of these methods to a practical machine translation system for which the translation target area cannot be limited, it is not possible to apply them directly, both because their precision of resolution is low as they only use limited information, and because the volume of knowledge that must be prepared beforehand is so large.",
        "To overcome these kinds of problems, several methods to resolve zero pronouns which consider applications for a practical machine translation system with an unlimited translation target area, have been proposed (Nakaiwa and Ikehara, 1992; Nakaiwa and Ikehara, 1995; Nakaiwa and Ikehara, 1996).",
        "These methods use categorized semantic and pragmatic constraints such as verbal semantic attributes (Nakaiwa et al., 1994) and types of modal expressions and conjunctions as a condition for anaphora resolution of zero pronouns and determine antecedents of zero pronouns depending on the typical category of three types of semantic and pragmatic constraints.",
        "However, with these methods it is necessary to make resolution rules for zero pronouns by hand.",
        "So, to make robust rules with wide coverage takes a lot of time and labor and analysts who make these resolution rules must be familiar with the NLP system itself.",
        "Furthermore, the types of zero pronouns change depending on the types of documents which must be analyzed.",
        "So, resolution rules must be made depending on the target domain of the documents.",
        "But, it is very difficult to make rules for every domain because of the time consuming labor and the need for expertise.",
        "Because of these problems, a method to make resolution rules for zero pronouns effectively and efficiently is greatly needed.",
        "In order to acquire resolution rules for a NLP system effectively and efficiently, various methods have been proposed.",
        "One typical method for this purpose is to use a corpus for extracting resolution rules by analyzing each sentence in the corpus.",
        "With regard to the automatic extraction of resolution rules for zero pronouns, several methods have been proposed (Murata and Nagao, 1997; Nasukawa, 1996).",
        "But these methods only use monolingual corpora and they find it difficult to extract resolution rules for zero pronouns whose referents are normally unexpressed in Japanese.",
        "Furthermore, rules can only be made when similar expressions to those containing the zero pronouns are found in the corpus.",
        "In order to take into account the kinds of problems which are caused by monolingual corpora, it seems that a bilingual corpus consisting of pairs of a sentence in one language and a translation of the sentence is better than a monolingual corpus for the purpose of acquiring resolution rules for zero pronouns.",
        "This is particularly so with a bilingual corpus of Japanese and English whose language families are so different and in which the distribution of zero pronouns is also very different.",
        "This combination is more useful than the bilingual corpora of language pairs whose language families are similar.",
        "Several methods have been proposed with regard to acquiring various kinds of rules such as translation rules, grammar rules, dictionary entries and so on from bilingual corpora (Dagan et al., 1991; Dagan and Church, 1994; Fung and Church, 1994; Tanaka, 1994; Yamada et al., 1995).",
        "From the point of view of the extraction of resolution rules for zero pronouns, a technique to extract zero pronouns in a sentence in one language and translation equivalents of their antecedents in a translation from aligned sentence pairs is needed.",
        "Such a technique has recently been proposed, and a method to extract Japanese zero pronouns in Japanese sentences and translation equivalents of their antecedents in English sentences from aligned sentence pairs has been developed.",
        "(Nakaiwa and Yamada, 1997).",
        "Another technique which is needed, is to make rules automatically to resolve zero pronouns using pairs of equivalent words/phrases with zero pronouns and their antecedents from aligned sentence pairs.",
        "Several methods to extract rules and dictionary entries for machine translation have been proposed such as (Yamada et al., 1995).",
        "But there is currently no proposed method for extracting resolution rules for zero pronouns automatically using bilingual corpora.",
        "In this paper, I propose a widely applicable method to extract resolution rules for Japanese zero pronouns from Japanese and English aligned sentence pairs automatically using pairs of equivalent words/phrases and pairs of zero pronouns and their antecedents."

        "In order to understand the distribution of zero pronouns with antecedents within Japanese and English aligned sentence pairs, in this section, I examine which zero pronouns in Japanese must be explicitly translated into English and where their translation equivalents in English appear, using a test set designed to evaluate the performance of Japanese-to-English machine translation systems (Ikehara et al., 1994).",
        "The test set (3718 sentences) has many examples of zero pronouns making intrasentential and deictic references.",
        "The sentence set was created to test the coverage of expressions that can be translated by Japanese to English MT systems based on the varieties of Japanese expressions and the differences between Japanese and English.",
        "The sentence set has approximately 500 kinds of test items.",
        "Each sentence has a manual translation, and almost all of the sentences can be translated without contextual information (3704 sentences out of 3718 sentences).",
        "A MT system can be evaluated by comparing its output to the equivalent manual translation.",
        "Each sentence is expressed in natural Japanese and the sentence set covers many different expressions.",
        "This is an example of a zero pronoun in Japanese whose referent is expressed in the English translation.",
        "I want to read a book.",
        "In this expression, the Japanese sentence contains the modal expression tai which indicates HOPE.",
        "This modal expression causes the default referent of the subject zero pronoun to be \"writer\" or \"speaker\" which is translated as \"I\" in English.",
        "The results of the examination of zero pronouns and their referential elements in the functional test sentence set are shown in Table 1.",
        "There were a total of 525 zero pronouns in 463 sentences.",
        "The location of the referential elements can be divided into 2 kinds: those expressed in the same sentence, and those not expressed in the same sentence.",
        "The latter were further classified into 6 kinds.",
        "• The zero pronoun is not translated because the passive voice is used.",
        "• The referent is the writer or speaker, \"I\" or a group, \"we\".",
        "• The referent is the reader or hearer, \"you\".",
        "• The referent is human but it is not known who the human is.",
        "• The zero pronoun should be translated as \"it\".",
        "• The referent is another specific element.",
        "According to this study of the functional test set, in 371 out of 525 instances (71%) the referent was not expressed in the sentence.",
        "Of these, the zero pronouns could be left unexpressed by converting the translation to the passive voice in 156 instances (30%).",
        "The other zero pronouns, 215 instances (41%), referred to referents that did not appear in the Japanese sentence but appear in the English translation.",
        "This result shows that aligned sentence pairs will be effective for extracting zero pronouns and their antecedents automatically by determining zero pronouns in Japanese and translation equivalents of their antecedents in English.",
        "According to a further examination of the English equivalents of Japanese zero pronouns in the sentence set in Table 1, depending on the types of referential elements, the style of the English equivalents are different.",
        "These characteristics can be summarized in the following:",
        "1.",
        "Deictic referents in English (215 instances)",
        "These elements are often translated as personal pronouns such as \"I\" or \"you\" or indefinite",
        "\"one\".",
        "2.",
        "Anaphoric antecedents in English (154 instances; intrasentential)",
        "These elements are often translated as personal pronouns, demonstratives such as \"that\", definite noun phrases such as a noun phrase with definite article (e.g. \"the company\") or anaphoric \"one\".",
        "English expressions of these two types can be preferred candidates for translation equivalents of Japanese zero pronouns.",
        "Furthermore, according to an analysis of these aligned sentence pairs (Nakaiwa and Ikehara, 1995; Nakaiwa and Ikehara, 1996), zero pronouns in the corpus can be successfully resolved using three kinds of semantic and syntactic constraints: verbal semantic attributes, the types of modal expressions and conjunctions.",
        "So, for making suitable rules for resolving Japanese zero pronouns in aligned sentence pairs, the use of these semantic and pragmatic categories which are extracted from the syntactic and semantic structure of the Japanese sentence in aligned sentence pairs, will be effective."
