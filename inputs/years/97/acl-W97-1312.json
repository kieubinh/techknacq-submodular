        "Annotated anaphoric links in language corpora play an important role in teaching and research.",
        "Research roles may include investigation into the distribution of the different types of ana-phors, or into the location or distance of the antecedent, and also development of rules or heuristics for anaphora resolution and the testing of anaphora-related hypotheses/theories on the basis of numerous real-life examples.",
        "Annotation of referential links has not yet been able to benefit from the level of automation enjoyed by its lexical, syntactical and semantic \"counterparts\".",
        "Part-of-speech tagging has shown remarkable accuracy (99.2% see [Voutilaen 95]), robust parsing in corpora has delivered very good results and even word sense tagging has reported a considerable improvement.",
        "However, \"referential tagging\" has not been fully explored (and developed) and probably this is due, no doubt, to the complexity of automatic anaphora resolution.",
        "One of the best known tools for anaphoric annotation is XANADU - an X-windows interactive editor written by Roger Garside, which offers the user an easy-to-navigate environment for manually marking pairs of anaphors-antecedents ([Fligelstone 92]).",
        "Manual annotation, however, imposes a considerable demand on human time and labour.",
        "In this paper we put forward the idea of incorporating a practical, knowledge-poor approach to anaphora resolution ([Mitkov 97]) within a larger architecture for rough automatic referential annotation of corpora.",
        "At this stage our proposal deals with pronominal anaphora only and \"rough annotation\" implies that a follow-up manual correction would be necessary.",
        "Nevertheless, we believe that this partial solution brings us somewhat closer to the automatic annotation of all types of anaphoric links."

        "With a view to avoiding complex syntactic, semantic and discourse analysis (vital for real-world applications), we have developed a practical approach to pronoun resolution ([Mitkov",
        "97]) which does not parse and analyse the input in order to identify antecedents of anaphors.",
        "It makes use of only a part-of-speech tagger, plus simple noun phrase rules (sentence constituents are identified at the level of noun phrase at most) and operates on the basis of antecedent-tracking preferences (referred to hereafter as \"antecedent indicators\")."

      "heading": "2.1 Antecedent indicators",
      "text": [
        "Our empirical study (restricted to computer and hi-fl technical manuals) enabled us to develop efficient preferences for antecedent tracking in this sublanguage/genre.",
        "(We studied more than 400 different documents which had been hand-annotated; referential links were marked by human experts).",
        "These antecedent indicators are described in detail in [Mitkov 97]; we shall outline here those which are most frequently used as a supplement to gender and number agreement.",
        "• Term preference NPs representing terms in the field are more likely to be the antecedent than NPs which are not terms (scores 1 if the NP is term and 0 if not).",
        "• Verb preference",
        "If the verb is a member of the Verb_set = { discuss, present, illustrate, summarise, examine, describe, define, show, check, develop, review, report, outline, consider, investigate, explore, assess, analyse, synthesise, study, survey, deal, cover}, then consider the first NP following it as the preferred antecedent (scores 1 and 0).",
        "(Empirical evidence suggests that because of their salience, the verbs listed above are particularly likely candidates) These two preferences can be illustrated by the example: This table shows a minimal configurationi; it; does not leave much room for additional applications or other software for which you may require additional swap space.",
        "• Lexical reiteration",
        "Lexically reiterated items are likely candidates for antecedent (scores 2 if the NP is repeated within the same paragraph twice or more, 1 if repeated once and 0 if not).",
        "Lexically reiterated items include repeated synonymous noun phrases which may often be preceded by definite articles or demonstratives.",
        "• Section heading preference",
        "If a noun phrase occurs in the heading of the section, part of which is the current sentence, then consider it as the preferred candidate for the antecedent (1, 0).",
        "• Collocation pattern preference",
        "This preference is given to candidates which have an identical collocation pattern with a pronoun.",
        "The collocation implemented here is restricted to the pattern \"noun/pronoun, verb\" or \"verb, noun/pronoun\" (2, 0).",
        "(owing to lack of syntactic information, this preference is somewhat weaker than the collocation preference described in [Dagan & Itai 90] and suggested subsequently in our procedure for semi-automatic annotation)",
        "Press the key; down and turn the volume up... Press it; again.",
        "• Referential distance",
        "In complex sentences, noun phrases in the previous clausel are the best candidate for the antecedent of an anaphor in the subsequent clause, followed by noun phrases in the previous sentence, then by nouns situated 2 sentences further back and finally nouns 3 sentences further back (2, 1, 0, -1).",
        "For anaphors in simple sentences, noun phrases in the previous sentence are the best candidate for antecedent, followed by noun phrases situated 2 sentences further back and finally nouns 3 sentences further back (1, 0, -1)",
        "• \"Non-prepositional\" noun phrases",
        "A \"pure\", \"non-prepositional\" noun phrase is given a higher preference than a noun phrase which is part of a prepositional phrase (0, -1) Insert the cassette; into the VCR making sure it; is suitable for the length of recording.",
        "• Non-candidates",
        "Constituents introduced by an indefinite article and constituents introduced by determiners such as \"another\", \"other\" (-1, 0) I Currently we use simple heuristics for identifying clauses in a complex sentence",
        "Each of the antecedent indicators is assigned a score with a value E 0, 1, 21.",
        "These scores have been determined experimentally on an empirical basis and are constantly being updated.",
        "Top symptoms like \"lexical reiteration\" assign score \"2\" whereas non-candidates are given a negative score of \"-1\".",
        "We should point out that the antecedent indicators are preferences and not absolute factors.",
        "There are cases where an antecedent indicator does not \"point\" to the correct antecedent.",
        "For instance, in the sentence \"Insert the cassette into the VCR making sure it is turned on\", the indicator \"non-prepositional noun phrases\" would give a \"wrong\" contribution.",
        "Within the framework of all preferences (antecedent indicators), however, the right antecedent is still very likely to be tracked down - in the above example, the \"non-prepositional noun phrases\" heuristics would be overturned by the \"collocational preference\" one."
