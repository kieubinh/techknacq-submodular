        "We can refer to an entity with several different expressions, and a single expression can be used to refer to many different entities.",

        "2) What determines the speaker's choice of form when referring to an entity?",
        "It has turned out to be very fruitful to see these two questions as closely connected.",
        "A whole field of research on the distribution and interpretation of referring expressions clearly suggests that the speaker's choice of form helps the audience pick out the irttendedreferent of the expression (cf. for example Garrod & Sandford 1982, Ariel 1988, Gtmdel, Hedberg and Zacharski 1993).",

        "(Fraurud 1992)",
        "Our main question in this paper is this: what yields an appropriate use of a given pronominal form when it refers to a higher-order entity in English and Norwegian?",
        "We will propose that in both languages the form that is most frequently used is one which requires its referent to be activated, but not necessarily in focus (in the sense of Gundel, Hedberg and Zacharski 1993).",
        "This is so because processing a sentence generally brings into focus the major participants rather than the event or state of affairs itself."

        "In the statistics presented in GHZ's 1993 paper, only one out of 33 occurrences of demonstrative pronouns in English referred to entities that had the status In Focus.",

        "That is, demonstrative pronouns convey a so-called scalar implicature: a weaker form conversationally implicates that a stronger form does not obtain.",
        "Thus, just as \"I have two children\" implicates that the speaker does not have more than two children, using a demonstrative form implicates that the referent of the expression does not have a status higher than activated, i.e. it is not in focus."

        "A situation or fact, on the other hand, is typically expressed by a whole sentence the first time it is referred to.",
        "The first mention of situations or facts will therefore usually not correspond to expressions that have prominent syntactic functions in the sentence, and we would expect them to be activated, but not yet in focus after being mentioned only once.2 Reference to higher-order entities with an unstressed pronoun, i.e. a form that requires its referent to be in focus, thus typically requires more than one previous mention.",
