        "Correct interpretation of anaphora is crucial for natural language understanding systems, as it enables a system to keep track of the entities introduced through the processed text.",
        "Various knowledge sources have been used for anaphora resolution, leading to more or less realistic systems.",
        "For instance, (Hobbs, 1978) uses a parse-tree analysis algorithm, and correctly solves an average of 88% of the personal pronouns, in a selection of English texts.",
        "A blackboard-like architecture is proposed by (Rich and Luperfoy, 1988) in order to integrate various knowledge sources, but no evaluation is given.",
        "The method proposed in (Lappin and Leass, 1994) uses context modelling and salience values, besides syntactic constraints, and proves 4% more accurate than Hobbs' algorithm on the same corpus.",
        "Salience can realistically be calculated even for unrestricted texts, and permits also integration of heterogeneous criteria.",
        "Local semantic constraints can be added to this algorithm, as in (HuIs et al., 1995).",
        "Whereas it is almost certain that complex semantic and pragmatic knowledge is needed to solve all the well-formed anaphors, it is highly improbable that this would soon be available for a computational system.",
        "Even elaborated semantics and complete parse trees aren't yet realistic for unrestricted text processing.",
        "A solution is then to use statistical methods to induce semantic constraints of frequently used verbs, as in (Dagan and Ito, 1990).",
        "But (Kennedy and Boguraev, 1996a) show that the Lappin and Leass algorithm still provides good results (75%) even without complete parse.",
        "They suggest also (Kennedy and Boguraev, 1996b) that anaphora resolution is part of the discourse referents resolution.",
        "However, little is said about concrete methods for building \"coreference classes\": the example given by the authors concerns only coreference between an acronym and its expanded form.",
        "We describe here an open architecture for reference resolution, which provides a common frame for pronoun and reference resolution.",
        "At its most elementary level, our system uses simple cues for pronominal anaphora solving (morphology, local syntax and context rules) and simultaneously performs noun phrase referent resolution (using identity, synonyms and hyperonyms).",
        "These two aspects of the same task benefit from their cooperation."

        "The cooperative strategy proposed here has long been masked by the classic conception of anaphora as a pure textual relationship, between an anaphor (e.g., a pronoun) and its explicit or inferred antecedent in the text (e.g., a noun phrase).",
        "In this view, the anaphor always needs another textual description or phrase in order to be solved, while the antecedent can refer directly to an object outside the text.",
        "Recent work tends to unify these two situations (Ariel, 1990 and 1994) (Reboul, personal communication).",
        "They propose a gradual classification for all the referring expressions (RE), ranging from proper names and definite or indefinite noun phrases up to the pronouns.",
        "Their \"resolution\" means the construction of a link between the RE (be it nominal or pronominal) and its correct referent, from an evolving set of potential referent representations.",
        "Therefore, we will avoid using the anaphor/antecedent distinction, and will speak instead about REs and their referent, called \"character\".",
        "As our open architecture supports the transition between the two paradigms, we will sometimes use also the classic terminology."

        "This rigid order is not really compatible with cataphors (unless the module can take the initiative to create a character corresponding to a pronominal RE), but has proved successful in most of the algorithms cited above.",
        "Also, it limits influence between textual close references.",
        "A better solution is to handle a buffer for the current sentence, compute mutual influence of the REs through their respective activation (cf. §5.3) and after stabilization validate the resolution for the entire current sentence.",

Each of the statements contained in a facet consists itself of a data set: temporal references, state of C'...",

        "Each character C is described with the following parameters:",
        "• a label: a number which allows to identify C • a list of identifiers: the REs which have been used to design the character; we envisage to order this list according to the frequency of use of the identifiers • a list of verbal descriptions (VD): what has been said about C • an activation value: it represents the salience of C, this value is modified during the resolution and it depends on the context • an accessibility mark: at each step of the resolution it indicates whether C is accessible or not according to the concordance rules implemented by MI (see §2) And each verbal description VD consists of: • a list of words: the words which compose VD • a sentence number: to localize the place of VD in the text • a position in the sentence: a pair of marks which localize the RE referring to the character in the sentence • a f-structure: it describes the syntactic structure of VD, if its parsing has succeeded",

        "Indeed, even when parsing the best written texts, comprehension mechanisms sometimes have to backtrack on their decisions, and on the characters they have recognised.",
        "Obviously, a module able to detect the inconsistencies (the one proposed by Berthelin) would be essential to give some indications for launching the merging module, but since it is not actually available, we suggest to trigger it with a regular but arbitrary frequency.",
        "We also suggest a mechanism which tracks MI, and triggers the merging when several characters have been created due to the presence of definite determinants, because this kind of determinant often describes a character already introduced, but without using the terms already used.",
        "As far as the structure is concerned, the mechanism has to unify the parameters of the two characters.",
        "The following methods are proposed:",
        "• the label: only the smaller of the two numerical numbers is retained (the label of the first RE which introduced the character) • the list of identifiers: the 2 lists are merged • the list of verbal descriptions: the two lists are simply merged, and the parameters constituting the VD are conserved • the activation value: it seems reasonable to retain the higher of them, but a more complex calculation may also be considered • the accessibility mark: there is no decision to take since this mark is determined at each resolution."
