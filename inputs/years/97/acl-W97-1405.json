        "All these questions arise, but not all have complete answers despite numerous work done in the domain [2, 12].",
        "In order to eliminate some drawbacks of speech recognition, we have added a touch screen to an oral system 171 Thus users can formulate their queries and provide their responses using the oral (linguistic) modality and the tactile modality separately or together.",
        "This paper presents responses to some of the questions above, First we describe the system the goal of which is the querying of a geographic and tourist database.",
        "Then we analyse the referential phenomena both from the linguistic and the tactile point of view.",
        "This analysis is originated from an experimental (WOZ) work [11] and the results have been confirmed by way of a first evaluation of the system with naive users.",
        "The different types of problems are underlined.",
        "The paper continues by presenting the general principles which guide us and the description of the principal processing methods.",
        "The principles are concerned with the choice of the modality on which the resolution of references is based, the architecture of the steps and the type of modeling.",
        "In the course of the description of the processing methods, we provide details about the format and the content of the data used.",
        "In the conclusion, we outline future planned studies using the system.",

        "• The global processing is divided up in three sequential steps: a linguistic analysis, a tactile analysis and a merging process.",
        "• The processing is mainly based on the oral modality, i.e. on the analysis (syntactic and thematic)",
        "of the oral utterance.",
        "This fact not only allows us to take into account the different uses of the system (with or without the tactile screen), but also compels us to do so because the tactile mode does not provide sufficient information in most of the cases.",
        "This choice presents some consequences and drawbacks: the speech recognition becomes very important and the discrepancies between oral and tactile activities will be dealt with by the tactile analysis.",
        "• The algorithms are based on contextual information.",
        "The dialogue history (context) provides the necessary elements (referents) to progressively solve the references, and the oral utterance (co-text) provides predictions about foreseen referents and type of tactile activity.",
        "Nevertheless, we chose an approach where the results of the linguistic and tactile activities are merged instead of an approach where the activities are interpreted using the tactile context [20].",

        "will be transformed as ASK(U, S, informref(S, U, beach, Q(beach, locality(deicphore(pointing))))) where deiephore(pointing) is generated by the presence of the keyword here and indicates a user tactile activity to point out the place where the system will have to explore.",
        "The transmission of the theme to the tactile processor is accompanied by the relevant objects of the database.",

        "we only take into account the two final points or the last drawn zone.",
        "As for the second type, we have designed a small set of rules (easily modifiable), which allows us to modify the gestural activity observed according to the expected style.",

        "Producing Communicative Acts A communicative act (CA) expresses the user's intention, which in turn is simultaneously conveyed by the speech activity (the dialogue act) and the tactile activity.",
        "In order to determine a CA one must merge the two types of activity, whilst using to a maximum advantage the redundant information conveyed by the two media [4, 20].",
        "This merging must also take into account possible incoherence problems between media, as a result either of the system (speech recognition and understanding) or of the user.",
        "According to the dialogue context, (recognized type of dialogue act) the merging is carried out in two ways.",

        "Whilst merging, we solve tactile and linguistic co-references [3, 8].",
        "For example, Figure 1 shows a model of the CA REQUEST for the completive mode where a tactile event and a dialogue act have to be merged.",
