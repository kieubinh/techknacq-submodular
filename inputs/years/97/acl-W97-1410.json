        "Nevertheless, we still have to provide discriminating descriptions for the intended referent with respect to the set of the components of the same type on that side.",
        "As the colour and the shape of both buttons in example 5 do not differ, we have to exploit information on the relative location, which enables us to generate a sentence like \"Press the left button, which is the spray button\".",
        "This establishes a co-referential connection between the referent of the nominal phrase \"the spray button\" and the left button on the top side, which can be exploited in the subsequent dialogue.",
        "In contrast to that, an augmentation of the depicted graphics with an arrow is proposed by (Andre, 1995, page 81) in order to establish this co-reference.",
        "Case 2: The intended referent is not a unique characteristic component, but an element of a set of characteristic components.",

        "Dale and Reiter proposed a number of algorithms that differ in their computational complexity.",
        "Since the task of finding the minimal set of descriptors is NP-hard3, a number of heuristics are used, which approximate the minimal set.",
        "The computation of the referring expressions in our approach is done in a two-stage process: First, we use only the type information to find the characteristic components of the sides which can be used for the generation of navigational descriptors.",
        "In a second step, classical reference algorithms compute the discriminating information for the intended referent with a reduced contrast set using perceptually recognisable attributes like colour, shape and relative location of components with respect to other components.",

        "the addressee to identify a side of a given complex object in contrast to the set of the other sides of the given object.",
        "For the characteristic component algorithm, while the intended referent is the given side of the object, the other sides of the object can be considered as the contrast set in Dale & Reiter's terms.",
        "In contrast to (Dale and Reiter, 1995) where at most one descriptor set is computed which distinguishes the referent from all other objects in the contrast set, our algorithm computes all minimal descriptor sets.",
        "The algorithm is far more expensive than classical reference algorithms, because we calculate all minimal distinguishing descriptions of the given side using only the type attribute.",
        "On the other hand, this enables us to use sources other than the part-whole relation (IDAS (Reiter et al., 1995)) or the spatial inclusion relation (KAMP (Appelt, 1985)) for the generation of the navigational part of the referring expression.",
        "The set of characteristic components contains no negative expressions.",
        "Negative expressions would enable us to compute characteristic components of sides, for which the proposed algorithm computes an empty set of characteristic components.",
        "On the other hand, that would force us to generate referring expressions which contain statements about components that are not located on the same side as the intended component.",
        "We think that statements of this kind would confuse the addressee.",
