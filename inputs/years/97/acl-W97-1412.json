        "User interfaces of many application systems have begun to include multiple devices which can be used together to input single expressions.",
        "Such interfaces (and even the whole application systems) are widely labelled multi-modal, since they use different types of communication channels to acquire information.",
        "These emerging devices and recognition systems potentially allow users to express their intentions more naturally, in ways similar to those used by humans to communicate with each other.",
        "However, very few works have concentrated on the integration and synergistic use of multimodal input capabilities within the same system.",
        "Most systems simply take almost no account of how the different modes interact 30 that the interdependence of modalities contributing to information processing is not capitalized upon.",
        "Moreover, the close interaction and interdependency between input and output is still a largely unexplored area.",
        "For example, the capability of referring directly to the content of a rich multimodal presentation while formulating multimodal input requires the processing of a body of knowledge that largely extend the information content that can be conveyed by a simple pick operation.",
        "Underlying practical use of these new technologies is the question of their suitability; are they appropriate for the tasks users need to perform, and what is their comparative ease of use?",
        "In order to build artifacts that are to be both useful and usable, the development of interactive systems must address user-oriented requirements and accommodate different perspectives in the (formal) design process.",
        "Novel interaction techniques may interfere with the functional and task-oriented requirements that a system is intended to support.",
        "Potential conflicts between these types of requirements can be identified early in the design process through the use of appropriate specification techniques using mathematical structures able to represent perceivable elements of the system and allowing for multidisciplinary insight into the design problem.",
        "This work describes an approach to evaluating the usability of devices that accounts for the cognitive resources needed to use a device to perform particular tasks.",
        "The framework draws its expressive power from a technique called syndetic modelling that allows the description of both the device and cognitive resources to be captured in a common representation.",
        "In this paper syndesis provides a foundation for examining the interplay occurring betwen an operator and a computer system when performing tasks involving deitic references made through speech and gestures.",
        "It is the relationship between users and systems, and the transformations that are necessary to move from one to another, that provides novel insight into usability."

        "The word syndesis comes from the ancient greek (aim,--- together and Sao = to tie), meaning to bring, to connect, to compose together.",
        "It conveys the idea of being able to reason about complex systems as a whole while keeping the capability of isolating and reasoning about their basic components at the same time.",
        "In our case, the syndetic model of an interactive system extends the formal model of its interface with the model of the cognitive resources needed to interact with the devices.",
        "Earlier work in this direction has been using state based notations and was aiming at the exploration of this field at a high level of abstraction (Backer and Buxton, 1987; Chan et al., 1984).",
        "In other approaches theoretical models originating from psychology have been used in an indirect way, see for example (Card et al., 1990; Fitts, 1954).",
        "We deviates from those early approaches by using cognitive models in a direct way within the design and specification process and find our justification for such an approach in that the factors that affect 84 Faconti and M. Massink usability depend on psychological and social properties of cognition and work, rather than on abstract mathematical models of programming semantics.",
        "Although in principle any cognitive theory might be adopted, we address one particular cognitive model, Phil Barnard's Interacting Cognitive Subsystems or shortly ICS (Barnard and May, 1993; Barnard and May, 1994).",
        "We formally model aspects of this theory in such a way that it can be combined with a traditional system specification.",
        "The formal model of the system provides few insights into the usability of its interface as well as the formal model of the user derived from some psychological theory supports general claims about the user's cognitive processes but not about the effective use of cognitive resources in a given context.",
        "By combining both of them in a syndetic model we can reason about how cognitive resources are mapped onto the functionality of the system.",
        "Within this approach, we consider an abstract view of the flow of information between devices, users and system.",
        "To facilitate precise description and modelling at this level, we make use of a specification notation in which the various components (device, system and user) are modelled as interac-tors.",
        "The concept of an interactor has been described in detail elsewhere, for example (Duke and Harrison, 1993; Faconti and Paterno, 1990), Briefly, an interactor is an object-like entity with an internal state, a presentation through which parts of the state (called percepts) can be perceived by a user, and actions - either user or system initiated - that bring about changes to the state.",
        "Interactors have been described using a number of formal notations including Z, LOTOS and MAL (Modal Action Logic), and it is the last of these that is used here.",
        "Briefly, MAL (Ryan et al., 1991) is a typed first-order logic that extends the predicate logic with an additional operator.",
        "For any action 'A' and predicate `P', the predicate '[Al P' means that after the action A is performed, P must hold.",
        "Interactors can describe the logical and physical components of an interactive system, but by themselves give little direct insight into how a user might or might not be able to use the system.",
        "This is a problem, as many of the developments in interactive systems that can benefit from use of abstract models also depend critically on human abilities to process information.",
        "Syndetic models (Duke, 1995; Duke et al., 1995; Faconti and Duke, 1996) address this problem by expressing the behaviour of computing and cognitive systems within a common framework that supports reasoning about the conjoint system.",
        "Clearly, the 'computer' component of a syndetic model is determined by the system being represented, but for the cognitive side there is a range of models to choose from, each emphasising different aspects of human information processing.",
        "The approach that we have adopted for syndetic modelling is called Interacting Cognitive Subsystems, or ICS, and is summarised in Section 3.",
        "Importantly, ICS operates in terms of resources and information flow at a level of abstraction that is commensurate with that used to describe interactors."

        "To satisfy the first sub-goal (item, read), the object subsystem receives coherent representations from :prop-obj: and :vis-obj: that are in its sources.",
        "They must be also stable and coherent so that their representations are blended.",
        "The enriched representation is tranformed by the object system into propositional, morphonolexical and limb representations.",
        "Since the goal is to read, the psychological subject becomes an entry in the list.",
        "The morphonolexical system can operate on this representation in order to find its related sound structure.",
        "Similarly the propositional system revives it through its buffer to both morphonolexical and object systems enriching their representations.",
        "In the case of the MDisplay system, which uses the mouse, the information transmitted by the object system is of little use for the limb system.",
        "In fact, the cursor is far from the psychological object in the representation structure.",
        "Consequently, the information from the body-state which 'feels' the mouse troough the 'ooperate' action and the one from the object system cannot be blended leading to buffering.",
        "However the buffer is already allocated and consequently the stream is disengaged leading to a change of the configuration.",
        "In the case of the TDisplay model, which makes use of the touch screen, the same stream resulting from the :obj-lim: transformation is relevant to the limb system since it blends with the information arriving from the body-state.",
        "In is interesting to note that in this second case the movement of pointing to an item starts before the same information is processed by the articulatory system for speaking.",
        "This is confirmed by experiments in the field of cognitive psychology.",
        "After one cycle of processing of the goal by all the involved subsystems, the propositional system removes the first part of the goal and starts satisfying the two parallel tasks of speaking and gesturing by sending representations again to the morphonolexical and object subsystems.",
        "At the morphonolexical level this representation blends naturally since all the information was already available for specking and it can be passed directly to the articulatory subsystem.",
        "At the object level the new representation blend with the information stream from the visual subsystem.",
        "In the case of the MDisplay system, the ghost node of figure 5 is built and sent to the propositional system for semantic checking.",
        "Only after a further loop between the propositional and the object systems this information is sent to the limb system where it can now be blended with the body-state information to perform the pointing gesture.",
        "However, at this time the articulatory system has already directed the speech of the referred word.",
        "Consequently, in this case the speech and locate actions cannot occur in parallel but are performed in a sequence.",
        "In the case of the TDisplay model, the limb system has already started to locate the item within the screen so that the operation can continue in parallel with the articulatory system and synchronize through the body state.",
        "The result is extremely interesting when related to previous works carried on the process of fusion of information within multimedia systems.",
        "At University of Grenoble, CLIPS, they have de-velopped an original algorithm, known as the 'melting pot', to support deixis within the Matis system.",
        "Matis is a Multimodal Airline Travel Information System supporting several combinations of modalities to formulate queries against a flights data base.",
        "The melting pot algorithm is built around the intrinsic uncertainty found in relating mouse events and spoken words, the authors have directly experimented in building the system.",
        "The practical consequence is that the algorithm is noon-deterministic.",
        "Our woork clearly gives a motivation for this.",
        "In (Faconti et al., 1996) the fusion process is described at a high level of abstracion.",
        "It defines a system architecture of fusion and a class of algorithms which the melting pot is one instance of.",
        "The work is in line with the findings of this paper suggesting that a non-deterministic fusion algorithm can be de-velopped based on exact temporal windows within which pointing events may occur.",
        "These temporal windows are defined by the limb and articulary subsystems processes within ICS and can be captured by the system speech recognizer."

        "Traditional approaches to evaluating or comparing input devices have focussed either on the logical behaviour of the device, or ergonomic aspects of its use.",
        "This paper has presented a framework that allows analysis of the cognitive ergonomics of interaction, in terms of the mental resources needed to utilise a particular device for a specific task.",
        "We have used the model to present a systematic account of the diffences between mouse and touch screen.",
        "The example was chosen for familarity, rather than for novelty.",
        "Hoowever, the approach is one that can be extended to rather more sophisticated and problematic techniques.",
        "One argument raised against the wider use of syndetic modelling for human factors evaluations is the level of formality involved.",
        "This is a reasonable concern, and there are two responses.",
        "The first is that the work on syndesis carried out so far has been primarily concerned with establishing its feasibility as a model for explaining interaction, rather than as a practical tool for industrial use.",
        "We are now beginning to explore means by which the level of formality can be tamed, both by supporting development of formal models with software tools, or by encapsulating the technique within a tool to support scenario-driven analysis of interaction.",
        "The second response to concern about formalism is that the complexity of modern interfaces, and the subtle demands that they place on users' cognitive abilities, calls for an expressive and analytically powerful method for modelling and evaluation.",
        "Such a method needs to be able to span both the user and the system, in order to capture the interplay between the information available from the system, the actions that can be taken, and the tasks and knowledge of the user.",
        "We are not advocating syndetic models as a replacement for other design representations.",
        "There is an inherent trade-off between the power and generality of a notation (Blanford and Duke, 1996), and there are important issues, for example based on social factors or domain requirements, for which syndetic models are either inappropriate or inadequate.",
        "Likewise however, synclesis brings considerable analytical power and authority (in the form of the underlying cognitive theory) to bear on problems whose complexity makes the use of less formal design techniques problematic."
