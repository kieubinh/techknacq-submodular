        "Approximately 35 people have worked extensively on the system, and at least that many have worked more peripherally.",
        "Thus, while it is not a geographically distributed project, it has been temporally distributed.",
        "At any given time, there is no single person who is completely familiar with all aspects of either the grammar or the tool kit.",
        "As a result, careful documentation has proven to be invaluable.",
        "Historically, this has taken the form of distinct papers on individual components; this is still the case for the tools.",
        "For the grammar, however, there is now a single document, available as a (frozen) technical report (XTAG-Group, 1995) or a constantly updated HTML document.'",
        "The tech report has been useful not only for the people working on the project at Penn, but also for those outside of Penn who are either interested in Tree Adjoining Grammar specifically, or simply interested in seeing how we handled some particular aspect of the grammar."

        "The corpus is intended to be a systematic collection of English grammatical phenomena, including complementation, agreement, modification, diathesis, modality, tense and aspect, sentence and clause types, coordination, and negation.",
        "It contains 1409 grammatical sentences and phrases and 3036 ungrammatical ones.",
        "Before parsing the TSNLP data, we made a few tokenization changes: we changed contractions from two tokens to one, downcased the first words of sentences, changed a pair of square brackets to parentheses and changed quotes to pairs of opens and closes.",
        "There were 42 examples which we judged ungrammatical, and removed from the test corpus.",
        "for relatively decent operation speed.",
        "These were sentences with conjoined subject pronouns, where one or both were accusative, e.g.",
        "Her and him succeed.",
        "Overall, we parsed 61.4% of the 1367 remaining sentences and phrases.",
        "The errors were of various types, broken down in Table 2.",
        "The missing lexicon items are obviously the easiest of these to remedy.",
        "This class also highlighted the fact that our grammar is heavily slanted toward American English â€“ our grammar does not handle dare or need as auxiliary verbs, and there were a number of very British particle constructions, e.g. She misses him out.",
        "The missing trees are slightly harder to address, but the data obtained here is very useful in helping us fill gaps in our grammar.",
        "We do not currently handle the class of modal+ 'ye contractions at all, and this clearly ought to be remedied.",
        "The feature clashes are mostly in sequences of determiners, and would need to be looked at more closely to see whether the changes needed to correct them would do more harm than good.",
        "One general problem with the corpus is that, because it uses a very restricted lexicon, if there is one problematic lexical item it is likely to appear a large number of times and cause a disproportionate amount of grief.",
        "Used to appears 33 times and we get all 33 wrong.",
        "However, it must be noted that the XTA.G grammar has analyses for syntactic phenomena that were not represented in the TSNLP test suite such as sentential subjects and subordinating clauses among others.",

        "The XTAG English grammar currently consists of 768 tree templates, so grammar maintenance is no small task.",
        "In general, lexicalizing a TAG creates redundancy because the same trees, modulo their anchor labels, may be associated with many different lexical items.",
        "We have eliminated this redundancy by storing only abstract tree templates with uninstantiated anchor labels, and instantiating lexi-calized trees on the fly, as words are encountered in the input.",
        "Another source of redundancy, however, is the reuse of tree substructures in many different tree templates.",
        "For example, most sentential tree templates include a structural fragment corresponding to the phrase-structure rule S NP VP.",
        "This redundancy poses a problem for grammar maintenance and revision.",
        "To consistently implement a change in the grammar, all the relevant trees currently must be edited individually, although we do have an implementation of Becker's metarules (Becker, 1994) which allows us to automate this process to a great extent.",
        "For instance, the addition of a new feature equation associated with the structural fragment corresponding to S NP VP would affect most clausal trees in the grammar.",
        "Crucially, one can only manually verify that such an update does not conflict with any other principle already instantiated in the grammar.",
        "As the grammar grows, the difficulty of this task grows with it.",
        "Following the idea first proposed in (Vijay-Shankar and Schabes, 1992), we extend the idea of abstraction over lexical anchors.",
        "A tree template with an unspecified anchor label subsumes an entire class of lexically specified trees; similarly, we define \"meta-templates\", or quasi-trees, which subsume classes of tree templates.",
        "The quasi-trees are specified by partial tree descriptions in a logical language patterned after Rogers and Vijay-Shanker (Rogers and Vijay-Shankar, 1994); we call the partial descriptions blocks.",
        "Since we are using a feature-based LTAG, our language has also been equipped with descriptive predicates allowing us to specify a tree's feature-structure equations, in addition to its structural characteristics.",
        "Each block abstractly describes all trees incorporating the partial structure it represents.",
        "An elementary tree template is expressed as a con",
        "junction of blocks.",
        "The blocks are organized as an inheritance lattice, so that descriptive redundancy is localized within an individual block.",
        "Within this description lattice, we isolate two sub-lattices which _form more or less independent dimensions: the subcategorization sub-lattice and the sub-lattice of descriptions of \"transformations\" on base subcategorization frames, such as wh-question formation and imperative mood.",
        "The subcategorization sub-lattice is further divided into four fairly orthogonal sub-parts: (1) the set of blocks describing the syntactic subject, (2) those for the main anchor(s), (3) those describing complements and (4) those for structure below a complement.",
        "Similar approaches have been pursued for a large French LTAG by (Candito, 1996) and for the XTAG English grammar by (Becker, 1994).",
        "Following the ideas set forth in (Vijay-Shankar and Schabes, 1992), Candito constructs a description hierarchy in much the same way as the present work, albeit for a smaller range of constructions than what exists in the XTAG grammar.",
        "Becker's meta-rules can also been seen as partial descriptions, wherein the inputs and outputs of the meta-rules are sisters in a description hierarchy and the parent is the common structure shared by both.",
        "However, there is still redundancy across meta-rules whose inputs apply to the same partial descriptions.",
        "For instance, the subject wh- extraction and subject relative metarules would be specified independently and both refer to an NP in subject position of a clause."

        "Consider, for example, the description of the relative clause tree for transitive verbs which contains four blocks: one specifying that its subject is extracted, one that the subject is an NP, one that the main anchor is a verb, and one that the complement is an NP.",

        "Beyond these issues of efficiency and consistency, this approach also gives us a unique perspective on the existing grammar as a whole.",

        "This can be very useful for gaining a overview of the theory that is being implemented and exposing gaps that have not yet been explained.",
        "Because of the organic way in which the grammar was built over the years, we have always suspected that there might exist a fair amount of inconsistency either within the feature structures, or within the tree families.",
        "The effort in organizing the lexicon has so far turned up very few non-linguistically motivated inconsistencies, which is a gratifying validation of the constraints imposed by the LTAG formalism.",
        "Our work in tree organization has allowed us to characterize three principal types of exceptions in the XTAG English grammar: (1) a class of trees is missing from the grammar, though this class would be expected from allowing the descriptive blocks to combine freely (for example, a sentential subject with a verb anchor and a PP complement); (2) within a class of trees, some member is missing, though an analogous member is present in another class (extraction of the clausal complement of a noun-anchored predicative); (3) one tree in a class can be generated by combining quite general descriptions, but there is an exceptional piece of structure or feature equation (the ergative alternation of transitive verbs).",

        "In considering how one might specialize a grammar, we make the following basic assumptions: that a sub-language exists; that it can be identified; that there is training data (usually unannotated) available; that default mechanisms will be adequate for handling over-specialization (since we know training data will not perfectly reflect the genre) and that the smaller grammar combined with defaults will still be more efficient than the large grammar.",
        "Based on these assumptions, the first choice is whether to do full parsing at all in the final application.",
        "If the domain contains a large number of fragments, it might be preferable to use a partial parsing approach, in which case development of a sub-grammar will be less crucial.",
        "Supertagging (Joshi and Srinivas, 1994) is one such approach; once the supertagger is trained for the domain, it could be used in place of the full parser.",
        "If, however, it is determined that full parsing is practicable for the domain, there are still a number of considerations in deriving the sub-grammar.",
        "In the ideal situation, there would already be a corrected parsed corpus (treebank), which can be used for crafting a sub-grammar for the domain.",
        "This is exceptionally unlikely, and in the more common case, training data will have to be constructed, either manually or automatically.",
        "In a lexicalized grammar like LTAG, this turns out to be quite manageable, since there are distinct representations which encode syntactic structures.",
        "We can use a statistical approach, such as supertagging, to make a first pass at assigning the correct structures to each word, and then hand-correct them to derive the relevant set of structures.",
        "In non-lexicalized grammars, this process would be much more difficult, because there is no straightforward way to associate structures with lexical word and to identify the rules to be eliminated.",
        "If it is impossible to create training data by any other method, the full grammar can be applied and then the output corrected to create a treebank of the training data.",
        "Needless to say, this is a tedious, time-consuming and computationally expensive task.",
        "Alternatively, a domain expert could provide a list of grammatical phenomena needing to be handled, and this list used to extract the sub-grammar.",
        "Once the training data has been processed by one of these methods, the sub-grammar is extracted based on the elementary objects in the grammar required to handle all of the syntactic phenomena identified in the training set.",
        "This could mean extracting precisely the constructions used in the training set, or generalizing from them.",
        "A lexical hierarchy such as that described in Section 2 can be used for this process, with generalization performed along either of the hierarchy dimensions.",
        "The expansion could be done by general principles (add all trees of a certain subcat frame if any are present), or could be done based on performance of the sub-grammar on held-out training data.",
        "Most domains have a rich terminological vocabulary, which if not taken into account can cause prohibitive ambiguity in parsing and interpretation.",
        "Identifying and demarcating domain specific terminology is helpful for all of these approaches, since the terms can then be treated as single tokens.",
        "This can been done either manually or automatically (Daille, 1994; Jacquemin and Royaut, 1994).",
        "Once the sub-grammar has been finalized, strategies for recovering from failure to parse should be developed.",
        "One simple strategy is to fall back to the large/whole grammar.",

        "With regard to partial parsing, we retrained the supertagger on the 100 training sentences (1416 tokens).",
