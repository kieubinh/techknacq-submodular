        "Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is the problem of assigning a sense to an ambiguous word, using its context.",
        "We assume that different senses of a word correspond to different entries in its dictionary definition.",
        "For example, suit has two senses listed in a dictionary: 'an action in court,' and 'suit of clothes.'",
        "Given the sentence The union's lawyers are reviewing the suit, we would like the system to decide automatically that suit is used there in its court-related sense (we assume that the part of speech of the polysemous word is known).",
        "In recent years, text corpora have been the main source of information for learning automatic WSD (see, for example, Gale, Church, and Yarowsky [1992]).",
        "A typical corpus-based algorithm constructs a training set from all contexts of a polysemous word W in the corpus, and uses it to learn a classifier that maps instances of VI; (each supplied with its context) into the senses.",
        "Because learning requires that the examples in the training set be partitioned into the different senses, and because sense information is not available in the corpus explicitly, this approach depends critically on manual sense tagging – a laborious and time-consuming process that has to be repeated for every word, in every language, and, more likely than not, for every topic of discourse or source of information.",
        "The need for tagged examples creates a problem referred to in previous works as the knowledge acquisition bottleneck: training a disambiguator for VI; requires that the examples in the corpus be partitioned into senses, which, in turn, requires a fully operational disambiguator.",
        "The method we propose circumvents this problem by automatically tagging the training set examples for W using other examples, that do not contain W, but do contain related words extracted from its dictionary definition.",
        "For instance, in the training set for suit, we would use, in addition to the contexts of suit,",
        "all the contexts of court and of clothes in the corpus, because court and clothes appear in the machine-readable dictionary (MRD) entry of suit that defines its two senses.",
        "Note that, unlike the contexts of suit, which may discuss either court action or clothing, the contexts of court are not likely to be especially related to clothing, and, similarly, those of clothes will normally have little to do with lawsuits.",
        "We will use this observation to tag the original contexts of suit.",
        "Another problem that affects the corpus-based WSD methods is the sparseness of data: these methods typically rely on the statistics of co-occurrences of words, while many of the possible co-occurrences are not observed even in a very large corpus (Church and Mercer 1993).",
        "We address this problem in several ways.",
        "First, instead of tallying word statistics from the examples for each sense (which may be unreliable when the examples are few), we collect sentence-level statistics, representing each sentence by the set of features it contains (for more on features, see Section 4.2).",
        "Second, we define a similarity measure on the feature space, which allows us to pool the statistics of similar features.",
        "Third, in addition to the examples of the polysemous word W in the corpus, we learn also from the examples of all the words in the dictionary definition of W. In our experiments, this resulted in a training set that could be up to 20 times larger than the set of original examples.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the approach we have developed.",
        "In Section 3, we report the results of tests we have conducted on the Treebank-2 corpus.",
        "Section 4 concludes with a discussion of related methods and a summary.",

        "1993).",
        "Note, further, that because we learn similarity from the training set of W, and not from the entire corpus, it tends to capture regularities with respect to the usage of W, rather than abstract or general regularities.",
        "For example, the otherwise unrelated words war and trafficking are similar in the contexts of the polysemous word drug ('narcotic'/'medicine'), because the expressions drug trafficking and the war on drugs appear in related contexts of drug.",
        "As a result, both war and trafficking are similar in being strongly indicative of the 'narcotic' sense of drug.",

        "Although this definition is circular, it turns out to be of great use, if applied iteratively, as described below.",
        "In each iteration n, we update a word similarity matrix WSM, (one matrix for each polysemous word), whose rows and columns are labeled by all the words encountered in the training set of W. In that matrix, the cell (i, j) holds a value between 0 and 1, indicating the extent to which word Wi is contextually similar to word Wi.",
        "In addition, we keep and update a separate sentence similarity matrix SSMk, for each sense sk of W (including a matrix SSMI6 that contains the similarities of the original examples to themselves).",
        "The rows in a sentence matrix SSMkn correspond to the original examples of W, and the columns to the original examples of W, for n = 0, and to the feedback-set examples for sense sk, for n > 0.",

        "Note that affinity is asymmetric: aff(S, W) aff(VV, S), because W may be similar to one of the words in S, which, however, is not one of the topic words of S; it is not an important word in S. In this case, aff(VV, S) is high, because W is similar to a word in S, but aff(S, W) is low, because S is not a representative example of the usage of the word W.",

        "In the subsequent iterations, each word W E Si contributes to the similarity of Si to S2 a value between 0 and 1, indicating its affinity to S2, instead of voting either 0 (if W E 52) or 1 (if W ft 82).",
        "Analogously, sentences contribute values to word similarity.",

        "For example, drug is more similar to traffic than traffic is to drug, because traffic is mentioned more frequently in drug contexts than drug is mentioned in contexts of traffic (which has many other usages).",

        "Second, words with a small count in the training set will have unreliable similarity values.",

        "Different dictionaries often disagree on the definitions; the split into senses may also depend on the task at hand.",
        "Thus, it is important to maintain the possibility of flexible distinction of the different senses, e.g., by letting this distinction be determined by an external knowledge source such as a thesaurus or a dictionary.",
        "Although this requirement may seem trivial, most corpus-based methods do not, in fact, allow such flexibility.",
