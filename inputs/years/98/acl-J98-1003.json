        "Word sense disambiguation (WSD) has been found useful in many natural language processing (NLP) applications, including information retrieval (Krovetz and Croft 1992; McRoy 1992), machine translation (Brown et al.",
        "1991; Dagan, Itai, and Schwall 1991; Dagan and Itai 1994), and speech synthesis (Yarowsky 1992).",
        "WSD has received increasing attention in recent literature on computational linguistics (Lesk 1986; Schtitze 1992; Gale, Church, and Yarowsky 1992; Yarowsky 1992, 1995; Bruce and Wiebe 1995; Luk 1995; Ng and Lee 1996; Chang et al.",
        "1996).",
        "Given a polysemous word in running text, the task of WSD involves examining contextual information to determine the intended sense from a set of predetermined candidates.",
        "It is a nontrivial task to divide the senses of a word and determine this set, for word sense is an abstract concept frequently based on subjective and subtle distinctions in topic, register, dialect, collocation, part of speech, and valency (McRoy 1992).",
        "Various approaches to word sense division have been proposed in the literature on WSD, including (1) sense numbers in everyday dictionaries (Lesk 1986; Cowie, Guthrie, and Guthrie 1992), (2) automatic or hand-crafted clusters of dictionary senses (Dolan 1994; Bruce and Wiebe 1995; Luk",
        "This paper is motivated by the observation that directly using dictionary senses for sense division offers several advantages.",
        "Sense distinction according to a dictionary is readily available from machine-readable dictionaries (MRDs) such as the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) (Proctor 1978).",
        "A dictionary such as the LDOCE has broad coverage of word senses, useful for WSD.",
        "Furthermore, indicative words and concepts for each sense are directly available in numbered definitions and examples.",
        "Lesk (1986) describes the first MRD-based WSD method that relies on the extent of overlap between words in a dictionary definition and words in the local context of the word to be disambiguated.",
        "The author reports that WSD performance ranges from 50% to 70% and his method works well for senses strongly associated with specific collocations, such as ice-cream cone and pine cone.",
        "Unfortunately, using MRDs as the knowledge source for sense division and disambiguation leads to some problems.",
        "Zernik (1992) notes that the dictionary dichotomy of senses is inadequate for WSD, because it is defined along grammatical, not semantic, lines.",
        "Furthermore, as pointed out in Dolan (1994), the sense division in an MRD is frequently too fine-grained for the purpose of WSD.",
        "A WSD system based on dictionary senses often faces unnecessary and difficult \"forced-choices.\"",
        "Dolan proposes a heuristic algorithm for forming unlabeled clusters of closely related senses in the LDOCE to eliminate distinctions that are unnecessarily fine for WSD.",
        "Regrettably, the proposed algorithm was only described in a few examples and was not developed further.",
        "Lacking an automatic method, recent WSD works (Bruce and Wiebe 1995; Luk 1995; Yarowsky 1995) still resort to human intervention to identify and group closely related senses in an MRD.",
        "Using thesaurus categories directly as a coarse sense division may seem to be a viable alternative (Yarowsky 1995).",
        "However, typical thesauri, such as Roget's Thesaurus (1987), suffer sense gaps and, occasionally, are too fine-grained.",
        "Yarowsky (1992) reports that there are uses not listed in Roget's for 3 of 12 nouns in his WSD study, while uses which a native speaker might consider as a single sense are often encoded in several Roget's categories.",
        "As an alternative approach to word sense division, this paper presents an algorithm capable of automatically clustering senses in an MRD based on topical information in a thesaurus.",
        "We refer to the algorithm as TopSense (Topical clustering of Senses).",
        "The current implementation of TopSense uses the topical information in the Longman Lexicon of Contemporary English (LLOCE) (McArthur 1992) to cluster LDOCE senses.",
        "The method makes use of none of the idiosyncratic information in either the LLOCE or the LDOCE.",
        "Therefore, the TopSense algorithm is quite general and is expected to produce comparable results for other MRDs and thesauri.",
        "TopSense is tested on 20 words extensively investigated in recent WSD literature (Schtitze 1992; Yarowsky 1992; Luk 1995).",
        "According to the experimental results, the automatically derived topical clusters can be used to good effect without any human intervention as a coarse sense division for WSD.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 starts out with a description of the MRDs and thesauri used in the computational lexicography and WSD literature, followed by some observations to justify the topic-based approach to word sense division.",
        "Section 3 describes the LinkSense algorithm for linking senses between an MRD and a thesaurus.",
        "Section 4 shows how the TopSense algorithm based on the IR model may be used to cluster the senses in an MRD.",
        "Examples are given in both",
        "Sections 3 and 4 to illustrate how the algorithms work.",
        "Section 4 also describes an implementation of the algorithms for the LDOCE and the LLOCE and reports the evaluation results for both algorithms based on a 20-word test set.",
        "Section 5 analyzes the experimental results to demonstrate the strengths and limitations of the method.",
        "The implication of TopSense to WSD and other issues related to lexical semantics are also touched upon.",
        "Section 6 compares the proposed method with other approaches in the computational linguistics literature.",

        "It should be clear by now that combining a dictionary and a thesaurus leads to a broad-coverage sense division with a suitable granularity for WSD.",
        "The obvious way to combine the two would be to disambiguate and link a sense definition D of a headword h in the dictionary to an entry relevant to D in the thesaurus.",

        "There is no simple solution e is no simple solution",
        "to the general WSD problem for unrestricted text, but we will show that this special case of disambiguating MRD definitions is significantly easier, for several reasons.",
        "First, the words used in a definition sentence are limited primarily to a small set; in the case of the LDOCE, the controlled vocabulary consists of some 2,000 words.",
        "For instance, in the first five LDOCE senses of bank shown in Table 1, all defining words are in the controlled vocabulary, except for the word SANDBANK, shown in capital letters.",
        "Obtaining WSD information for this small set of words obviously is much easier than it would be for a large, open set.",
        "Second, dictionary definitions adhere to rather rigid patterns under which only words with predictable semantic relations show up.",
        "A dictionary definition, in general, begins with a genus term (that is, conceptual ancestor of the sense), followed by a set of differentiae that are words semantically related to the sense to provide the specifics.",
        "The semantic relations between the sense, the genus, and differentiae are reflected in what are termed categorical, functional, and situational clusters in McRoy (1992).",
        "The semantic relations and clusters have been shown to be very effective knowledge sources for such NLP tasks as WSD (McRoy 1992) and interpretation of noun sequences (Vanderwende 1994).",
        "For instance, in the first four definitions of bank in Table 1, the genus terms land, earth, mass, and slope are categorically related to the respective bank senses.",
        "On the other hand, the differentiae river, lake, field, garden, bend, road, and racetrack have a LocationOf situational relation with bank.",
        "Other differentiae, snow, cloud, and mud, are related functionally to bank.1.n.3 through the MakeOf relation.",

        "The LLOCE and Roget's conveniently contain information on the relations in the form of word lists under a topic (category) or cross-referencing to other topics.",
        "Therefore, an MRD sense definition can be effectively disambiguated based on the word lists and cross-references in a thesaurus.",
        "A simple heuristic relying on the similarity between a sense's defining keywords and thesaurus word lists suffices to link an MRD sense to its relevant sense in the thesaurus.",
        "For instance, the differentiae (land, side, river, lake) of bank.1.n.1 is sufficiently similar to the word list of Ld-topic (Geography) to warrant the link between LDOCE sense bank.1.n.1 and LLOCE sense bank-Ld099.",
        "The topics and cross-references of LLOCE in general capture the Generic/Specific relation; therefore, a sense definition is often disambiguated through the genus.",

        "disambiguation of the genus.",
        "For instance, in the above example, linking bank.1.n.1 to bank-Ld099 has, as a by-product, the disambiguation of the genus land to land-Ld084 (Geography) rather than land-Ce078 (Social organization in groups and place).",
        "Details of extraction and disambiguation of the genus can be found in previous works (Guthrie et al.",

        "1992).",
        "Disambiguated genus and differentiae terms can be used to construct a better taxonomy of word senses.",

        "For instance, many verbs for moving and action, such as move and strike, can be used polysemously in the sense of emotion.",
        "Chodorow, Byrd, and Heidom (1985) observe that many instances of intersense relations can be found in W7 that are not idiosyncratic, but rather exist among senses of many words.",
        "Those relations include Process/Result, Food/Plant, and Container/Volume.",
        "Virtual polysemy and recurring intersense relations are closely related to polymorphic senses that can support coercion in semantic typing under Putstejovsky's (1991) theory of the generative lexicon.",
        "Dolan (1994) maintains the position that intersense relations are mostly idiosyn-cratical, thereby making it difficult to characterize them in a general way so as to identify them.",
        "The author cites the example of two senses of to moult, one a bird behavior and the other an animal behavior, to stress that polysemy primarily reflects fine distinctions that do not recur systematically throughout the English lexicon.",
        "However, our experimental results indicate that (a) it is exactly senses with fine distinction that are merged together and (b) there is a greater concentration of recurring intersense relations emerging from condensed senses.",
        "For instance, the distinction between the bird and animal behavior of moulting would be eliminated, since both are likely to be clustered and labeled as Ha (Making things) by TopSense.",
        "Relations among senses in the same topical clusters are mostly systematic.",
        "Many of those relations are reflected in the cross-reference information in the LLOCE.",
        "For instance, the LLOCE lists the following cross-references for the topic of Eb (Food):",
        "Most of those cross-references are systematic intersense relations similar to the abovementioned Food/Plant relation.",
        "Indeed, words involved in such intersense relations are frequently underspecified.",
        "For instance, chicken is listed under both topic Eb and topic Ad, while duck is listed under Ad but not Eb.",
        "By characterizing some 200 cross-references in LLOCE, most systematic sense shifts can be easily identified among the senses across topical clusters.",
        "The topical clusters of MRD senses, coupled with the topical description of sense-shift knowledge, can support and realize automatic sense extension, as advocated in Putstejovsky and Bouillon (1994), and prevent a proliferation of senses in the semantic lexicon.",
        "For instance, the sense of duck in the Ad cluster can be coerced into an Eb sense, in some context, based on the knowledge of a systematic sense shift from Ad (Birds) to Eb (Food)."

        "Sanfilippo and Poznanski (1992) propose a so-called dictionary correlation kit (DCK) in a dialogue-based environment for correlating word senses across a pair of MRDs such as the LDOCE and the LLOCE.",
        "The approach taken in DCK is essentially a heuristic one, based on a correlation in the headwords, grammar codes, definition, and examples between the senses in LDOCE and LLOCE.",
        "The authors indicate that for the heuristics to yield optimum results, the degree of overlap in the examples should be weighted twice as heavily as all other factors.",
        "However, they do not elaborate on how the comparisons are done, or on how effective the program is.",
        "Dolan (1994) describes a heuristic approach to forming unlabeled clusters of closely related senses in an MRD.",
        "The clustering program relies on LDOCE domain code, grammar code, and 25 types of semantic relations extracted from definitions such as Hypernym, Location, Manner, Purpose, Part0f, and Ingredient0f.",
        "Matching two senses",
        "involves comparing any values that have been identified for each of the semantic relation types.",
        "The author reports that straightforwardly comparing the values of the same semantic relation types, particularly the Hypern yin relation, for two senses would be quite effective.",
        "In addition to such a comparison, a number of \"scrambled\" comparisons between values of different types of semantic relations are also helpful.",
        "For instance, in comparing the two senses of coffee, the value \"drink\" in the sense, \"the coffee as a drink\" is compared with that of the Ingredient Of relation in another sense, \"the powder as an ingredient of the drink.\"",
        "Yarowsky (1992) describes a WSD method and an implementation based on Roget's Thesaurus and a very large corpus, the 10-million-word Grolier's Encyclopedia.",
        "He suggests that the method can be applied to disambiguation and merging of MRD definitions as well, and gives the results of applying the method to the senses of the word crane for the COBUILD and Collins dictionaries using Roget's categories as an example.",
        "It is not known how the method fares for words other than crane.",
        "Contrary to our approach, the method requires substantial data for training.",
        "In most of the above-mentioned works, experimental results are reported only for some senses of a few words.",
        "In this study, we have evaluated our method using all senses for 20 words that have been studied in WSD literature.",
        "This evaluation provides an overall picture of the expected success rate of the method when applied to all word senses in the MRD.",
        "Direct comparison of methods is often difficult, but it is clear that, as compared to other methods discussed above, our algorithm is very simple, requires minimal preprocessing, and does not rely on information idiosyncratic to the MRD, such as the LDOCE subject code or grammar code.",
        "Thus, the algorithm described in this paper can be readily applied to other MRDs besides LDOCE.",
        "Although our algorithm makes use of defining words in various semantic relations with the sense, those relations need not be explicitly computed through an elaborated parsing and extraction process.",
        "Finally, it is interesting to compare our method with some aspects of the program for induction of sense division of SchUtze (1992).",
        "As mentioned in the introduction, the program uses distributional similarity of lexical co-occurrence to partition word instances into clusters that are likely to be related to sense division.",
        "Drawing on the work of latent semantic indexing in IR research, words and contexts are represented as vectors in a multidimensional space.",
        "Regression techniques of singular value decomposition are used to reduce the representation to a lower dimensional space.",
        "After that, sense division is derived through unsupervised clustering of these word instances.",
        "Our method, on the other hand, relies primarily on co-occurrence in an existing set of topical clusters, the topics in LLOCE or Roget's.",
        "The sense in question is simply merged to the nearest topical cluster.",
        "Low-cost distance calculation is done according to the overlap between words in a definition and a topical cluster."

        "This paper presents the issues of WSD using machine-readable dictionaries.",
        "It describes simple but effective algorithms for disambiguating and clustering dictionary senses to create a sense division for WSD.",
        "The proposed algorithms are effective for specific linguistic reasons.",
        "Although word sense is an abstract concept that relies on the subjective and subtle distinction of many factors, coarse word sense division can be attributed primarily to the subject and topic.",
        "This is evident from the observation that very topical genus and differentiae show up in dictionary definitions in rather rigid patterns.",
        "Therefore, an MRD coupled with a thesaurus organized according to subjects and topics is very effective for acquisition of sense division for WSD.",
        "Chen and Chang Topical Clustering In a broader context, this paper presents an approach to automatic construction of semantic lexicons through integration of lexicographic resources such as MRDs and thesauri.",
        "As noted in Dolan (1994), it is possible to run a sense-clustering algorithm on several MRDs to build an integrated lexical database with more complete coverage of word senses.",
        "If TopSense is run on several bilingual MRDs, there is a potential for creating an integrated multilingual lexicon enriched with thesaurus concepts as language-neutral signs to support knowledge-based machine translation.",
        "A similar idea has been put forward by Okumura and Hovy (1994).",
        "The TopSense algorithm's performance could definitely be improved by handling deictic, metonymic, and metaphoric sense definitions more appropriately Nevertheless, the algorithm already produces clustered MRD sense entries that not only are exploitable as a workable sense division but also are likely to be an effective knowledge source for many NLP tasks related to semantic processing, such as WSD.",
        "In summary, this paper presents a functional core for automatic construction of the semantic lexicon."
