        "Word sense disambiguation is the task of assigning sense labels to occurrences of an ambiguous word.",
        "This problem can be divided into two subproblems: sense discrimination and sense labeling.",
        "Sense discrimination divides the occurrences of a word into a number of classes by determining for any two occurrences whether they belong to the same sense or not.",
        "Sense labeling assigns a sense to each class, and, in combination with sense discrimination, to each occurrence of the ambiguous word.",
        "This view of disambiguation as a two-stage process may not be completely general (for example, it may not be appropriate for the iterative process by which a lexicographer arrives at the sense divisions of a dictionary entry), but it seems applicable to most work on disambiguation in computational linguistics.",
        "In this paper, we will address the problem of sense discrimination as defined above.",
        "That is, we will not be concerned with the sense-labeling component of word sense disambiguation.",
        "Word sense discrimination is easier than full disambiguation since we need only determine which occurrences have the same meaning and not what the meaning actually is.",
        "Focusing solely on word sense discrimination also liberates us of a serious constraint common to other work on word sense disambiguation.",
        "If sense labeling is part of the task, an outside source of knowledge is necessary to define the senses.",
        "Regardless of whether it takes the form of dictionaries (Lesk 1986; Guthrie et al.",
        "1991; Dagan, Itai, and Schwall 1991; Karov and Edelman 1996), thesauri (Yarowsky 1992; Walker and Amsler 1986), bilingual corpora (Brown et al.",
        "1991; Church and Gale 1991), or hand-labeled training sets (Hearst 1991; Leacock, Towell, and Voorhees 1993; Niwa and Nitta 1994; Bruce and Wiebe 1994), providing information for sense definitions can be a considerable burden.",
        "What makes our approach unique is that, since we narrow the problem to sense discrimination, we can dispense of an outside source of knowledge for defining senses.",
        "We therefore call our approach automatic word sense discrimination, since we do not require manually constructed sources of knowledge.",
        "In many applications, word sense disambiguation must both discriminate and label occurrences; for example, in order to find the correct translation of an ambiguous word in machine translation or the right pronunciation in a text-to-speech system.",
        "The application of interest to us is information access, i.e., making sense of and finding information in large text databases.",
        "For many problems in information access, it is sufficient to solve the discrimination problem only.",
        "In one study, we measured document-query similarity based on word senses rather than words and achieved a considerable improvement in ranking relevant documents ahead of nonrelevant documents (Schtitze and Pedersen 1995).",
        "Since the measurement of similarity is a system-internal process, no reference to externally defined senses need be made.",
        "Another potentially beneficial application of word sense discrimination in information access is the design of interfaces that take account of ambiguity.",
        "If a user enters a query that contains an ambiguous word, a system capable of discrimination can give examples of the different senses of the word in the text database.",
        "The user can then decide which sense was intended and only documents with the intended sense would be retrieved.",
        "Again, a reference to external sense definitions is not required for this task.",
        "The algorithm we propose in this paper is context-group discrimination: Context-group discrimination groups the occurrences of an ambiguous word into clusters, where clusters consist of contextually similar occurrences.",
        "Words, contexts, and clusters are represented in a high-dimensional, real-valued vector space.",
        "Context vectors capture the information present in second-order co-occurrence.",
        "Instead of forming a context representation from the words that the ambiguous word directly occurs with in a particular context (first-order co-occurrence), we form the context representation from the words that these words in turn co-occur with in the training corpus.",
        "Second-order co-occurrence information is less sparse and more robust than first-order information.",
        "In context-group discrimination, the context of each occurrence of the ambiguous word in the training corpus is represented as a context vector formed from second-order co-occurrence information.",
        "The context vectors are then clustered into coherent groups such that occurrences judged similar according to second-order co-occurrence are assigned to the same cluster.",
        "Clusters are represented by their centroids, the average of their elements.",
        "An occurrence in a test text is disambiguated by computing the second-order representation of the relevant context, and assigning it to the cluster whose centroid is closest to that representation.",
        "Since the choice of representation influences the formation of clusters, we will experiment with several representations in this paper, some involving a dimensionality reduction using singular value decomposition (SVD).",
        "Context-group discrimination can be generalized to do a discrimination task that goes beyond the notion of sense that underlies many other contributions to the disambiguation literature.",
        "If the ambiguous word's occurrences are clustered into a large number n of clusters (e.g., n =- 10), then the clusters can capture fine contextual distinctions.",
        "Consider the example of space.",
        "For a small number of clusters, only the senses \"outer space\" and \"limited extent in one, two, or three dimensions\" are separated.",
        "If the word's occurrences are clustered into more clusters, then finer distinctions such as the one between \"office space\" and \"exhibition space\" are also discovered.",
        "Note that differences between sense entries in dictionaries are often similarly fine-grained.",
        "The basic design of context-group discrimination.",
        "Contexts of the ambiguous word in the training set are mapped to context vectors in Word Space (upper dashed arrow) by summing the vectors of the words in the context.",
        "The context vectors are grouped into clusters (dotted lines) and represented by sense vectors, their centroids (squares).",
        "A context of the ambiguous word (\"test context\") is disambiguated by mapping it to a context vector in Word Space (lower dashed arrow ending in circle).",
        "The context is assigned to the sense with the closest sense vector (solid arrow).",
        "Even if the contextual distinctions captured by generalized context-group discrimination do not line up perfectly with finer distinctions made in dictionaries, they still help characterize the contextual meaning in which the ambiguous word is used in a particular instance.",
        "Such a characterization is useful for the information-access applications described above, among others.",
        "The basic idea of context-group discrimination is to induce senses from contextual similarity.",
        "There is some evidence that contextual similarity also plays a crucial role in human semantic categorization.",
        "Miller and Charles (1991) found evidence in several experiments that humans determine the semantic similarity of words from the similarity of the contexts they are used in.",
        "We hypothesize that, by extension, senses are also based on contextual similarity: a sense is a group of contextually similar occurrences of a word.",

        "Each occurrence of the ambiguous word in the training set is mapped to a point in Word Space (shown for one example occurrence: see dashed line from training text to Word Space).",
        "The mapping is based on word vectors that are looked up in Word Space (to be described below).",

        "The context is then assigned to the context group whose centroid is closest (solid arrow).",
        "Finally, the context is categorized as being a use of the sense corresponding to this context group.",

        "They are represented as word vectors, context vectors, and sense vectors, respectively.",
        "Word vectors are derived from neighbors in the corpus, context vectors are derived from word vectors, and sense vectors are derived by way of clustering from the distribution of context vectors.",

        "Systems based on it have ranked among the best in many evaluations of IR performance (Harman 1993).",
        "The success of the vector-space model motivates us to use it for the representation of words.",
        "We represent words in a space in which each dimension corresponds to a word, just as documents and queries are commonly represented in this space in IR.",
        "Another approach to computing word similarity is the representation of words in a document space in which each dimension corresponds to a document (Lesk 1969; Salton 1971; Qiu and Frei 1993).",
        "There are fewer occurrence-in-document than word-co-occurrence events, so these word representations tend to be more sparse and, arguably, less informative than word-based representations.",
        "Word vectors have also been based on hand-encoded features (Gallant 1991) and dictionaries (Sparck-Jones 1986; Wilks et al.",
        "1990).",
        "Corpus-based methods like the one proposed here have the advantage that no manual labor is required and that a possible mismatch between a general dictionary and a specialized text (e.g., on chemistry) is avoided.",
        "Finally, word similarity can be computed from structural features like head-modifier relationships (Grefenstette 1994b; Ruge 1992; Dagan, Marcus, and Markovitch 1993; Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993; Dagan, Pereira, and Lee 1994).",
        "Like document-based representations, structure-based representations are sparser than those based on co-occurrence.",
        "It is debatable whether structural features are more informative than associational features (Grefenstette 1992, 1996) or not (Schiitze and Pedersen 1997).",
        "Approaches to word representation closely related to ours were proposed by Niwa and Nitta (1994) and Burgess and Lund (1997).",

        "The underlying assumption in using the x2-test is that candidate words whose occurrence depends on whether the ambiguous word occurs will be indicative of one of the senses of the ambiguous word and hence useful for disambiguation.' After 1,000 words have been selected in local selection, word vectors are formed by collecting a 1, 000-by-1, 000 matrix C, such that element c1 records the number of times that words i and j co-occur in a window of size k.

        "All occurrences of either word in the corpus are then replaced by the new type.",
        "It is easy to evaluate disambiguation performance for pseudowords since one can go back to the original text to decide whether a correct decision was made.",
        "To create the pseudowords shown in Table 2, all word pairs were extracted from the corpus, i.e., all pairs of words that occurred adjacent to each other in the corpus in a particular order.",
        "All numbers were discarded, since numbers do not seem to involve sense ambiguity.",
        "Pseudowords were then created by randomly drawing two pairs from those that had a frequency between 500 and 1,000 in the corpus.",
        "Pseudowords were generated from pairs rather than simple words because pairs are less likely than words to be ambiguous themselves.",
        "Pair-based pseudowords are therefore good examples of ambiguous words with two clearly distinct senses.",

        "Rare senses are those that account for fewer than 15% of the occurrences.",

        "This is also the reason that we do not do cross-validation.",
        "Cross-validation respecting the constraint that test and training sets be from different time periods would have required a test set several times larger than the one that was available.",
        "Clustering and evaluating on the same set is also problematic because of sampling variation.",

        "We have a set of three context vectors C = Ici = (1), c2 -= (2), c3 = (3)1 in a one-dimensional space.",
        "Contexts 1 and 2 are uses of sense 1, context 3 is a use of sense 2.",

        "If we split C into a training set T of size 2 and a test set E of size 1, we get an average performance of 67% (100% for E = Ici 1, 50% for E = {c2}, 50% for E = {c3}), which is lower than 83%.",
        "This example shows that conflating training and test set can result in artificially high performance.",
        "An advantage of context-group discrimination is that the granularity of sense distinctions is an adjustable parameter of the algorithm.",

        "To test performance for fine-grained sense distinctions (e.g., 'office space' vs. 'exhibition space'), we will run two experiments, one that evaluates performance for clustering the context vectors of a word into ten clusters and an information retrieval experiment in which the number of clusters is also large for sufficiently frequent words.",
        "The goal of the 10-cluster experiments is to induce more fine-grained sense distinctions than in the 2-cluster experiments.",
        "However, it is harder to determine the ground truth for fine sense distinctions.",
        "When it comes to fine distinctions, a large number of occurrences are indeterminate or compatible with several of the more finely individuated senses (cf. Kilgarriff [1993]).",
        "For this reason, experiments with a large number of clusters were evaluated using two indirect measures.",
        "The first measure is accuracy for two-way discriminations, i.e., the degree to which each of the ten clusters contained only one of the two \"coarse\" senses.",
        "This evaluation is indirect because a cluster that contains, say, only 'limited extent in one, two, or three dimensions' uses of space would be deemed 100% correct, yet it could be randomly mixed as far as fine sense distinctions are concerned (e.g., 'office space' vs. 'exhibition space').",
        "The author inspected the data and found good separation of fine-grained senses in the 10-cluster experiments to the extent that the evaluation measure indicated good performance on the two-way discrimination task.",
        "However, because of the above-mentioned subjectivity of judgements for fine sense distinctions, this is hard to quantify.",
        "Results from a second evaluation on an information retrieval task will be presented in Section 4.2 below.",

        "Such minimal user input will be a negligible burden for users in some situations.",
        "However, consider the interactive information-access application described above.",
        "When asked to improve their initial ambiguous information request many users will be reluctant to",
        "give a seed word or a set of good features for each sense of the word.",
        "They are more likely to satisfy a request by the system to choose the correct sense (e.g., by mouse click), if example contexts corresponding to different senses are presented without the requirement of additional user interaction.",
        "In an application like this, it is of great advantage that context-group discrimination does not require any manual intervention to induce senses.",
        "Another body of related work is the literature on word clustering in computational linguistics (Brown et al.",
        "1992; Finch 1993; Pereira, Tishby, and Lee 1993; Grefenstette 1994a) and document clustering in information retrieval (van Rijsbergen 1979; Willett 1988; Sparck-Jones 1991; Cutting et al.",
        "1992).",
        "In contrast to this earlier work, we cluster contexts or, equivalently, word tokens here, not words (or, more precisely, word types) or documents.",
        "The straightforward extension of word-type clustering and document clustering to word-token clustering would be to represent a token by all words it co-occurs with in its context and cluster these representations.",
        "Such an approach based on first-order co-occurrence is used, for example, by Hearst and Plaunt (1993) for the representation of tiles or document subunits that are similar to our notion of context.",
        "Instead, we use second-order co-occurrence to represent the tokens of ambiguous words: the words that occur with the token are in turn looked up in the training corpus and the words they co-occur with are used to represent the token.",
        "Second-order representations are less sparse and more robust than first-order representations.",
        "In a cluster-based approach, the subdivision of the universe of elements into clusters depends on the representation.",
        "If the representation does not capture the information crucial for distinguishing senses, then context-group discrimination performs poorly.",
        "The clearest such example in the above experiments is the pseudoword wide range/consulting firm.",
        "The algorithm does not do better than the baseline of always choosing the most frequent sense.",
        "The reason is that the representation captures only topic information.",
        "So a cluster will contain a group of contexts that are about the same topic.",
        "Unfortunately, the pair wide range can come up in text about almost any topic.",
        "Since there is no clear topical characterization of one sense of the pseudoword, context-group discrimination performs poorly.",
        "The reliance on topical similarity may also be the reason that performance for pseudowords is generally better than performance for natural ambiguous words.",
        "All pseudowords except for wide range/consulting firm are composed of two pairs from different topics.",
        "For example, heart disease and reserve board pertain to biology and finance, respectively, two clearly distinct topics.",
        "On the other hand, the senses of some of the ambiguous words have less clear associations with particular topics.",
        "For example, one can be trained to perform a wide variety of activities, so the 'teaching' sense of train can be invoked in many different topics.",
        "Part of the superior performance for pseudowords is due to this different topic sensitivity of natural and artificial ambiguous words.",
        "The limitation to topical distinctions is not so much a flaw of context-group discrimination as a flaw of the particular implementation we have presented here.",
        "It is possible to integrate information in the context vectors that reflect syntactic or sub-categorization behavior of different senses, such as the output of a shallow parser as used in Pereira, Tishby, and Lee (1993).",
        "For example, one good indicator of the two senses of the word interest is a preposition occurring to its right.",
        "The phrase interest in invokes the 'feeling of attention' sense, the phrase interest on, the sense 'charge on borrowed money.' It seems plausible that performance could be improved for words whose senses are less sensitive to topical distinctions if such \"proximity\" information is integrated.",
        "In some recent experiments, Pedersen and Bruce (1997) have used proximity features (tags of close words and the presence or absence of close functions words",
        "Schatze Automatic Word Sense Discrimination and content words) with some promising results.",
        "This suggests that a combination of the topical features used here and proximity features may give optimal performance of context-group discrimination.' We have used only one source of information (topical features) in the interest of simplicity, not because we see any inherent advantage of topical features compared to a combination of multiple sources of evidence.",
        "Our justification for the basic idea of context-group discrimination, inducing senses from contextual similarity, has been that its results seem to align well with the ground truth of senses defined in dictionaries.",
        "However, there is also some evidence that contextual similarity plays a crucial role in human semantic categorization.",
        "In one study, Miller and Charles (1991) found evidence that human subjects determine the semantic similarity of words from the similarity of the contexts they are used in.",
        "They summarized this result in the following hypothesis: Strong Contextual Hypothesis: Two words are semantically similar to the extent that their contextual representations are similar.",
        "(p. 8) A contextual representation of a word is knowledge of how that word is used.",
        "The hypothesis states that semantic similarity is determined by the degree of similarity of the sets of contexts that the two words can be used in.",
        "The hypothesis that underlies context-group discrimination is an extension of the Strong Contextual Hypothesis to senses: Contextual Hypothesis for Senses: Two occurrences of an ambiguous word belong to the same sense to the extent that their contextual representations are similar.",
        "So a sense is simply a group of occurrence tokens with similar contexts.",
        "The analogy between the contextual hypotheses for words and senses is that both word types and word tokens are semantically similar to the extent that their contexts are semantically similar.",
        "A group of contextually similar word tokens is a sense.",
        "Miller and Charles's work thus provides a justification for our framework, the induction of senses from contextual similarity.",
        "There are several issues that need to be addressed in future work on context-group discrimination.",
        "First, our experiments only considered words with two major senses.",
        "The algorithm also needs to be tested for words with more than two frequent senses and for infrequent senses.",
        "Second, our test set consisted of a relatively small number of natural ambiguous words.",
        "This is a flaw of almost all contemporary work on word sense disambiguation, but in the future more extensive test sets will be required to establish the general applicability of disambiguation algorithms.",
        "Finally, the implementation of context-group discrimination proposed here is based on topical similarity only.",
        "It will be necessary to incorporate other, more structural constraints (such as the interest in vs. interest on case discussed above) to achieve adequate performance for a wide variety of ambiguous words."
