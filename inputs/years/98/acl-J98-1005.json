        "Unfortunately, the effectiveness of these word-matching systems is depressed by both homographs and synonyms.",
        "Homographs depress the accuracy of the retrieval systems by making texts about two different concepts appear to match.",
        "Synonyms impair the system's ability to find all matching documents, since different words mask conceptual matches.",
        "While polysemy is the immediate cause of the first problem, it indirectly contributes to the second problem as well by preventing the effective use of thesauri.",
        "These considerations motivate our desire for a highly accurate word sense disambiguator.",
        "Our experimental results show that the disambiguator described in this paper is quite accurate.",
        "The disambiguator is a particular formulation of feed-forward neural networks (Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams 1986) that separately extract topical and local contexts of a target word from a set of sample sentences that are tagged with the correct sense of the target.",
        "The neural networks responsible for topical and local disambiguation are then combined to form a single, \"contextual\" representation (Miller and Charles 1991).",
        "Further experiments show that the accuracy of the contextual disambiguator can be improved if the disambiguator is allowed to label some examples as",
        "unknown.",
        "Since the accumulation of sufficient tagged samples is expensive and time-consuming, we finish by describing an extension of our algorithm through which its accuracy can be enhanced by using inexpensive untagged examples.",
        "Our long-term goal is to be able to incorporate such a contextual disambiguation system within a taxonomy such as WordNet (Miller 1990) and thereby to use it for resolving query word senses at retrieval runtime.",
        "To accomplish this goal, the disambiguator must be able to construct contextual representations that accurately distinguish among the highly ambiguous words found in general-purpose lexicons as well as build representations that are efficient to use at query runtime.",

      "text": [
        "The effectiveness of information retrieval systems is usually measured in terms of precision, the percentage of retrieved documents that are relevant, and recall, the percentage of relevant documents that are retrieved.",
        "As mentioned above, in principle, the direct effect of polysemy on word-matching systems is to decrease precision (e.g., queries about financial banks retrieve documents about rivers).",
        "The impact this direct effect has in practice is less clear.",
        "Schiltze and Pedersen (1995) found noticeable improvement in precision using sense-based (as opposed to word-based) retrieval.",
        "On the other hand, Krovetz and Croft (1992) concluded that polysemy hurt retrieval only if the searcher needed very high recall or was using very short (one or two word) queries.",
        "Sanderson (1994) found that resolving senses could degrade retrieval performance unless the disambiguation procedure was very accurate, although he worked with large, rich queries.",
        "Other techniques also address the polysemy problem without requiring explicit disambiguation.",
        "One such technique is local-global matching (Salton and Buckley 1991), where the similarity of a document with a query depends not only on the words occurring in the entire document but also on the existence of smaller lexical units, such as sentences, that exhibit particularly close matches with the query.",
        "These techniques implicitly accommodate ambiguity: by computing similarity measures based on word co-occurrence, the systems find instances of words used in the same contexts and thus words that are used in the same sense.",
        "Polysemy has a second, indirect effect, however, in that it hampers the successful application of thesauri.",
        "Much as using the same word in different senses can depress precision by causing false matches, using different words to express the same sense (i.e., synonyms) depresses recall by causing true conceptual matches to be missed.",
        "One way to mitigate the effects of synonyms is to use lexical aids to expand a text (usually the query) by words that are closely related to words in the original text.",
        "This procedure has met with some success in experiments on small, single-domain collections.",
        "For example, Salton and Lesk (1971) found that expansion by synonyms only improved performance, and Wang, Vendendorpe, and Evens (1985) found that a variety of lexical-semantic relations improved retrieval performance.",
        "However, it is difficult to obtain similar improvements in heterogeneous collections where the lexical aids necessarily contain multiple senses of words (Voorhees and Hou 1993; Voorhees 1994a, 1994b).",
        "Selecting the correct sense of a word to be expanded is an essential first step when expanding queries by lexically related words.",
        "Experiments run on the diverse TREC test collection (Harman 1993), and using the WordNet lexical system as a source of related words, demonstrate that expanding queries by the set of words such that each word in the set is related to some (any) sense of the query word consistently degrades performance compared to the base run in which no expansion is done (Voorhees and",
        "Towell and Voorhees Disambiguating Highly Ambiguous Words Hou 1993).",
        "However, query expansion by lexically related words can significantly improve retrieval effectiveness: additional experiments in which hand-selected WordNet synonym sets were used as seeds for expansion improved retrieval performance by over 30% (Voorhees 1994b).",
        "Because the process used in hand-picking the seed synonym sets encompassed more than simple sense resolution – other considerations such as specificity of the sense and perceived usefulness of the concept also played a part – simply finding the correct sense of the query terms is not likely to produce this large an improvement.",
        "Nonetheless, significant improvement should be possible if the correct sense can be determined.",
        "Unfortunately, determining the correct sense of a query word using simply the paradigmatic relations that organize WordNet and other thesauri is unlikely to be successful (Voorhees 1993).1 Instead, the word sense disambiguation literature strongly suggests that syntagmatic relations are important for sense resolution.",
        "For example, consider the word board and the noun hierarchy of WordNet.",
        "Each of nail, hammer, and carpenter is a good clue for the 'lumber' sense of board, but each is closest to some other sense of board in WordNet when distance is measured by the number of IS-A links between the respective nodes.",
        "An ideal lexical system would therefore incorporate both paradigmatic and syntagmatic relations.",
        "An automatic text retrieval system could exploit such a combined lexical system by first using the syntagmatic relations to resolve word senses, and then adding both paradigmatic and syntagmatic-related words to the query.",
        "The WordNet expansion experiments discussed above (Voorhees 1994b) suggest that paradigmatic-related words are useful for expansion, while the success of retrieval techniques such as relevance feedback (Salton and Buckley 1990) demonstrates the usefulness of expansion by syntagmatic-related words.",
        "Since the different relations link quite different sets of words, the combined effect should be complimentary, resulting in greater improvement than either type of expansion alone.",
        "To test this conjecture, we must build a lexical system that contains both types of relations.",
        "This in turn requires capturing the syntagmatic relations associated with the various senses contained within a particular paradigmatic lexicon.",
        "A word sense disambiguator that can capture these relations is described in the remainder of the paper."

        "In earlier work, we demonstrated that contextual representations consisting of both local and topical components are effective for resolving word senses and can be automatically extracted from sample texts (Leacock, Towell, and Voorhees 1996).",
        "The topical component consists of substantive words that are likely to co-occur with a given sense of the target word.",
        "Word order and grammatical inflections are not used in topical context.",
        "In contrast, the local component includes information on word order, distance, and some information about syntactic structure; it includes all tokens (words and punctuation marks) in the immediate vicinity of the target word.",
        "Inclusion of a local component is motivated in part by a study that showed that Princeton University",
        "undergraduates were more accurate at resolving word senses when given complete sentences than when given only an alphabetized list of content words appearing in the sentences (Leacock, Towel!, and Voorhees 1996).",

        "Black (1988) trained on high-frequency local and topical context using a method based upon decision trees.",
        "While Black's results were encouraging, our attempt to use C4.5 (a decision-tree algorithm [Quinlan 19921) on the topical encoding of line were uniformly disappointing (Leacock, Towell, and Voorhees 1993).",

        "The senses tested for each word are listed in Table 1.",
        "We restrict the test to senses within a single part of speech to focus the work on the harder part of the disambiguation problem – the accuracy of simple stochastic part-of-speech taggers such as Brill's (Brill 1992) suggests that distinguishing among senses with different parts of speech can readily be accomplished.",
        "The data set we use is identical to that of Leacock, Chodorow and Miller (this volume) with two exceptions.",
        "First, we do not use part-of-speech tags.",
        "Second, we use exactly the same number of examples for each sense.",
        "To create data sets with an equal number of examples of each sense, we took the complete set of labeled examples for a word and randomly subsampled it so that all senses occurred equally often in our subsample.",

        "The same three subsamples were used in all of the experiments reported below.",
        "Analysis of variance studies have never detected a statistically significant difference between the subsamples.",
        "We used the same number of examples of each sense to eliminate any confounding effects of occurrence frequency.",
        "We do this because the frequency with which different senses occur in a corpus varies depending on the corpus type (the Wall Street Journal has many more instances of the 'product line' sense of line than other senses of line, for example) and can be difficult to estimate.",

        "The goal of our sense disambiguation work is to develop a classifier that allows information retrieval systems to exploit the semantics encoded in lexical systems such as WordNet to improve retrieval performance.",
        "To be useful in that environment, the classifier must be effective at distinguishing the senses included in the lexicon and efficient enough to use during query processing.",
        "As a first step towards this goal, we have developed a classifier that is able to select the sense of a single highly ambiguous word given the two-sentence context in which the word appears.",
        "We tested our sense disambiguation approach on three highly polysemous words: six noun senses of line, four verb senses of serve, and three adjective senses of hard.",
        "The performance of our disambiguator on these three tasks was quite good; it has an average accuracy of 87%, 90%, and 81%, respectively, when it is forced to label all test examples.",
        "The labeling accuracy of our method can be further improved by allowing it to respond do not know on a small percentage of the test examples.",
        "While our current plan is to resolve the sense of each query term independently, some modifications to the current classifier may provide for the simultaneous classification of multiple polysemous words in a single context.",
        "By changing from backpropagation to the EM algorithm (Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977), we can jointly refine poor guesses of the senses of the words with feedback from prior iterations.",
        "Our desire to use the sense classifier as part of a query-processing step influenced the types of classifiers we considered.",
        "The error-correcting codes networks discussed in Section 4.1 offer the potential for slightly higher accuracy rates than our simple sum combination, but at a significantly higher cost in time and space.",
        "Hence, we concentrated our effort on a simple scheme for combining local and topical neural networks using a sum of the output activations.",
        "Using this method, the expense of using the classifier would be dominated by the time and space requirements needed to break the query into tokens and to map those tokens to the correct input units of the various networks.",
        "The bottleneck in our approach to query processing is obtaining sufficient labeled examples for the set of polysemous words in a large lexicon.",
        "To minimize the bottleneck as much as possible, we developed a technique that substitutes inexpensive, readily available unlabeled examples for a labeled example while maintaining comparable levels of accuracy.",
        "Nonetheless, it is clearly impossible to gather examples of all possible senses of all possible words.",
        "Thus, we also examined the impact on sense resolution accuracy of having previously unseen senses occur in the classifier's test cases.",
        "The classifier is allowed to choose do not know for a particular test case by requiring the output activation to be above a threshold before a sense is considered to be selected.",
        "When modified in this manner and trained on a subset of the available senses, the classifier chose do not know on a large fraction of the test cases of the sense it had not been trained on.",
