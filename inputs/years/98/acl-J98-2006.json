        "Analyses within generative phonology have traditionally been stated in terms of systems of rewrite rules, which, when applied in the appropriate sequence, produce a surface form from an underlying representation.",
        "As first pointed out by Johnson (1972), the effects of phonological rewrite rules can be simulated using only finite-state machinery, with iterative application accomplished by sending the output from one transducer to the input of the next, a process that can be compiled out into a single transducer (Kaplan and Kay 1994).1 Using this insight, a vast majority of computational implementations of phonological rule systems have been done using finite-state transducers or extensions thereof (Sproat 1992).",
        "Recently, there has been a shift in much of the work on phonological theory, from systems of rules to sets of well-formedness constraints (Paradis 1988, Scobbie 1991, Prince and Smolensky 1993, Burzio 1994).",
        "This shift has, however, had relatively little impact upon computational work (but see Bird and Ellison 1994).",
        "In this paper, we begin an examination of the effects of the move from rule-based to constraint-based theories upon the generative properties of phonological theories.",
        "Specifically, we will focus our efforts on the issue of whether the widely adopted constraint-based view known as Optimality Theory (OT) may be instantiated in a finite-state transducer.2 OT",
        "raises a particularly interesting theoretical question in this context: it allows the specification of a ranking among the constraints and allows lower-ranked constraints to be violated in order for higher-ranked constraints to be satisfied.",
        "This violability property means that certain well-known computational techniques for imposing constraints are not directly applicable.",
        "Our study can be seen, therefore, as the beginnings of an investigation of the generative complexity of constraint ranking and violability.",
        "In this paper, we present a general formalization of OT that directly embodies that theory's notion of constraint violability.",
        "We then study the formal properties of one particular case of this general formalization in which the mapping from input to possible output forms, GEN, is representable as a finite-state transducer, and where each constraint is represented by means of some total function from strings to non-negative integers, with the requirement that the inverse image of every integer be a regular set.",
        "These two formal assumptions are sufficiently generous to allow us to capture most of the current phonological analyses within the OT framework that have been presented in the literature.",
        "We prove that the generative capacity of the resulting system does not exceed that of the class of finite-state transducers precisely when each constraint has a finite codomain, i.e., constraints may distinguish among only a finite set of equivalence classes of candidates.",
        "As will be discussed in Section 6, this result is optimal with respect to the finite codomain assumption, in the sense that dropping this assumption allows the representation of relations that cannot be implemented by means of a finite-state transducer (the latter fact has been shown to us by Markus Hiller, and will be discussed here).",

        "As in derivational systems, the general form of phonological computation in OT proceeds from an underlying representation (UR).3 Such a UR is fed as input to the function GEN, which produces as output the set of all possible surface realizations (SRs) for this UR, called the candidate set.",
        "The notion of a possible SR, as realized in Prince and Smolensky (1993), is governed by the containment condition, requiring any SR output by GEN to include a representation of the UR as a (not necessarily contiguous) subpart.",
        "Thus, an SR must at a minimum include all of the structure that is specified in the UR, but may also include extra structure absent from the UR, called epenthetic structure.",
        "This is not to say that all parts of the input are necessarily pronounced at the surface.",
        "Rather, the analogue of \"deletion\" may occur by marking that part of the SR corresponding to the deleted material as unparsed, meaning that it is not visible to the phonetic interface.",

        "We are, however, interested in the more general question of whether the input – output mapping specified by OT for the class of inputs as a whole can be simulated with finite-state machinery.",
        "Another related study is that of Tesar (1995), who shows how the set of optimal output forms can be efficiently computed using a dynamic programming technique.",
        "Tesar does not, however, address the question of the generative complexity of the mappings his algorithm computes.",
        "Frank and Sada Constraint Violability duce the SR.",
        "The core of the OT machinery is devoted to choosing among the members of this candidate set to determine which is the actual SR. To do this, OT imposes a set of well-formedness constraints on the elements of the candidate set.",
        "Note, however, that these constraints are not imposed conjunctively, meaning that the \"winning\" SR need not, and most often will not, satisfy them all.",
        "Instead, OT allows for the specification of a language-particular ranking among the constraints, reflecting their relative importance.",
        "The candidate SRs are evaluated with respect to the constraints in a number of stages.",
        "At each stage, the entire candidate set is subjected to one of the constraints, the stage at which a constraint is applied being determined by the specified constraint ranking.'",
        "There are two possible outcomes of such an evaluation.",
        "The first arises when some members of the candidate set violate the constraint, but others do not.",
        "In this case, the constraint permits us to distinguish among the members of the candidate set: those that do not satisfy the constraint are eliminated from the candidate set and are not considered in subsequent constraint evaluation.",
        "(Alternatively, if a constraint can be violated multiple times by a single SR, the relevant evaluation compares the number of violations incurred by each of the SRs in the candidate set.",
        "Candidates with the fewest violations are preferred and those with more violations are eliminated.)",
        "The second possible outcome from a constraint evaluation ensues when all of the members of the candidate set violate the constraint to the same degree, perhaps massively or perhaps not at all.",
        "When this happens, the constraint does not help us in narrowing down the candidate set.",
        "Hence, no candidates are eliminated from the candidate set and violations of the constraint do not block any of them from being considered further to be the actual SR. At the end of the last stage, i.e., when all constraints have been applied, what remains is precisely the subset of the candidate set that are the optimal satisfiers of the constraints under their ranking.",
        "This set of candidates, which will often contain only a single member under the system of constraints suggested by Prince and Smolensky (1993), is taken as the set of actual SRs for the original UR.",
        "OT makes the strong assumption that the constraints used to evaluate the members of the candidate set are universal, and are therefore active in the phonology of every language.",
        "What varies from one language to another is the relative ranking of constraints.",
        "Thus, as soon as a commitment is made concerning the set of constraints, there is a concomitant commitment concerning the range of possible typological variation: every ordering of the constraints corresponds to a possible phonological system."
