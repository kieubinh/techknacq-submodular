        "In this paper, we approach the problem of verb alternations from the perspective of knowledge-based natural language generation (NLG), which aims at producing a set of verbalizations from a common underlying representation.",
        "This viewpoint places some specific requirements on the nature of lexical representations, which will be explained in Section 2.",
        "Thereafter, we will investigate the problem of systematically generating a number of verb alternations – a problem that so far has received little attention in the NLG community Why should a language generator have knowledge about producing alternations?",
        "Because a sophisticated discourse production may call for using a verb in one or another configuration, depending on the current situation of utterance.",
        "Alternations can place the emphasis on different elements of the sentence, and distribution of emphasis is influenced by the development of the discourse – and thus related to a whole range of other generation decisions.",
        "To illustrate, consider the following alternative beginnings of a little story:",
        "(1) (a) Tom was in a hurry, but he had to change the oil before hitting the road.",
        "He crawled under the car and unscrewed the drain bolt.",
        "The engine drained in 20 seconds.... (b) Time was short, but the oil had to be changed before Tom could hit the road.",
        "Within 20 seconds, he drained the engine.",
        "Then ... (c) Tom was in a hurry, but he had to change the oil before hitting the road.",
        "Quickly, he crawled under the car and unscrewed the drain bolt.",
        "For 20 long seconds, the oil drained from the engine....",
        "(d) Tom was in a hurry, but he had to change the oil before hitting the road.",
        "Crawling under the car, he drained the old oil from the engine, and then ...",
        "Depending on how the story develops, which might hinge on stylistic parameters, a different configuration of to drain, with different subjects, objects, and prepositional phrases, should be produced.",
        "Therefore, if an NLG system is expected to be able to cope with such differences, it needs knowledge of what alternations are possible for a given verb, and how the different syntactic configurations relate to differences in meaning.",
        "In linguistics, the central goal of research on alternations is to uncover the relationships between syntax and semantics (linking rules), and to form classifications of verbs according to their alternation behavior (Levin 1993).",
        "To accomplish these goals, the need for fine-grained lexical-semantic representations is pointed out, although there is no strong consensus yet on exactly what such representations should look like (see the discussion in Levin and Rappaport Hovav [1995, chapter 1]).",
        "NLG, in any case, needs representations to work with; and in order to account for verb alternations, we need to devise rather fine-grained ones.",
        "In particular, a generator has to relate the (possible) changes in meaning to the changes in form, so that – from a given representation – the correct set of \"alternated verb forms\" can be produced.",
        "In other words, the generator needs to know the conditions under which some input representation licenses the use of a specific alternation.",
        "As a step in this direction, we consider a number of alternations that affect the aspectual category (or Aktionsart) of the verb – a group that Levin (1993, 12) chose not to focus on.",
        "We look at the differences in meaning that coincide with such alternations, and propose suitable representations for input specifications (the underlying ontology), for verb meaning, and for the alternation rules.",
        "These rules are able to sequentially derive the various alternated forms from a single base form, which is stated in the lexical entry.",
        "The approach has been implemented in a bilingual generation system, which can produce the \"alternated paraphrases\" in English and German.",
        "To demonstrate its capabilities, we will show how a salience parameter associated with the input can give rise to selecting one or another of the alternatives; specifically, the production of the alternative drain sentences (la–d), from a common underlying representation, will be demonstrated.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the specific requirements of lexical information in NLG, focusing on verbs, and suggests a format for dictionary entries.",
        "Section 3 develops our approach to verb alternations and proposes rules that account for several such alternations.",
        "Section 4 describes the implementation of the alternation framework in the MOOSE generator, and Section 5 concludes and compares our approach to related research.",
        "While Sections 2 and 3 are concerned with linguistic representations and make only little reference to NLG, Section 4 presupposes some knowledge of the generation concepts and systems that MOOSE is built upon."

        "The central characteristic of knowledge-based NLG is the existence of a domain model, which anchors the representations serving as input to the generator.",
        "The domain model provides the basis for drawing inferences on the representations.",
        "One class of such inferences is the subsumption check, which our approach exploits for the task of language generation (see Section 4).",
        "The NLG system is thus in charge of mapping a",
        "network of instantiated domain concepts to linguistic utterances, and the specific role of lexemes within this process is to \"carry over\" the meaning from the underlying domain model to utterances in natural language.",
        "To accomplish this step, the lexicon of the generator requires two basic components: it has to explain what words mean with respect to the domain model, and it has to explain how words can be combined into well-formed sentences.",
        "At this point, the study of lexical semantics becomes relevant – it should systematically relate these two tasks.",
        "In NLG, however, lexical semantics has for a long time been relatively neglected; words and concepts were often conveniently put into a simple one-to-one correspondence.",
        "The key to incorporating lexical semantics into NLG is breaking up this tight correspondence and arranging for more flexible mappings.",
        "As soon as entities in the knowledge representation scheme do not correspond to words in a direct manner, the relationship between word meaning and entities in the knowledge base (KB) needs to be specified in some more elaborate way.",
        "Now, lexical semantics has to supply the interface between knowledge and words: It has to specify what words can be used to express what parts of what KB entities, and, possibly, under what circumstances.",
        "To this end, the relevant work in linguistics needs to be identified, extended, and adapted for generation purposes.",
        "This adaptation is not straightforward, however, because the starting position of linguistics is different from that of NLG: For a linguist, the syntax-semantics interface is of central concern, whereas in NLG, there is the additional level of instantiated knowledge, which needs to be systematically related to linguistic levels.",
        "Our approach is to employ a level of sentence-semantic representation that mediates between the knowledge-level input and syntactic realization.",
        "A well-motivated semantic level allows us to encapsulate all syntactic decisions in a front-end generation module; we use the Penman system (Penman Group 1989) for this purpose.",
        "For the other mapping, from KB to sentence-semantics, we use the lexicon as the primary source of information.",
        "In this approach, lexical entries therefore have two main components: a denotation that defines the applicability conditions of the lexeme with respect to the domain model (i.e., it can be matched against the generator's input), and a partial semantic specification (PSemSpec), which specifies the contribution that the lexeme makes to sentence meaning.' The task of lexicalization in our generator thus consists of first finding lexemes that can convey parts of the input, and then determining the preferred combination of candidate lexemes, yielding a sentence-semantic specification (Sem-Spec), which is then processed by the surface generator.",
        "The generation architecture is presented in Section 4.",
        "The next two sections explain the denotation and the partial semantic specification associated with verb lexicon entries, and thereby also the two levels of representation used in the generation system."

        "They are quite similar to states, but there is always something \"going on,\" as in The water was flowing toward the sea.",
        "We distinguish two subtypes here: protracted activities take place over an extended period of time, whereas momentaneous activities occur in an instant; a \"point adverbial\" such as at noon serves as a linguistic test.",
        "Events are occurrences that have a structure to them; in particular, their result, or their coming to an end is included in them: to destroy a building, to write a book.",
        "As their central feature we take them to always involve some change of state: the building loses its integrity the book comes into existence, or gets finished.",

        "A verbalization of this event can emphasize either of these aspects.",
        "Since we decompose event structure in such a way, it follows that the denotations of verbs for verbalizing events need to be fairly complex.",
        "The type of event denoted relates to the Aktionsart of the verb: the inherent features characterizing (primarily) the temporal distribution of the event denoted.' A generator needs to know these features when verbalizing different kinds of events, so that it can produce (for example) the correct temporal modifier to express the duration of either an activity or a culmination.",
        "The variety of phenomena in Aktionsart are far from clear-cut, and there is no generally accepted and well-defined set of features.",
        "In the following, we use the terms given by Bussmann (1983) and discuss only those Aktionsart features that are directly relevant for us because they relate types of situations to denotations of verbs.",

        "Jackendoff (1990) is concerned with this problem for a number of alternations; specifically, in his framework of lexical-conceptual structure (LCS) he seeks to explain the relationships between stative, inchoative, and causative readings of a verb.",

        "Moreover, since the verb entry will be the most basic form, its denotation is relatively simple and therefore the matching is inexpensive.",
        "Finding more complex verb configurations will then require some further matching, but only locally and to those verbs that have already been determined as verbalization options.",
        "In general, the idea is to see verb alternations not just as relations between different verb forms, but to add directionality to the concept of alternation and treat them as functions that map one into another.",
        "From this viewpoint, there are two groups of alternations: (1) Alternations that do not affect the denotation of the verb.",

        "(2) Alternations that do change the denotation of the verb.",

        "Therefore we define directionality for group (2) to the effect that an alternation always adds meaning: The newly derived form communicates more than the old form – the denotation gets extended.",
        "This notion is different from the standard, nondirectional way in which alternations are seen in linguistics; to label the difference, we call alternations of group (2) extensions.",
        "In this section, we will introduce a number",
        "of extension rules for which we can give a clear definition in terms of Aktionsart features, as they were introduced in Section 2.2.",
        "These rules extend the denotation of a verb and rewrite its PSemSpec in parallel to reflect the change in valency; the result is a new verbalization option, which can differ from the previous one in terms of coverage or attribution of salience (see Section 4).",

        "Here, of the oil is an optional constituent.",
        "To this last form, a causative extension can apply and yield Tom drained the engine of the oil.",

        "ROC is a list of pairs that exchange participant role names or the UM type in the PSemSpec; this replacement can also change optionality.",
        "For example, (< : act e e > : actor) means \"replace the term : act e e in the PSemSpec of the old verbalization, where it was optional, with : actor, which is not optional.\" Finally, NRO contains new roles and fillers that are to be added to the new PSemSpec; these will also contain variables from the denotation extension.",

        "Levin points out that this alternation has received much attention in linguistics research and notes that, in spite of the efforts, a satisfactory definition of the holistic facet has not been found.",
        "Jackendoff, in his treatment of the alternation, suggests encoding the holistic feature in a primitive: The function ONd is a derivative of ON and means that something \"distributively\" covers a surface, e.g., the paint covers all of the wall.",
        "Introducing a primitive, though, amounts to conceding that no explanation in terms that are already known can be given.",
        "We cannot solve the question of \"holisticness,\" either, but we want to point to the fact that the two verb configurations correlate with a change in Aktionsart: Sally sprayed paint onto the wall is durative (she can do it for two hours), whereas Sally sprayed the wall with paint is transformative (she can do it in two hours).",
        "That observation leads us to propose that the example is best analyzed as involving a mere activity in the with configuration, and an additional transition in the onto configuration.",
        "Support for this analysis comes from Pinker (1989), who postulates a change in meaning when moving from one configuration to the other: In (b) above, Sally causes the paint to move onto the wall, whereas in (a), Sally causes the wall to change its state by means of moving the paint onto it.",

        "The exact interpretation of completion-state is the open question that Levin (1993) referred to, and that Jackendoff treated with his d subscript.",
        "We do think, though, that an abstract state in the domain model, which subsumes a range of the concrete states, is preferable to introducing a primitive on the linguistic level (unless the primitive is relevant for other linguistic phenomena as well).",
        "The following alternation rule applies to durative verb readings that denote activities of something being moved to somewhere, and extends them to also cover the post-state, which must be subsumed by completion-state.",
        "In this way, it derives reading (a) from (b) in the spray example, and analogously for the other verbs undergoing the alternation, e.g.: Tom loaded hay onto the wagon / Tom loaded the wagon with hay; Jill stuffed the feathers into the cushion / Jill stuffed the cushion with the feathers.",
        "The PSemSpec is modified as follows: The former : destination (wall) becomes the new : act ee, whereas the former : act ee (paint) now fills the role < : inclusive >, and is optional there, because Jill stuffed the cushion is also well formed.",
        "Stede Verb Alternations Levin distinguishes two kinds of locative alternation: the spray /load alternation just discussed and the clear (transitive) alternation.",
        "The latter applies only to the verbs clear, clean, drain, empty and can be seen as the \"semantic inverse\" of the spray /load alternation, because one group of verbs denotes activities of placing something somewhere, and the other describes activities of removing something from somewhere; but both have the same holistic effect in one of the verb configurations.",

        "However, the range of alternative verbalizations",
        "that can be produced from the same input is seriously limited under this approach (see Stede and Grote [1995]), and therefore MOOSE opts for a complete separation of DM and UM; they are distinct taxonomies.",
        "Consequently, as opposed to a general SPL term used in Penman, a SemSpec used in MOOSE must contain only upper model concepts and no domain model concepts.",
        "Furthermore, since our system takes lexicalization as the decisive task in mapping a SitSpec to a SemSpec, the UM concepts referred to in a SemSpec must be annotated with : lex expressions.",

        "Stede Verb Alternations is well beyond the scope of this paper,' we will merely sketch a possible division of labor between text planning and sentence planning, and then describe the role of verb alternations as one means of realizing generation goals related to salience.",
        "Specifically, we show under what circumstances the various drain sentences given in the examples in (1) in Section 1 (and in Figure 7) are produced by MOOSE.",
        "When text planning has been completed and linearization as well as the \"chunking\" of the material into sentence-size pieces is accomplished, MOOSE takes over to perform the necessary sentence planning, which includes lexicalization.",
        "Thus, text planning has produced a sequence of SitSpecs, which may be enriched with information pertaining to the relative salience of the elements.",
        "This information can result from constraints on theme development, from rhetorical strategies, or from other considerations at the discourse level.",
        "For instance, in the sample texts given in (1) at the beginning of Section 1, different theme developments are responsible for the different usages of to drain.",
        "For sentence planning, we assume that individual nodes of a SitSpec can have a foreground, background, or optional label attached to them (but they need not).",
        "Then, a realization is to be found that signals the differences in prominence on the linguistic surface.",
        "In general, there is no one-to-one correspondence between the configuration of salience labels and linguistic realization, though.",
        "Instead, we view salience goals as goals that the generator tries to fulfill if possible, similar to certain stylistic goals (see Stede [1996a]).",
        "Thus, generation becomes a matter of constraints (say the right thing) and preferences (try to say it in a particular way), similar to Hovy's (1988) distinction between \"prescriptive\" and \"restrictive\" planning.",
        "What, then, is the role of verb alternations in assigning different degrees of salience?",
        "Talmy (1988) listed a number of morphological and syntactic means to distribute salience across the elements of a clause.",
        "For instance, he suggested the hierarchy subject > direct object > indirect object > oblique, ranging from the most salient to the least salient.",
        "From a slightly different perspective, Kunze (1991) was concerned with differences in salience between similar verbs.",
        "He advanced the view that they share a common underlying base form and differ, inter alia, in distributing salience via their case roles.",
        "For our purposes here, we can adapt these insights (with some simplification) and state that an element is placed in the foreground if it is mapped to the role actor (best) or to actee (second best).",
        "Correspondingly, it is placed in the background if it corresponds to a circumstance, i.e., a role that is not part of the verb's case frame.",
        "Now, consider again the sentences in Figure 7.",
        "On the one hand, (0) and (1) omit the fact of Tom's causing the event, and hence are preferred only if the respective SitSpec node is labeled as optional.",
        "On the other hand, (0,2) and (1,3) differ in that the former render the oil prominent, while the latter emphasize the engine.",
        "Figure 9 shows the common SitSpec underlying the four sentences, and a set of salience labels attached to three nodes, where the numbers correspond to the target sentences.",
        "For example, when sentence (1) is the preferred output, the SitSpec would have an opt label at node tom-1 and an fg label at node engine-1.",
        "For any verbalization option, base forms and alternations alike, the number of fulfilled salience goals can be computed straightforwardly: Since variables in denotations and PSemSpecs are co-indexed, we can determine for every salience label in the SitSpec how the corresponding element participates in the SemSpec.",

        "Productive rules derive the more complex forms from a basic one, which is the only one that needs to be stated in the lexical entry of the verb.",
        "We have focused on those alternations that affect the Aktionsart of the verb: They imply a type change in aspectual classifications such as those of Bach (1986).",
        "For generation, our approach uses two distinct ontologies: a language-neutral domain model for event categorization, and a language-specific taxonomy, the upper model developed by Bateman et al.",
        "(1991) on the basis of Halliday's (1985) work.",
        "The lexicon acts as the mediator between these two realms and serves to map a conceptual input representation to a semantic sentence specification, which can be further processed by a front-end realization component.",
        "Within this framework, multilingual generation is possible once language-specific upper models and front-ends are used (but multilinguality was not addressed in this paper).",
        "The approach has been implemented in the MOOSE system, which uses the Penman generator (Penman Group 1989); MOOSE can serve as a plug-in sentence production module to a larger text generator.",
        "The examples discussed in this paper (including the alternated forms) were generated from a domain model that encodes knowledge about automobile engines, tanks, and related liquids.",
        "It consists of 150 concepts and relations; the associated English lexicon has 200 words, including 50 verbs.",
        "Given the nature of the work, which depends on quite fine-grained representations in both domain model and lexicon, it is difficult to make statements on how well the approach \"scales up.\" Large-scale (automatic) acquisition of dictionary entries typically does not result in representations of the kind needed here, and furthermore, the domain model needs to be developed in tandem with the lexicon.",
        "The precise shape of such models, on the other hand, also depends on the specific application the generator is used for; even though some steps towards standardization in ontologies are being taken, this is still a bottleneck in knowledge-based NLG.",

        "Starting from the aspectual categories proposed by Bach (1986), the verb classifications of Levin (1993), and the lexical representations given by Jackendoff (1990), we have developed a new synthesized approach for dealing with verb alternations that affect the Aktionsart of verbs.",
        "Our ontology for input representations and the specifications for lexical meaning have benefited from the earlier work just mentioned but essentially constitute a new framework in which the specific alternation/ extension rules could be formulated.",
        "The utility of these rules demonstrates the importance of defining a place for fine-grained lexical-semantic representations in language generation.",
        "To our knowledge, no other generator can systematically derive the various forms for the alternations discussed in this paper.",
        "Recently, Dorr and Olsen (1996) suggested using verb representations based on Jackendoff's (1990) LCSs for NLG; specific kinds of LCSs are proposed to represent different classes of verbs on the basis of telicity.",
        "Rules are proposed that relate telic and atelic versions of the same verb.",
        "The central difference of our approach is our distinction between SitSpec and SemSpec, and thus between denotation and PSemSpec in the lexical entries.",
        "Dorr and Olsen map directly between LCSs and syntax, so there is no systematic link to background knowledge yet (which, as we have pointed out, would be useful for generation).",
        "Besides, as we mentioned in Section 3, LCS representations use primitives (BECOME, INCH, d), where we opt for a more fine-grained decomposition of the underlying event.",
        "For the alternations investigated, we have chosen the approach of defining a single base form from which alternated forms are derived.",
        "For other alternations, this might not be feasible or practical – in such cases, different lexical entries are to be used.",
        "There is, on the other hand, a line of research that questions the utility of distinguishing a base form from a more complex one in an alternation.",
        "For example, Saint-Dizier (1996) states that his approach to alternations deliberately avoids three difficulties: the need to define a basic form from which alternations are produced; the need to explain the relation between the basic form and the alternated one; and the need to account for changes in meaning produced by the alternation.",
        "It seems that the work presented in this paper aims precisely at those questions that Saint-Dizier's approach proposes to better leave aside.",
        "For generation, however, we believe that a system must know about the fine-grained changes in meaning that a verb alternation implies – a generator has to relate some semantic input representation to verb meaning, after all, and that includes alternations.",
        "And if the semantic change induced by an alternation can be described by a general rule that covers a whole class of verbs, a useful abstraction is gained.",
        "The final point to consider is the question of admitting lexical rules into one's framework.",
        "For example, Sanfilippo (1994) argues against this instrument on the grounds that there is no general control regime on lexical rules that would deterministically restrict any polysemic expansion.",
        "Instead, he advocates coding the alternative lexical forms in a hierarchy of typed feature structures, where the underspecified forms subsume the specific ones.",
        "His criticism applies to the notion of rules that are triggered automatically and proceed to derive new forms without principled limitations.",
        "Our \"defensive\" approach of listing applicable rules in the lexical entries avoids this problem but at the same time raises the question of why rules should be preferable to a simple enumeration of forms.",

        "In contrast to earlier systems, however, MOOSE strengthens the role of lexical semantics in the generation process by distinguishing between the SitSpec and SemSpec levels and clearly specifying the relationships between the two (as done with the alternation rules).",
        "Furthermore, we have emphasized that lexical choice should be seen as a constraint satisfaction process, similar to Reiter (1991), who focused his attention on nouns, while we have concentrated on verbs.",
        "There are several other generators using Penman as a front-end.",
        "For example, the DRAFTER system (Paris et al.",
        "1995) builds SPLs and hands them over to Penman; contrary to MOOSE, however, the domain model in DRAFTER is subsumed by the upper model, which significantly limits the range of lexical variation, as pointed out above.",
        "Working in the framework of systemic-functional grammar (SFG), both Wanner (1992) and Teich and Bateman (1994) employ SPL as an intermediate description, but they emphasize the integration of the SPL construction process into SFG.",
        "Wanner uses system networks to make fine-grained lexical choices in line with the three systemic metafunctions.",
        "Teich and Bateman develop system networks describing genre and register variation to drive the generation process, and they query an external domain model when building the SPL.",
        "In related work, Teich, Firzlaff, and Bateman (1994) present an implementation of Kunze's theory of semantic emphasis (cf.",
        "Section 4.3).",
        "From a \"basic semantic scheme\" annotated with emphasis labels, an SPL with appropriate roles and upper model concepts is constructed.",
        "The SPL can also contain an emphatic!",
        "nonemphatic feature, which might lead, for instance, to a dative shift.",
        "Hence, this work shares our interest in salience and indeed goes a step further than our present account in that the generation grammar can employ additional means for salience variation.",
        "However, in these three approaches, all lexical matters are taken to be part of the (huge) grammar processing the SPL.",
        "Thus, the central difference to the MOOSE approach is our step of promoting the lexicon to the crucial device for mapping between conceptual and sentence-semantic representations.",
        "We have argued that this step of keeping the lexicon separate and accessing it early has a number of advantages.",
        "Essentially the same difference holds between MOOSE and GOSSiP (Iordanskaja, Kittredge, and Polguêre 1991), which also emphasizes the importance of lexical choice and paraphrasing abilities.",
        "Here, a powerful lexicalization mechanism is embedded in a meaning – text generation model following the theory of Mel'cuk, where lexical functions play a central role in mapping between different levels of representation.",
        "These are semantic and syntactic levels, though, whereas MOOSE focuses on the interface between conceptual and semantic representations, and employs the lexicon at that point.",

        "In a computational approach to the lexicon, word sense enumeration should not be the rule but be reserved for the exceptions (Pustejovsky 1995).",
        "In line with this view, our approach seeks to exploit generalizations by accounting for different forms of a verb with explicit alternation and extension rules that relate the changes in meaning to the changes in form.",
        "Ultimately, such an account establishes correspondences not only between different forms of the same verb but also between different verbs; for example, applying the causative extension to to rise yields (one form of) to raise.",
        "Interconnections of this kind have not yet been integrated into the system presented here, though.",
        "Three assumptions have guided the development of our account of verb alternations: (1) There is a single base form from which other forms can be derived.",
        "(2) Alternation rules leave the denotation unchanged, and extension rules always add facets of meaning to the simpler denotation.",
        "(3) The changes in denotation correspond to changes in form, which can be characterized on a case-role level of description.",
        "In dealing with the telicity-related alternations discussed in Section 3, these assumptions have proven useful.",
        "For generalizing the approach to other alternations, assumption (2) could turn out to be too strong; in fact, even the causative extension might not always be monotonic when temporal adverbials are part of the sentence.",
        "In our framework, monotonicity is not a problem as long as the order of rule application is fixed anyway (cf.",
        "Figure 6).",
        "As soon as nonmonotonic rules are allowed, and the applicability of rules is no longer defined in the lexicon entries but triggered directly by the input, circularity is to be avoided: It needs to be ensured that rules reducing meaning reduce only parts that are not added by a different rule.",
        "Our selection of alternations was guided by their relationship to Aktionsart, in particular to causation and telicity.",
        "Since the notion of Aktionsart is not a well-demarcated one in linguistics, and since the most comprehensive catalogue of alternations, the one by Levin (1993), has largely excluded Aktionsart-related problems, it is rather difficult to evaluate our approach in terms of \"how many alternations\" it covers.",
        "(Besides, we have argued in Section 3 that some of Levin's categorizations need refinement.)",
        "Clearly, there are other alternations involving telicity that we have not discussed here.",
        "Dorr and Olsen (1996) state that 27 of Levin's alternations add the telicity feature to a verb's meaning; many of these are rather specific and apply only to very few verbs.",
        "Among the more prominent ones are the unspecified object alternation (Tom ate/Tom ate a pizza) and the conative alternation (John cut at the bread/John cut the bread).",
        "Both lend themselves to extension rules as in our framework, because one form entails the other and adds information: When it holds that Tom ate a pizza, then it holds that Tom ate.",
        "Other alternations involve specific prepositions, such as Levin's through/with alternation: Alison pierced the needle through the cloth/ Alison pierced the cloth with a needle.",
        "This does not pose problems for representing the changes in denotation, but renders a reliance on case roles – assumption (3) above – questionable; if suitable generalizations to similar prepositions cannot be found, the change in form ought to be stated directly on the syntactic level.",
        "Finally, we look at the question of evaluating our approach from the perspective of natural language generation.",
        "From a descriptive viewpoint, as argued above, general lexical rules are to be preferred over enumerating word senses.",
        "Whether this preference also carries over to the design of practical NLG systems, however, merits some additional discussion.",
        "For the lexicalization step, we can either successively apply alternation rules to a successfully matched base form, or compile out the various",
        "alternated forms, which must then all be considered in matching against the input representation.",
        "While the first option obviously yields a much smaller lexicon, it is not self-evident whether it is faster or slower in a running system.",
        "As long as all alternated forms individually enter the matching phase, the compile-out option is hardly useful.",
        "Rather, compilation can be advantageous if only the most preferred form of the verb is considered first, and the other ones only upon request if the first did not work out.",
        "In this case, we are spared the effort of applying the rules to reach the desired form at runtime.",
        "Overall, the compilation decision hinges on the kind of criteria that the generator employs for its lexical choices.",
        "If the desired salience distribution is the central factor, then storing precompiled options and their salience information will be most effective.",
        "If considerations of lexical style lead to preferring one verb over a set of others irrespective of the specific alternation, then applying alternation rules only to the preferred verb will be more effective (in turn depending on how many similar verbs are ruled out and thus spared from the matching process).",
        "Thus, there appears to be no general answer; the size of the lexicon, including the ranges of nearly synonymous verbs, and the choice criteria used by the generator have to be taken into account."
