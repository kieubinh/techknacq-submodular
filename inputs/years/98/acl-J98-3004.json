        "This paper describes a framework for generating natural language captions to accompany complex graphical presentations of diverse data sets.",
        "It describes an implemented system that integrates two robust systems: SAGE – an intelligent graphics presentation system (Roth et al.",
        "1994), and a natural language generator, consisting of a text planner (Young and Moore 1994; Young 1997), a microplanner implementing tactical decisions, and a sentence realizer (Elhadad and Robin 1992).",
        "Graphical presentations can be an effective method for succinctly communicating information about multiple, diverse data attributes and their interrelationships.",
        "More than 80% of all business reports these days contain graphic presentations of data (Beat-tie and Jones 1994; Schmid 1983).",
        "When a display includes only a small number of data attributes or can make use of conventionalized graphical styles (e.g., spreadsheet",
        "graphics), it is easy for a viewer to understand how to interpret it.",
        "However, one of the main goals for automatic presentation systems is to allow users to see complex relationships between different attributes and perform problem-solving tasks (e.g., summarizing, finding correlations or groupings, and analyzing trends in data) that involve many data attributes at the same time.",
        "A number of research groups have developed systems that can automatically design sophisticated presentations to support a task – presentations that are both novel and complex (e.g., Casner 1991; Mackinlay 1986; Roth et al.",
        "1994).",
        "These graphics are often difficult to understand (Shah 1995).",
        "Clearly, such graphics can only be fully effective for supporting analysis tasks if accompanied by explanations designed to enable users to understand how the graphics express the information they contain.",
        "Studies have shown that the presentation of captions with pictures can significantly improve both recall and comprehension, compared to either pictures or captions alone (Nugent 1983; Large et al.",
        "1995; Hegarty and Just 1993).",
        "This suggests that the generation of captions for statistical graphics is an important application area in which natural language generation techniques can make a significant contribution.",
        "In our system, the graphical displays are designed by an automatic presentation component, SAGE (Roth et al.",
        "1994), and are often complex for several reasons.",
        "First, they typically display many data attributes at once.",
        "The mapping of many different data attributes to multiple graphical objects in a single display can be difficult to determine from the graphics alone.",
        "Second, integrating multiple data attributes in a display requires designing graphics that are unfamiliar to users accustomed to spreadsheet graphics that create simple displays of individual data attributes.",
        "While these integrated displays can be very useful once they are explained, it is often difficult to understand them completely without accompanying explanations.",
        "Finally, the nature of the data with which we are concerned is inherently abstract and does not have an obvious or natural visual representation.",
        "Unlike depictions of real world objects or processes (e.g., radios [Feiner and McKeown 1991], coffee makers [Wahlster et al.",
        "1993], network diagrams [Marks 1991]) and visualizations of scientific data (e.g., weather, medical images), visualizations of abstract information lack an obvious physical analogue.",
        "As an example of the type of data we are concerned with, consider the graphic shown in Figure 1.",
        "This is a SAGE-generated version of the famous graphic drawn by Minard in 1861 depicting Napoleon's march of 1812 (Roth et al.",
        "1994).1 The graphic relates seven different variables: position (latitude and longitude), size, direction of movement, temperature, and dates and locations of battles.",
        "Unless one has seen this graphic (or a very similar one) before, it can be very difficult to understand.",
        "Indeed, Minard accompanied the original graphic with a paragraph of text, the first half of which is about how the graphic expresses the information it contains.2 Consider how the following human-generated caption for the graphic in Figure 1 explains the picture and the underlying data:3 This map shows march segments and battles from Napoleon's 1812 campaign.",
        "The map shows the relation between the geographic locations, temperature and number of troops for each segment.",
        "Each line shows the start and end locations for the march segment.",
        "Its color shows the temperature, and the thickness shows the number of troops.",
        "The temperature was about 100 degrees for the initial segments in the west (the wide, dark red lines on the left), about 60 degrees in",
        "later segments in the east (the narrower, light red lines on the right) and about – 40 degrees in the last segments, also in the west (the narrowest, dark blue lines on the left).",
        "The number of troops was 400,000 in the earliest segments, 100,000 in the later segments, and 10,000 in the last segments.",
        "The city and date of each battle is shown by the labels of a yellow diamond, which shows the battle's location.",
        "This caption can help users understand the various attributes and the underlying relations between them – conveyed so succinctly by the graphic.",
        "Although several projects have focused on the question of how such intelligent graphical presentations can be automatically generated (e.g., Casner 1991; Mackinlay 1986; Roth and Hefley 1993; Kerpedjiev 1992), they have not addressed the problem of generating the accompanying textual explanations.",
        "Without this ability, automatic graphical presentation systems will necessarily be limited to generating conventionalized graphics that do not use novel means to express complex relationships among data attributes, or risk generating displays that users will find difficult to fully comprehend and utilize.",
        "In designing our framework for generating natural language captions we have adapted and integrated work in natural language generation (NLG) by a number of researchers – including ourselves – in different subareas: text planning, aggregation, centering, computing referring expressions, example generation, and linearization.",
        "Given the applied nature of our work, in selecting specific NLG techniques we followed a parsimonious approach.",
        "For each subtask we selected the simplest technique that was capable, in conjunction with the behavior of the other subtasks, of producing coherent text that could express the propositions we needed to convey.",
        "The generation process starts with content selection.",
        "For this process, we use LONGBOW, a domain-independent discourse planner originally developed as part of a project aimed at generating tutorial explanations (Young and Moore 1994).",
        "Using plan operators that encode discourse strategies devised for the task of generating captions, the planner determines what information should be included in the captions (and consequently what should be left out), and how to organize the selected information.",
        "Operator constraints analyze the structure of the graphic presentation and the perceptual complexity of the graphical display to enable the planner to select and apply appropriate strategies.",
        "The output of the text planning stage is then further processed by a microplanner, a sequence of modules implementing inter and Figurative map of the losses, expressed in men, of the army during the Russian campaign.",
        "1812-1813",
        "The number of men is represented by the width of the colored zones, where one millimeter corresponds to ten thousand men; moreover, they (number of men) are written across the zones.",
        "Red indicates men entering Russia, black indicates men exiting it.",
        "The information used to fill this map would have not been available without M. Thiers, de Segur, de Frezerisac, de Chambray, and the journal of Jacob, army pharmacist since Oct. 28th.",
        "To help the eye judge how the army shrank, I assumed that the regiments of Price Jeroms and Marchal Davons, that were detached in Minsk and Mobilov, and rejoined near Orscha and Wiltesk, always walked together with the army.",
        "intraclause ordering, aggregation, and referring expression computation.",
        "The module performing intraclause ordering is of special interest because it uses a novel technique based on centering theory.",
        "Although we have devised such a technique specifically for generating captions, it is general and can be applied to any discourse structure.",
        "The other three microplanning modules use standard NLG techniques.",
        "Ordering and aggregation are based on text genre (i.e., descriptions of information graphics) and domain-specific (e.g., real estate sales or stock market data) heuristics.",
        "The referring expression module uses a well-known domain-independent algorithm that, given an intended referent, builds a description uniquely identifying it.",
        "The referential problems in our application did not require more sophisticated referring algorithms; there was also no interaction between computing the referring expressions and inter and intraclause ordering.",
        "Once microplanning is complete the FUF/SURGE realization module generates the actual English.",
        "The modules of our NLG system are discussed in detail in Section 5.",
        "In addition to these NLG techniques, generating textual captions for information graphics requires the following knowledge sources:",
        "• a representation of the syntax of graphical displays, that is, the structural, spatial and other relations among graphical objects and their properties.",
        "For example, the relationship between the end points of the lines in Figure 1 to positions on the map, the fact that an axis conveys the positional values for all the objects within a chart,' the difference between alternative uses of color: (i) constant color, (ii) color used to distinguish between different attributes, and (iii) color used to encode data values • a representation of the semantics of graphical displays, i.e., the mapping from data objects and their attributes to graphical ones.",
        "For example, in Figure 1 the fact that the temperature during a march segment is mapped to the color of the corresponding graphical segment.",
        "• a mechanism for determining which aspects of graphical displays must be explained based on their perceptual complexity or the complexity of the data attributes they express.",
        "This mechanism must take into account information about the underlying data and the perceptual complexity of the way in which data attributes and relations have been mapped to graphical entities.",

        "SAGE is a knowledge-based presentation system that designs graphical displays of combinations of diverse information (e.g., quantitative, relational, temporal, hierarchical, categorical, geographic).",
        "The inputs to SAGE include: (1) sets of data represented as tuples in a relational database, (2) a characterization of the properties of the data that are relevant to graphic design, and (3) an optional set of design specifications, expressing a user's preferences for visualizing the data set.",
        "A sAGE-generated version of the well-known Minard graphic.",
        "SAGE'S output consists of one or more coordinated sets of 2-D information graphics that use a variety of graphical techniques to integrate multiple data attributes in a single display.",
        "SAGE integrates multiple attributes in three ways:",
        "• by representing them as different properties of the same set of graphical objects.",
        "For example, both the left and the right edges of the bars in the left most chart in Figure 2 are used to map attributes (asking-price and selling-price respectively) • by assembling multiple graphical objects into groups that function as units to express data.",
        "For example, the interval bar and the mark in the left most chart in Figure 2 are used to show different types of price-related attributes: asking-price, selling-price, and the agency-estimate.",
        "• by aligning multiple charts and tables together with respect to a common axis.",
        "For example, the three charts in Figure 2 are aligned on the Y-axis, which indicates the house.",
        "Creating a graphic that integrates data in this way is partly an encoding process in which the values of data attributes are converted into graphical values of properties of objects (e.g., color, shape, and spatial position of polygons).",
        "Interpreting the information in a graphic is a decoding process, where people must translate visual symbols back into data values.",
        "SAGE creates graphics that enable people to efficiently perform information-seeking tasks (e.g., searching for clusters of data values that are different from the rest and looking up other facts to understand what makes them different).",
        "In designing graphics, however, SAGE only considers how effectively attributes can be mapped to graphical properties to support a task.",
        "For example, a requirement to be able to search for particular values by name might result in the relevant attribute being arranged along an axis in lexicographic order; on the other hand, if it is important to find the maximum and minimum values in a set, SAGE might order these values in terms of magnitude.",
        "SAGE, like other automated presentation systems (Casner 1991; Mackinlay 1986), does not take into account perceptual complexities associated with the resulting graphic.",
        "For instance, SAGE does not explicitly reason about the difficulties users may have in translating bicolor saturation scales to exact numerical values.'",
        "SAGE can also design complex presentations that have overlapping objects, or use cluster composition to define a novel combination or grouping of graphical objects in the presentation.",
        "This can make understanding some of the graphics that SAGE generates quite difficult.",
        "Fortunately, the picture representation used in SAGE contains a complete declarative representation of the content and structure of the graphic in a form that can be used for reasoning by other components.",
        "Thus, this representation can be used to reason about possible sources of user confusion arising from mappings that are either complex or ambiguous to the user.",
        "SAGE'S representation serves three functions in explanation generation.",
        "First, it helps define what a viewer must understand about a graphic in order to obtain useful information from it.",
        "It does this by defining the elements of a graphic and the way they combine to express facts (i.e., how they map to data).",
        "Second, the representation describes the structure of both the graphical presentation and the data it presents, so that they can be explained coherently.",
        "Finally, the representation helps derive judgments of complexity for specifying graphical elements needing text explanation.",
        "To understand these three functions, we briefly review the representation.",
        "Graphemes are the basic building blocks for constructing pictures.",
        "Marks, text, lines, and bars are some of the different grapheme classes available in SAGE.",
        "Each grapheme type consists of a definition of the parameters that control the appearance of all graphemes of that type; different grapheme subtypes can be created by varying specific parameters.",
        "Individual graphemes can be generated by providing appropriate values for all the input parameters.",
        "For instance, individual marks can be generated by providing values for the parameters: x-coordinate, y-coordinate, shape, size, and color to an instance of a mark class encoder; individual line segments can be generated by providing values for the coordinates xl, y1, x2, and y2, thickness, and color to the line class encoder.",
        "Symbol classes are used to organize graphemes into structures that express facts in the data set.",
        "A labelled-mark, an interval bar, and a bar with an attached label are some of the more familiar symbol classes available in SAGE.",
        "Each symbol class consists of a definition of the spatial relationship among a set of graphemes and the correspondence between the parameters of this set and attributes types in a data set.",
        "A labelled-mark, for instance, would be defined as a combination of a mark and a text label and the spatial relationship between them.",
        "Consider the labelled-marks in the chart shown in Figure 3.",
        "The spatial position of the label is dependent on the position of the mark: it is offset slightly to the right and above the mark.",
        "Symbol classes in SAGE can be either predefined (some of the more common ones, such as a labelled-mark have already been defined), or created by the system based on rules about combining different graphemes into clusters.",
        "Encoders are used to relate specific data values and graphical values to each other.",
        "Horizontal/ vertical axes, color keys, size keys, and shape keys are some of the different encoders available in SAGE.",
        "Each encoder class consists of a definition of the relation between a family of data set attributes and a particular graphical type.",
        "SAGE can then use this information to map data values to graphical values in designing a picture, and provide a frame of reference (e.g., axes, keys, etc.)",
        "that can be used to visually interpret specific values in the picture.",
        "For instance, a color encoder could map data values \"less than 5\" to the graphical value \"blue\" and others to \"red.\" A schematic of the encoders used in the chart shown in Figure 3 is shown in Figure 4.",
        "In addition to this knowledge about graphemes, symbols, and encoders, SAGE uses knowledge of the characteristics of data relevant to graphic design (Roth and Mattis 1990; Roth and Hefley 1993), including knowledge of data types and scales of measurement (e.g., quantitative, interval, ordinal, or nominal data sets), structural",
        "A graphic generated by SAGE to illustrate the use of encoders.",
        "relationships among data (e.g., the relation between the endpoints of ranges or between the two coordinates of a 2-D geographic location), and the functional dependencies among attributes in database relations (e.g., one:one, one:many, many:many).",
        "As we will show later, the latter is an important factor in selecting a high-level discourse strategy for generating explanatory captions.",
        "Finally, SAGE has a library of graphical techniques, knowledge of the appropriateness of the techniques for different data and tasks, and design knowledge for as",
        "sembling these techniques into composites that can integrate information in a single display.",
        "SAGE uses this graphic design knowledge together with the data characterization knowledge to generate displays of information.",
        "To summarize, the portion of SAGE'S knowledge base that is most relevant for generating explanatory captions is its graphical syntax and semantics.",
        "The syntax includes a definition of the graphical constituents that convey information: spaces (e.g., charts, maps, tables), graphemes (e.g., labels, marks, bars), their properties (e.g., color, shape), and encoders – the frames of reference that enable their properties to be interpreted/ translated back to data values (e.g., axes, graphical keys).",
        "The syntax also defines the ways in which graphemes can be combined to form symbols – composites that integrate multiple data attributes (e.g., a label attached to a mark).",
        "The syntactic structure of a graphical display, like the linguistic structure of text, can provide guidance for creating structurally coherent explanations.",
        "The representation of the semantics of graphics conveys the way data is mapped to the syntactic elements of displays.",
        "It also provides guidance for organizing explanatory captions by grouping graphical elements that express data attributes that form a coherent group.",

        "An attribute is functionally independent if it uniquely determines the values of all other attributes.",
        "For example, in one of our current data sets about house sales, the house's street address has been specified as the FIA; it uniquely determines asking-price, selling-price, and the other attributes in the database.",
        "In contrast, the listing agency does not uniquely determine any of the other attributes in the house-sales relation.",
        "In addition to the factors mentioned above – used to select the overarching discourse strategies – the system makes use of additional information about the symbols and their mappings used in the display to select and organize information to be presented in the caption.",
        "For instance, the system uses graphical information to determine the order in which information is presented.",
        "This reasoning can occur at various levels of the picture representation: at the space level (all objects in a space are described before objects in another space), at the grapheme cluster level (all objects in a cluster are described together), and at the encoder level (all objects that map the same attribute type are described together).",
        "SAGE'S representation of the graphical display thus provides additional information that can be considered when text explanations are generated.",
        "The process of generating natural language explanations can be divided into three conceptual stages: (i) select a discourse strategy to provide the overall organization of the explanation based on the structural properties of the graphical presentation, the relations expressed in the data set, and the data-to-grapheme mappings; (ii) within each space of the presentation, use the complexity metric to determine the amount of detail to be included in the explanation; and (iii) reason about the tactical decisions in sentence planning.",

        "The central tenet in centering theory is that discourse coherence of a text span increases (and a reader's cognitive load decreases) proportionately to the extent that discourse within the span follows two fundamental centering constraints (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1995).",
        "These are: Constraint on realization: If any element in the set of forward-looking centers of an utterance (U,) is realized by a pronoun in the following utterance (U144 ), then the backward-looking center of the following utterance (LI,4.1) must also be realized by a pronoun.",

        "Grosz and her colleagues suggest that a competent generation system should apply the constraint on movement by planning ahead in an attempt to minimize the number of SHIFTS in a locally coherent discourse segment (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1995).",
        "Our centering-based strategy implements this suggestion by selecting intraclause orderings that enforce centering transitions consistent with a given discourse structure.",

        "The referring expression module uses color in this case to distinguish between the two types of bars and the attributes mapped to them.",
        "terms of centering theory must be made.",
        "The problem is that the NPs generated in the captions are often possessive and have complex syntactic structures (e.g., the selling price of the house, the mark's horizontal position) and centering theory is not yet clear on the determination of centers in complex syntactic structures such as possessives and subordinate clauses (Grosz and Sidner 1993).",
        "To accommodate this problem we made two assumptions.",
        "First, given possessives of the form \"property of grapheme/ entity\", either the grapheme or the entity is the center, not their properties.",
        "Second, even when only a property (e.g., selling-price, right edge) is mentioned, the corresponding entity or grapheme is the center.",
        "Our centering strategy processes the ordered speech acts sequentially and assumes that text spans describing the mappings from properties of a grapheme to properties of an entity are locally coherent discourse segments.",
        "The strategy enforces the constraint on movement within each of these discourse segments by preferring a CONTINUATION or a SMOOTH-SHIFT transition to a RETAIN or a ROUGH-SHIFT transition, respectively.",
        "This is done by keeping the highest-ranking forward-looking center of the first clause of the segment (which is either an entity or a grapheme), as the Cp(Lii) of all the following clauses in the same segment.",
        "In this way, in all such clauses the Cb(Ui) and the Cp(Ui) will be the same and, according to Table 1, this corresponds to forcing",
        "Furthermore, the strategy applies an additional constraint on movement: between segments dealing with different graphemes, the strategy explicitly marks the segment boundaries by preferring ROUGH-SHIFT over SMOOTH-SHIFT and RETAIN over CONTINUATION.",
        "This case is not mentioned in Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995).",
        "However, since the system maintains local coherence in a segment by minimizing ROUGH-SHIFTS and RETAINS, it seems intuitive to prefer ROUGH-SHIFTS and RETAINS to emphasize the change at segment boundaries (i.e., the boundaries between such segments should be maximally incoherent).",
        "Thus, in the caption generation application, when a text span describing the mapping for a grapheme (a discourse segment) is followed by a description of a mapping for a different grapheme (another discourse segment), the centering strategy will try to force either a ROUGH-SHIFT or RETAIN to mark the segment boundary.",
        "This is done by moving the Cb(1.1,) of the clause following the boundary out of the clause front position.",
        "That is, if the grapheme is the Cb(1.1,), the domain entity is placed in front of the clause, and vice versa in the other case.",
        "For example, consider the effect of the centering strategy on clauses 3-5 of the sample caption shown in Figure 19.",
        "Since clauses 3 and 4 are about mappings from properties of the same grapheme – a horizontal bar – they are assumed to belong to the same discourse segment.",
        "Therefore, the system keeps the Cp of clause 4 equal to the Cp of clause 3 by placing the possessive the house's asking price in front of the clause.",
        "In contrast, since clauses 4 and 5 are about mappings from properties of different graphemes, a RETAIN centering transition (as opposed to a CONTINUATION) was enforced by moving the possessive corresponding to the Cb, the house's agency estimate, out of the front position.",

        "These identifying attributes are selected based on a domain-specific default ordering.",
        "In our case, the only referential problem is identifying the graphemes, and often the type of the grapheme (e.g., \"bar\") is sufficient to do so.\" However, sometimes, a graphic may contain multiple graphemes of the same type.",
        "In such cases, the system must utilize additional perceptual properties (e.g., color, saturation, size, shape) to build an appropriate referring expression.",
        "For example, the referring expressions for the bars in the caption for the chart shown in Figure 20 use color as an additional identifying attribute.",
        "Since our system generates multisentential captions, the referring expression module takes into account what is in focus at a given point in the discourse in order to generate concise and natural expressions.",
        "The referring expression module considers in focus all of the forward-looking centers (i.e., Cf) computed by the centering module, and simply removes identifying attributes if they are in the Cf at that point in the discourse.",
        "This strategy results in the more concise rephrasing:",
        "There are other forms of referring expression reduction due to discourse context that require a more sophisticated treatment.",
        "Handwritten captions often radically simplify descriptions to express facts such as: \"the third chart shows the neighborhood.\" However, the system-generated caption would express the underlying proposition, based on the data to grapheme mappings, as: \"the position of the mark in the third chart shows the neighborhood.\" The sequence of reductions shown below could achieve the more natural effect by repeatedly reasoning about the picture and the information being conveyed by each statement.",
        "the position of the mark in the third chart shows the neighborhood (1) the mark in the third chart shows the neighborhood (2) the third chart shows the neighborhood (3) The system would need to realize that position was the only attribute of the mark being used for a mapping, and position is always clear in a graph and need not explicitly be mentioned; thus resulting in statement (2).",
        "However, since the mark is the only grapheme used in the graph, the system could leave off mentioning the mark as well, thus resulting in statement (3).",
        "There are two ways of dealing with this issue: (i) The system could apply iterative refinements of the referring expressions generated by the planner, as done in the local brevity algorithm (Reiter 1990).",
        "However, this single case would have substantially increased the computational cost of generating referring expressions in all cases, without significantly improving any of the other (perfectly appropriate) referring expressions generated by the module.",
        "(ii) The system could recognize this specific situation at a higher level and process the speech acts appropriately to avoid this situation completely.",
        "Thus, rather than considering this situation as a problem of generating an appropriate expression for the concept position of the mark in the third chart, we have chosen to push this problem up to the planner level during content selection.",
        "Consequently, there are operators that look specifically for situations such as this – single grapheme in a space, mapping a single property – that are selected by the planner in such situations.",
        "While this does tend to muddy the distinction between the \"high-level\" planner and the \"lower-level\" tactical processing – because the planner is now forced to deal with this one situation regarding referring expressions that should arguably be dealt with more properly by the referring expression module – it does enable the system to generate appropriate texts with a simpler, more efficient approach in this application.",

        "• validity of the discourse strategies: The paper discussed three discourse strategies for structuring information presented in the captions.",
        "There are at least two ways to evaluate a set of strategies used: (1) We could perform a corpus analysis on a different set of charts and captions than those used to initially infer the strategies, in an effort to see how well they fit the test set: this is the usual approach in machine learning, where the learning and test sets are kept separate for precisely this reason.",
        "This would require significant resources to find and code charts and their captions for both the data displayed and the discourse strategies used, but it would help determine whether the set of discourse strategies we had come up with was both consistent and complete.",
        "(2) Another way to evaluate the discourse strategies would be to conduct user",
        "comprehension tests with various charts and captions generated using different strategies at random: while this would be less efficient at testing the set of strategies for completeness, it would allow us to validate that a particular strategy (from our set of three) was best suited for particular types of charts.",

        "We can categorically state that the captions clearly help in understanding the graphic being presented.",

        "There are several advantages of a pipelined approach as in our case: not only is it easy to design, implement, and test each module independently, it also becomes easy to extend the functionality of any individual module without significantly affecting the others.",
        "While such a simplified architecture will certainly not suffice for all generation tasks, this is a strong argument for trying this minimal approach to see where it falls short and why.",
        "Over the last two years, this system has been used to generate captions for several hundred figures in different domains (housing-sales, Napoleon's march of 1812, logistics transportation, scheduling, etc.).",
        "Porting the system from one domain to another usually requires only specifying the lexicon for the new domain (e.g., battle, troops, etc.).",
        "The fact that the captions generated in each of these – quite different – domains are deemed useful and natural by users is testimony to the effectiveness of the caption generation mechanism currently in place.",
        "It should be noted that there are two shortcomings in the system that will be addressed in future work: (1) the caption generation system, as described here, cannot, in general, modify the graphics designed by SAGE.",
        "There are several cases where this capability would be extremely useful, but the caption generation system described here was designed to work after SAGE had designed and rendered the graphic.",
        "There is one specialized case where coordination currently occurs, which is when the caption generator presents an example.",
        "In that case, the caption generator can request that the graphemes corresponding to the tuple values used in the example be highlighted in the picture; (2) the system does not, as yet, analyze the data set for interesting patterns or clusters of data points.",
        "To do this, the system will need a clustering analysis module that can be used by the caption generator.",

        "Combined with the fact that the graphics are generated in response to an explicit user goal, user comprehension problems in POSTGRAPHE are less likely than in our system.",
