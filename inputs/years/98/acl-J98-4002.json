        "Word sense disambiguation is a potentially crucial task in many NLP applications, such as machine translation (Brown, Della Pietra, and Della Pietra 1991), parsing (Lytinen 1986; Nagao 1994) and text retrieval (Krovets and Croft 1992; Voorhees 1993).",
        "Various corpus-based approaches to word sense disambiguation have been proposed (Bruce and Wiebe 1994; Chamiak 1993; Dagan and Itai 1994; Fujii et al.",
        "1996; Hearst 1991; Karov and Edelman 1996; Kurohashi and Nagao 1994; Li, Szpakowicz, and Matwin 1995; Ng and Lee 1996; Niwa and Nitta 1994; Schiitze 1992; Uramoto 1994b; Yarowsky 1995).",
        "The use of corpus-based approaches has grown with the use of machine-readable text, because unlike conventional rule-based approaches relying on hand-crafted selectional rules (some of which are reviewed, for example, by Hirst [1987]), corpus-based approaches release us from the task of generalizing observed phenomena through a set of rules.",
        "Our verb sense disambiguation system is based on such an approach, that is, an example-based approach.",
        "A preliminary experiment showed that our system performs well when compared with systems based on other approaches, and motivated",
        "us to further explore the example-based approach (we elaborate on this experiment in Section 2.3).",
        "At the same time, we concede that other approaches for word sense disambiguation are worth further exploration, and while we focus on example-based approach in this paper, we do not wish to draw any premature conclusions regarding the relative merits of different generalized approaches.",
        "As with most example-based systems (Fujii et al.",
        "1996; Kurohashi and Nagao 1994; Li, Szpakowicz, and Matwin 1995; Uramoto 1994b), our system uses an example database (database, hereafter) that contains example sentences associated with each verb sense.",
        "Given an input sentence containing a polysemous verb, the system chooses the most plausible verb sense from predefined candidates.",
        "In this process, the system computes a scored similarity between the input and examples in the database, and choses the verb sense associated with the example that maximizes the score.",
        "To realize this, we have to manually disambiguate polysemous verbs appearing in examples, prior to their use by the system.",
        "We shall call these examples supervised examples.",
        "A preliminary experiment on eleven polysemous Japanese verbs showed that (a) the more supervised examples we provided to the system, the better it performed, and (b) in order to achieve a reasonable result (say over 80% accuracy), the system needed a hundred-order supervised example set for each verb.",
        "Therefore, in order to build an operational system, the following problems have to be taken into account':",
        "• given human resource limitations, it is not reasonable to supervise every example in large corpora (\"overhead for supervision\"), • given the fact that example-based systems, including our system, search the database for the examples most similar to the input, the",
        "computational cost becomes prohibitive if one works with a very large database size (\"overhead for search\").",
        "These problems suggest a different approach, namely to select a small number of optimally informative examples from given corpora.",
        "Hereafter we will call these examples samples.",
        "Our example sampling method, based on the utility maximization principle, decides on the preference for including a given example in the database.",
        "This decision procedure is usually called selective sampling (Cohn, Atlas, and Ladner 1994).",
        "The overall control flow of selective sampling systems can be depicted as in Figure 1, where \"system\" refers to our verb sense disambiguation system, and \"examples\" refers to an unsupervised example set.",
        "The sampling process basically cycles between the word sense disambiguation (WSD) and training phases.",
        "During the WSD phase, the system generates an interpretation for each polysemous verb contained in the input example (\"WSD outputs\" of Figure 1).",
        "This phase is equivalent to normal word sense disambiguation execution.",
        "During the training phase, the system selects samples for training from the previously produced outputs.",
        "During this phase, a human expert supervises samples, that is, provides the correct interpretation for the verbs appearing in the samples.",
        "Thereafter, samples are simply incorporated into the database without any computational overhead (as would be associated with globally reestimating parameters in statistics-based systems), meaning that the system can be trained on the remaining examples (the \"residue\") for the next iteration.",
        "Iterating between these two",
        "Flow of control of the example sampling system.",
        "phases, the system progressively enhances the database.",
        "Note that the selective sampling procedure gives us an optimally informative database of a given size irrespective of the stage at which processing is terminated.",
        "Several researchers have proposed this type of approach for NLP applications.",
        "Engelson and Dagan (1996) proposed a committee-based sampling method, which is currently applied to HMM training for part-of-speech tagging.",
        "This method sets several models (the committee) taken from a given supervised data set, and selects samples based on the degree of disagreement among the committee members as to the output.",
        "This method is implemented for statistics-based models.",
        "How to formalize and map the concept of selective sampling into example-based approaches has yet to be explored.",
        "Lewis and Gale (1994) proposed an uncertainty sampling method for statistics-based text classification.",
        "In this method, the system always samples outputs with an uncertain level of correctness.",
        "In an example-based approach, we should also take into account the training effect a given example has on other unsupervised examples.",
        "This is introduced as training utility in our method.",
        "We devote Section 4 to further comparison of our approach and other related works.",
        "With respect to the problem of overhead for search, possible solutions would include the generalization of similar examples (Kaji, Kida, and Morimoto 1992; Nomi-yama 1993) or the reconstruction of the database using a small portion of useful instances selected from a given supervised example set (Aha, Kibler, and Albert 1991; Smyth and Keane 1995).",
        "However, such approaches imply a significant overhead for supervision of each example prior to the system's execution.",
        "This shortcoming is precisely what our approach aims to avoid: we aim to reduce the overhead for supervision as well as the overhead for search.",
        "Section 2 describes the basis of our verb sense disambiguation system and preliminary experiment, in which we compared our method with other disambiguation methods.",
        "Section 3 then elaborates on our example sampling method.",
        "Section 4 reports on the results of our experiments through comparison with other proposed selective sampling methods, and discusses theoretical differences between those methods."

        "Our verb sense disambiguation system is based on the method proposed by Kurohashi and Nagao (1994) and later enhanced by Fujii et al.",
        "(1996).",
        "The system uses a database containing examples of collocations for each verb sense and its associated case frame(s).",
        "A fragment of the database, and the entry associated with the Japanese verb toru.",
        "Figure 2 shows a fragment of the entry associated with the Japanese verb toru.",
        "The verb toru has multiple senses, a sample of which are 'to take / steal,\"to attain,' 'to subscribe,' and 'to reserve.' The database specifies the case frame(s) associated with each verb sense.",
        "In Japanese, a complement of a verb consists of a noun phrase (case filler) and its case marker suffix, for example ga (nominative) or wo (accusative).",
        "The database lists several case filler examples for each case.",
        "The task of the system is to \"interpret\" the verbs occurring in the input text, i.e., to choose one sense from among a set of candidates.2 All verb senses we use are defined in IPAL (Information-technology Promotion Agency, 1987), a machine-readable dictionary.",
        "IPAL also contains example case fillers as shown in Figure 2.",
        "Given an input, which is currently limited to a simple sentence, the system identifies the verb sense on the basis of the scored similarity between the input and the examples given for each verb sense.",
        "Let us take the sentence below as an example input:",
        "In this example, one may consider hisho ('secretary') and shindaisha ('sleeping car') to be semantically similar to joshu ('assistant') and hikouki ('airplane') respectively, and since both collocate with the 'to reserve' sense of toru, one could infer that toru should be interpreted as 'to reserve.' This resolution originates from the analogy principle (Nagao 1984), and can be called nearest neighbor resolution because the verb in the input is disambiguated by superimposing the sense of the verb appearing in the example of highest similarity.' The similarity between an input and an example is estimated based on the similarity between case fillers marked with the same case.",
        "Furthermore, since the restrictions imposed by the case fillers in choosing the verb sense are not equally selective, Fujii et al.",
        "(1996) proposed a weighted case contribution to disambiguation (CCD) of the verb senses.",
        "This CCD factor is taken into account",
        "The semantic ranges of the nominative and accusative for the verb toru.",
        "An input and the database.",
        "when computing the score for each sense of the verb in question.",
        "Consider again the case of toru in Figure 2.",
        "Since the semantic range of nouns collocating with the verb in the nominative does not seem to have a strong delinearization in a semantic sense (in Figure 2, the nominative of each verb sense displays the same general concept, i.e., HUMAN), it would be difficult, or even risky, to properly interpret the verb sense based on similarity in the nominative.",
        "In contrast, since the semantic ranges are disparate in the accusative, it would be feasible to rely more strongly on similarity here.",
        "This argument can be illustrated as in Figure 3, in which the symbols eland e2 denote example case fillers of different case frames, and an input sentence includes two case fillers denoted by x and y.",
        "The figure shows the distribution of example case fillers for the respective case frames, denoted in a semantic space.",
        "The semantic similarity between two given case fillers is represented by the physical distance between the two symbols.",
        "In the nominative, since x happens to be much closer to an e2 than any x may be estimated to belong to the range of e2's, although x actually belongs to both sets of e1 's and e2's. In the accusative, however, y would be properly estimated to belong to the set of e1 's due to the disjunction of the two accusative case filler sets, even though examples do not fully cover each of the ranges of el's and e2's. Note that this difference would be critical if example data were sparse.",

        "The database also contains a set of case filler examples for each case c1 of each sense s, (\" – \" indicates that the corresponding case is not allowed).",
        "During the verb sense disambiguation process, the system first discards those candidates whose case frame does not fit the input.",

        "The score of an interpretation is computed by considering the weighted average of the similarity degrees of the input case fillers with respect to each of the example case fillers (in the corresponding case) listed in the database for the sense under evaluation.",
        "Formally, this is expressed by Equation (1), where Score(s) is the score of sense s of the input verb, and SIM(nc, Es,c) is the maximum similarity degree between the input case filler II, and the corresponding case fillers in the database example set Es,c (calculated through Equation (2)).",
        "CCD(c) is the weight factor of case c, which we will explain later in this section.",
        "With regard to the computation of the similarity between two different case fillers (sim(nc, e) in Equation (1)), we experimentally used two alternative approaches.",

        "1993] in the case of English, and Bunruigoihyo [National Language Research Institute 1964] or EDR [Japan Electronic Dictionary Research Institute 1995] in the case of Japanese), based on the intuitively feasible assumption that words located near each other within the structure of a thesaurus have similar meaning.",
        "Therefore, the similarity between two given words is represented by the length of the path between them in the thesaurus structure (Fujii et al.",
        "1996; Kurohashi and Nagao 1994; Li, Szpakowicz, and Matwin 1995; Uramoto 1994b).",
        "We used the similarity function empirically identified by Kurohashi and Nagao in which the relation between the length of the path in the Bunruigoihyo thesaurus and the similarity between words is defined as shown in Table 1.",
        "In this thesaurus, each entry is assigned a seven-digit class code.",

        "Figure 5 shows a fragment of the Bunruigoihyo thesaurus including some of the nouns in both Figure 2 and the input sentence above.",
        "The second approach is based on statistical modeling.",
        "We adopted one typical implementation called the \"vector space model\" (VSM) (Frakes and Baeza-Yates 1992; Leacock, Towell, and Voorhees 1993; Salton and McGill 1983; Schiitze 1992), which has a long history of application in information retrieval (IR) and text categorization (TC) tasks.",
        "In the case of IR/TC, VSM is used to compute the similarity between documents, which is represented by a vector comprising statistical factors of content words in a document.",

        "Predicate argument structures, which consist of complements (case filler nouns and case markers) and verbs, have also been used in the task of noun classification (Hindle 1990).",
        "This can be expressed by Equation (3), where if is the vector for the noun in question, and items t, represent the statistics for predicate argument structures including n.",
        "In regard to t„ we used the notion of TF • IDF (Salton and McGill 1983).",
        "TF (term frequency) gives each context (a case marker/verb pair) importance proportional to the number of times it occurs with a given noun.",
        "The rationale behind IDF (inverse document frequency) is that contexts that rarely occur over collections of nouns are valuable, and that therefore the IDF of a context is inversely proportional to the number of noun types that appear in that context.",
        "This notion is expressed by Equation (4), where f ((n, c, v)) is the frequency of the tuple (n, c, v), nf ((c, v)) is the number of noun types which collocate with verb v in the case c, and N is the number of noun types within the overall co-occurrence data.",

        "In the rule-based method, selectional restrictions are represented by thesaurus classes, and allow only those nouns dominated by the given class in the thesaurus structure as verb complements.",
        "In order to identify appropriate thesaurus classes, we used the association measure proposed by Resnik (1993), which computes the information-theoretic association degree between case fillers and thesaurus classes, for each verb sense (Equation (7)).6",

        "The Naive-Bayes method assumes that each case filler included in a given input is conditionally independent of other case fillers: the system approximates the probability that an input x takes a verb sense s (P(slx)), simply by computing the product of the probability that each verb sense s takes nc as a case filler for case c. The verb sense with maximal probability is then selected as the interpretation (Equation (8)).7",
        "Here, P(ncls) is the probability that a case filler associated with sense s for case c in the training data is nc.",
        "We estimated P(s) based on the distribution of the verb senses in the training data.",

        "This process is repeated until only one verb sense remains.",
        "When more than one verb sense is selected for any given method (or none of them remains, for the rule-based method), the system simply selects the verb sense that appears most frequently in the database.'

        "Through this argument, one can assume that committee-based sampling is better suited to statistics-based systems, while our method is more suitable for example-based systems.",
        "Engelson and Dagan (1996) criticized uncertainty sampling (Lewis and Gale 1994), which they call a \"single model\" approach, as distinct from their \"multiple model\" approach: sufficient statistics may yield an accurate 0.51 probability estimate for a class c in a given example, making it certain that c is the appropriate classification.13 However, the certainty that c is the correct classification is low, since there is a 0.49 chance that c is the wrong class for the example.",
        "A single model can be used to estimate only the second type of uncertainty, which does not correlate directly with the utility of additional training.",
        "(p. 325) We note that this criticism cannot be applied to our sampling method, despite the fact that our method falls into the category of a single model approach.",
        "In our sampling method, given sufficient statistics, the increment of the certainty degree for unsupervised examples, i.e., the training utility of additional supervised examples, becomes small (theoretically, for both example-based and statistics-based systems).",
        "Thus, the utility factor can be considered to correlate directly with additional training, for our method.",
        "5.",
        "Conclusion Corpus-based approaches have recently pointed the way to a promising trend in word sense disambiguation.",
        "However, these approaches tend to require a considerable overhead for supervision in constructing a large-sized database, additionally resulting in a computational overhead to search the database.",
        "To overcome these problems, our method, which is currently applied to an example-based verb sense disambiguation system, selectively samples a smaller-sized subset from a given example set.",
        "This method is expected to be applicable to other example-based systems.",
        "Applicability for other types of systems needs to be further explored.",
        "The process basically iterates through two phases: (normal) word sense disambiguation and a training phase.",
        "During the disambiguation phase, the system is provided with sentences containing a polysemous verb, and searches the database for the",
        "most semantically similar example to the input (nearest neighbor resolution).",
        "Thereafter, the verb is disambiguated by superimposing the sense of the verb appearing in the supervised example.",
        "The similarity between the input and an example, or more precisely the similarity between the case fillers included in them, is computed based on an existing thesaurus.",
        "In the training phase, a sample is then selected from the system outputs and provided with the correct interpretation by a human expert.",
        "Through these two phases, the system iteratively accumulates supervised examples into the database.",
        "The critical issue in this process is to decide which example should be selected as a sample in each iteration.",
        "To resolve this problem, we considered the following properties: (a) an example that neighbors more unsupervised examples is more influential for subsequent training, and therefore more informative, and (b) since our verb sense disambiguation is based on nearest neighbor resolution, an example similar to one already existing in the database is redundant.",
        "Motivated by these properties, we introduced and formalized the concept of training utility as the criterion for example selection.",
        "Our sampling method always gives preference to that example which maximizes training utility.",
        "We reported on the performance of our sampling method by way of experiments in which we compared our method with random sampling, uncertainty sampling (Lewis and Gale 1994), and committee-based sampling (Engelson and Dagan 1996).",
        "The result of the experiments showed that our method reduced both the overhead for supervision and the overhead for searching the database to a larger degree than any of the above three methods, without degrading the performance of verb sense disambiguation.",
        "Through the experiment and discussion, we claim that uncertainty sampling considers property (b) mentioned above, but lacks property (a).",
        "We also claim that committee-based sampling differs from our sampling method in terms of its suitability to statistics-based systems as compared to example-based systems."
