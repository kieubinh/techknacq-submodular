        "The Message Understanding Conferences (MUCs) have been held with the goal of qualitatively evaluating message understanding systems.",
        "While the MUCs held thus far have been quite successful at providing such an evaluation, very little work has been done in analyzing the difficulty of understanding a text in a particular domain; both, independently, as well as in comparison to understanding a text in some other domain.",
        "The organizers of MUC-5 attempted to compare the difficulty of the EJV (English Joint Ventures) task in MUC-5 to the terrorist task of MUC-3 and MUC-4.",
        "The criteria used for comparing these two tasks included the vocabulary size, the average sentence length, the average number of sentences per text, the number of texts, etc.",
        "[Sundheim 1993].",
        "The organizers of MUC-6 did not attempt to compare the difficulty of the MUC-6 task to the previous MUC tasks saying that \"the problem of coming up with a reasonable, objective way of measuring relative task difficulty has not been adequately addressed\" [Sundheim 1995].",
        "In this paper we describe a method of classifying facts (information) into categories or levels; where each level signifies a different degree of syntactic complexity related to a fact.",
        "Based upon this classification mechanism, we also propose a method of evaluating a domain by assigning to it a \"domain number\" based on the levels of a set of standard facts present in the articles of that domain.",
        "In addition, using the proposed classification mechanism, we analyze the complexity of the MUC-7 information extraction task and compare it to the complexities of the information extraction tasks of MUC-4, MUC-5, and MUC-6."

      "text": [
        "Given the definition of the level of a fact, the following observations can be made: • The level of a fact is related to the concept of \"semantic vicinity\" defined by Schubert et al.",
        "[Schubert 1979].",
        "The semantic vicinity of a node in a network consists of the nodes and the arcs reachable from that node by traversing a small number of arcs.",
        "The fundamental assumption used here is that \"the knowledge required to perform an intellectual task generally lies in the semantic vicinity of the concepts involved in the task\" [Schubert 1979].",
        "The level of a fact is equal to the number of arcs that one needs to traverse to reach all the concepts (nodes) which comprise the fact of interest.",
        "• A level-0 fact consists of a single node (i.e. no transitions) in a network.",
        "• A level-k fact is a union of k level-1 facts.",
        "• Conjunctions/disjunctions increase the level of a fact.",
        "• The higher the level of a fact, the harder it is to extract it from a piece of text.",
        "• A fact appearing at one level in a piece of text may appear at some other level in the same piece of text.",
        "• The level of a fact in a piece of text depends on the granularity of the network constructed for that piece of text.",
        "Therefore, the level of a fact with respect to a network built at the word level (i.e. words represent objects and the relationships between the objects) will be greater than the level of a fact with respect to a network built at the phrase level (i.e. noun groups represent objects while verb groups and preposition groups represent the relationships between the objects)."

        "Let S be the network shown in Figure 1.",
        "S has been built at the phrase level.",
        "• The city mentioned, in S, is an example of a level-0 fact because the \"city\" fact consists only of one node \"Medellin.\" • The type of attack, in S, is an example of a level-1 fact.",
        "We define the type of attack in the network to be an attack designator such as \"murder,\" \"bombing,\" or \"assassination\" with one modifier giving the victim, perpetrator, date, location, or other information.",
        "In this case the type of attack fact is composed of the \"the murder\" and the \"two employees\" nodes and their connector.",
        "This makes the type of attack a level-1 fact.",
        "The type of attack could appear as a level-0 fact as in \"the Medellin bombing\" (assuming that the network is built at the phrase level) because in this case both the attack designator (bombing) and the modifier (Medellin) occur in the same node.",
        "The type of attack fact occurs as a level-2 fact in the following sentence (once again assuming that the network is built at the phrase level): \"10 people were killed in the offensive which included several bombings.\" In this case there is no direct connector between the attack designator (several bombings) and its modifier (10 people).",
        "They are connected by the intermediatory \"the offensive\" node; thereby making the type of attack a level-2 fact.",
        "The type of attack can also appear at higher levels.",
        "• In S, the date of the murder of the two employees is an example of a level-2 fact.",
        "This is because the attack designator (the murder) along with its modifier (two employees) account for one level and the arc to \"Nov 15\" accounts for the second level.",
        "The date of the attack, in this case, is not a level-1 fact (because of the two nodes \"the murder\" and \"Nov 15\") because the phrase \"the murder on Nov 15\" does not tell one that an attack actually took place.",
        "The article could have been talking about a seminar on murders that took place on Nov 15 and not about the murder of two employees which took place then.",

        "The exact same argument as the date of the murder of the two employees applies here.",
        "• The complete information, in S, about the victims is an example of a level-2 fact because to know that two employees of Bogota's Daily El Espectador were victims, one has to know that they were murdered.",
        "The attack designator (the murder) with its modifier (two employees) accounts for one level, while the connector between \"two employees\" and \"Bogota's Daily El Espectador\" accounts for the other.",
        "• Similarly, the complete information, in S, about the perpetrators of the murder of the two employees is an example of a level-5 fact.",
        "The breakup of the 5 levels is as follows: the fact that two employees were murdered accounts for one level; the fact that \"The Extraditables\" have claimed responsibility for the murders accounts for two additional levels; and the fact that the Extraditables are the \"armed branch of the Medellin Cartel\" account for the remaining two levels.",
        "Justification of the Methodology The level of a fact quantifies the \"spread\" in the information that makes up the fact.",
        "Therefore, the higher the level of a fact, the greater is the \"spread\" in the information that makes up the fact.",
        "This means that more processing has to be done to identify and link all the individual pieces of information that make up the fact.",
        "In fact, an exploratory study done by Beth Sundheim during MUC-3 showed \"a degradation in correctness of message processing as the information distribution in the message became more complex, that is, as slot fills were drawn from larger portions of the message\" [Hirschman 1992].",
        "An argument can be made that there are other factors, apart from the spread of information, which influence the difficulty of extracting a fact from text.",
        "Some of these factors include the amount of training done on an information extraction system, the quality of training, and the frequency of occurrence of the patterns that a system has been trained on.",
        "While these factors do influence the performance of an information extraction system and they do give some indication as to how difficult it was for a particular system to extract the fact, they do not give a system independent way of determining the complexity of extracting the fact.",
        "In [Hirschman 1992], Lynette Hirschman proposed the following hypothesis: there are facts that are simply harder to extract, across all systems.",
        "Based on our definition of the level of a fact, we analyzed the performances of several information extraction systems on the MUC-4 terrorist reports domain.",
        "Our analysis shows that all the systems consistently did much worse on higher level facts.",
        "In addition to confirming Hirschman's hypothesis, the analysis also shows that higher level facts are indeed harder to extract.",
