        "The LOLITA (Large-scale, Object-based, Linguistic Interactor, Translator, and Analyser) system is designed as a general purpose Natural Language Processing (NLP) system and has been under development at the University of Durham since 1986.",
        "The system is designed to provide NLP capabilities to support many applications in multiple domains.",
        "It attempts to do this by providing a core platform upon which different applications can be built.",
        "This core platform provides two main facilities: analysis, which converts text to a logical representation of its meaning, and generation, which expresses information represented in this logical form as text.",
        "Unlike many of its contemporary NLP systems, the LOLITA system is not designed as a framework that can be tailored to specific domains, but as a system that brings its knowledge of specific domains to bear as and when appropriate.",
        "The Laboratory for Natural Language Engineering (LNLE) at the University of Durham is focussed on developing this core.",
        "Prototype applications have been built using the core facilities; some of them are listed below:",
        "• Information extraction: production of summary and other templates.",
        "• Simple meaning-based translation: currently Italian to English.",
        "• Natural language query: supplying information to LOLITA and then asking questions about this information.",
        "• Dialogue: a model of dialogue has been implemented.",
        "• Chinese language tutoring: a mixed English and Chinese grammar allows detection of students of Chinese using English constructions, and diagnosis of problems.",
        "The MUC competitions have provided an opportunity for the Laboratory for Natural Language Engineering to evaluate the approach used in the LOLITA system on some very specific tasks as well as a chance to strengthen the system’s performance in the domain of newspaper articles.",
        "Given the wider aims of the project, the approach taken was to put minimal effort into the development of the new applications needed for the MUC tasks and maximum effort into the development and improvement of the core system.",
        "The following three sections describe the details of the LOLITA core as used for MUC-7.",
        "The description of the architecture in the following section is substantially similar to that for MUC-6 and readers familiar with this may choose to skip over most of this section.",
        "The section following ‘Architecture’ describes some important modifications that have been carried out on the core since MUC-6.",
        "The majority of the time spent in preparing for MUC-7 was spent enhancing these pieces of core functionality, and developing appropriate rules and knowledge bases for the tasks.",
        "This approach follows from the design that was adopted, i.e., don’t tailor the system to the particular domain, instead develop core functionality and use the available rules/knowledge where appropriate."

        "The most important part of the core is the large knowledge base, which is called the ‘Semantic Network’, SemNet or net, for short.",
        "It is heavily used in most stages of analysis, and the results of analysis are added to it, as a disambiguated logical representation of the input.",
        "The analysis stages are fairly standard, and are arranged in a pipeline.",
        "Each is implemented in a rule-based way.",
        "The system does not currently use any form of stochastic or adaptive techniques in the main system.",
        "The applications can then read the results of the analysis from the SemNet, and generally interrogate the contents of the SemNet.",

        "Some nodes have an associated ‘name’: this is usually a single word which characterises the meaning of the node.",
        "Each link has an arc and a set of targets.",
        "Targets are other nodes, and the arc too is just a node.",
        "Nodes correspond to concepts of entities or events.",
        "Links correspond to relationships between nodes.",
        "Since an arc is also a node, the concepts of the different kinds of relationship possible between nodes can be represented in the same formalism as more concrete concepts.",
        "In this system, the ‘meaning’ of any particular node is given by its connections, its relative position in the net.",
        "Controls indicate basic information about a node, such as its type (e.g., event, entity, relation), its family (e.g., human, inanimate, food, organisation), its lexical type (e.g., noun, preposition, adverb) - as appropriate.",
        "An important control is a node’s rank: this encodes quantification information.",
        "Concepts of general sets have a Universal rank, specifically named objects have a Named Individual rank, and general individuals an Individual rank.",
        "There are several other less important ranks, used for things like encoding script-like information or existential quantification.",
        "Controls could be represented using links, but for efficiency reasons a more compact form is used.",
        "There are approximately 60 different arcs.",
        "The arcs subj_, action_, and object_ are used to represent the basic roles of an event.",
        "Events can have other arcs, such as those indicating temporal information, the status of the information (e.g., known fact, hypothesis, etc), or arcs that indicate the source of the information.",
        "Most arcs also have inverses: e.g., the subject_ arc has the inverse subject_of_, which allows determination of the events in which a particular concept played the subject role.",
        "Figure 2: Example piece of semantic net, for the sentence \"John will retire as chairman\".",

        "Concepts are connected with arcs such as specialisation_ (and its inverse, generalisation_), or instance_ (inverse universal_).",

        "Between the former and the latter is a specialisation_ link, indicating that old chairmen are a subset of chairmen.",
        "Conversely, the latter is linked to the former with a generalisation_ link, representing a superset.",
        "Using the specialisation_ link, hierarchies of concepts are specified.",

        "Other links between concepts include synonym_ and antonym_.",
        "The SemNet is used to hold several kinds of information:",
        "• Concept hierarchies: built with arcs such as generalisation_, concept hierarchies encode knowledge like \"man is _a mammal is_a vertebrate\" etc.",
        "They prevent duplication of information by allowing information to be inherited within the hierarchy.",
        "• Lexical information: actual words are represented in the net, and their properties are stored in the net, as opposed to having a separate lexicon.",
        "The lexical-level nodes are indexed via a simple dictionary: i.e., a mapping from root words to all the senses of that word.",
        "Note that the lexical forms are distinct from the concepts: they are linked by a concept_ arc.",
        "Concepts are linked to lexical forms by a link named after the language of interest.",
        "For example, dog[U] has a link english to the noun form of ‘dog’, and a link italian to the Italian word ‘cane’.",
        "• Prototypical events: these define restrictions on events by providing ‘templates’ for events, e.g., by imposing selectional restrictions on the roles in an event.",
        "\"Human owners own things\" says that only humans can take the subject role in ‘ownership’ events.",
        "• General events: other kinds of information.",
        "For example, the content of a MUC article would come in this class, when analysed.",
        "The bulk of the net (70%) comes from WordNet, a database containing lexical and semantic information about word forms in English [3].",
        "More details about the formalism used in the net can be found in [4].",
        "Referring back to the Original Text Before MUC-6, LOLITA did not have a method of referring back to its input: the previous orientation was to move from language-dependent surface forms to a language-independent logical representation.",
        "Therefore, information about the surface form was discarded.",
        "Since the ability of reference has many uses outside of the MUC tasks, a more general mechanism was designed and added to the core.",
        "It allows fine-grain connection of the analysis results to the sections of the document giving rise to those results.",
        "The system allocates new SemNet nodes to components of the document (words, phrases, sentences, ...), which act as references into the document.",

        "The system was not designed to compete solely in the MUC tasks and in fact the MUC specific code forms a very small part of the whole.",
        "The first MUC evaluation to which LOLITA was applied was MUC-6.",
        "Since then the system's core has been substantially improved and this has lead to a significant improvement in the system's performance for the MUC-7 evaluation.",
        "We are pleased with this improvement and believe that this further validates our method of development.",
        "Although pleased with the results there is certainly room for improvement.",
        "In particular approximately 20% of parses failed in the final evaluation.",
        "This had a substantial impact on the system's performance as all of the task applications rely on a `good' core analysis of which parsing is a key component.",
        "Although some recovery strategies were used, these had a limited effect.",
        "(Little effort was expanded in attempting to reduce the number of parse failures as a new parser is under development.)",
        "Of particular encouragement were the articles for which the system’s underlying analysis was correct.",
        "In such cases the system was able to apply the higher level semantic and pragmatic rules to good effect.",
        "The system also suffered a drop in scores due to the lack of data that was available.",
        "The issues of more robust parsing and data improvement are currently being addressed.",
        "Major projects are underway to re-engineer large parts of the system (the parser being one), and to add a large amount of data in the form of dictionary definitions.",
        "We feel that the MUC series of evaluations has been very useful to the development of the LOLITA system and has allowed us to focus development on some key areas of the system’s core.",
        "Now that MUC has reached an end we shall continue to devote our main development effort to the core issues, in particular those mentioned above, i.e., re-engineering of the system, and addition of dictionary definition data.",
        "This engineering work, carried out by a university spin-off company, 3F Ltd, will allow us to reach our goal of bringing to the market, a number of sophisticated and powerful natural language processing applications based on an underlying core system."
