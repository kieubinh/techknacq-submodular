        "In our planning for MUC-7, we made the decision to concentrate our efforts in two areas: improvements to our infrastructure, both in system architecture and the supporting set of tools, second, maximizing the performance of each information extraction (IE) module, including the introduction of trainable learning-based modules.",
        "We felt that achieving our performance goals in extraction depended on improvements in these areas.",
        "Specifically, our goals when entering MUC-7 were to:",
        "• Increase the accuracy in the Template Element (TE) task and the Template Relation (TR) task sufficiently for operational use, i.e., F-Measures of 85% and 80% respectively, • Increase the accuracy and portability in the Scenario Template (ST) task significantly.",
        "In order to achieve these goals, we took several important steps, which included: • A new IE system developed in the past year • A flexible, modular system architecture • A set of annotation tools and development tools to speed up development, and enable higher accuracy • A high-performance phrase and link tagger • A hybrid, trainable discourse module.",
        "The result was a new high-performance information extraction system, Information Extraction Engine (IE').",
        "It has a flexible and modular architecture and allows optimal speed in the development of all system modules.",
        "In the end, this new system achieved the highest score in each of the three tasks we entered: TE, TR, and ST, as shown in Table 1.",
        "In particular, TE showed an operational performance level, while TR was almost at that level.",
        "ST, by contrast, still presents fundamental problems yet to be solved by the community, but we believe that we have demonstrated an effective strategy for enhancing performance on this task."

        "About a year ago, we set out to develop a new IE system.",
        "One of the first things we worked on was the design of a new system architecture.",
        "The two top requirements were modularity and flexibility.",
        "We wanted a modular architecture so that each module could be developed, tested, and improved independently.",
        "This modular architecture not only speeds up the system development process but also provides the ability to replace an existing module with a new one very easily.",
        "We also wanted a flexible workflow so that development of a module in the latter stage of IE processing does not require processing input through all the previous modules.",
        "This flexible workflow not only cuts development time, but also enables simultaneous development of multiple modules without dependency problems.",
        "We chose SGML-marked up texts as the input and output of each module, which follows the spirit of the TIPSTER architecture.",
        "This enabled us to spell out system interface requirements between two modules much more clearly than previously possible, and reduced miscommunication between modules.",
        "The IE' system is truly modular, and any module can be replaced as long as the new module follows the system interface requirements.",
        "Its workflow is also flexible so that one can start processing at any point.",
        "For example, the person who is testing the discourse module can just input the previous SGML output of the event tagging module without reprocessing any of the previous modules.",
        "Figure 1 shows the new system architecture.",
        "We discuss each module in more detail in the next section."

        "They are further classified into",
        "subtypes: plane, helicopter, space shuttle, rocket, missile, space probe, space station, satellite, and capsule for AIR, car and tank for GROUND, and ship and submarine for WATER.",
        "During the formal test period, we also developed additional patterns to recognize missing names of people, organizations, and places for the launch domain.",
        "PhraseTag In order to achieve operational-level accuracy in TE and TR, we decided that we needed a high-performance noun phrase tagger especially targeted to recognize noun phrases describing people (PNP), organizations (ENP), and artifacts (ANP).",
        "Thus, we developed PhraseTag, which tags these three types of NPs.",
        "It recognizes not only simple NPs but also complex NPs with post modifiers such as relative clauses, reduced relatives, and prepositional phrases.",
        "In a blind test set, it achieves around 80% F-Measure, including the post-modifier attachments.",
        "Additionally, PhraseTag adds local links between phrases with high accuracy.",
        "During the design phase of IE', our analysis of MUC-6 data led us to believe that most links necessary to recognize for the TE and TR tasks are local.",
        "That is, by targeting one's effort at good recognition of such linguistic structures as appositives (e.g., \"Irving Goldstein, director general and chief executive of Intelsat\") and copula sentences (e.g., \"International Technology Underwriters of Bethesda, Maryland, is one insurer in this consortium\"), one can achieve high accuracy in TE and TR.",
        "As these structures are constrained to local contexts, it is much easier to recognize them with high accuracy than structures involving long-distance dependencies.",
        "PhraseTag recognizes four local links, namely employeeof, locationof, product of, and ownerof.",
        "Links are registered in the SGML attributes AFFIL, LOC, MAKER and OWNER, respectively, as shown below.",
        "The ownerof relation is not a part of the TR task, but we used it in the ST task to extract owners of vehicles and payloads.",
        "• employeeof <PNP AFFIL=1>an analyst at <ENTITY ID=1>ING Barings</ENTITY> in Mexico City</PNP> • locationof <ENP LOC=2><PLACE ID=2>Paris</PLACE> insurer</ENP> • product of <ANP MAKER=3>a satellite built by <ENTITY ID=3>Loral Corp. </ENTITY> of New York for Intelsat</ANP> • owner of <ANP OWNER=4>an <ENTITY ID=4>Intelsat</ENTITY> satellite</ANP>",
        "Note that in these examples, the unique identifier (ID) of the ENTITY or PLACE is being written as attribute information on the surrounding noun phrase tags with the appropriate label.",
        "Other types of link, such as the parent/child-organization relationship (e.g., \" Apache Corp., which owns a majority stake in Hudson Energy\"), can be easily added to IE'.",
        "EventTag For the ST task, we decided to take a bottom-up, minimalist approach in MUC-7 rather than using a general-purpose full noun phrase or sentence parser.",
        "The EventTag module starts with a set of syntactically-oriented rule templates.",
        "We show some examples in Table 2 and Table 3.",
        "Then, an IE developer fills in the templates using example phrases and sentences from the training texts.",
        "Scenario-specific NP macros, such as $Vehicle and $Payload, are used to fill Arg's, while scenario-specific verb lists (e.g., LauchTransitiveV, AttackV) and noun lists (e.g., LaunchN, AttackN) are used to fill verbs and nouns in the templates respectively.",
        "Some examples from the launch event are shown in Table 4.",
        "Our plan was to develop and integrate a trainable rule generalization module under TIPSTER 3, and apply it to an initial set of manually-coded rules to significantly boost ST accuracy, especially recall.",
        "Unfortunately, this effort did not start early enough to be completed and integrated with EventTag.",

        "Our goal was to develop a discourse module which can improve specific IE tasks, rather than develop a generic one which may perform well overall but may not necessarily increase the IE performance.",
        "For this, we aimed at developing a high-precision discourse module.",
        "The new Discourse Module employs three co-reference resolution strategies so that it can be configured for its best performance for different IE tasks.",
        "The rule-based strategy uses the CLIPS engine.",
        "We have developed rules to resolve definite NPs (ANP, PNP, ENP) and singular personal pronouns (e.g., \"he,\" \"his,\" \"him\").",

        "This is a reimplemented (in C++) and improved version of SRA's previous machine learning-based co-reference resolution module [2].",
        "The third strategy is a hybrid method where the module first applies the rule-based strategy to narrow down the possible antecedents and then applies the machine learning strategy to order the possible antecedent candidates.",
        "The Discourse Module is also configurable so that one can select a set of anaphora types to resolve for each task.",

        "Name alias resolution for people, organizations, and places is performed in addition to that performed by NetOwl Extractor 3.0 in order to increase recall.",
        "Appositive links are always made by PhraseTag because of its local nature.",
        "For TE, TR, and ST, we resolved name alias and appositive anaphora.",
        "However, we performed definite NP and pronoun resolution only for TR and ST because doing so did not increase the TE score in experimenting with the formal training texts.",
        "We think this is because the discourse module was trained on the dry-run training texts (i.e., aircraft crash domain), and the lack of training on the formal test domain (i.e., spacecraft launch domain) made the resolution of definite NPs and pronouns less accurate.",
        "In fact, the module had increased the TE score on the dry-run test texts.",
        "This indicates the delicate trade off between recall and precision in IE.",
        "For the TE task, the definite NP resolution should theoretically increase the recall of the DESCRIPTOR slot.",
        "However, as most descriptors are actually found locally, either in appositives or copula constructions, it takes a very high-precision discourse module to improve the recall of this slot without hurting precision.",
        "The discourse module with definite NP and pronoun resolution did however increase the ST score by 2 points in the formal test.",
        "The Discourse Module is still relatively new, and it needs to be trained on more texts.",

        "For instance, for a phrase like \"Jeff Bantle, NASA's mission operations directorate representative for the shuttle fight,\" the Discourse Module produces the simplified SGML output in Figure 2.",
        "TempGen takes this output and produces two TE templates (cf., Figure 3 and Figure 4), and one TR template (cf., Figure 5).",
        "The PNP's REF register holds the ID of the person the PNP refers to (i.e., Jeff Bantle).",
        "Thus, the PNP is used for ENTDESCRIPTOR of the TE template for \"Jeff Bantle.\"",
        "The PNP's AFFIL register holds the person's affiliation, and is used for the EMPLOYEEOF TR for the person (i.e., Jeff Bantle) and its employer (i.e., NASA).",
        "For ST, TempGen integrates a Time Module, which interprets and normalizes time expressions according to the MUC-7 time guidelines.",
        "TempGen also performs event merging.",
        "While the Discourse Module takes care of the merging of noun phrases describing payloads and vehicles in the launch domain, the TempGen makes decisions on whether or not to merge two launch events based on the consistency of payloads, vehicles, time, and location participating in the two events.",
