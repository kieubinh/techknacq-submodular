        "We aim to build a single simple framework for tasks in text information extraction, for which, to a certain extent, the required information can be resolved locally.",
        "Our system is statistics-based.",
        "As usual, language model is built from training corpus.",
        "This is the so-called learning process.",
        "Much effort has been spent to absorb domain knowledge in the language model in a systematic and generic way, because the system is designed not for one particular task, but for general local information extraction.",
        "For the information extraction part (tagging), the system consists of the following modules:",
        "• Sentence segmentor and tokenizer.",
        "This module accepts a stream of characters as input, and transforms it into a sequence of sentences and tokens.",
        "The way of tok-enization can vary with different tasks and domains.",
        "For example, most English text is tokenized in the same way, while tokenization in Chinese itself is a research topic.",
        "• Text analyzer.",
        "This module provides analysis necessary for the particular task, be it semantic, syntactic, orthographic, etc.",
        "This same analyzer is also applied in the learning process.",
        "• Hypothesis generator.",
        "The possibilities for each word (token) are determined.",

        "This is essentially implementation of Viterbi algorithm.",

        "TEXT INFORMATION EXTRACTION TO TAGGING First of all, a brief of the modeling of the problem is in order.",
        "Each word in text is assigned a tag, information can then be obtained from tags of all words.",

        "It is observed that different tags for a same task make difference.",
        "We feel that choosing an appropriate tag set is a problem worthy of careful investigation.",

        "The basic idea is, as much as possible relevant and significant information (to the task) contained in the original corpus should retain in back-off corpora where back-off features are stored, so that correct decisions can be made from the statistics generated from the back-off corpora when they can not be done from the statistics from the original training corpus.",
        "The original training corpus is in the form of word/tag, statistics about words and tags including local contextual information can be obtained.",
        "Each word in the corpus is given a back-off feature by the principle that the back-off features of all words should extract the most information from the corpus relevant to the particular task.",
        "The information loss is compensated by gain of generosity.",
        "A back-off corpus in the form of back-off feature/tag is then generated, and statistics can be obtained in the same manner.",
        "The original corpus is processed this way for a certain number of times.",

        "• Training Corpus and Supporting Resources",
        "We have a text corpus of about 500,000 words from People Daily and Xinhua News Agency, all of which were manually checked for both word segmentation and part of speech tagging.",
        "In addition, we have a lexicon of 89,777 words, in which 5351 words are labeled as geographic names, 304 words are people's name and 183 are organization names.",
        "1167 words consist of more than 4 characters.",
        "The longest word (meaning \"Great Britain and North Ireland United Kingdom\") contains 13 characters.",
        "About 50,000 different words appeared in the 500,000 words corpus.",
        "We also have three entity name lists: people name list (67,616 entries), location name list (6,451 entries) and organization name list (6190 entries).",

        "Intuitively, case information of proper names in English writing system pro",
        "vides good indication about locations and boundaries of entity names.",
        "There are successful systems [2] which are built upon this intuition.",
        "Unfortunately, the uniformity of character string in Chinese writing system does not contain such information.",
        "One should look for such analogous indicative characteristics which may be unique in Chinese language.",
        "2.",
        "Word in Chinese is a vague concept and there is no clear definition for it.",
        "There are boundary ambiguities between words in texts for even human being understanding, and inevitably machine processing.",
        "Tokenization, or word segmentation is still a problem in Chinese NLP.",
        "Word boundary ambiguities exist not only between commonly used words which are not in entity names, but also between commonly used words and entity names.",
        "3.",
        "Besides the uniformity appearance of characters, proper names in Chinese can consist of commonly used words.",
        "As a matter of fact, almost all Chinese characters can be a commonly used words themselves, including those in entity names such as people's names, location names, etc.",
        "Therefore, unlike English, the problem of Chinese entity recognition should not be isolated from the problem of tokenization, or word segmentation.",
        "• Building Language Models",
        "One level of back-off features, which are also called word classes, are obtained by the following way: We extend the idea in the new word detection engine of the integrated model of Chinese word segmentor and part of speech tagger [1].",
        "The idea is to extend the scope of an interested word class of new word, the proper names, into named entities by looking into broader range of constituents.",
        "Under this framework, we believe contextual statistics plays important rules in deciding word boundary and predicting the categories of named entities, while local statistics, or information resides within words or entities, can provide evidence for suggesting the appearance of named entity and deciding the validity of these entities.",
        "We need to make full use of both contextual and local statistics to recognize these named entities, thus contextual language model and entity models are created.",
        "The basic process to build the model is like this:",
        "1.",
        "Change the tag set of the part-of-speech tagger by splitting the tag NOUN into more detailed tags related to the particular task, which include the symbolic notions of person, location, organization, date, time, money and percentage.",

        "SGML marked up (for NE task only) Brown corpus and corpus from Wall Street Journal.",
        "In total the size of words is 7.2MB, words with SGML-markup is 9.5MB.",
        "Supporting resources include the location list, country list, corporation reference list and the people's surname list provided by MUC.",
        "Only the single-word entries in these lists are in actual use.",
        "• Observation: Problems and Solutions",
        "Case information, or more generally, orthographic information, gives good evidence of names, as was observed in [2].",
        "Although things get muddled up when one really gets deep into it: e.g. first words of sentences, words which do not have all normal (lower) case form (e.g. \"I\"), or words whose cases are changed due to other reasons such as formatting (e.g. titles), being artifacts, etc.",
        "Nevertheless, this is an very important information for identifying entity names.",
        "Prepositions are also helpful, so are common suffixes and prefixes of the entities, such as Corp., Mr., and so on.",
        "In general, all such useful information should be somehow sorted out.",
        "Word classes tailored for this particular purpose will be ideal.",
        "• Building Language Models",
        "There are two levels of back-off features represented by word classes.",
        "For the following words, the two back-off features are the same: – Hand-crafted special words for NE task.",
        "Each possesses a different word class (represented by word itself).",
        "These special words include \"I\", \"the\", \"past\", \"pound\", \"following\", \"of\", \"in\", \"May\", etc.",

        "Words from a same list possess a same word class.",
        " – Hand-crafted lists of words, which include week words (Monday, Tuesday, ...), month words (January, February, ...), cardinal numbers (one, two, 1 – 31, ...), ordinal numbers (1st, first, 2nd, second, ...), etc.",
        "For the rest of words, the first level features are word classes provided by a machine auto classification of words, while the second level of features include:",

        "From our corpus, these are: Organization 7525 None of the named entities 8493 Location 896 Person 195 Date 8 Money 2 From the above statistics, it's interesting to notice that non-first common words which are initial capitalized have a far more chance to be organization than person (frequencies 7525 vs 195) and location (frequencies 7525 vs 896).",
        "This agrees with general observations.",
        "Also interesting is that such words have a higher chance not to be any of the seven entities.",
