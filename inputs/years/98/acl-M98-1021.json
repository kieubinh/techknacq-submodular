        "The basic building blocks in our MUC system are reusable text handling tools which we have been developing and using for a number of years at the Language Technology Group.",
        "They are modular tools with stream input/output; each tool does a very specific job, but can be combined with other tools in a UNIX pipeline.",
        "Different combinations of the same tools can thus be used in a pipeline for completing different tasks.",
        "Our architecture imposes an additional constraint on the input/output streams: they should have a common syntactic format.",
        "For this common format we chose eXtensible Markup Language (XML).",
        "XML is an official, simplified version of Standard Generalised Markup Language (SGML), simplified to make processing easier [3].",
        "We were involved in the development of the XML standard, building on our expertise in the design of our own Normalised SGML (NSL) and NSL tool LT NSL [10], and our XML tool LT XML [11].",
        "A detailed comparison of this SGML-oriented architecture with more traditional database oriented architectures can be found in [9].",
        "A tool in our architecture is thus a piece of software which uses an API for all its access to XML and SGML data and performs a particular task: exploiting markup which has previously been added by other tools, removing markup, or adding new markup to the stream(s) without destroying the previously added markup.",
        "This approach allows us to remain entirely within the SGML paradigm for corpus markup while allowing us to be very general in the design of our tools, each of which can be used for many purposes.",
        "Furthermore, because we can pipe data through processes, the UNIX operating system itself provides the natural \"glue\" for integrating data-level applications.",
        "The SGML-handling API in our workbench is our LT NSL library [10] which can handle even the most complex document structures (DTDs).",
        "It allows a tool to read, change or add attribute values and character data to SGML elements and to address a particular element in an NSL or XML stream using a query language called ltquery.",
        "The simplest way of configuring a tool is to specify in a query where the tool should apply its processing.",
        "The structure of an SGML text can be seen as a tree, as illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "Elements in such a tree can be addressed in a way similar to UNIX file system pathnames.",
        "For instance, DOC/TEXT/P [0] will give all first paragraphs under TEXT elements which are under DOC.",
        "We can address an element by freely combining partial descriptions, e.g. its location in the tree, its attributes, character data in the element and sub-elements contained in the element.",
        "The queries can also contain wildcards.",
        "For instance, the query .",
        "*/S will give all sentences anywhere in the document, at any level of embedding.",
        "Using the syntax of ltquery we can directly specify which parts of the stream we want to process and which part we want to skip, and we can tailor tool-specific resources for this kind of targeted processing.",
        "For example, we have a programme called fsgmatch which can be used to tokenize input text according to rules specified in certain resource grammars.",
        "It can be called with different resource grammars for different document parts.",
        "Here is an example pipeline using fsgmatch: >> cat text I fsgmatch q \".",
        "*/DATEINWORDS\" date.gr Ifsgmatch q \".",
        "*/PREAMBLE\" preamb.gr Ifsgmatch q \".",
        "*/TEXT/P[0]\" P0.gr In this pipeline, fsgmatch takes the input text, and processes the material that has been marked up as DATE or NWORDS using a tokenisation grammar called date.",
        "gr; then it processes the material in PREAMBLE using the tokenisation grammar preamb .",
        "gr; and then it processes the first paragraph in the TEXT section using the grammar P0.",
        "gr.",
        "This technique allows one to tailor resource grammars very precisely to particular parts of the text.",
        "For example, the reason for applying P0.gr to the first sentence of a news wire is that that sentence often contains unusual information which occurs nowhere else in the article and which is very useful for the muc task: in particular, if the sentence starts with capitalised words followed by &MD; the capitalised words indicate a location, e.g. PASADENA, Calif. &MD; .",
        "We have used our tools in different language engineering tasks, such as information extraction in a medical domain [4], statistical text categorisation [2], collocation extraction for lexicography [1], etc.",
        "The tools include text annotation tools (a tokeniser, a lemmatiser, a tagger, etc.)",
        "as well as tools for gathering statistics and general purpose utilities.",
        "Combinations of these tools provide us with the means to explore corpora and to do fast prototyping of text processing applications.",
        "A detailed description of the tools, their interactions and application can be found in [4] and [5]; information can also be found at our website, http://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/software/.",
        "This tool infrastructure was the starting point for our muc campaign.",
        "LTG TOOLS IN MUC Amongst the tools used in our muc system is an existing LTG tokeniser, called lttok.",
        "Tokenisers take an input stream and divide it up into \"words\" or tokens, according to some agreed definition of what a token is.",
        "This is not just a matter of finding white spaces between characters for example, \"Tony Blair Jr\" could be treated as a single token.",
        "lttok is a tokeniser which looks at the characters in the input stream and bundles them into tokens.",
        "The input to lttok can be SGmL-marked up text, and lttok can be directed to only process characters within certain SGmL elements.",
        "One muc-specific adjustment to the tokenisation rules was to treat a",
        "hyphenated expression as separate units rather than a single unit, since some of the NE expressions required this, e.g. <TIMEX TYPE= \"DATE\">first quart er</TIMEX>-charge.",
        "Here is an example of the use of lttok.",
        "cat text I muc2xml �lttok q \".",
        "*/P\" mark W standard.gr The first call in this pipeline is to muc2xml, a programme which takes the Muc text and maps it into valid xML.",
        "lttok then uses a resource grammar, standard.",
        "gr, to tokenise all the text in the P elements.",
        "It marks the tokens using the sGML element W. The output from this pipeline would look as follows:",
        "... <W>said</W> <W>the</W> <W>director</W> <W>of</W> <W>Russian</W> <W>Bear</W> <W>Ltd.</W> <W>He</W> <W>denied</W> <W>this.</W> <W>But</W> ...",
        "As the example shows, the tokeniser does not attempt to resolve whether a period is a full stop or part of an abbreviation.",
        "Depending on the choice of resource file for lttok, a period will either always be attached to the preceding word (as in this example) or it will always be split off.",
        "This creates an ambiguity where a sentence-final period is also part of an abbreviation, as in the first sentence of our example.",
        "To resolve this ambiguity we use a special program, ltstop, which applies a maximum entropy model pre-trained on a corpus [8].",
        "To use ltstop the user must specify whether periods in the input are attached to or split off from the preceding words; in our case, they were attached to the words, and ltstop is used with the option -split.",
        "With this option, ltstop will split the period from regular words and create an end-of-sentence token <W C=\".",
        "\"> .",
        "</W>; or it will leave the period with the word if it is an abbreviation; or, in the case of sentence-final abbreviations, it will leave the period with the abbreviation and in addition create a virtual full stop <W C=\".",
        "\"></W> Like the other LTG tools ltstop can be targeted at particular sGML elements.",
        "In our example, we want to target it at <W> elements within <P> elements the output of lttok.",
        "It can be used with different maximum entropy models, trained on different types of corpora.",
        "For our example, the full pipeline looks as follows: cat text I muc2xml �lttok q \".",
        "*/P\" mark W standard.gr �ltstop q \".",
        "*/P/W\" split fs_model.me This will generate the following output:",
        "Note how ltstop has \"added\" a final stop to the first sentence, making explicit that the period after \"Ltd\" has two distinct functions.",
        "Another standard LTG tool we used in our Muc system was our part-of-speech tagger LT pos [7].",
        "LT pos is sGML-aware: it reads a stream of sGML elements specified by the query and applies a Hidden Markov Modeling technique with estimates drawn from a trigram maximum entropy model to assign the most likely part of speech tags.",
        "An important feature of the tagger is an advanced module for handling unknown words [6], which proved to be crucial for name spotting.",
        "Some Muc-specific extensions were added at this point in the processing chain: for capitalised words, we added information as to whether the word exists in lowercase in the lexicon (marked as L=l) or whether it exists in lowercase elsewhere in the same document (marked as L=d).",
        "We also developed a model which assigns certain \"semantic\" tags which are particularly useful for Muc processing.",
        "For example, words ending in -yst and -ist (analyst, geologist) as well as words occurring in a special list of words",
        "(spokesman, director) are recognised as professions and marked as such (S=PROF).",
        "Adjectives ending in an or -ese whose root form occurs in a list of locations (American/America, Japanese/Japan) are marked as locative adjectives (S=LOC JJ).",
        "The output of this part of speech tagging could look as follows:",
        "We also used a number of other SGML-tools, such as sgdelmarkup which strips unwanted markup from a document, sgsed and sgtr, SGML-aware versions of the UNIX tools sed and tr.",
        "But the core tool in our MUC system is fsgmatch.",
        "fsgmatch is an SGML transducer.",
        "It takes certain types of SGML elements and wraps them into larger SGML elements.",
        "In addition, it is also possible to use fsgmatch for character-level tokenisation, but in this paper we will only describe its functionality at the SGML level.",
        "fsgmatch can be called with different resource grammars, e.g. one can develop a grammar for recognising names of organisations.",
        "Like the other LTG tools, it is also possible to use fsgmatch in a very targeted way, telling it only to process SGML elements within certain other SGML elements, and to use a specific resource grammar for that purpose.",
        "Piping the previous text through fsgmatch with a resource grammar for company names would result in the following:",
        "The combined functionality of lttok and fsgmatch gives system designers many degrees of freedom.",
        "Suppose you want to map character strings like \"25th\" or \"3rd\" into SGML entities.",
        "You can do this at the character level, using lttok, specifying that strings that match [0-9]+[ -]?",
        "((st) � (nd) � (rd) � (th)) should be wrapped into the SGML structure <W C=ORD>.",
        "Or you can do it at the SGML level: if your tokeniser had marked up numbers like \"25\" as <W C=NUM> then you can write a rule for fsgmatch saying that <W C=NUM> followed by a <W> element whose character data consist of th, nd, rd or st can be wrapped into an <W C=ORD> element.",
        "A transduction rule in fsgmatch can access and utilize any information stated in the element attributes, check sub-elements of an element, do lexicon lookup for character data of an element, etc.",
        "For instance, a transduction rule can say: \"if there are one or more W elements (i.e. words) with attribute C (i.e. part of speech tag) set to NNP (proper noun) followed by a W element with character data \"Ltd.\", then wrap this sequence into an ENAMEX element with attribute TYPE set to ORGANIZATION.",
        "Transduction rules can check left and right contexts, and they can access sub-elements of complex elements; for example, a rule can check whether the last W element under an NG element (i.e. the head noun of a noun group) is of a particular type, and then include the whole noun group into a higher level construction.",
        "Element contents can be looked up in a lexicon.",
        "The lexicon lookup supports multi-word entries and multiple rule matches are always resolved to the longest one.",
        "TIMEX, NUMEX, ENAMEX In our MUC system, TIMEX and NUMEX expressions are handled differently from ENAMEX expressions.",
        "The reason for this is that temporal and numeric expressions in English newspapers have a fairly structured appearance which can be captured by means of grammar rules.",
        "We developed grammars for the temporal and numeric expressions we needed to capture, and also compiled lists of temporal entities and currencies.",
        "The SGML transducer fsgmatch used these resources to wrap the appropriate strings with TIMEX and NUMEX tags.",
        "ENAMEX expressions are more complex, and more context-dependent.",
        "Lists of organisations and place names, and grammars of person names, are useful resources, but need to be handled with care: context will determine whether Arthur Andersen is used as the name of a person or a company, whether Washington is a location or a person, or whether Granada is the name of a company or a location.",
        "At the same time, once Granada has been used as the name of a company, the author of a newspaper article will not suddenly start using it to indicate a location without giving contextual clues that such a shift in denotation has taken place.",
        "Because of this, we strongly believe that identification of supportive context is more important for the identification of names of places, organisations and people than are lists or grammars.",
        "We do use such lists, but alter them dynamically: if anywhere in the text we have found sufficient context to decide that Granada is used as the name of an organisation, it is added to our list of organisations for the further processing of that text.",
        "When we start processing a new text, we don't make any assumptions anymore about whether Granada is an organisation or place, until we find supportive context for one or the other.",
        "To identify ENAMEX elements we combine symbolic transduction of sGML elements with probabilistic partial matching in 5 phases:",
        "1. sure-fire rules 2. partial match 1 3. relaxed rules 4. partial match 2 5. title assignment",
        "We describe each in turn.",
        "The sure-fire transduction rules used in the ENAMEX task are very context oriented and they fire only when a possible candidate expression is surrounded by a suggestive context.",
        "For example, \"Gerard Klauer\" looks like a person name, but in the context \"Gerard Klauer analyst\" it is the name of an organisation (as in \"General Motors analyst\").",
        "Sure-fire rules rely on known corporate designators (Ltd., Inc., etc.",
        "), titles (Mr., Dr., Sen.), and definite contexts such as those in Figure 2.",
        "At this stage our Muc system treats information from the lists as likely rather than definite and always checks if the context is either suggestive or non-contradictive.",
        "For example, a likely company name with a conjunction is left untagged at this stage if the company is not listed in a list of known companies: in a sentence like \"this was good news for China International Trust and Investment Corp\", it is not clear at this stage whether the text deals with one or two companies, and no markup is applied.",
        "Similarly, the system postpones the markup of unknown organizations whose name starts with a sentence initial common word, as in \"Suspended Ceiling Contractors Ltd denied the charge\".",
        "Since the sentence-initial word has a capital letter, it could be an adjective modifying the company \"Ceiling Contractors Ltd\", or it could be part of the company name, \"Suspended Ceiling Contractors Ltd\".",
        "Names of possible locations found in our gazetteer of place names are marked as location only if they appear with a context that is suggestive of location.",
        "\"Washington\", for example, can just as easily be a surname or the name of an organization.",
        "Only in a suggestive context, like \"in the Wahington area\", will it be marked up as location.",
        "After the sure-fire symbolic transduction the system performs a probabilistic partial match of the entities identified in the document.",
        "This is implemented as an interaction between two tools.",
        "The first",
        "words; DD is a digit; PROF is a profession (director, manager, analyst, etc.",
        "); REL is a relative (sister, nephew, etc.",
        "); JJ* is a sequence of zero or more adjectives; LOC is a known location; PERSON-NAME is a valid person name recognized by a name grammar.",
        "tool collects all named entities already identified in the document.",
        "It then generates all possible partial orders of the composing words preserving their order, and marks them if found elsewhere in the text.",
        "For instance, if at the first stage the expression \"Lockheed Martin Production\" was tagged as organization because it occurred in a context suggestive of organisations, then at the partial matching stage all instances of \"Lockheed Martin Production\", \"Lockheed Martin\", \"Lockheed Production\", \"Martin Production\", \"Lockheed\" and \"Martin\" will be marked as possible organizations.",
        "This markup, however, is not definite since some of these words (such as \"Martin\") could refer to a different entity.",
        "This annotated stream goes to a second tool, a pre-trained maximum entropy model.",
        "It takes into account contextual information for named entities, such as their position in the sentence, whether these words exist in lowercase and if they were used in lowercase in the document, etc.",
        "These features are passed to the model as attributes of the partially matched words.",
        "If the model provides a positive answer for a partial match, the match is wrapped into a corresponding ENAMEX element.",
        "Figure 3 gives an example of this.",
        "Once this has been done, the system again applies the symbolic transduction rules.",
        "But this time the rules have much more relaxed contextual constraints and extensively use the information from already existing markup and lexicons.",
        "For instance, the system will mark word sequences which look like person names.",
        "For this it uses a grammar of names: if the first capitalised word occurs in a list of first names and the following word(s) are unknown capitalised words, then this string can be tagged as a PERSON.",
        "Here we are no longer concerned that a person name can refer to a company.",
        "If the name grammar had applied earlier in the process, it might erroneously have tagged \"Philip Morris\" as a PERSON instead of an ORGANISATION.",
        "However, at this point in the chain of ENAMEX processing, that is not a problem",
        "anymore: \"Philip Morris\" will by now already have been identified as an ORGANISATION by the sure-fire rules or during partial matching.",
        "If the author of the article had also been referring to the person \"Philip Morris\", s�he would have used explicit context to make this clear, and our MUc system would have detected this.",
        "If there had been no supportive context so far for \"Philip Morris\" as organisation or person, then the name grammar at this stage will tag it as a likely person, and check if there is supportive context for that hypothesis.",
        "At this stage the system will also attempt to resolve the \"and\" conjunction problem noted above with \"this was good news for China International Trust and Investment Corp\".",
        "The system checks if possible parts of the conjunctions were used in the text on their own and thus are names of different organizations; if not, the system has no reason to assume that more than one company is being talked about.",
        "In a similar vein, the system resolves the attachment of sentence initial capitalised modifiers, the problem alluded to above with the \"Suspended Ceiling Contractors Ltd\" example: if the modifier was seen with the organization name elsewhere in the text, with a capital letter and not at the start of a sentence, then the system has good evidence that the modifier is part of the company name; if the modifier does not occur anywhere else in the text with the company name, it is assumed not to be part of it.",
        "At this stage known organizations and locations from the lists available to the system are marked in the text, again without checking the context in which they occur.",
        "ENAMEX: Partial Match 2 At this point, the system has exhausted its resources (name grammar, list of locations, etc�.",
        "The system then performs another partial match to annotate names like \"White\" when \"James White\" had already been recognised as a person, and to annotate company names like \"Hughes\" when \"Hughes Communications Ltd.\" had already been identified as an organisation.",
        "As in Partial Match 1, this process of partial matching is again followed by a probabilistic assignment supported by the maximum entropy model."

        "The tools do not convert from sGML into an internal format and back, but operate at the sGML level.",
        "Our system does not rely heavily on lists or gazetteers but instead treats information from such lists as \"likely\" and concentrates on finding contexts in which such likely expressions are definite.",
        "In fact, the first phase of the ENAMEx analysis uses virtually no lists but still achieves substantial recall.",
        "The system is document centred.",
        "This means that at each stage the system makes decisions according to a confidence level that is specific to that processing stage, and drawing on information from other parts of the document.",
        "The system is truly hybrid, applying symbolic rules and statistical partial matching techniques in an interleaved fashion.",
        "Unsurprisingly the major problem for the system were single capitalised words, mentioned just once or twice in the text and without suggestive contexts.",
        "In such a case the system could not apply contextual assignment, assignment by analogy or lexical lookup.",
        "At the time we participated in the Muc competition, our system was not particularly fast it operated at about 8 words per second, taking around 3 hours to process the 100 articles.",
        "This has now considerably improved."
