        "Recall error then is the sum of m's divided by the number of links in the key.",
        "Precision error is computed by reversing the roles of the answer key and the response.",
        "The full details of the algorithm are discussed next.",
        "In the description of the model theoretic algorithm, the terms \"key,\" and \"response\" are defined in the following way: key refers to the manually annotated coreference chains (the truth).",

        "An equivalence set is the transitive closure of a coreference chain.",
        "The algorithm computes recall in the following way.",
        "First, let S be an equivalence set generated by the key, and let Rl ... R,,,, be equivalence classes generated by the response.",
        "Then we define the following functions over S:",
        "• p(S) is a partition of S relative to the response.",
        "Each subset of S in the partition is formed by intersecting S and those response sets RZ that overlap S. Note that the equivalence classes defined by the response may include implicit singleton sets - these correspond to elements that are mentioned in the key but not in the response.",

        "• m(S) is the number of \"missing\" links in the response relative to the key set S. As noted above, this is the number of links necessary to fully reunite any components of the p(S) partition.",

        "The algorithm does not give any credit for separating out singletons (entities that occur in chains consisting only of one element, the entity itself) from other chains which have been identified.",
        "This follows from the convention in coreference annotation of not identifying those entities that are markable as possibly coreferent with other entities in the text.",
        "Rather, entities are only marked as being coreferent",
        "if they actually are coreferent with other entities in the text.",
        "This potential shortcoming could be easily enough overcome with different annotation conventions and with minor changes to the algorithm, but the decision to annotate singletons is a bit of a philosophical issue.",
        "On the one hand singletons do form equivalence classes, and those equivalence classes are significant in that they are NOT coreferent with another phrase in the text and they may play an important role in other equivalence classes out side the immediate text (as in cross document coreference).",
        "On the other hand, if coreference is viewed as being about the relations between entities, then perhaps is makes little sense to annotate and score singletons.",
        "2.",
        "All errors are considered to be equal.",
        "The MUC scoring algorithm penalizes the precision numbers equally for all types of errors.",
        "It is our position that, for certain tasks, some coreference errors do more damage than others.",
        "Consider the following examples: suppose the truth contains two large coreference chains and one small one (Figure 1), and suppose Figures 2 and 4 show two different responses.",
        "We will explore two different precision errors.",
        "The first error will connect one of the large coreference chains with the small one (Figure 2).",
        "The second error occurs when the two large coreference chains are related by the errant coreferent link (Figure 4).",
        "It is our position that the second error is more damaging because, compared to the first error, the second error makes more entities coreferent that should not be.",
        "This distinction is not reflected in the [Vilain, 95] scorer which scores both responses as having a precision score of 90% (Figure 6).",
        "Revisions to the Algorithm: Our B-CUBED Algorithm Our B-CUBED algorithm was designed to overcome the two shortcomings of the Vilain et.",
        "al algorithm.",
        "Instead of looking at the links produced by a system, our algorithm looks at the presence/ absence of entities relative to each of the other entities in the equivalence classes produced.",

        "The final precision and recall numbers are computed by the following two formulae:",
        "where N is the number of entities in the document, and wi is the weight assigned to entity i in the document.",
        "It should be noted that the B-CUBED algorithm implicitly overcomes the first shortcoming of the Vilain et.",
        "al algorithm by calculating the precision and recall numbers for each entity in the document (irrespective of whether an entity is part of a coreference chain).",
        "Different weighting schemes produce different versions of the algorithm.",
        "The choice of the weighting scheme is determined by the task for which the algorithm is going to be used.",
        "When coreference (or cross-document coreference) is used for an information extraction task, where information about every entity in an equivalence class is important, the weighting scheme assigns equal weights for every entity i.",
        "For example, the weight assigned to each entity in Figure 1 is 1/12.",
        "As shown in Figure 6, the precision scores for responses in Figures 2 and 4 are 16/21 (76%) and 7/12 (58%) respectively, using equal weights for all entities.",
        "Recall for both responses is 100%.",
        "It should be noted that the algorithm penalizes the precision numbers more for the error made in Figure 4 than the one made in Figure 2.",
        "As evident from the two examples, this version of the B-CUBED algorithm (using equal weights for each entity) is a precision oriented algorithm i.e. it is sensitive to precision errors.",
        "But, for an information retrieval (IR) task, or a web search task, where an user is presented with classes of documents that pertain to the same entity, the weighting scheme assigns equal weights to each equivalence class.",
        "The weight for each entity within an equivalence class is computed by dividing the weight of the equivalence class by the number of entities in that class.",
        "Recall is calculated by assigning equal weights to each equivalence class in the truth while precision is calculated by assigning equal weights to each equivalence class in the response.",
        "For example, in Figure 2, the weighting scheme assigns a weight of 1/10 to each entity in the first equivalence class, and a weight of 1/14 to each entity in the second equivalence class, when calculating precision.",
        "Using this weighting scheme, the precision scores for responses in Figures 2 and 4 are 39/49 (79.6%) and 3/4 (75%) respectively.",
        "Recall for both responses is 100%.",
        "Comparing these numbers to the ones obtained by using the version of the algorithm which assigns equal weights to each entity, one can see that the current version is much less sensitive to precision errors.",
