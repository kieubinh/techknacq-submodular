        "Brief Definition of Information Extraction Task",
        "Information extraction in the sense of the Message Understanding Conferences has been traditionally defined as the extraction of information from a text in the form of text strings and processed text strings which are placed into slots labeled to indicate the kind of information that can fill them.",
        "So, for example, a slot labeled NAME would contain a name string taken directly out of the text or modified in some well-defined way, such as by deleting all but the person's surname.",
        "Another example could be a slot called WEAPON which requires as a fill one of a set of designated classes of weapons based on some categorization of the weapons that has meaning in the events of import such as GUN or BOMB in a terrorist event.",
        "The input to information extraction is a set of texts, usually unclassified newswire articles, and the output is a set of filled slots.",
        "The set of filled slots may represent an entity with its attributes, a relationship between two or more entities, or an event with various entities playing roles and/or being in certain relationships.",
        "Entities with their attributes are extracted in the Template Element task; relationships between two or more entities are extracted in the Template Relation task; and events with various entities playing roles and/or being in certain relationships are extracted in the Scenario Template task."

      "text": [
        "The overall goal of the Information Extraction (IE) task is to provide an evaluation of IE technology with minimal non-NLP requirements and minimal domain portability overhead.",
        "To enforce the requirements for low portability overhead, the participant preparation for the evaluation will consist of two stages.",
        "The first stage will be domain independent, and will begin well in advance of the evaluation; the second stage of participant preparation, which is domain-dependent, will start just one month prior to the evaluation."

      "heading": "2.1 Domain-Independent Information Extraction",
      "text": [
        "No set of texts can literally be said to be domain-independent, but an attempt can be made to define information that represents a generic \"domain\" or can be said to belong to most domains of interest.",
        "The extraction of entities and their attributes as well as facts about those entities constitutes the most domain-independent kind of information extraction.",
        "Template Elements such as organizations and persons with some associated attributes can be extracted from texts without knowing what role or relationships those elements may enter into.",
        "Template Relations such as organizations and their locations or persons and the organizations they are employed by can be extracted to fill a database that could support decision-making at a later time."

    {
      "heading": "2.2 Domain-Dependent Information Extraction",
      "text": [
        "A set of texts containing a preassigned percentage of articles relevant to a domain, i.e.,articles containing well-defined events, can be used for domain-dependent information extraction.",
        "The same set of texts can also be processed without regard to the domain for Template Elements and/or Relations.",
        "However, the Scenario Template task requires more focused information extraction from only relevant texts about events and only those entities which participate in the events in defined ways.",
        "Scenario Template evaluation is the traditional MUC template-level task, where the participants are evaluated on whether the templates contain exactly the instantiated objects and filled slots as specified in the scenario definition and reflected in the answer key with penalties given for spurious, missing, and wrong objects and slot fills.",
        "The scenario definition is revealed only one month prior to the day that test responses must be submitted to force limitations on the amount of domain-specific work required of the developers for porting from domain to domain or moving from generic information extraction to domain-specific information extraction."

        "One difficulty with the Scenario Template task is that it is subject to the \"linchpin\" or \"keystone\" effect, where a decision whether to instantiate an object carries a high penalty if wrong (points off for each slot fill in that object).",
        "We can reduce the linchpin effect by having one or more tasks which do not involve scenario-dependent relevance criteria.",
        "Furthermore, this IE task is viewed as an interesting exercise in its own right, as the next step up from the aggregation of the Named Entity task and the Coreference task.",
        "For example, for the Template Element evaluation, an ENTITY object of the ORGANIZATION type and all possible slots defined for that object type are to be instantiated for each organization mentioned in a given text, even if a given Scenario Template task confines itself to organizations which are airplane manufacturers.",
        "For the Scenario Template evaluation, only those Template Element object and slot types that appear in the scenario task definition will be tested.",
        "ARTIFACT objects in the Template Element task are handled somewhat differently from ORGANIZATION and PERSON objects because there are so many objects mentioned in texts that can be considered artifacts.",

        "In the MUC-7 Template Relation task, these relations or \"facts\" can be broken out on their own level and be separate from the scenario.",
        "Furthermore, this task is viewed as an interesting exercise in its own right, as the next step up from the Template Element task and the beginning of a compilation of scenario-independent facts about Template Elements.",
