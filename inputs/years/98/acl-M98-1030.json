        "All tasks involve reading in a set of documents from one computer file.",
        "The documents contain text from periodicals or some other source of natural language, so the input file is called a texts file.",
        "The texts file is analyzed, and a set of objects is produced and printed to a single output file.",
        "For each document in the input file there are, in general, several objects produced.",
        "The format of the objects varies with the task, although the scorer uses the same internal representation of objects for all tasks.",
        "When the scorer is run, it reads in an output file produced by a human, containing keys, and an output file produced by a software system, containing responses.",
        "The scorer aligns objects in the key file with objects in the response file.",
        "It then calculates various scores based on how well the responses agree with the keys.",
        "At present, there are two ways that the scores are calculated.",
        "In four of the five tasks, scores are based on counting how many fills (which are substructures of the objects, and are described below) agree for each aligned object.",
        "In the coreference task, the objects in the key file are grouped into equivalence classes, as are the objects in the response file.",
        "Scores for coreference are based on how well the equivalence classes agree."

        "For scoring, Single fills are treated as \"atoms.\"",
        "When objects are aligned, the objects' single fills are also aligned, and it is the results of the single fill alignments which are tallied up to get the final score (in all tasks but Coreference).",
        "There are three types of single fills: Set fills Strings of characters which must match exactly (except for character case) to be considered \"correct\".",
        "String fills Strings of characters which must match after some massaging (e.g., removing articles or repeated space or tab characters) to be considered \"correct\".",

        "A top-level object consists of some identification information and a set of slots.",
